the issue of this pl with off the lines violation had almost destroyed orgs quickie grades entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases therefore actions which neglect or violate this policy letter are high crimes resulting in comm evs on administrators and executives it is not entirely tech matter as its neglect destroys orgs and caused 2 year slump it is the business of every staff member to enforce it all levels keeping scientology working hco sec or communicator hat check on all personnel and new personnel as taken on we have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technology the only thing now is getting the technology applied if you cant get the technology applied then you cant deliver whats promised its as simple as that if you can get the technology applied you can deliver whats promised the only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is results trouble spots occur only where there are results attacks from governments or monopolies occur only where there are results or bad results therefore the road before scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if the technology is applied so it is the task of the assn or org sec the hco sec the case supervisor the d of p the d of t and all staff members to get the correct technology applied getting the correct technology applied consists of one having the correct technology two knowing the technology three knowing it is correctfour teaching correctly the correct technology five applying the technology six seeing that the technology is correctly applied seven hammering out of existence incorrect technology eight knocking out incorrect applications nine closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology ten closing the door on incorrect application one above has been done two has been achieved by many three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in proper manner and observing that it works that way four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world five is consistently accomplished daily six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently seven is done by few but is weak point eight is not worked on hard enough nine is impeded by the reasonable attitude of the not quite bright ten is seldom done with enough ferocity seven eight nine and ten are the only places scientology can bog down in any area the reasons for this are not hard to find weak certainty that it works in three above can lead to weakness in seven eight nine and ten b further the nottoobright have bad point on the button selfimportance c the lower the iq the more the individual is shut off from the fruits of observation d the service facs of people make them defend themselves against anything they confront good or bad and seek to make it wrong the bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate the bad thus we as scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to seven eight nine and ten in all the years i have been engaged in research i have kept my comm lines wide open for research data i once had the idea that group could evolve truth third of century has thoroughly disabused of that idea willing as i was to accept suggestions and data only handful of suggestions less than twenty had long run value and none were major or basic and when i did accept major or basic suggestions and used them we went astray and i repented and eventually had to eat crow on the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writings which if accepted and acted upon would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs so i know what group of people will do and how insane they will go in accepting unworkable technology by actual record the percentages areabout twenty to 100000 that group of human beings will dream up bad technology to destroy good technology as we could have gotten along without suggestions then we had better steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it this point will of course be attacked as unpopular egotistical and undemocratic it very well may be but it is also survival point and i dont see that popular measures self abnegation and democracy have done anything for man but push him further into the mud currently popularity endorse degraded novels self abnegation has filled the south east asian jungles with stone idols and corpses and democracy has given us inflation and income tax our technology has not been discovered by group true if the group had supported in many ways i could not have discovered it either but it remains that in its formative stages it was not discovered by group then group efforts one can safely assume will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future i can only say this now that it is done there remains of course group tabulation or coordination of what has been done which will be valuableonly so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applications the contributions that were worth while in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship of defence of organization of dissemination of application of advices on results and of finance these were great contributions and were and are appreciated many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are discovery contribution was not however part of the broad picture we will not speculate here on why this was so or how i came to rise above the bank we are dealing only in facts and the above is factthe group left to its own devices would not have evolved scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called new ideas would have wiped it out supporting this is the fact that man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolvepsychiatry psychology surgery shock treatment whips duress punishment etc ad infinitum so realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense and refuse to sink back into it again see that seven eight nine and ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped relax them get reasonable about it and we will perish so far while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions i have not failed on seven eight nine and ten in areas i could supervise closely but its not good enough for just myself and few others to work at this whenever this control as per seven eight nine and ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed witness elizabeth ny wichita the early organizations and groups they crashed only because i longer did seven eight nine and ten then when they were all messed up you saw the obvious reasons for failure but ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons the common denominator of group is the reactive bank thetans without banks have different responses they only have their banks in common they agree then only on bank principles person to person the bank is identical so constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in human group an individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from humanoid group to get anything decent done the bankagreement has been what has made earth helland if you were looking for hell and found earth it would certainly serve war famine agony and disease has been the lot of man right now the great governments of earth have developed the means of frying every man woman and child on the planet that is bank that is the result of collective thought agreement the decent pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow gotten by the group idea for that matter look how we ourselves are attacked by public opinion media yet there is more ethical group on this planet than ourselvesthus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then as group of freed beings achieve freedom and reason it is only the aberrated group the mob that is destructive when you dont do seven eight nine and ten actively you are working for the bank dominated mob for it will surely surely introduce incorrect technology and swear by it b apply technology as incorrectly as possible c open the door to any destructive idea and d encourage incorrect application its the bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing its the bank that says we must fail so just dont play that tune do seven eight nine and ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns heres an actual example in which senior executive had to interfere because of pc spin case supervisor told instructor to have auditor b run process x on preclear c auditor b afterwards told instructor that it didnt work instructor was weak on three above and didnt really believe in seven eight nine and ten so instructor told the case supervisor process x didnt work on preclear c now this strikes directly at each of one to six above in preclear c auditor b instructor and the case supervisor it opens the door to the introduction of new technology and to failure what happened here instructor didnt jump down auditor bs throat thats all that happened this is what he should have done grabbed the auditors report and looked it over when higher executive on this case did so she found what the case supervisor and the rest missed that process x increased preclear cs ta to 25 ta divisions for the session but that near session end auditor b qed and aed with cognition and abandoned process x while it still gave high ta and went off running one of auditor bs own manufacture which nearly spun preclear c auditor bs iq on examination turned out to be about 75 instructor was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone even lunatic the case supervisor was found to be too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases all right theres an all too typical example the instructor should have done seven eight nine and ten this would have begun this way auditor b that process x didnt work instructor what exactly did you do wrong instant attack wheres your auditors report for the session good look here you were getting lot of ta when you stopped process x what did you do then the pc wouldnt have come close to spin and all four of these would have retained certainty in year i had four instances in one small group where the correct process recommended was reported not to have worked but on review found that each one had increased the ta b had been abandoned and c had been falsely reported as unworkable also despite this abuse in each of these four cases the recommended correct process cracked the case yet they were reported as not having worked similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed then the resulting error uncorrected in the auditor is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter so seven eight nine and ten are even more important in course than in supervision of cases heres an example rave recommendation is given graduating student because he gets more ta on pcs than any other student on the course figures of 435 ta divisions session are reported of course his model session is poor but its just knack he has is also included in the recommendation careful review is undertake because nobody at levels to iv is going to get that much ta on pcs it is found that this student was never taught to read an emeter dial and instructor observed his handling of meter and it was not discovered that he overcompensated nervously swinging the ta 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed togo to place the needle at set so everyone was about to throw away standard processes and model session because this one student got such remarkable ta they only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student the pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain impeded by rough model session and misworded processes thus what was making the pcs win actual scientology was hidden under lot of departures and errors i recall one student who was squirreling on an academy course and running lot of offbeat whole track on other students after course hours the academy students were in state of electrification on all these new experiences and werent quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on seven eight nine and ten so they stuck subsequently this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse hard tough instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of girl but students had right to do whatever they pleased squirreling going off into weird practices or altering scientology only comes about from noncomprehension usually the noncomprehension is not of scientology but some earlier contact with an offbeat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood when people cant get results from what they think is standard practice they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree the most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight scientology under instruction in scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles and the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble and worse it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions hence debacle resulted in two places directly traced to failures of instruction earlier so proper instruction is vital the d of t and his instructors and all scientology instructors must be merciless in getting four seven eight nine and ten into effective action that one student dumb and impossible though he may seem and of use to anyone may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure scientology got home to him with what we know now there is student we enrol who cannot be properly trained as an instructor one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the sluggards inside out personally system will do it only you or with our sleeve rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student never on whole class only hes slow something is awful wrong take fast action to correct it dont wait until next week by then hes got other messes stuck to him if you cant graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining graduate them in such state of shock theyll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling then experience will gradually bring about three in them and theyll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing when somebody enrols consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the universe never permit an openminded approach if theyre going to quit let then quit fast if they enroled theyre aboard and if theyre aboard theyre here on the same terms as the rest of us win or die in the attempt never let them be halfminded about being scientologists the finest organizations in history have been tough dedicated organizations not one nambypamby bunch of pantywaist dilettantes have ever made anything its tough universe the social veneer makes it seem mild but only the tigers surviveand even they have hard time well survive because we are tough and are dedicated when we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger when we instruct halfmindedly and are afraid to offend scared to enforce we dont make students into good scientologists and that lets everybody down when mrs pattycake comes to us to be taught turn that wandering doubt in he eye into fixed dedicated glare and shell win and well all win humour her and we all die little the proper instruction attitude is youre here so youre scientologist now were going to make you into an expert auditor matter what happens wed rather have you dead that incapablefitting that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear but we wont have to bear it forever the bigger we get the more economics and time we will have to do our job and the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from one to ten keep those in mind and well be able to grow fast and as we grow our shackles will be less and less failing to keep one to ten will make us grow less so the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the high priests its our possible failure to retain and practise our technology an instructor or supervisor or executive must challenge with ferocity instances of unworkability they must uncover what did happen what was run and what was done or not done if you have one and two you can only acquire three for all by making sure of all the rest were not playing some minor game in scientology it isnt cute or something to do for lack of something better the whole agonized future of this planet every man woman and child on it and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depends on what you do here and now with and in scientology this is deadly serious activity and if we miss getting out of the trap now we may never again have another chance remember this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of the past dont muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do seven eight nine and ten do them and well win l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1965 1970 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office

deleting processes from grades the pressure exerted to speed up student completions and auditing completions was mistakenly answered by just not delivering the correct way to speed up students progress is by using 2 way comm and applying the study materials to students the best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going on to the next and repairing them when they do not the puzzle of the decline of the entire scientology network in the late 60s is entirely answered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materials

have had word squirreling it means altering scientology offbeat practices it is bad thing i have found way to explain why scientology is workable system this does not mean it is the best possible system or perfect system remember and use that definition scientology is workable system in fifty thousand years of history on this planet alone man never evolved workable system it is doubtful if in foreseeable history he will ever evolve another man is caught in huge and complex labyrinth to get out of it requires that he follow the closely taped path of scientology scientology will take him out of the labyrinth but only if he follows the exact markings in the tunnels it has taken third of century in this lifetime to tape this route out it has been proven that efforts by man to find different routes came to nothing it is also clear fact that the route called scientology does lead out of the labyrinth therefore it is workable system route that can be travelled what would you think of guide who because his party said it was dark and the road rough and who said another tunnel looked better abandoned the route he knew would lead out and led his party to lost nowhere in the dark youd think he was pretty wishywashy guide what would you think of supervisor who let student depart from procedure the supervisor knew worked youd think he was pretty wishywashy supervisor what would happen in labyrinth if the guide let some girl stop in pretty canyon and left her there forever to contemplate the rocks youd think he was pretty heartless guide youd expect him to say at least miss those rocks may be pretty but the road out doesnt go that way all right how about an auditor who abandons the procedure which will make his preclear eventually clear just because the preclear had cognition people have following the route mixed up with the right to have their own ideas anyone is certainly entitled to have opinions and ideas and cognitionsso long as these do not bar the route out for self and others scientology is workable system it white tapes the road out of the labyrinth if there were white tapes marking the right tunnels man would just go on wandering around and around the way he has for eons darting off on wrong roads going in circles ending up in the sticky dark alonescientology exactly and correctly followed takes the person up and out of the mess so when you see somebody having ball getting everyone to take peyote because it restimulates prenatals know he is pulling people off the route realize he is squirreling he isnt following the route scientology is new thing it is road out there has not been one not all the salesmanship in the world can make bad route proper route and an awful lot of bad routes are being sold their end product is further slavery more darkness more misery scientology is the only workable system man has it has already taken people toward higher iq better lives and all that other system has so realize that it has competitor scientology is workable system it has the route taped the search is done now the route only needs to be walked so put the feet of students and preclears on that route dont let them off of it matter how fascinating the side roads seem to them and move them on up and out squirreling is today destructive of workable system dont let your party down by whatever means keep them on the route and theyll be free if you dont they wont l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedpab 43 professional auditors bulletin from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 163 holland park avenue london w11 _____________________________________________________________________ 7 january 1955 plotting the preclear on the tone scale the most important point in entering case from the viewpoint of the auditor is establishing the position of the preclear on the chart of human evaluation as given and fully described in the publication science of survival today this is relatively simple task providing the auditor knows the simple processes which are the basic processes of both dianetics and scientology as given in the last pab these processes are twoway communication elementary straightwire opening procedure 8c opening procedure by duplication remedying havingness and spotting spots in space the establishing characteristic of the preclears position on the tone scale is all contained under the heading of communication lag today we do not use emeters today we do not use oldtime dianometry today we have positive and precise method of positioning the preclear communication lag is the length of time intervening between the asking of the question by the auditor and the reply to that specific question by the preclear the question must be precise the reply must be precisely to that question it does not matter what intervenes in the time between the asking of the question and the receipt of the answer incidentally from my experience in training in phoenix this is very hard point for an auditor to grasp thus i am stressing it for you in these pabs it does not matter what intervenes the preclear may outflow jabber discuss pause hedge disperse dither or be silent matter what he does or how he does it between the asking of the question and the giving of the answer the time is the communication lag the near answer guessing answer an undecided answer are alike imprecise answers and are not adequate responses to the question on receipt of such questionable answers the auditor must ask the question again that he asks the question again does not reduce the communication lag he is still operating from the moment he asked the question the first time and if he has to ask the question twenty or thirty times more in the next hour in order to get precise and adequate answer from the preclear the length of time of the lag would be from the asking of the first question to the final receipt of the answer near answers to the question are inadequate and are themselves simply part of the communication lag example auditor how many chairs are there in this room preclear now let see i dont knowwere sitting down anyway this is not an answer to the question the answer to the question is the exact number of chairs in the room there are of course certain questions which are fadeaway questions to which because of the characteristics of the mind there is possible answer one of these is give an unknown time as soon as the preclear starts to answer such question he of coursehas asised certain amount of unknownness and will know the time the answer to fade away question is also measurable however it could be said arbitrarily to be answered when the preclear has asised enough unknownness to give known time there are relatively few of these questions the length of time necessary for an individual to ask and answer questions is actually complete twoway communication lag but here in testing lag we are interested simply in the question the auditor asks and the length of time it takes preclear to answer it now here comes specialized knowledge on communication lag preclear may have very short lag on social questions he may be able to answer immediately and expertly what his name is how old he is and many other things these questions are actually being answered by social machinery or habitual practice he has actually lag apparently but remember the auditor in this case is not asking the preclear he is asking social response machine for the socially acceptable answer as an example of this as mentioned in dianetics evolution of science i once had preclear who would answer on any query as to health that she was fine even though she was lying in the agony of migraine headache she had machine set up to respond one was not in communication with the preclear and indeed one seldom ever was for she was psychotic thus in establishing communication lag it is necessary for the auditor to ask nonsocial questions the question what is your name may be replied to very readily however this is social question and thus one would have to ask the question such as how many doors in this room or how many feet do women ordinarily have in order to pose question which requires intelligent differentiation on the part of the preclear the length of time it takes for him to resolve this question as problem and reply to it is the lag time this is an actual measure of the distance and the number of vias on the communication lag line of the preclear the phenomenon of communication lag is intensely useful it tells you immediately how far the individual is out of present time it tells us also the ability of the preclear to give up problem he may be so hungry for problems and every question is problem which requires an answer that he simply swallows the problem and refuses to solve it by giving an answer to the question it also tells us how protective defensive the preclear is in regard to life and the environment an oldtime auditor could very probably tell by his tone of voice as he spoke where he was on the emotional tone scale as given in science of survival an auditor not so schooled need only glance at the persons communication lag in order to know where he stood on the tone scale there is an additional phenomenon brother to communication lag known as process lag this is the length of time it requires for the preclear to obtain result from process how many chairs are there in this room process and then let us ask the preclear this question how many chairs are there in this room and discover how many times he has to be asked the question and has to be made to answer the question precisely in order to do so without protest and with instant response the length of time it would take him to reduce first his lack of knowledge as to the number of chairs in the room and then his unwillingness to be asked the question many many times over and over which is his unwillingness to duplicate would on an overall count be his process lag the process lag is the length of time it takes to reduce all communication lag from type of question or action in auditing and process lag then is peculiar to auditing unless of course you wish to examine the whole subject of communication lags at which moment you would discover all manner of interesting phenomena not particularly necessary to the auditor he would discover for instance that the length of time it takes for an individual to learn and adequately use arithmetic could be classed as process lag he could discover also thatthere is communication lag going on in nearly all conversations one asks the social question how are you and the person responds from his machinery fine and then as though totally disrelated onehalfhour later suddenly says to his companion who asked the first question you know i feel terrible today there is for instance the physiological communication lag how long does it take for mans body to change the consideration that he is tired to the consideration that he is refreshed how long does it take certain drug to work but it is not our purpose to go into the broad study of communication lags as interesting as that field may be for we do not need to know any more than communication lag and process lag in order to do good job of auditing and to position the preclear accurately on the tone scale actually it is the process lag which situates the preclear on the tone scale for the auditor let us say that very long process lag could be classified as unable to do until processed then we would discover that twoway communication as the basic process would be an inability if not done with ease by the preclear if it is done very arduously by the preclear it would take the preclear on the lower part of the tone scale similarly if the preclear has enormous lag on straightwire questions it would peg him as on another slightly higher part of the tone scale and so forth this is extremely useful information for an auditor for it tells him that anybody below 20 on the tone scale is there to be audited into death he is not there to be made to survive and thus case poses considerable amount of trouble for an auditor when it is below 20 on the tone scale when in other words it does not discover in twoway communication and in elementary straightwire easy processing just to make sure that preclear fools an auditor with social responses and just to make sure that every preclear gets well we process today in this fashion first we discover and execute twoway communication with the preclear even though we have to do it in the field of mimicry then when twoway communication is very adequately established between the auditor and the preclear we continue with elementary straightwire the commands of which are something you wouldnt mind remembering something you wouldnt mind forgetting only then would we go into opening procedure of 8c it would seem very hard to believe to some people unless they have considerable experience in auditing that many people find in opening procedure of 8c process so arduous that they become sick fall on the floor and do all manner of weird convulsions yet it is true that an individual who has not already been put upscale to twoway communication and elementary straightwire will discover considerable difficulty in opening procedure of 8c when one has done twoway communication and elementary straightwire on preclear and has recovered the preclears ability to get well he can see for the purposes of auditing that the individual has come to level above 20 on the tone scale and he then is ready to embark on opening procedure of 8c remembering at all times that he must still be able to maintain his twoway communicationthat is not oneway communication but twoway communication with the preclear whatever process he does on the preclear whenever he does it matter what actual condition the preclear is in many an auditor fails simply because he fails to listen to the preclear when the preclear has something to say and thus the preclear goes into apathy for he was about to discover to the auditor that the auditors process had done something fantastically interesting to him and being unable to communicate this to the auditor the preclear goes into apathychart of processes where they are on the arc

professional auditors bulletin from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 163 holland park avenue london w11 _____________________________________________________________________ 21 january 1955 twoway communication in action the first thing one should know about communication is its formula the formula of one way communication is cause distance effect with intention and attention where that which occurs at effect duplicates what emanated from cause the elements of communication then are intention attention cause effect distance and duplication meaning significance are secondary phenomena communication is part of the triangle of affinity reality and communication reality is composed of the degree of duplication possible and this is also describable under the heading of agreement reality is quality which depends upon duplication and in the action of duplication expertly or poorly done we find agreement and disagreement the basic definition of affinity is coexistence and as we drift away from actual coexistence we drift into the arc triangle and the communication formula coexistence is superior to the arc triangle and the mechanics of living here we would find two things occupying the same space this would be at the top of the scale two things with space mass and energy at the bottom of the scale we would find two things compulsively or obsessively almost occupying the same space as affinity enters into the state of notquite coexistence we get the manifestations of particles and significances symbols and of course much more intimately affinity embraces the distance part of the communication formula it begins with the distance of coexistence and then as affinity drops the distance factor is more and more important regardless of whether the distance is far or close until we have at last complete and positive objection to proximity or complete and positive objection to any distance and in this state of mind we find material objects or the particles which compose them under affinity of course we have the emotional scale effort as found in science of survival and the know down to mystery scale as discussed in the advanced clinical course tapes the entirety of arc is the subject of understanding knowingness is highest on the scale and this exceeds arc and is in the realm of considerations and ideas the moment we enter into understanding we get into the communication formula and the arc triangle understanding is highly superior commodity but still lower than knowing understanding itself produces column of the chart of human evaluation which could be added to it at the top we would have complete understanding of all things and it would be complete knowingness but this would require communication to effect from this knowingness we would drop downscale into understanding and then into varying but dwindling degrees of understanding until we arrived at 20 on the scale where we would find that understanding had become commixed with incomprehensibilities to such degree that the entire vectors of life are reversed and become the vectors of physical objects from 20 down we specialize in greater and greater degrees of incomprehensibility the subject of incomprehensibility is difficult to comprehend if we examine the communication formula we discover that duplication at effect must take place if communication is to be received from the cause point of the line similarly the cause point of the line has to take into account the fact that effect must be able to duplicate thus the causepoint of the line if it wishes to communicate must communicate in fashion or in guise which can be duplicated at the effect point of the line this is not question of being so stupid or incomprehensible as to cause an effect on any incomprehensibility but it is willingness to selfdeterminedly emanate in such manner as to allow duplication to take place at effect the basic stuff of the physical universe to thetan is an incomprehensibility but he is entirely devoted to trying to understand it thetan himself the awareness of awareness unit is understanding thus we have this unit attempting to understand the incomprehensible thetan can with perfect ease understand incomprehensibility but sometimes until it is called to his attention he is continually on the track of trying to find some comprehensibility in the incomprehensible the very fact that thing is in mass form is puzzle to thetan since he himself has mass wave length and actual position in space other than his own declaration of it he can easily understand form since he is generally experienced in forms but he cant understand the stuff of which the form is made because that stuff is incomprehensibility thus we find the thetan very easily asising forms and altering them and we find him considering that he is incapable of altering in its actual substance creating or destroying the stuff of which the physical universe is made thetan looking at the incomprehensibility of the physical universe is of course doing noduplicate he is mocking himself up in the role of having to understand the incomprehensible thus we get him fixated on the idea of the physical sciences and eventually degenerating down to point where he behaves like mest and here we have the luckless nuclear physicist who can cause mest to vanish only by blowing it up physicallya game which will never win here we find science in general and here we find scientists and their utter incapability of understanding any slightest particle of human behavior or conduct and without any beliefs to speak of in humanity and with perfect and gruesome willingness to destroy it these as awareness of awareness units have agreed so thoroughly with the physical universe that they have agreement with actual understanding they write their books with many communication lags hemming and hawing and without any decisions and thoroughly object to anybodys writing as though he knows what he is doing the one thing that the scientist knows is that nobody knows and this does not happen to be true thus his science is based on false datum he originates theory that man rises from mud because he himself is so close to it when he does go into the field of the human spirit the spirit itself and indeed his own beingness is an otherdeterminism to him he sees virtue in human fellowship or decency and advises in his books the necessity to turn to higher force once scientist has broken through in revulsion against himself his feelings of non understandingness about people it is generally on the downward side and it is in the realm where he must obsessively turn to god i give you this as an idea of what happens to preclears as they go down the tone scale when they get close to the bottom they become scientific and pretend they know nothing and fight anything else which might know when they get little further down they become more violently neurotic and little more south they become psychotic and forget even their science and this is of considerable interest to the auditor for the auditor is interested in human reactions and actions and all he has to do is understand that he is looking at an incomprehensibility when he looks at anyone who is that neurotic or psychotic there is other causation in psychotic behavior than that everything is incomprehensible there is private secret button which can be hit in case magically turning the individual into sanity unless of course we utilize successfully be three feet back of your head with some basic preparatory work but this of course returns the person upscale toward understanding since it takes him from such close proximity to mass the auditor then who is looking at psychotic is trying to understand an incomprehensible and if we were to cease using the word psychotic and began to use the word incomprehensetic we would have word which would serve us extremely well thus an auditor processes the psychotic with considerable difficulty in the absence of this understanding of incomprehensibility for the auditor to get any communication acrosshas to mock himself up at least to some degree as psychotic before he can communicate the auditors fight to keep from being psychotic or even seeming psychotic is such that this conflict within himself not because of any emanation from the psychotic since these people do not emanate restimulates him the best way to handle psychotic is with physical form making the psychotic mimic the physical form by mimicking with the physical form the psychotic thus we have our basic level of mimicry and thus we have the entering wedge of communication oneway communication is firstdynamic operation twoway communication is thirddynamic operation an auditor who is playing the only one does not engage in third dynamic activities much less communication and so he withdraws into oneway communication and thus never lets the preclear emanate any communications and will not listen to anything the preclear has to say to this one fact alone we attribute the breakdown and lack of forward progress of many cases the auditor did not pay any attention when the preclear had some vital information he desired to impart the process involved with running twoway communication is best entered in the field of mimicry and the best twoway process is then of course mimicry such process will be given in the next pab on the subject of communication itself the auditor must realize that twoway communication is part and parcel of every process known in dianetics and scientology and if it is not established and if it is not continued and if attention is paid to twoway communication only small amount of benefit will occur if twoway communication is understood as process many cases which previously seemed utterly unsolvable can be resolved with considerable ease chart of processes where they are on the arc tone scale

the following process was developed by dscn jan halpern throughout the process the auditor doesnt say word he doesnt answer possible questions he doesnt explain in words what he wants under all circumstances he makes like the tar baby and dont say nothin he uses any gestures necessary step ia the auditor stands in front of the preclear holding out small object to him until the preclear takes it from his hand as soon as the preclear takes the object the auditor holds out his hand palm up until the preclear places the object in his palm the auditor immediately then offers it to the preclear again this is continued until without comm lag the object should be offered to the preclear from variety of positions once he has gotten the idea from down near the floor far off to either side over the preclears head likewise the palm should be held in variety of positions for the return of the object both hands may be used get the preclear doing it really fast step ib when step ia is going swiftly and easily the auditor introduces switch after the preclear has just accepted the article the auditor instead of extending his palm for its return places his hands behind his back briefly then conveys by gestures that the preclear is to offer the object to him when the preclear does so the auditor takes the object from his hand but does not return it until the preclear holds out his own hand palm up to receive it this exchange is continued until the preclear is offering and accepting the object from as wide variety of positions as the auditor used and all other comm lags are flat step ii the auditor just having accepted the object makes gesture that this part is over then deliberately puts the object down where the preclear can see it stands back and indicates that the preclear is to pick it up when the preclear picks it up the auditor gestures that he is to put it down again anywhere he likes in the room the instant the preclear does so the auditor snatches it up and puts it someplace else you keep this up till auditor and preclear are racing around the room seizing the object as soon as the others fingers have let go of it the object isnt necessarily placed in different spot each time it may be picked up and put down again in the same place but it must be handled each time all sorts of tacit rules and understandings will probably develop while this is being run this process rehabilitates the sense of play validates nonverbal arc shortcircuits verbal circuitry lets the preclear position matter and energy in space and time gets the preclear up to speed murders there must be reason for doingness processes the auditor and the preclear equally and besides its fun copyright 1955 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedpab 46 professional auditors

the oldest form of psychotherapy involved the questioning of the patient about his dreams this is currently dramatized by psychology more modern type of psychotherapy consists of asking preclear about his past both of these and many other activities in dianetics and scientology could be included under the heading of straight wire effective particularly from 11 on the tone scale to 18 the processes embraced under the heading straight wire have all one purpose in common this is the purpose of making the preclear stretch straight wire between cause and effect across the intervening distance whether this distance could be distance in terms of location or distance in terms of time any process in dianetics or scientology is third dynamic process thus any process in dianetics or scientology requires communication in straight wire and any other process this fact must be observed by the auditor that twoway communication must be maintained thus when administering any process which could be called straight wire the auditor should be careful at the same time to maintain twoway communication when he originally started the session the auditor captured some ground he established twoway communication whether by mimicry conversation or discussion he must never lose this captured ground thus when running straight wire when running opening procedure of 8c opening procedure by duplication remedy of havingness spotting spots in space or any other process it is necessary that this gained ground be maintained the term straight wire itself is meant to describe the imaginary straight line between cause and effect the trouble with preclear is that he is doing too many things via he is doing anything and everything in life via he is obtaining via food he is looking via glasses he is feeling and expressing emotion via glands he is utilizing or experiencing effort via muscles he is thinking via he thinks brain he is obtaining sensation sustenance and even revenge via food he is experiencing sensation and making the future via his genitals and he is even trying to experience the origin of life in most cases via church his dependency upon objects and services is such that his own creativeness becomes suppressed submerged for this working law is always present that upon which one becomes dependent becomes at length ones enslaver when anyone sets up anything automatically that thing becomes his randomity at some future date we can observe this in many ways but the entire summation of this can be grouped under the heading via should the auditor bring the preclear to point where certain cause and certain effect can be joined together without the intervention of via then the auditor has materially gained such process is the opening procedure of 8c for here the preclear is being asked to connect at least as body directly with wall as he reaches out to touch spot on that wall he is in effect stringing straight line it is notable that the opening procedure of 8c wasfirst designed for use upon an exteriorized person and when one has preclear exteriorized running through the steps of the opening procedure of 8c and the remainder of 8c as given in issue 24g of the journal of scientology produces very marked effects if your preclear cannot have an effect he certainly cannot change if he cannot cause an effect to occur he certainly cannot change himself all time is changechange is time while basically time is simply consideration the considerations of time itself are mechanically tracked by the alteration of the position of the particles in space your preclear is stuck wherever there was motion of particles whether the moment is pleasure moment triumph failure or even death in the absence of particle motion as far as he is concerned if he has lost his power to change his considerations time has existed thus those things which you find in the engram bank which are most readily available to the preclear are things which contain change in them or things which have change immediately before them and after them but have change between in the absence of this change we get condition of timelessness in an engram or facsimile which permits that incident to float on the track and thus rise up to present time as the preclear becomes more and more embedded in motionless incidents he becomes harder and harder to change himself or as he dramatizes to marked degree his own bank in the most ordinary living then he dramatizes the changeless moments and he himself does not change the basic confusion of preclear lies in the fact that an awareness of awareness unit basically has mass meaning or mobility it has qualities and potentials but it does not have position in space nor in its highest form any movement in space it can be at will in various positions in space but it is not itself in space as this is the case you can see that preclear is dramatizing the truth when he is holding himself and motionless incidents motionless in other words if change to him is totally particle shift in space then he is apt to consider himself moving as the particles move if he is moving he is actually to some degree disobeying the most basic quality of theta motion then to him becomes antipathetic on the lowest toned catatonic one finds this dramatization in full progress motionless person is then dramatizing the truth but in all aberration we discover that it is the ingredient of truth which maintains the aberration in force he is dramatizing motionlessness and is motionless but the truth of the matter is that as thetan he should be able to make things move at will and appear in various positions in space thus in clinging to the truth he loses his ability to move particles and thus loses his ability to have time this is best manifested as his communication but as his communication drops so drop his reality and his affinity in other words although he clings to the motionlessness of being thetan he loses the basic qualities of being thetan which are those of knowingness and understanding the basic confusion of any preclear then is to move or not to move shakespeare has said to be or not to be is the question when it comes to getting preclear upscale the question is to move or not to move the basics of straight wire are designed to bring the preclear into the realization that he himself can be at either the cause or effect point of communication line and that he himself does not have to be the particle moving on that line being the particle and insisting upon the truth that he isnt moving simply stops his communication entirely particles move on the straight line between cause and effect cause and effect themselves are not in motion the task is to get the individual to assume the responsibility of moving particles with this comes the realization on his part that he himself does not have to move in order to move particles and thus he will come upscale getting him to move his body around the room is an excellent method of accomplishing this but to many preclears the movement of body is near impossibility and these can contemplate only the moving of memory or an idea thus from 11 to 18 on the tone scale we find the best therapy to be that which directs itself toward the thinkingness below effortthe moving of ideasthere is particular reason to concentrate solely upon preclears past actually preclear is not the product of the past he is the product of himself all the past can do for him is to accumulate and hold for him the information that it is bad for him to move or act or do so let us take preclear whom we have gotten into communication and work with his more elementary ideas and thus get him to string straight lines between cause and effect elementary straight wire has two commands the auditor takes the first of these and uses it as long as is necessary to entirely flatten the preclears hesitancy as represented by his communication lag his communication lag is merely the expression of vias on the line which amounts to the preclears unwillingness to string straight line the questions are give something you wouldnt mind remembering give something you wouldnt mind forgetting more elementary form of this would be remember something forget something but this is far too direct for our preclear if you will notice very direct and forthright person if surrounded by people who are more covert gets very bad goingover for it thus it is in processing when you try to string very straight line with preclear he will sometimes resist slightly less elementary than elementary straight wire as above is the nexttothelast list in self analysis can you recall something that is really real to you can you recall time when you were in good communication with someone can you recall time when someone was in good communication with you can you recall time when you felt some affinity for someone can you recall time when someone felt some affinity for you the entire text of self analysis in its original edition now available from the foundation in phoenix is devoted to rehashing the preclears past to show him that it is not quite as dangerous as it is made out to be and that it wont bite him if he remembers some things about it from this form of straight wire we go into more complicated form as given in self analysis in scientology converted edition of the original self analysis the edition is converted by the way simply by substituting everywhere in its text for the word recall the word mock up simply by substituting mock up in the directions at the beginning of each list one has modern self analysis now it is very remarkable that the less specific and sequitur the auditors questions are the better the results with the preclear another form of straight wire is quite superior to those above but is very vicious and violent process it is contained in the creation of human ability which is the printed edition much expanded of the earlier auditors handbook the basic command of this process is start lying keep on lying this can be particularized with tell some lies about your past tell some lies about present tell some lies about the future the auditor each time making sure that the preclear is using nonactual places and times remember that while running straight wire one must maintain twoway communication many case has been lost simply because the preclear wanted to say something and the auditor was so intent upon the process that he paid attention whatsoever to the preclears urge to communicate remember that oneway communication is first dynamic operation that twoway communication is necessary for third dynamic operation that under oneway communication preclear will not get well that under twoway communication preclear will get well thus in running straight wire do not begrudge the preclear few moments discussion of the incident he has just recalled or discussion ofphenomena he has suddenly noticed do not crush him simply because he wishes to express himself this is essentially subjective process and the auditor should make sure that the preclear speaks aloud the things he is remembering the preclears nod or yes to signify that he has recalled something or has invented something is insufficient and should always be suspect for preclears who are very bad off pervert or invert every communication line they use and so they will not be doing the process if given any slightest opportunity elementary straight wire and other forms of straight wire are intensely beneficial from 11 to 18 on the tone scale but after you have your preclear up to 18 or above remember that there are better processespab 47 professional auditors bulletin from l ron hubbard

various auditors comes to stating that they now realize why their auditing of many of their preclears failed and they uniformly declare that the reason for former failure on preclears was not the case level of the preclear nor yet the complicated state of processes but i failure on the part of the auditor to get the preclear into twoway communication before proceeding with other processes and continuing failure to keep two way communication established and 2 not doing enough opening procedure of 8c on the preclear an evaluation of technique does not depend upon the intricacy or brilliance of its theory but upon its ease of communication to auditors during training and the ease of their application of it upon preclears in 8c we have process which answers these various conditions it is very easy to train an auditor to do 8c it is very easy for preclear to do opening procedure of 8c in one form or another the entirety of technique known as standard operating procedure 8c was intended for exteriorized preclears its opening procedure was originally designed to be done by an exteriorized preclear but it was found to be far less workable for the exteriorized preclear than when done so far as the opening part of the procedure was concerned with the preclear moving his body around and making it touch spots there are three parts to opening procedure of 8c and it is necessary for the comm lag as dramatized physically by the preclear to be completely flattened by the auditor on each part before the next is undertaken eventually these parts are the gradient scale of decision in the first part we have the auditor picking out the spots telling the preclear to walk over to them telling the preclear to touch them in the next step part b of opening procedure of 8c we have the preclear picking out the spots on the auditors order and then on the auditors order walking over to them and touching them and in the third part part c we have the preclear picking out the spots on the auditors order walking over to them and deciding on his own decision but under the auditors command when to touch and let go this is not one of those processes one gets novel about as an auditor the process has been found to be workable exactly as it is put forth variation or the introduction of extraneous material beyond that necessary to continue twoway communication with the preclear is found to be destructive of the process this process is as workable as it is simple it is also as workable as the auditor is able to do process as given the first thing that opening procedure of 8c does is to get the preclear used to the idea of following somebody elses directions and leading him to discover that by following somebody elses directions he does not collapse or become ill or die in other words the preclear discovers that he can follow orders without becoming entirely ruined this is an interesting discovery since the physical universe is continually ordering him around and if heis resisting orders he is resisting the physical universe resistance is the one step necessary to entrapment there is another point in the opening procedure of 8c which cannot be too thoroughly stressed nearly every failure in the past where the preclear has been audited and audited and audited the auditor was unaware of the fact that the preclear was not following the directions given him survey was taken of preclears who had had great deal of trouble in being processed in scientology and each one of them either by means of meter or by their own statement was discovered to have uniformly avoided running any of the auditing commands given them even though they were giving the auditor every assurance and appearance of running the auditing commands now it could only be possible for preclear to avoid auditing commands if the auditor was unable to observe directly the workings going on in the preclear in the opening procedure of 8c it is impossible for the preclear to avoid the auditing command the auditor can stand or sit and watch the preclear go through the exact orders and observe directly whether or not the preclear is doing what he is told to do this is major benefit the basic theory of opening procedure of 8c is to make and break communication with the physical universe once an individual discovers that he can make and break communication with walls and objects it will be discovered that he can let go of various pieces of his engram bank actually all the time he is doing 8c he is letting go of enormous quantities of useless material with which he has cluttered his thinking and life it is very direct process and gets the preclear to stretch very straight line between cause and effect an auditor while running this should occasionally ask the preclear who is doing this preclears who are psychotic will tell the auditor that their finger is doing it or that the wall is doing it and then advance on up to where the hand is doing it the arm is doing it and finally that the body is doing it and at last that the preclear himself is doing it this is the acceptance of responsibility for an action very good description of the opening procedure of 8c exists in the printed edition or the mimeo edition of intensive procedure as r216 which is the proper technical number of this process thorough description of the process is given in pab no34 at the beginning of this series the process is being repeated here in order to give it proper stress it has and do not doubt it for moment tremendous value i have yet to see preclear who is having physical difficulty of major sort or mental difficulty fail to improve under long and careful and meticulous administration of the opening procedure of 8c there are two errors which can be made in the running of the opening procedure of 8c the first is not to know and do the process and the second is not to run it long enough how long is long enough in many cases twentyfive hours is not long enough in the opening procedure of 8c r216 the auditor has very powerful tool and is invited to use it thoroughlypab 48 professional auditors bulletin from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 163 holland park avenue london w11 _____________________________________________________________________ 18 march 1955 opening procedure by duplication numbered r217 in the creation of human ability and the mimeo edition of this the auditors handbook available from the hasi in phoenix opening procedure by duplication has been doing things to cases hitherto untouched by extensive and intricate auditing because this process is very arduous to run on people below boredom on the tone scale and because it has very often been used on people on whom it should not be used it was early called dirty 30 actually dirty 30 is procedure 30 which encompassed what is now r2 17 and two other steps ranting and raving has gone on in various locales because of opening procedure by duplication it has been branded as hypnotic technique the fact of the matter is it runs out hypnosis and in the process of running it the restimulation of hypnotism is sufficiently marked to make an auditor and preclear believe that hypnotism is taking place however opening procedure by duplication continued on past this point runs on out the hypnotism before one does opening procedure by duplication one should have done the earlier steps of the six processes which are twoway communication elementary straight wire and opening procedure of 8c only when these are thoroughly accomplished should one attempt opening procedure by duplication furthermore it is very good thing for an auditor to have had opening procedure by duplication run on him before he tries to run it on preclears for the technique is very difficult upon an auditor who himself cannot duplicate inability to duplicate is also inability to be cause and inability to be effect the reason one has an engram bank is because it mustnt happen again or it must happen again in order to make sure that something does not happen again one has picture of it which he considers necessary to prevent him from duplicating the action the existence of picture of course will eventually make him follow the action and follow the dictates of the picture thus we get the action of an engram and restimulation the minimum time to run opening procedure by duplication r217 would be two andahalf hours there is sense in running the process twenty minutes for it may well happen that the preclear can bear up for little while only to bog thoroughly on the process run on people who are below boredom on the tone scale the auditor may experience the preclears bolting from the session when opening procedure by duplication is being run it is common for the preclear by comments and reactions to dramatize the know to mystery scale the know to mystery scale of course is very long tall scale but any section of this scale has in it the various levels of know to mystery thus one can see preclear going up from mystery through sex through eating through effort through emotion through looking to knowing then going through different higher harmonic of mystery then sex then eating and so forth theauditor may not see him go through all of the grades on the know to mystery scale in order but will see him spotting one after another of the levels of this scale the preclear will make such comments as looks good enough to eat theres lot of work connected with this its mystery to going up the mystery to know scale one of course crosses the emotional scale which was described and witnessed in dianetics the modern science of mental health but this emotional scale is of course part of the know to mystery scale in great britain where auditors have used for the two objects required book and bottle the process is called book and bottle these two objects are very good choice for working the process book for instance is placed in one part of room and bottle is placed in another part of room far enough apart so that preclear will have to walk between them the auditor then sends him back and forth from one to the other using for each item stereotyped series of questions which actually themselves never vary because these questions never vary the auditor is apt to forget that he must maintain twoway communication with the preclear the auditor is not doing opening procedure by duplication the preclear is doing opening procedure by duplication when the preclear talks and asks questions and when he volunteers information the auditor of course must answer him there must be discussion of some sort from time to time and the auditor who is not content with the fact that the preclear has actually looked at it should of course insist that the preclear look at the object or that he weigh it more carefully however one can err very easily in the direction of varying the process remember that matter how much talking goes on the basic process is the same and the order of the commands and the commands themselves are all exactly the same to quote r217 from the creation of human ability which is the printed edition of the auditors handbook r217 opening procedure by duplication is begun only after the preclear has some reality on his environment until the preclears reality on his environment is good opening procedure by duplication should not be done for the preclear only turns on an unreality circuit and goes through it mechanically the first part of opening procedure by duplication is to get the preclear to examine communicate with and own somewhat on the order of opening procedure of 8c two dissimilar objects these objects are then placed several feet apart and at level so that the preclear can pick them up without bending over but so that he has to walk between them once the auditor is entirely satisfied that the preclear has reality on these objects and can own them he then begins opening procedure by duplication with the following commands supposing that one of the objects was book and the other was an ash tray go over to the book look at it pick it up what is its color at this point the preclear must give an answer what is its temperature here the preclear must answer again what is its weight here again the preclear must answer put it down in exactly the same place when the preclear has executed go over to the ash tray look at it pick it up what is its color the preclear says an answer what is its temperature the preclear says his answer what is its weight the preclear says his answer put it down exactly in the same place when the preclear has executed go over to the book and the same words and the same formula are used over and over again until the preclear has had sufficient number of hours of opening procedure by duplication to enable him to do it without communication lag without protest without apathy but only cheerfulness each time seeing the items newly this is process which is done by the hour the process is better when done consecutively for so many hours rather than done an hour apiece each day for several days this procedure is the first step of procedure 30pab 49 professional auditors bulletin from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 163 holland park avenue london w11 _____________________________________________________________________ 1 april 1955 the remedy of havingness there is great deal of upperechelon theory connected with the remedy of havingness as process for here we are dealing with energy and the reasons and operations of thetan in regard to it just why thetan should get himself so completely snarled up in energy might be an entire mystery to anyone who did not realize that thetan has to cut down his knowingness and his total presence in order to have game the awareness of awareness unit builds space to cut down knowingness space makes it necessary then to look at something in order to know about it the next thing thetan does to cut down his knowingness is to create energy and to pass it to other thetans and to bring in the energy of other thetans so as to get duration and time span if the thetan is successful and obtains game in this wise he continues on with this modus operandi of having game and when he does not have game he simply cuts his knowingness down once more of course he reaches point eventually where he does not get game simply by cutting down his knowingness and eventually assumes fairly fixed stupid aspect he is below the level of having games but because he has cut down his knowingness he does not know now that he is below the level of having games and thinks that all that is necessary to get another game is to further cut down his knowingness he is by this time obsessively dramatizing the lowering of knowingness when one speaks of knowingness one should realize that one is speaking of an embracive thing everything on the know to mystery scale is simply greater condensation or reduction of knowingness at first one simply knows then he makes some space and some energy and so now he has knowingness in terms of looking by changing the position of the particles of energy thus created and by exchanging particles with others extant or selfcreated the thetan cuts down his knowingness further and gets time and so gets emotion and sensation when these become solid he has effort particles and masses now he could cut down his knowingness further by refusing to use emotion and effort but by thinking about them thus introducing new vias into his line of knowingness and when he longer knows entirely by thinking he ceases to create knowingness and begins to eat and from eating he drops into the readymade sensation of sex instead of knowing what happens in the future and from here he drops down into postulated mystery as something one cannot possibly know about in other words one gets continued reduction of knowingness in order to have games the greatest chess player in the world has game since he can predict that he will win and predict everything that opponents will do so he will simply demonstrate how to play chess sooner or later he will announce that he is burned out or has lost his knack for playing chess and will go off into some other field where he can have game the field he will choose will be less wisdomdemanding field than playing chess boxer such as some of the very great ones of the past will reduce his timing which is to say his knowingness of arrival to point where he can at least put on good exhibition and from this they will further reduce their knowingness and then not noticing how far they have gone get themselves thoroughly and consistently beaten there will be period however when they are fairly evenly matched against their opponentsto understand this with any thoroughness one would have to recognize the intention back of all communication creation survival and destruction is knowingness when somebody talks to you his intention is to continue in parity where he can have an interchange of communication which is to say game he takes knowingness from you and gives knowingness to you with one form of communication or another two soldiers fighting and shooting at each other are using bullet to make the other man know what is there to know in this situation that one is dead of course and for the victor that one has won it is dangerous alike to thetan to have too many wins or too many losses give him too many wins and he will correct in the direction of reducing his knowingness as represented by his dexterity his prediction his activity give him too many losses and he will seek another game even to the point where he will die and pick up another body because the decision is on the basis of knowingness the decision is always downward one does not decide upward toward greater knowingness actually unless one has the full and complete intention of winning in new game if one discovers that there are wins or losses either to be found in this new game one will reduce ones own knowingness even to the point of forgetting all of his knowledge concerning it in order to ensure game as there is not an infinity of games in progress one is apt as he comes down seventy four trillion years of track to play out the available games and to put them in the category of it must not happen again one then becomes bored one is only bored when there is game possible from his viewpoint actually all he has to do is become enthusiastic about the game on his own consideration and he will begin to know more about it again thetan considers that some form or mass is necessary in order to have game he gets into the belief that he cannot create new masses and so he begins to hold on to old masses and here whether he is exteriorized or in body we find him holding on hard to old facsimiles old significances old decisions rather than taking on new decisions the remedy of havingness directly addresses the problems of giving the thetan something to play with when he discovers that he can have new masses he will begin to let go of old masses it is an easily observed phenomenon while having preclear remedy havingness that old engrams go into restimulation go into restimulation and run out that they show up in front of his face and suddenly explode or disappear the remedy of havingness actively does run out engrams this process is used from boredom up to conservatism for its best results this process is done by asking the preclear to mock up something and pull it in or mock up something and throw it away when thetan is exteriorized if you want to see him get very unhappy make him change space until he begins to lose all the energy he is holding on to and then fail to remedy his havingness the thetan will become convinced that he is only thought and is therefore by his standards unable to have game tell him to mock up eight anchor points in the form of the corners of cube around him and pull them in upon himself ask him to do it several more times and he immediately brightens up and becomes very happy why is this you have reassured him that he can have game the cutting down of knowingness and the remedy of havingness have opposite vectors the remedy of havingness will knock out old energy masses the thetan is holding on to or that the body is holding on to which tell the thetan he is stupid the supplanting of these by new energy masses which do not have the postulate of cutdown knowingness in them of course makes the thetan brighter when you find theory detached from process and not demonstrating itself in process there must be something wrong with the theory similarly if what i say here about condensed knowingness being all other things and the cutdown of knowingness were not demonstrated in the process of remedy of havingness then we would have to get ourselves new theory however this is demonstrated very definitely those people who cannot remedyhavingness wherever they are on the tone scale can be brought to point where they will remedy havingness simply by asking them what they wouldnt mind knowing the consideration of what they are willing to know then begins to rise if you only could see black five operate you would see that his barriers are all erected toward knowing something of course he is very afraid of being told something bad and so doesnt want to be told anything at all and when the auditor gives him command he never receives the command as given but does something else he has block up against knowingness to such degree that he will eventually permit himself to be pressed into complete inactive stupidity what are those black screens for basically to keep him from knowing knowing what then one will have to look closely at the definition of datum datum is an invention which has become agreed upon and so solidified in other words datum is to some degree solidity even if it is merely symbol to get into this state it has to be agreed upon when it is thoroughly agreed upon it becomes then truth it is not at all truth it is an invention what made it sure or what made it real was the fact that it was agreed upon this opens the doors further to other processes in order to get the preclear in good condition we would have to put him into some kind of condition so that he could create the first thing he is liable to be able to create in auditing is lie the word lie is simply invention with bad connotation society gives invention that connotation because of its anxiety to have game and to agree and so be able to communicate with one another thus society frowns upon the invention of facts yet the preclears sanity and continued happiness absolutely depend upon his ability to create new facts the technique which remedies this is included in the creation of sanity number r229 start lying one can vary this auditing command with tell some lies about your past and then keep the preclear at it long enough so that the preclear is able to come out of the complete blur which will follow on the heels of his taking over the function of and running of his memory machines the invention of data is step immediately toward the remedy of havingness simply asking the preclear what he wouldnt mind knowing what he wouldnt mind having other people knowing about him will bring him into condition where he can mock up and remedy havingness the remedy of havingness is the companion process to spotting spots which will be taken up in the next pab the remedy of havingness simply as process by itself if worked up to by getting the preclear willing to know things and willing for other people to know things and run thoroughly so that whole avalanches of masses can pour into him or pour out of him will actually run out an entire engram bank and thus is an extremely valuable process it has been reported by several auditors that exteriorization was accomplished on preclears by making them remedy havingness and do nothing else for eight or ten hours the auditing commands for the remedy of havingness are mock up something pull it in until the preclear is doing this easily then mock up something throw it away until the preclear can do this easily the significance of the object may be added by the auditor with pull in an ideal body or some such thing but the actual fact is that the actual significance does nothing for the preclear it is the mass which counts the auditor can have the preclear pull things in two at time six at time he can have the preclear mock up something copy it dozen times one time after another then pull in the whole mass but the real reason he is doing this with the preclear should never drop from sight the auditor is remedying havingness in order to give the preclear enough mass to permit him to discard old masses which he is holding on to and doesnt know anything aboutpab 50 professional auditors bulletin from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 163 holland park avenue london w11 _____________________________________________________________________ 15 april 1955 remedy of havingnessthe process when in doubt remedy havingness this is motto which can well be followed by an auditor doing any process on any preclear but if there is process which one should do with any other process then that process should be understood thoroughly for if done incorrectly it would be likely to produce confusion into all the other processes of dianetics and scientology therefore in the first place let us examine with rigor the name of this process it is remedy of havingness by remedy one means the correction of any aberrated condition by havingness one means mass or objects the process could also be called remedy of unhavingness it could also be called remedy of acceptingness it could also be called remedy of rejectingness to those people who are deficient in havingness the process is liable to mean that the auditor should increase the havingness of the preclear such an auditor with this misunderstanding would have the preclear put up large masses and push them into his body or himself the auditor would neglect having the preclear throw away objects and masses if the auditor misunderstood the process and simply assumed that it had something to do with havingness and if his own havingness were too great he would be likely to specialize on all preclears by having the preclear throw things away actually the auditor should have the preclear push things into himself and his body and throw things away from himself and his body until the preclear can do both with equal ease when this has been accomplished the preclears havingness has been remedied what then does remedy of havingness mean it means the remedy of preclears native ability to acquire things at will and reject them at will amongst the havingnesses which would require remedy would be an obsessive inflow of money sexual objects troubles somatics and difficulties in general whenever one of these appeared in the preclears environment it would have tendency to inflow on the preclear the reverse difficulty would be an obsessive outflow whereby the preclear threw away or wasted anything which he had such as money clothes cars or living quarters when the process remedy of havingness has been done thoroughly and completely the preclear should be able to reject or accept at his own discretion anything in his environment as well as anything in his engram bank the earliest use of this process is to be found in gita which is to say give and take processing one of the early sops which became an sop8 expanded gita in issue 16g of the journal of scientology we have long list of key items the preclear was asked towaste accept and desire these items at will this was the desireenforcementinhibit scale or the dei scale this process is the immediate ancestor of the remedy of havingness indeed one could do far worse than to take the dei expanded gita list as given in issue 16g and in the form of mockups use it as such upon the preclear or more modernly employ it directly on the remedy of havingness on these objects if one were to employ such list in the remedy of havingness one would of course have to employ gradient scales the use of the gradient scale has never been discarded and the concept and principle of doing things by gradient scales is inherent in auditing itself for one starts with process which the preclear can do and gives him some wins and on gradual scale gives him larger and larger wins until he is cleared similarly in remedying havingness the preclear must be started at the lowest end of the scale and advanced on up to the higher end of the scale quantity is one of the methods of doing this at first one can ask preclear to mock up one of an item and shove it into his body or throw it away and then go finally when he is doing that well to two items three four five and six all the same but greater quantity of the item an even lower gradient on this scale would be to simply get the idea that something was there and to progress on forward with the idea into the actual mass an expert auditor working with this from the idea on through to the object would discover that he had preclears who could not mock up he would have the preclear get the idea out in front of him of ball and get the idea of the ball being thrown away get the idea of ball up in front of him and get the idea of ball coming in he would then when the preclear could do this excellently well move forward into the actual mockup of ball the mockup would get better and better as the process progressed until at last the preclear could mock up and throw away or push into his body at will ball he could see this ball he could even feel it and its weight now you may get the idea occasionally that these pabs are mostly at least in this series handling old material this is not the case every time one of these pabs is written i put into it everything that is known up to the date that it is written and this pab is exception and let tell you this is very lucky pab for you because remedy of havingness by slight change i made some weeks ago has become key exteriorization process so we have remedy of havingness for exteriorization as newer process than the old remedy of havingness exteriorization remedy of havingness or exteriorization by remedy of havingness is accomplished by having the preclear shove or push things into his body one longer has the preclear pull things into his body simply by having the preclear mock up things and shove them into his body mock up things and throw them away mock up things and shove them into his body mock up things and throw them away preclear who has already been run on the earlier steps of the six basic processes will at this stage exteriorize quite neatly after as little as fifteen or twenty minutes of the process if he does not then the earlier processes have been skimped and the preclear was really not ready for full forthright remedy of havingness even when doing route i the preclear is told to push things into himself this will rather take his flitter away for moment for he is there being one viewpoint and in order to push something into himself he has to be second viewpoint in view of the fact that thetan gets in trouble by being only one viewpoint this remedies the viewpoint scarcity of the thetan and he pushes himself up into two viewpoints with great rapidity thus we are doing duplication of the thetan at the same time that we are remedying havingness so one even has the thetan shove things into himself rather than pull things into himself in short one never has anyone pull things into his body any more one has person push things into his body one has him for instance mock up planet and push it into the body mock up planet and throw it away mock up planet and push it into his body mock up planet and throw it away mock up planet and push it into his body and then one says where are you pushing it in from the preclear says out here in front of the body the auditor simply goes on doing the process and very shortly the preclear will if the earliersteps have been done well which is to say the six basic processes below remedy of havingness the preclear will be neatly exteriorized and will be ready for route 1 one would omit in such an instance running spotting spots as such for change of space processing and communication processing have great deal to do with spotting spots already if you were to do remedy of havingness forthrightly and allout and you were to accept this as the only process we had we would work with its cousin process r263 as given in the creation of human ability acceptreject one would ask the preclear for things he could accept one after the other until the communication lag was flat and then would ask the preclear for things he could reject one after the other until the communication lag was flat on that one would then move into the expanded gita list and would have the preclear mock up and shove into his body if interiorized or into himself if exteriorized the various items on the expanded gita list as given in issue 16g of the journal of scientology this would be long process and not entirely successful on all counts but would nevertheless be very effective and efficient process from the standpoint of gains one would certainly get the preclear over very large number of aberrations and would do great deal for him however this is not the advised way of handling this process for the process itself is not an endall aberrations can be handled much more easily by communication processing as will be given in later pab the exact use and commands of remedy of havingness in ordinary and routine auditing are simple and effective one has been asking preclear great many questions which as ised large masses of energy one in handling change of space or interiorization and exteriorization into objects while the preclear is exteriorized has been burning up great deal of energy any time the preclear begins to feel dopey or boil off he has either run too long on flow in one direction in which case reverse the flow or he has simply reduced his havingness down to point where he feels tired or sleepy without waiting for this manifestation to occur the good auditor simply in the course of straight wire or description processing or many other processes such as those contained in route 1 remedies havingness having achieved something like momentarily flat comm lag on process the auditor says to the preclear mock up mass out in front of you when the preclear has done this the auditor says shove it into your body when the preclear has done so the auditor says mock up another mass out in front of you and when the preclear has done so the auditor says throw it away that as given is for preclears who are interiorized it is simply repeated over and over the mass is not specified it can be almost anything and in fact it does not much matter what type of significance the mass has any mass is better than mass according to the thetan if the preclear is exteriorized the auditor already starts him on the remedy of havingness in the route i step where the preclear is asked to copy what he is looking at r15 when one is doing r15 one must be very careful to obey the gradient scale principle behind remedy of havingness he would not make the preclear make twenty copies and then push them all into himself or the body he would make the preclear make two or three copies and push them in one at time until the preclear could remedy his havingness with ease the auditor would then have the preclear mock up mass and shove it into yourself and then mock up mass and throw it away and do this back and forth until the preclear could do this easily and well at which time the auditor would tell the preclear mock up two masses and shove them into yourself and then mock up two masses and throw them away until finally the auditor has the preclear mock up eight masses as though they were the corners of cube around the preclear and shove them into yourself and then mock up eight masses and throw them away one must remember that in spite of the fact that he cannot duplicate mass actually as himself having space or mass natively the motto of the thetan is anything is better than nothing when you tear up lot of facsimiles for thetan and throw them away he becomes very unhappy unless you have him reconstruct those facsimiles or remedy the mass he has lostaccordingly when you are having thetan go into and out of mest universe masses certain amount of energy is burned up and after the thetan has been run for short time on this step r19 in the creation of human ability you must be particularly careful to remedy his havingness with eight masses shoved into himself and eight masses thrown away several times thetan who has been run great deal without remedy of havingness comes to what is to him horrible thought i am just concept and will sag in tone he does not come to this state as long as havingness is consistently remedied it may be as you look at scientology that youve come to the opinion watching remedy of havingness work that all there is to anything is the remedy of havingness that it is all based on the remedy of havingness if you have preclear shove enough havingness into his body he will exteriorize in most cases if you remedy enough havingness while he is chasing around the universe as in the grand tour he will discover and asis great many communication lines which otherwise might be very detrimental however it is not true that havingness is the entire key to the human mind havingness is the gimmick or weenie for which the game is played and having something is very like winning however above havingness there is doingness and above doingness there is beingness and above beingness there is communicatingness and above communicatingness there is knowingness and above knowingness there is postulatingness and so we see we have long way to go above havingness in order to get to the top activity of thetan which is making postulates or unmaking them you could of course rationalize each and every action of the thetan with regard to havingness you could even extend havingness to space although it normally refers to objects you could do all manner of interesting things with havingness you could get as specific and as significant as you like or as unsignificant as you like and still find remedy of havingness working but we do not have here in remedy of havingness the total clue the total key but we do have process and an item which must not be overlooked in auditing in the six basic processes the remedy of havingness comes after the opening procedure by duplication as process itself but remember that remedy of havingness is done and can be done at any time during any of the processes as long as the preclear is even vaguely in communication with the auditor it does not matter how vague the mass is that the preclear is using to remedy his havingness here is place where certainty is not necessary an unreal vague or flimsy mass if this is all the preclear can get will still remedy his havingness case comes to mind out of the advanced clinical course where student was unwilling after his second day to continue his studies he did not believe that he could stand the hammer and pound as he put it of the terrifically intense schedule i took him into my office asked him what he was doing in life and he replied to that he was machinist also it seemed to turn out that he had had something to do with ship which had sunk under him although his recollection of this was very unclear i asked him what kind of machine he had customarily run and he told then i had him mock up this machine and remedy his havingness with it then i had him mock up the ship and remedy his havingness with that just as given above i did this for about fifteen minutes and enough change occurred in his case to entirely return his confidence in his ability to stand up to the course and to audit yet the mockups he was getting were so thin that he could barely vaguely discern them at all mockups get unreal because the thetan is notising existence he is trying to destroy masses by saying that they do not exist that they are not real he is so bent upon this system of destruction that he is making everything unreal or black one of the cures for this is end of cycle processing run in the following fashion one has the preclear mock himself up dead matter how unreal this mockup is then have the mockup waste away to bone and have the bones waste away to dust and then have the preclear shove the dust into himself or alternately throw it away one once more has the preclear mock himself up dead have the mockup waste away to bone have the bones waste away to dust and then have the preclear remedy his havingness with the dust one continues this for two or three hours with the preclear if one really wishes the case to make change where preclear is getting reality on mockups or blackness he is most commonly stuck in that parascientological thing that thing horribly abhorred by psychologists who havebecome dianeticists or by people who are just plain scared past death if you wanted to convince somebody that past deaths exist you would run end of cycle processing on them this is cousin process to the remedy of havingness one could go very long distance with this process and have the preclear mock up his mother dead have her waste away to bones and remedy havingness with the dust or do this with the dust or do this with the father or brothers or grandparents with considerable change in the case this end of cycle processing by the way is very fine process it has been with us about year and it has been successful whenever used it has tendency to fall into disuse because it has not until now had an exact place on the six basic processes but end of cycle is actually an additional process to the remedy of havingness and is an effective way of remedying havingness do you remember in the old days the dianetics corpse case who would lie upon the couch with his arms crossed neatly all ready for lily and would always audit in this fashion the solution to this corpse case is end of cycle processing as given here the preclear is so fixed in death that he is trying to make everything unreal and the only real thing to him would be the unreality of death in these pabs i have been trying to give you the basic auditing as it is done today in hubbard professional college in phoenix and in london it is intensely effective auditing recent survey of the staffaudited preclears over period of two months demonstrated by the most arduous and recognized testing that we had been jumping the iq of preclears an average of ten points apiece for every twentyfive hours of auditing many of them went much higher than this i myself in five hours of auditing was getting this same result which was being obtained by staff twentyfive hour intensive but all that i was using actually were the six basic processes all that staff auditors were using were the six basic processes of course our having the knowhow of using remedy of havingness and communication processing in the midst of these six basic processes these gains were not necessarily the gains being obtained across the broad field of scientology there is actually substitute for good thorough professional training professionally trained auditor shows up like lamp in lighthouse on dark night if only by reason of inspecting his results you will find the background of this material contained in dianetics 1955 and in the recent hardcover edition of intensive procedure which including now 75 separate processes is called the creation of human ability this book is obtained from london directly or from the hasi in phoenix only the british edition is ready but we have plenty of these and if you ordered the book from phoenix it was filed with london edition if you want to write for london edition you will find that the cost is 590 and it will be airmailed to you we are discovering that it takes about eight weeks of very intensive training in order to indoctrinate an auditor into an adequate use of these six basic processes this is done in the hca or in london hpa course the course has the additional bonus of getting these processes run on the auditor until he is in pretty good condition if not cleared in the upper echelon phoenix course which is to say the graduate course all of the various angles and alternate uses are taken up if you are using scientology or modem dianetics without professional training you would do very well to have somebody study these processes with you as given in these recent pabs and run them on you just as given in order for some subjective information concerning them now another footnote in this pab some lastminute news on these six basic processes is change from the material given in the pab on elementary straight wire and the pab just before that on twoway communication in the next pabs numbers 57 58 and 59 written by jack parkhouse we will take up these highly advanced alterations for the mission of these pabs is to keep you up to date as far as possible by the way i heard from an old hda recently via member of the staff to whom he wrote and this old hda complained hubbard does not put out anywhere near enough material to keep us up to date search through the pab files disclosed that this hda was not on the pab mailing list if an individual is not on the pab mailing list it is certain he will beconvinced that hubbard isnt putting out any material the data which you should have in your kit to know scientology and auditing and be up to date as of now are the creation of human ability from london dianetics 1955 from phoenix and at least the last ten pabs with the material which is immediately forthcoming you will be up to date indeed if not well into the future as far as the rest of the human race is concerned and by the way i wish you would write and tell how you are getting along with these pabs and how you are getting along with the auditing in general it just might be that id like to know l ron hubbardthe creation of human ability handbook for scientologists by l ron hubbardgo your ways behold i send you forth as lambs among wolves carry neither purse nor scrip nor shoes and salute man by the way and into whatsoever

expanded by wbb jr 107preface to all hasi schools and british associates subject training the training program of the hasi was stabilized during the seven clinical course units this has been developed into the hasi training schedule and it is expected that this schedule will be fitted into the training programs under use with further modification than is absolutely necessary to fit the peculiar needs of the school this training course embraces the grade of hubbard certified auditor hubbard professional auditor bachelor of scientology and doctor of scientology there is difference amongst these degrees as to the procedures employed or methods of instruction the difference of course level amongst these ratings consists of the amount of theory and expansion given to the subject of intensive procedure in all cases for all courses we wish at the end of course to have an auditor in good personal condition who understands thoroughly that the processes enumerated in intensive procedure are workable and that they will resolve the problems he faces in preclears and groups and the conviction on the auditors part that at least some of these processes can be used expertly by himself the auditors examination for certification in any grade is based upon the definitions and theories underlying those processes contained in the creation of human ability handbook for scientologists the examination should include history general theory and conversance with the various publications of scientology as well as dianetics the primary goal of an hca or hpa school is outlined in the first sentence above when this has been accomplished that level of school can consider that it has accomplished its mission the primary text of any school of any level is now the creation of human ability handbook for scientologists secondary text but almost equal in importance is scientology group auditors handbook concentration on these two publications should be extreme only those tapes which will actually supplement these manuals should be employed particularly in the hca hpa course the instructor should be severely reluctant to impart any further data of any kind than that contained in these manuals and the tapes supporting them forthcoming popular text book on scientology is designed to embrace little more in theory and practice than that found crowded into the two handbooks thus when person who has read the popular text turns to school or auditor for training he will discover himself studying in far more intense form that material on which he has already agreed the basic theory in which the student is to be instructed is as follows considerations take rank over the mechanics of space energy and time and that these mechanics are the product of agreedupon considerations which life mutually holds that the mechanics have taken such precedent in man that they have become more important than the considerations and overpower his ability to act freely in the framework of mechanics which is to say that the picture man presents is an inverted one that the goal of processing is to bring an individual into such thorough communication with the physical universe that he can regain the power and ability of his own postulates that scientology is the science of knowing how to know answers and that scientologist is expected to be able to resolve problems in great many specialized fields of which auditing is the first field he addresses so as to be conversant with and capable in the phenomena of life that in world every day more violently impressed with mechanics chaos may be expected to ensue on national and community level by many reasons which incidentally include atomic fission that the role of scientologist is to impede this disintegration if possible but if it occurs to be ready to pick up the pieces that the scientologist has specialized political or religious convictions beyond those dictated by wisdom and his own early training that the total empire to which scientologist aspires is the empire of wisdom that an auditor is expected to follow the auditors code 1954 and the code of scientologists and that he is expected to know these codes by heart that the only scarcity of preclears which will occur is through his own indigence and his procurement of preclears or 1groups does not depend upon the industry of other auditors but of himself that l ron hubbard is human being the student should be instructed as well in the organization and functions of the hasi in various certifications and their meaning and in his legal status his instruction should begin with the lecture on scientology and what it is and with an immediate assignment to auditing this assignment should consist of the most elementary possible technique in order to accustom the auditor into achieving twoway communication with the preclear he should be maintained on such an assignment until such time as the instructor is satisfied that he can deliver the auditing commands and maintain his twoway communication with the preclear without falling into any deeper significances and until he has complete and positive understanding of communication lag and how to flatten one out the auditing commands to be used in this first step are something you wouldnt mind remembering something you wouldnt mind forgetting it is completely vital that the student understand the mechanism of communication lag and its definition that it is the length of time between the moment the auditor poses the question and the moment when that exact question posed is answered positively by the preclear matter whether silence or talk or incorrect answers occurred in the interim only when the student has become at ease with the above and perfectly comprehensent is he permitted to go further in his training the next step consists of opening procedure of 8 c the three parts of this are given him one at time to audit on his fellow students until he has become expert and assured in performing each part at this same time he must become assured as well of the workability of this process and that it is the only process he must ever employ on psychotics and neurotics the student must also be made to understand physical communication lag as just another kind of communication lag and he must become convinced that he must flatten physical communication lags by continuing to use the command which produced them he must develop precision in his rendition and all sloppiness or carelessness in the running of this process must be ironed out by the instructor the lecture material at this time should strenuously and repetitively take up the auditors code with examples until the student understands it thoroughly the next process in which the student is to be indoctrinated is opening procedure by duplication he is expected to do this for many hours he is expected to have this run on him for many hours after this the auditors code is taken up again and only at this point should general theory or other data subjects be undertaken by the instructor either in his own lectures or by tapes once the student is entirely comfortable and familiar and precise with opening procedure by duplication he is instructed in remedying havingness and spotting spots in space remedying havingness is emphasized and is senior to spotting spots in space and is taken up in lecture in its various forms before the auditor is permitted to run spotting spots in space when the auditor has mastered acceptance level rejection level and things that you wouldnt mind occupying your space he is then turned loose to audit spotting spots in space and the remedy of havingness using this to clean up various areas or old auditing in his preclears he is to run this process until he is convinced of its workability and his ability to use it and until he can honestly classify it as his chief emergency assist tool now that the student can remedy havingness on preclears he is permitted to run consideration in the form of significances having preclears put significances into things only when the student has learned to audit significances and has had all the processes he is being taught as above run upon him is it particularly safe to engage upon much theory or upon more complex processes for the student turned loose to consider at will may otherwise begin to make nothing out of preclears and mountainous somethings out of processes at this point granting of beingness in the form given in the appendix of issue one of the handbook for scientologists should be run thoroughly by the student and on the student and he should hear the lrh lecture on that subject from the seventh clinical course for until this is remedied our student will have difficulty most likely with his fellow students by being 2himself the only one who can grant life he will also to some slight degree perhaps be at war with the subject and his instructors until this is remedied only when all of the above has been accomplished and with certainty should the student be embarked upon the use of intensive procedure as given be initiated into the mysteries of exteriorization and the general data of earlier scientology we must be very definite at this point that it would be far far better to turn out student who had learned the steps prior to studying the handbook itself as given above and graduate with those steps firmly in his grasp than to cover multitude of subjects and processes in scientology on which he had poor reality by the end of the course our course goal is to push the student of the hcahpa level as far forward as possible in his period of training into the handbook for scientologists and the group auditors handbook but to progress him in such way as to teach him nothing further than he has been taught until we are sure that he has excellent data workability and use reality on what he has been taught at that point this we learned in the advanced clinical courses was an absolute necessity in order to turn out auditors it is better for us to have auditors able to use well opening procedure of 8c than auditors who can use every technique we have poorly and ineffectually the training materials for the hcahpa course should include the professional course lectures by lrh made in july 1954 the student should clearly understand that training which has been done is not necessarily the retraining which is being and will be done he should understand that the exigencies of scientology were such as to turn out as good auditors as we could with what we had to hand and that we are just now stabilized in training and that we expect far more from him than we have ever expected from any auditor in the past sincerely l ron hubbard 15 july 1954 3the auditors code 1954 an auditor must observe the auditors code if he intends to produce beneficial results in preclear the auditors attention is very strongly called to sections 1 and 13 section 13 contains the difference between bad auditor and good auditor whereas the whole code is important section 13 is vitally important so much so that an auditor not understanding it will not produce good results in preclear section 13 means that an auditor must not change the process just because the preclears perception or communication is changing bad auditor will change the process every time the preclear starts to change this is the auditor obsessively duplicating the preclear good auditor will run process until it longer produces change in the preclear and only then will go to new process bad auditor can always be estimated by the number of processes he uses on preclear for any process in modern procedures consistently used will produce considerable change when the auditor changes process just because the preclear starts to change we call this auditor qandaing it is very bad manifestation 1do not evaluate for the preclear 2do not invalidate or correct the preclears data 3use the processes which improve the preclears case 4keep all appointments once made 5do not process preclear after 1000 pm 6do not process preclear who is improperly fed 7do not permit frequent change of auditors 8do not sympathize with the preclear 9never permit the preclear to end the session on his own independent decision 10never walk off from preclear during session 11never get angry with preclear 12always reduce every communication lag encountered by continued use of the same question or process 13always continue process as long as it produces change and longer 14be willing to grant beingness to the preclear 15never mix the processes of scientology with those of various other practices 16maintain twoway communication with the preclear 17never use scientology to obtain personal and unusual favors or unusual compliance from the preclear for the auditors own personal profit 418estimate the current case of your preclear with reality and do not process another imagined case 19do not explain justify or make excuses for any auditor mistakes whether real or imagined the auditors code was evolved from years of observing processing it is the technical code of scientology it contains the important errors which harm cases it could be called the moral code of scientology 5the code of honor one expects the code of honor to be closely and tightly followed an ethical code cannot be enforced any effort to enforce the code of honor would bring it into the level of moral code it cannot be enforced simply because it is way of life which can exist as way of life only as long as it is not enforced any other use but self determined use of the code of honor would as any scientologist could quickly see produce considerable deterioration in person therefore its use is luxury use and which is done solely on selfdetermined action providing one sees eye to eye with the code of honor 1never desert comrade in need in danger or in trouble 2never withdraw allegiance once granted 3never desert group to which you owe your support 4never disparage yourself or minimize your strength or power 5never need praise approval or sympathy 6never compromise with your own reality 7never permit your affinity to be alloyed 8do not give or receive communication unless you yourself desire it 9your selfdeterminism and your honor are more important than your immediate life 10your integrity to yourself is more important than your body 11never regret yesterday life is in you today and you make your tomorrow 12never fear to hurt another in just cause 13dont desire to be liked or admired 14be your own adviser keep your own counsel and select your own decisions 15be true to your own goals 6the code of scientologist the code of scientologist was evolved to safeguard scientologists in general and is subscribed to by leading scientologists the committee of examination and services of the hasi has accepted it as an enforceable code as scientologist i pledge myself to the code of scientology for the good of all 1to hear or speak word of disparagement to the press public or preclears concerning any of my fellow scientologists our professional organization or those whose names are closely connected to this science 2to use the best i know of scientology to the best of my ability to better my preclears groups and the world 3to refuse to accept for processing and to refuse to accept money from any preclear or group i feel i cannot honestly help 4to deter to the fullest extent of my power anyone misusing or degrading scientology to harmful ends 5to prevent the use of scientology in advertisements of other products 6to discourage the abuse of scientology in the press 7to employ scientology to the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics 8to render good processing sound training and good discipline to those students or peoples entrusted to my care 9to refuse to impart the personal secrets of my preclears 10to engage in unseemly disputes with the uninformed on the subject of my profession 11to completely refrain from discussing the case of another auditors preclear with that preclear or within his hearing 7a summary of scientology scientology is the science of knowing how to know answers it is wisdom in the tradition of ten thousand years of search in asia and western civilization it is the science of human affairs which treats the livingness and beingness of man and demonstrates to him pathway to greater freedom subjects which were consulted in the organization and development of scientology include the veda the tao by lao tzu the dharma and the discourses of gautama buddha the general knowingness about life extant in the lamasaries of the western hills of china the technologies and beliefs of various barbaric cultures the various materials of christianity including st luke the mathematical and technical methodologies of the early greeks romans and arabians the physical sciences including what is now known as nuclear physics including the various speculations of western philosophers such as kant nietzsche schopenhauer herbert spencer and dewey and the various technologies extant in the civilization of both the orient and occident in the first half of the twentieth century scientology is an organization of the pertinancies which are mutually held true by all men in all times and the development of technologies which demonstrate the existence of new phenomena not hitherto known which are useful in creating states of beingness considered more desirable by man there are two distinct divisions in scientology the first is philosophic the second is technical under the philosophic heading one discovers the ways and means of forming new ways of life and of evaluating or creating standards of livingness and beingness by this knowingness alone and without processing it should be understood clearly that new way of life could be created or an old way of life could be understood and better endured or altered under the technical division we have long series of developed processes which applied immediately and directly to life or an organism thereof produce changes at the will of the practitioner scientology concludes and demonstrates certain truths these truths might be considered to be the highest common denominators of existence itself the following summary of these truths has the aspect of precision observations rather than philosophic hazardings when treated as precision observations many results occur when regarded as philosophic opinions only more philosophy results considerations take rank over the mechanics of space energy and time by this it is meant that an idea or opinion is fundamentally superior to space energy and time or organizations of form since it is conceived that space energy and time are themselves broadly agreedupon considerations that so many minds agree brings about reality in the form of space energy and time these mechanics then of space energy and time are the product of agreedupon considerations mutually held by life the aspects of existence when viewed from the level of man however is reverse of the greater truth above for man works on the secondary opinion that mechanics are real and that his own personal considerations are less important than space energy and time this is an inversion these mechanics of space energy and time the forms objects and combinations thereof have taken such precedent in man that they have become more important than considerations as such and so his ability is overpowered and he is unable to act freely in the framework of mechanics man therefore has an inverted view whereas considerations such as those he daily makes are the actual source of space energy time and forms man is operating so as not to alter his basic considerations he therefore invalidates himself by supposing another determinism of space energy time and form although he is part of that which created these he gives them such strength and validity that his own considerations thereafter must fall subordinate to space energy time and form and so he cannot alter the universe in which he dwells 8the freedom of an individual depends upon that individuals freedom to alter his considerations of spacer energy time and forms of life and his roles in it if he cannot change his mind about these he is then fixed and enslaved amidst barriers such as those of the physical universe and barriers of his own creation man thus is seen to be enslaved by barriers of his own creation he creates these barriers himself or by agreeing with things which hold these barriers to be actual there is basic series of assumptions in processing which assumptions do not alter the philosophy of scientology the first of these assumptions is that man can have greater freedom the second is that so long as he remains relatively sane he desires greater freedom and the third assumption is that the auditor desires to deliver greater freedom to that person with whom he is working if these assumptions are not agreed upon and are not used then auditing degenerates into the observation of effect which is of course goalless soulless pursuit and is indeed pursuit which has degraded what is called modern science the goal of processing is to bring an individual into such thorough communication with the physical universe that he can regain the power and ability of his own considerations postulates scientologist is one who understands life his technical skill is devoted to the resolution of the problems of life the technical information of the scientologist includes the following which are list of usable or selfevident truths as revised from the earlier logics and axioms 1 life is basically static definition life static has mass motion wavelength location in space or in time it has the ability to postulate and to perceive 2 the static is capable of considerations postulates and opinions 3 space energy objects form and time are the result of considerations made andor agreed upon or not by the static and are perceived solely because the static considers that it can perceive them 4 space is viewpoint of dimension 5 energy consists of postulated particles in space 6 objects consist of grouped particles 7 time is basically postulate that space and particles will persist 8 the apparency of time is the change or position of particles in space 9 change is the primary manifestation of time 10 the highest purpose in the universe is the creation of an effect 11 the considerations resulting in conditions of existence are fourfold 9a asisness is the condition of immediate creation without persistence and is the condition of existence which exists at the moment of creation and the moment of destruction and is different from other considerations in that it does not contain survival b alterisness is the consideration which introduces change and therefore time and persistence into an asisness to obtain persistency c isness is an apparency of existence brought about by the continuous alteration of an asisness this is called when agreed upon reality d notisness is the effort to handle isness by reducing its condition through the use of force it is an apparency and cannot entirely vanquish an isness 12 the primary condition of any universe is that two spaces energies or objects must not occupy the same space when this condition is violated perfect duplicate the apparency of any universe or any part thereof is nulled 13 the cycle of action of the physical universe is create survive persist destroy 14 survival is accomplished by alterisness and notisness by which is gained the persistency known as time 15 creation is accomplished by the postulation of an asisness 16 complete destruction is accomplished by the postulation of the asisness of any existence and the parts thereof 17 the static having postulated asisness then practices alterisness and so achieves the apparency of isness and so obtains reality 18 the static in practising notisness brings about the persistence of unwanted existences and so brings about unreality which includes forgetfulness unconsciousness and other undesirable states 19 bringing the static to view asis any condition devaluates that condition 20 bringing the static to create perfect duplicate causes the vanishment of any existence or part thereof perfect duplicate is an additional creation of the object its energy and space in its own space in its own time using its own energy this violates the condition that two objects must not occupy the same space and causes vanishment of the object 21 understanding is composed of affinity reality and communication 22 the practice of notisness reduces understanding 1023 the static has the capability of total knowingness total knowingness would consist of total arc 24 total arc would bring about the vanishment of all mechanical conditions of existence 25 affinity is scale of attitude which falls away from the co existence of static through the interpositions of distance and energy to create identity down to close proximity but mystery by the practice of isness beingness and notisness refusal to be individuation progresses from the knowingness of complete identification down through the introduction of more and more distance and less and less duplication through lookingness emotingness effortingness thinkingness symbolizingness eatingness sexingness and so through to notknowingness mystery until the point of mystery is reached some communication is possible but even at mystery an attempt to communicate continues here we have in the case of an individual gradual falling away from the belief that one can assume complete affinity down to the conviction that all is complete mystery any individual is somewhere on this knowtomystery scale the original chart of human evaluation was the emotion section of this scale 26 reality is the agreedupon apparency of existence 27 an actuality can exist for one individually but when it is agreed with by others it can then be said to be reality the anatomy of reality is contained in isness which is composed of asisness and alterisness isness is an apparency it is not an actuality the actuality is asisness altered so as to obtain persistency unreality is the consequence and apparency of the practice of notisness 28 communication is the consideration and action of impelling an impulse or particle from sourcepoint across distance to receiptpoint with the intention of bringing into being at the receiptpoint duplication of that which emanated from the sourcepoint the formula of communication is cause distance effect with attention and duplication the component parts of communication are consideration intention attention cause sourcepoint distance effect receiptpoint duplication the velocity of the impulse or particle nothingness or somethingness noncommunication consists of barriers barriers consist of space interpositions such as walls and screens of fast moving particles and time communication by definition does not need to be two way when communication is returned the formula is repeated with the receiptpoint now becoming sourcepoint and the former sourcepoint now becoming receipt point 29 in order to cause an asisness to persist one must assign other authorship to the creation than his own otherwise his view of it would cause its vanishment any space energy form object individual or physical universe condition can exist only when an alteration has occurred of the original asisness so as to prevent casual view from vanishing it in other words anything which is persisting must contain lie so that the original consideration is not completely duplicated 1130 the general rule of auditing is that anything which is unwanted and yet persists must be thoroughly viewed at which time it will vanish if only partially viewed its intensity at least will decrease 31 goodness and badness beautifulness and ugliness are alike considerations and have other basis than opinion 32 anything which is not directly observed tends to persist 33 any asisness which is altered by notisness by force tends to persist 34 any isness when altered by force tends to persist 35 the ultimate truth is static static has mass meaning mobility wavelength time location in space space this has the technical name of basic truth 36 lie is second postulate statement or condition designed to mask primary postulate which is permitted to remain examples neither truth nor lie is motion or alteration of particle from one position to another lie is statement that particle having moved did not move or statement that particle not having moved did move the basic lie is that consideration which was made was not made or that it was different 37 when primary consideration is altered but still exists persistence is achieved for the altering consideration all persistence depends on the basic truth but the persistence is of the altering consideration for the basic truth has neither persistence nor impersistence 38 1 stupidity is the unknowness of consideration 2 mechanical definition stupidity is the unknowness of time place form and event 1 truth is the exact consideration 2 truth is the exact time place form and event thus we see that failure to discover truth brings about stupidity thus we see that the discovery of truth would bring about an asisness by actual experiment thus we see that an ultimate truth would have time place form or event thus then we perceive that we can achieve persistence only when we mask truth lying is an alteration of time place event or form lying becomes alterisness becomes stupidity 12the blackness of cases is an accumulation of the cases own or anothers lies anything which persists must avoid asisness thus anything to persist must contain lie 39 life poses problems for its own solution 40 any problem to be problem must contain lie if it were truth it would unmock an unsolvable problem would have the greatest persistence it would also contain the greatest number of altered facts to make problem one must introduce alterisness 41 that into which alterisness is introduced becomes problem 42 mest matter energy space time persists because it is problem it is problem because it contains alterisness 43 time is the primary source of untruth time states the untruth of consecutive considerations 44 theta the static has location in matter energy space or time it is capable of consideration 45 theta can consider itself to be placed at which moment it becomes placed and to that degree problem 46 theta can become problem by its considerations but then becomes mest problem is to some degree mest mest is problem 47 theta can resolve problems 48 life is game wherein theta as the static solves the problems of theta as mest 49 to solve any problem it is only necessary to become theta the solver rather than theta the problem 50 theta as mest must contain considerations which are lies the above is summary of states of being which can be used to create cause to persist or destroy having agreed to the mechanics and retaining the agreements the thetan can yet make innumerable postulates which by their contradiction and complexity create cause to persist and destroy human behavior 13intensive procedure outline for all cases who have any psychosomatic ills or who are neurotic or psychotic use only r216 anywhere from ten to hundred hours or until the person is longer ill neurotic or psychotic in the use of this procedure only two types of case are considered and the procedure is adapted to these two types the sole criteria of the case is whether or not it can be exteriorized this is promptly established by the use of arc straightwire when there is noticeable communication lag then route 1 is employed in this procedure when there is any noticeable communication lag route 2 is employed all sessions begin with the first three identical steps then if he has established that there is noticeable communication lag with arc straightwire the third step the auditor proceeds on route 1 however if noticeable communication lag exists when using arc straightwire the auditor having flattened this lag for the moment proceeds on route 2 the amount of occlusion on the case is not the test 1 get into twoway communication with the preclear 2 discuss the present time problem if any 3 get the preclear into session with arc straightwire 14route 1 r14 be three feet back of your head

1 steps are omitted and the case is entered into route 2 the first step of which is route 216 r216 run preclear through opening procedure of 8c parts b c each one until the physical communication lag

perception changes in altering communication lag there has been found by long practice that the only things which spin preclear are 1 too many auditors 2 not enough food and 3 processing between 1000

36 remedy of havingness 35 31 op by duplication 30 26 opening procedure 8c 18 25 elementary straightwire 18 11 twoway communication 10 80 19auditing commands for intensive procedure i get into twoway communication with the preclear communication is the consideration and action of impelling an impulse or particle from source point across distance to receipt point with the intention of bringing into being at the receipt point duplication of that which emanated from the source point the formula of communication is cause distance effect with attention and duplication the component parts of communication are consideration intention attention cause source point distance effect receipt point duplication the velocity of the impulse or particle nothingness or somethingness noncommunication consists of barriers barriers consist of space interpositions such as walls and screens of fast moving particles and time communication by definition does not need to be twoway when communication is returned the formula is repeated with the receipt point now becoming source point and the former source point now becoming receipt point one can be comfortable in communicating only when one is willing to be cause and is willing to be an effect as the distance factor in communication lessens or as mass increases in the particle one views the condensing manifestation of the know to sex scale and deterioration of the reality factor of the arc triangle to improve communication one must lessen mass increase velocity and increase the distance factor improve the quality of duplication remedy attention and bring about willingness on the part of cause to be an effect and on the part of effect to be cause to reach toward theoretical perfection in communication one should be willing to tolerate in any form any of the component parts of communication itself with the understanding that these include affinity and reality any sensory perceptic can be utilized in communication in establishing twoway communication communication lag is the interval of time intervening between posed question and the actual and precise answer to that question communication lag is manifestation of twoway communication whether the interval is filled with speech or silence the definition of communication lag still holds true an auditor must go by the rule that all questions posed must receive answers and therefore must be careful that he poses questions which can be answered by person in the condition of the preclear this is the most important step of any auditing session and its achievement by any perception with affinity and reality is specific goal of the auditor if preclear for any reason drags under processing it is because the auditor was not sure that the preclear was in communication with anything and was not in communication actually with the things to which the auditor directed his attention ii discuss the present time problem if any discussion of the present time problem is necessary each session so as to discover whether or not the preclear has had disturbance between sessions which has so fixed his attention that he is unable to give his complete presence to auditing iii get the preclear into session with arc straightwire arc straightwire is used to determine the communication lag of the preclear the steps of arc straightwire are can you remember time which seems real to you can you remember time when you were in communication with someone can you remember time when someone was in communication with you can you remember time when someone agreed with you can you remember time when you agreed with someone can you remember time when someone liked you can you remember time when you liked someone 20in actual practice to establish the communication lag it is only necessary to use the first question can you remember time which seems real to you to establish the lag and then use this question enough more times to bring the communication lag to constancy before proceeding on with further steps 21route 1 r14 be three feet back of your head the command be three feet back of your head should be given casually and if immediately obeyed the auditor with further discussion should then go on to r15 if there is any argument after this command is given or if the preclear cannot quite understand what is occurring and does not do so then it is indicated that the auditor switch routes and without further argument on the subject of exteriorization continue the session with r216 note thetan located in space is less than theta itself but thetan located is greater than homo sapiens r15 whatever the preclear happens to be looking at do not direct his attention to anything have him copy it one at time many many times then have him locate nothingness and copy it many many times without directing the preclears attention to anything ask him what he is looking at and then have him mock up copy of whatever he sees whether it is the room picture or blackness have him then make another copy of what he saw and another one and another one and another one and another one these copies are all the same as the original sight which he perceived when asked what he was looking at acquaint the preclear with the word copy by first asking him to make another one just like it and then for this phrase substitute the word copy when the preclear has made some two dozen copies have him do something anything with these copies so as to dispose of them they can be used to supplement havingness in which case he would be asked to push them all together and pull them in upon himself in any event do not leave him with these copies when the copies are disposed of have the preclear locate nothingness by saying can you find nothingness somewhere around you and then have him copy it by saying now make another one just like it make another one just like it now copy that first nothingness again and so forth until he has copied this couple of dozen times then have him dispose of these nothingnesses r16 have preclear hold the two upper back anchor points of the room for at least two minutes by the clock locate the two upper back corners of the room those behind the preclears body hold on to them and dont think do this for at least two minutes the preclear could be alternately asked to find two nothingnesses and hold on to them for two minutes without thinking the length of time is not mentioned to the preclear when this has been done do not neglect to tell the preclear to let go do not run the next step with him still holding on to the two back corners of the room r17 have preclear let go and find many places where he is not repeat the copying back anchor points and where he is not one after the other many times now find place where you are not repeat this command many times until any communication lag developed by the question has been rendered constant r18 have preclear discover many things one after another which he considers safe to look at 22this step is the basic theory behind viewpoint straightwire its intention is to render the preclear comfortable while looking at anything the keynote here is to use the goal of viewpoint straightwire directly one is interested in having him look at actual things in the mest universe from look down to sex on the know to sex scale one should include in particular turbulent masses and mysteries the most important part of this process and the one which should be stressed while others are neglected is to get the preclear to actually look at actual things then to have him look at actual emotions and finally to make very certain that he can be very comfortable in looking at all manner of efforts to do this one sends the preclear as thetan out into the world and has him actually find things which it is comfortable for him to look at in the bands of plain lookingness then emotion then effort one starts with the command what would it be all right for you to look at here in this room this is done with the bodys eyes closed the preclear is made to give as many things in the room which it would be all right for him to look at as is necessary to bring to constant any communication lag involved run the command now find something it is safe to look at outside this room when it is ascertained that in this exercise of discovering things which are all right for him to look at the preclear is wandering rather far afield with some confidence the auditor should tell him now go and find some emotional states which it would be all right for you to look at the preclear actually goes around to various parts of the world and sees people and animals in various states of emotion until he discovers he can be completely comfortable in viewing all the emotions on the tone scale in action apathy grief fear resentment anger antagonism boredom enthusiasm and serenity when this has been accomplished have the preclear find some efforts being engaged in by something anywhere which it would be comfortable for the preclear to view it may take some little time to discover something in the line of effort which he can really comfortably perceive he finds various efforts which he can view and the process should be continued until he can look very comfortably upon wild and turbulent motion the keynote of this process is to get the preclear completely certain that he can view anything in the universe with aplomb particularly emotion and effort the process can be continued if with less benefit with the remainder of the know to sex scale plus mystery know look emote effort think symbols eat sex mystery if in doubt the auditor should run the entire band from know to sex including mystery it should be clearly understood hy the auditor that the preclear does not simply think about these things or mock them up and view them the auditor wants the preclear exteriorized to go around various places in the actual physical universe and look at things and so build his tolerance on the physical universe it is important that it may be necessary to remedy the preclears havingness at intervals while this step is in progress r19 grand tour the commands of the grand tour are as follows be near earth be near the moon be near the sun be near the earth be near the moon be near the sun earth moon sun giving the last three commands many times each time the auditor must wait until the preclear signifies that he has completed the command the preclear is supposed to move near these bodies or simply be near them it does not matter which the grand tour continues with now find rock be inside of it be outside of it inside outside inside outside be in the center of the earth be outside of earth inside outside and back and forth until the preclear is able to do this very rapidly then the grand tour continues be near mars be at the center of mars outside of mars center outside now more down slowly toward the surface the preclear will probably question this for he has run into force screen or thinks he has all right then be on the surface of mars be above mars be on the surface be above mars move down to the surface of mars he is shifted into various positions in the vicinity of mars until he is entirely used to that planet when the preclear is entirely comfortable in the solar system by reason of running the grand tour do change of space with him first on all the locations where he has received auditing therapy or treatment of any kind here on earth next do all the key locations mentioned in what to audit history of man such as the entrance point of the mest universe the place where he made his first facsimile etc this is run in this fashion be at the place where you 23entered the mest universe be at the center of this room center of this room entrance point room and so forth until the entrance point is in present time the preclear should be made to run change of space on any area until that area is in present time originally it could be conceived that only the place where the preclear is is in present time that all other places are in past time to the degree that they are far from the preclear the object is to get all areas into present time caution change of space is never run with the command be here be there for when the preclear is there it has become here to him thus the actual designation in brief should be given each time important while running change of space or any part of the grand tour it may be necessary to remedy the havingness of the preclear this is done with the command put up eight anchor points as though they were the corners of cube around you now pull them in on you put up eight more pull them in on you any dopiness or increasing sadness on the part of the preclear or feeling of degradation comes about from lack of havingness in the grand tour it is more important for the preclear to locate and occupy exact locations in space and in objects than it is for him to examine the surrounding area r110 have preclear discover things he wouldnt mind occupying the same space with him agreement with the physical universe brings about the consideration on the part of the preclear that two things cannot occupy the same space it is this basic rule which keeps the physical universe stretched it is not however true that two things cannot occupy the same space and it is particularly untrue when the two things are an object and thetan since thetan can occupy the space any object is occupying the process is run with the question now tell something you wouldnt mind having occupy the same space you are in or give something you wouldnt mind having occupy your space the auditor must ascertain in any answer the preclear gives whether or not the preclear is absolutely certain he wouldnt object to this mutual occupation of the same space the preclear is made to get item after item until he recognizes high reality on it and then is made to occupy the same space as many things this is comparable to the step 1 processes of earlier sops where the preclear was made to be in many things when it has been clearly established that the preclear with absolute certainty is perfectly able to tolerate anything occupying his same space the auditor goes on to the next step r111 have preclear be problems and solutions in havingness ask the preclear what kind of problem can you be in havingness what kind of problem can you be in not havingness many times until he has isolated many problems for many people what kind of problem can others be to you in havingness what kind of problem can others be to you in not havingness after this has been well worked over advance into solutions with what kind of solution can you be to havingness what kind of solution can you be to not havingness and so forth it may be necessary to explain what is meant by havingness but it has been my experience this has not been so r112 have preclear mockup generators power plants and suns to give him energy on that gradient scale until he is totally convinced that he does not have to receive energy from an outside source complete remedy of havingness 24having run r110 and r111 the preclear should be able to get good mockups the main object of this step however it is done is to get the preclear to recognize that he himself creates the energy which he uses one of the methods of doing this is having him mockup generators of various sizes on gradient scale then larger generators then power plants lightning bolts and finally suns to give him energy at this step complete remedy of havingness should be accomplished if it is not adequately accomplished with this step the auditor should return to r110 do that and r111 and then repeat r112 r113 have preclear adjust genetic entity anchor points early in processing never direct the preclears attention to his body if he happens to be looking at his body this is all right but do not tell him to look at his body to begin r113 have preclear duplicate his body many many times and push the mockup into it have him pretend that by mockups he is exteriorizing from various other kinds of bodies have him interiorize and exteriorize many times from his present body then have him mockup the electronic structure of his body until he can see it easily now ask him do you see any gold balls in your head if he does not have him mockup gold balls until his heads golden balls appear now have him move any golden balls he finds which are out of position in his head until they are in the proper position when an anchor point golden ball will not move back into position have the preclear mockup many anchor points in that area which is to say remedy the bodys havingness in that area then and only then will it be found that the anchor point of the body itself will go back into that position caution never let the preclear mockup an anchor point of his own and put it into position in the body the ge can tolerate only its own anchor points ask the preclear can you find any more of these golden balls which are out of position and have him move them back into position or assemble them or remedy them until all the anchor points of the body are in excellent condition and in the proper position r114 have preclear create and destroy various kinds of thetan machines thetan is always equipped with various kinds of machinery remedying of havingness should make it very easy for him to dispense with or create new machinery he has machines which send him places machines which hide things and machines which zap him there are two types of machines those that mock things up and those which unmock things but there can be great variety of considerations in this machinery machines are actually machines he makes them up of tubes and other electronic equipment sometimes they look like huge teletypewriters simply duplicating machine many times will at last reduce it to nothingness thetan whose havingness has been remedied has relatively little difficulty with machinery as he is not keeping it around to supply him with energy he has set up machinery which will zap him when he gets into certain positions this in life as homo sapien is manifested by fear of selfinvalidation it comes from the machine since invalidation on the upper echelon is by force have him make machinery which actually works make the machinery work and destroy the machinery until he is totally confident of his ability to make and destroy any and all types of machines it is important that the machinery he mocks up actually works the process of making machine is to make postulate fit it into machine hide the machine and forget it the machine is keyed against something the thetan may think when the thetan thinks something the machine goes into action be very wary of destroying all of thetans machinery be also very wary of leaving thetan with mass as he feels very unhappy about being only thought r115 repair preclears ability to communicate by having him copy many scenes in the physical universe this step is actually the same step as r15 but it is run on wider basis the thetan is sent around to various parts of the world and the universe and asked to copy things he copies 25each one many times until he is satisfied that his copy is exact in all respects with the original in the physical universe when the thetan has accomplished this he will be able to make things with adequate density and mass now have preclear run each and every route 2 step until the auditor is convinced that he can do these easily and ably 26route 2 if the preclear had any appreciable communication lag as established in the iii step arc straightwire above all rl steps are omitted and the case is entered into route 2 the first step of which is r216 r216 run preclear through opening procedure of 8c parts b c each one until the physical communication lag stabilizes the auditor should make sure at first while running step that the spots he designates are highly generalized and are not small areas until the preclear can be directed to small and precise spots the entire modus operandi of opening procedure of 8c consists in having the preclear move his body around the room under the auditors direction until he finds he is in actual communication with many spots on the surface of things in the room b until he can select spots in the room and know that he is selecting them and can communicate with them and c select spots and move to them decide when to touch them and when to let go each one of these steps is done until the auditor is well assured that the preclear has communication lag the auditing commands are as follows do you see that chair go over to it and put your hand on it now look at that lamp now walk over to it an put your hand on it this is done with various objects without specifically designating spots of more precise nature than an object until the preclear is very certain that he is in good communication with these objects and the walls and other parts of the room the auditor can say anything he pleases or seemingly introduce any significance he wishes to so long as he hews very closely to the actual thing in this method which makes it work which is to say perceiving the physical universe and making contact with it part has been enlarged by the auditors selecting exact spots do you see that black mark on the left arm of that chair all right go over to it and put your finger on it now take your finger off it do you see the lower bolt on that light switch all right go over to it and put your finger on it take your finger off it and so forth until the preclear has uniform perception of any and all objects in the room including the walls the floor and the ceiling this step can be kept up for long time it has an infinity of variations but it is not the variations which work it is the making and breaking of communication with the actual designated spots if at any time there is any doubt about the preclears case do this step part until satisfied that communication is good case which will not obey opening procedure 8c orders will always pervert or alter commands to be performed with less supervision than perception of his body part b has these auditing commands find spot in this room further designation is necessary for this spot spotting procedure gives the preclear determinism of selection when the preclear has done so the auditor says go over to it and put your finger on it when the preclear has done this the auditor says now let go of it it must be emphasized that the preclear is not to act upon command until the command is given and must not let go until told to let go the preclear is permitted to select spots until such time as all communication lag is flat and until he is freely selecting spots on the walls objects chairs etc with specialization whatsoever which means that his perception of the room has become uniform many things turn up in running this procedure such as the fact that the preclear cannot look at walls etc part c of this procedure is run with these auditing commands find spot in the room make up your mind when you are going to touch it and then touch it make up your mind when you are going to let go of it and let go variation of this process is to have the 27preclear make up his mind about spot and then have him change his mind and select another spot the trouble with most cases and the trouble with any case which is hung up and is not progressing is that an insufficient quantity of opening procedure 8c has been used by the auditor this has been found to be an invariable rule preclears will pretend to run commands of subjective nature but not run them at all in other words the auditor is saying do one thing and the preclear is doing quite another thus the process is not actually being used on the preclear the difficulty in this case is specific difficulty in communication where the preclear cannot duplicate but more important than that any preclear whose case is hanging up is out of touch with reality and the environment to such an extent that he has begun to do processes on mockups rather than on the actual physical universe it will be discovered that doing processes on mockups such as finding spots in them finding distances to them and so forth is productive of gain and even negative gain only processes which directly address the physical universe are found to raise the tone of the preclear he has to come up to full tolerance of it before he can get out of it thus any case bogging down somewhere in more intricate procedures can be relieved and brought into present time by 8c the only caution on the part of the auditor is that he must be very precise about giving his orders and must insist on the preclear being very certain that he is actually seeing spots and touching them and inhibiting the preclear from executing the commands before they are given r217 opening procedure by duplication until preclear feels good about it opening procedure by duplication is begun only after the preclear has some reality on his environment until the preclears reality on his environment is good opening procedure by duplication should not be done for the preclear only turns on an unreality circuit and goes through it mechanically the first part of opening procedure by duplication is to get the preclear to examine communicate with and own somewhat on the order of opening procedure of 8c two dissimilar objects these objects are then placed several feet apart and at level so that the preclear can pick them up without bending over but so that he has to walk between them once the auditor is entirely satisfied that the preclear has reality on these objects and can own them he then begins opening procedure by duplication with the following commands supposing that one of the objects was book and the other was an ash tray go over to the book look at it pick it up what is its color at this point the preclear must give an answer what is its temperature here the preclear must answer again put it down in exactly the same place when the preclear has executed go over to the ash tray look at it pick it up what is its color the preclear says his answer what is its temperature the preclear says his answer put it down exactly in the same place when the preclear has executed go over to the book and the same words and the same formula are used over and over again until the preclear has had sufficient number of hours of opening procedure by duplication to enable him to do it without communication lag without protest without apathy but only cheerfulness each time seeing the items newly this is process which is done by the hour the process is better when done consecutively for so many hours rather than done an hour apiece each day for several days this procedure is the first step of procedure 30 r218 have preclear spot spots in space until he can do it easily meanwhile remedying his havingness as briefly as spotting spots in space and remedying havingness can be stated this is one of the key processes of scientology and has an infinity of variations it is actually two processes stemming from one while the preclear is still interiorized spotting spots and remedying havingness is done by the preclear remaining where he is and simply indicating by pointing where the spot is which he is designating when it is done with the preclear exteriorized it becomes change of space this process has an infinity of uses and is one of the best processes in rendering an assist here in intensive procedure we use it in its simplest 28form the auditor says spot spot in the space of this room the preclear does so the auditor ascertains whether or not the spot has color mass or if it is simply location in space spot should be simply location in space it should not have color or mass the preclear is asked to located several such spots in the room it is important that he walk over to them and that he put his finger on them after he has done this for very short time it will be discovered that his havingness has decrease markedly the auditor has him mock up something which is acceptable to him and has him pull it in on his body until any queasiness or physical upset is remedied as soon as this is accomplished the auditor has him spot more spots in the space of the room r219 have preclear spot spots in room and move body into them and move body out into new spots only when the preclear can do r218 comfortably and actually locate locations independent of the objects in the room itself does the auditor go on to the next phase of this process which is locate spot in the room which you can then move into your body when the preclear has done so the auditor says move your body over the spot when the preclear has done this move your body off that spot it will he discovered that the preclear may find that the spot moves along with his body one simply wants the location in space and this of course does not move only the body moves this is done many times until the preclear is adept at moving his body over these spots and moving his body off of them it is understood of course that the location simply moves on into the body as the body is moved over it and that the location moves out of the body as the body is moved away from it in other words the location is stable the body is moving this is done until the preclear is absolutely sure that it is he who is moving his body over such spots it may be necessary to remedy havingness while this step is being done the third part of this step is done as follows spot spot in the space of this room now move your body around it fix your body in that position now change your mind about staying there and without the preclear moving off the spot pick out new spot now move your body around the new spot this process has many variations one can have preclear move chronic somatic around such spots fix it there and unfix it one can have preclear find spot and then appear there and then disappear there find new spot and appear there and disappear there the main thing is to have the preclear spot spots and move his body around them and then move his body off the spot r220 use of problems and solutions the use of problems and solutions is the second step for procedure 30 and includes the steps already given in r111 these steps come after the steps as given below the auditor asks the preclear what kind of problem could you be to your mother and when the preclear has found one all right can you be that problem and when the preclear has become it can you see your mother figuring about it and whether the preclear can or not give another problem you could be to your mother can you be that problem etc until the communication lag is flattened then one asks the same question about father and about other people in the preclears life asking the preclear each time for the problem then asking him to be the problem and then asking if it makes other people worry and think about it finally one asks now what kind of problem can you be to preclears name and when this has finally been flattened to communication lag constant one can assume that he has more or less handled this situation for the moment and he uses exactly the same process on solutions the same wording as above is used with the exception that solution is substituted for problem when the preclear cannot be problem the auditor should find some things that the preclear can be with great certainty have the preclear be those things then have the preclear be problem when processing an auditor have him be an auditor and preclear alternately physically assuming the proper position for each until all auditing has been run out and the preclear is longer waiting to find out what is going to happen the auditor should keep in mind the fact that preclear can be nosolution also that the preclear can be noproblem also that the preclear can be solution that needs problems many various and strange 29manifestations take place but this process very severely uses only the above commands the process can be continued and should be into the commands of r111 which take up problems in havingness it may occur if the preclear is mystic or is interested in the occult that he offers peculiar problem in problems such preclear may be looking for the solution to all problems assuming that only one solution is possible for all problems if he were to discover this solution he would of course find himself completely out of problems thus his havingness in terms of problems would be so enormously reduced that he would discover himself without any interest of any kind but even if the preclear is not in this category the process which is given in this paragraph is definitely indicated in the field of problems actually it is combination of running significances and handling problems and it is useful for any state of case except of course those upon whom only opening procedure of 8c may be run the complete remedy of problems of course takes place when the preclear is convinced that he can create problems at will until he is so convinced he is going to hold on to old problems the way to convince him that he can create problems is to have him pick out or pick up an object have him examine this object until he is sure it is real then ask him the question what problems could this object be to you have him begin to name off various problems it will be discovered at first as always in the handling of significances that he begins to drain the object itself of the problems which are inherent in the object and then will eventually begin to invent problems the problem should be run until the preclear is convinced that he can create problems at will many objects can be used rather than just one if it is discovered that the preclears attention is fixing too strongly upon the object r221 granting of beingness granting of beingness life to something the preclear is as well as he can grant life to things an action which involves the creation of energy the basic granting of beingness is the thetan duplicating himself as another thinking being in the mechanics of the granting of beingness we have orientation point and the symbol an orientation point is that point in relation to which others have location it is also that point from which the space containing the locations is being created in the orientation point we have our basic definition of space space is viewpoint of dimension dependent upon the orientation for its location and to some degree for its life is the symbol symbol is an object which has mass meaning and mobility symbol locates itself if it does so at all by the orientation point it regards the orientation point as continual source point and itself as continual effect point of that source point so long as one can create life he more or less considers himself an orientation point and as soons he is convinced he cannot create life in any degree he becomes to that degree symbol the granting of beingness is complexity of the communication formula in that we have broadly added space rather than linear distance and have introduced the idea of continuing orientation point and continuing symbol the velocity of the communication formula is expanded to continuing velocities and we have entered directly from the communication formula into our first understanding of time and therefore survival its the symbol which is surviving in minute gradients of time and the orientation point which is timeless but which determines the time frame of that space as practical example most preclears consider the childhood home an orientation point and themselves symbol of that orientation point where preclear has lost too many orientation points successively he begins to consider himself symbol of symbol the concept in some religions of god being everywhere and every place at the same time is direct and overt effort to loose the worshipper by taking from him finite position for his orientation point the processing of the granting of beingness is more complex and therefore less effective than using the communication formula in its simpler form it is well within the attention of an auditor and the problems involving it should to some degree be resolved with the preclear the preclear has many times sought to give life to something such as dying ally or pet or enterprise and has failed to bring it to life resultingly he has become convinced that he cannot grant life but senior to this granting of life is the mechanical matter of orientation point and symbol multitude of processes can be applied with profit to this subject one of the simplest would be to demand of the preclear 30where are you from and then continue to repeat this question on and on and on matter what answer the preclear gave until the preclear replies that he is from right where he is at which time the auditor changes the question to where is that and to any answer the preclear gives again asks where is that until the preclear ceases to locate himself by his environment and then ceases to locate himself by his body and by himself and comes to the realization that he is exactly where he says he is and other place the otherdeterminism to selfdeterminism course is marked by the fact that he is first nowhere then where old orientation points and present locations tell him where he is and then where his body tells him where he is and then where he seems to be because he can see certain things to the final realization that he is where he is by postulate and by that alone this will exteriorize preclear if continued long enough all other processes are only covert level of this process he can be made to spot spots which he has considered orientation points such as the childhood home and then remedy havingness he can be asked why the environment is there and for every answer simply ask again why what he is looking at is there or this can be run as the third step of procedure 30 which is what it is as the third step of procedure 30 granting of beingness is run in this fashion who would grant beingness to and in the blank may be placed psychosomatics letters cats dogs kings and coal heavers or anything the auditor might think of each time until the preclear replies without communication lag the key question would be who would it be all right to have grant some beingness the person the preclear will name will be the person the preclear has most recently depended upon thoroughly as symbol in lieu of an orientation point this is continued with what else would it be all right for the person he has named to grant beingness to with this last question we are resolving the only one complex the preclear has gotten into state ordinarily where he is the only one who can grant beingness but he has so long restrained other people from granting life to things that he himself will longer grant any life to things the preclear is engaged in some kind of giddy contest whereby nobody else can grant beingness to things but he can grant beingness to them the resolution of this will mean considerable increase in case there is an additional question who are you eating for and who are you doing other things for item by item which processed continuously will eventually bring the preclear into certain changes of consideration this last technique is part of one called swizzlestick an additional process is to simply have the preclear say to himself i am here and each time establish for himself the fact that he is this is done over and over without further variation part of the granting of beingness is having symbols out there moving around for you an individual who cannot be an orientation point and who cannot therefore grant beingness does not have symbols thus he cannot predict objects even in the immediate environment variation is to have him look at various objects and the walls of the room and predict that they will be there in ten seconds then to have him count off the ten seconds and find out whether or not they are there r222 spanning attention scarcity of attention is manifested on gradient scale from the top to the bottom on the chart of human evaluation an individual has so many times excused his failure to direct attention when it was required by saying that he had not enough attention that eventually things which sought to seize his attention distract him this brings on certain franticness scarcity of attention is the reason why preclear cannot look at past engrams and present time at the same time and be in present time his attention gets caught or trapped in the past the scarcity of attention can be directly remedied by having the preclear put his attention on one object until it is thoroughly real to him then on another object until it is thoroughly real to him and then put his attention on both objects until they are thoroughly real to him then his attention on third object until it is thoroughly real to him and then his attention on all three objects until they are completely real to him the caution which must be taken is that one does not fixate his attention on the objects but keeps him answering questions concerning the objects in all attention processes an hypnotic condition takes place only when the preclear is unable to comment or respond while his attention is closely fixed upon one object the body gives the thetan scarcity of attention and therefore sort of hypnotic trance by having only one direction of attention ie through the eyes thetan seeing on 360 degree periphery when interiorizing into the head finds himself looking in only one direction this is sufficient to 31fixate him exteriorization by attention is possible simply by directing the preclears attention to wider and wider spheres the technique spanning of attention is done with the following commands the auditor put match down in front of the preclear now look at that match is it real to you the auditor puts down another match close to the first match now look at the second match is it real to you and then works with such question until both the first and second match are real the auditor then has him put his attention on both matches at once to establish whether or not they are both real at once then he has him look at the first match the second match and then both matches in that order until the preclear can see both matches as entirely real third match is now put down the auditor saying now put your attention on this third match is it real to you when reality on the third match is established the auditor has the preclear see the first two matches at once then the second and third matches at once until these two groups as groups are real and then has the preclear look at all three matches until they are real with this process the preclears attention is not permitted to linger on any one object for more than few seconds continuous staring at the object will not produce any further result than boil off this process is continued until the preclear can do this see with entire reality ten matches simultaneously laid out in front of him now the auditor begins by taking an object in the room such as chair has the preclear examine that until it is entirely real then takes another chair in the room and establishes its reality with the preclear then he works on the first and second chairs and on both until the preclear can see both chairs with complete reality then third chair is picked out and reality is established on the first and second chair and the second and third chair and then on all three chairs this is done until all the objects in the room are included in the reality of the preclear at which time he will very probably be exteriorized r223 attention by duplication two similar objects preferably black and not shiny are placed before the preclear in such way that they are more or less even with his level gaze and making with each other and the preclears space 90 degree angle so that the preclear has to turn at least 45 degrees out of his normal line of sight in order to put his attention on either one of them the preclears attention is directed to object one on the right and then is asked to put his attention on object two on the left put your attention on the right hand object put your attention on the left hand object these two commands are then given consecutively many many times each time the auditor waiting for the preclears execution of the command before giving the next command the process can be done with only these two commands for the preclear is not asked to fix his attention on either object he is only asked to look at these two objects if there is any question about the preclears general reality this should be remedied by opening procedure of 8c further the preclear prior to the process matter what his reality may be should be put into communication with the two objects this process is often found to be more workable by having the preclear describe the objects he is looking at each time he looks at them this keeps the preclear outflowing and where the preclear begins to demonstrate hypnotic manifestations the step of making him describe each object should be used the commands would be now put your attention on object one the preclear executes tell about it the preclear does so now put your attention on object two the preclear does so tell about it put your attention on object one and so forth over and over this process should be run as long as it produces perception changes in the preclear attention by duplication can be applied to any sense perception here we have the example of it applied to sight this step should also apply to attention by duplication by hearing if there is noise in the room preferably monotonous one such as motor or fan or even record of monotonous voice but not the radio the auditor commands the preclear listen to that naming the source of sound and when the preclear has done so for moment now put your attention on the silence present in the room now on the again naming the source of sound now on the silence back and forth for considerable length of time second step both in attention by duplication for sight and attention by duplication for hearing is accomplished by adding in the commands now take your attention off before the next command to put his attention on something is given in this wise the commands would be for 32attention by sight put your attention on object one and when the preclear has complied now take your attention off of object one and the preclear has complied now put your attention on object two and when the preclear has complied now take your attention off of object two and so on back and forth between the two objects an additional step can be run having the preclear decide when to take his attention off the objects this is similar to the pattern of opening procedure of 8c with the addition that it is run by monotonous duplication of the process and the objects r224 exteriorization by distance extroverted and introverted alternately the simplest form of exteriorization by distance is accomplished simply by having the preclear sit still and spot various objects in the room without calling his attention to any distance involved this would be done with this one command and with further qualification as to what the preclear puts his attention on find another spot in this room this can be run for hours with benefit all other exteriorization by distance processes are simply complications of this basic process the next most used exteriorization by distance process uses three spots in the room on these commands find three spots in your body and when the preclear signifies that he has now find three spots in the room and when the preclear signifies that he has find three spots in your body and when the preclear signifies that he has now find three spots in the room this is done over and over without any change of command this process is commonly run on groups spotting one spot at time not designating whether it is in space or on objects may also be run on groups as above when preclears reality on exteriorization by distance is very poor the simpler forms of this process as above should be used the commands of exteriorization by distance are as follows what distance could you tolerate to your right foot what distance could you tolerate to your left foot what distance could you tolerate to your genitals what distance could you tolerate to your stomach what distance could you tolerate to your rectum what distance could you tolerate to your back what distance could you tolerate to your right hand what distance could you tolerate to your left hand what distance could you tolerate to your right eye what distance could you tolerate to your left eye what distance could you tolerate to your mouth and then consecutively what distance could your right foot tolerate to thetan what distance could your left foot tolerate to thetan what distance could your stomach tolerate to thetan what distance could your genitals tolerate to thetan what distance could your rectum tolerate to thetan what distance could your right hand tolerate to thetan what distance could your left hand tolerate to thetan what distance could your right eye tolerate to thetan what distance could your left eye tolerate to thetan what distance could your mouth tolerate to thetan what distance could your back tolerate to thetan this complete series on the body is called the introverted part of the process and is immediately followed by these commands what distance could you tolerate to the front wall what distance could you tolerate to the right wall what distance could you tolerate to the left wall what distance could you tolerate to the back wall what distance could you tolerate to the floor what distance could you tolerate to the ceiling what distance could you tolerate to your chair and this is followed by what distance could the front wall tolerate to thetan what distance could the right wall tolerate to thetan what distance could the left wall tolerate to thetan what distance could the back wall tolerate to thetan what distance could the floor tolerate to thetan what distance could the ceiling tolerate to thetan what distance could your chair tolerate to thetan and this is followed by the first of the series on the body what distance could you tolerate to your right foot and so forth around and around on these commands important the preclear must not be permitted to use mock ups in the matter of what distance the parts of the body or the room could tolerate to thetan the auditor wants the actual parts of the body right where they are and their tolerance to the thetan in each case and he wants the parts of the room right 33where they are and their distance to the thetan this process is not to be done by mockups but if mockups appear in the matter of what distance the thetan can tolerate to the parts of the body or room they are allowable but are not encouraged if mockups are used in the matter of distance of the objects to the thetan the reality of the preclear will decrease markedly the preclear is not being exteriorized from mockups he is being exteriorized from actual physical universe objects r225 viewpoint and viewpoint arc straightwire viewpoint and viewpoint arc straightwire in brief form has the following commands give some things which it would be comfortable for you to look at and when the communication lag on this is flattened give some emotions it would be all right for you to look at give some efforts it would be all right for you to look at these are the chief concerns of the auditor in this process the auditor must make sure that the preclear is absolutely certain he is comfortable in viewing such objects the process fails when the auditor is incapable of pressing the preclear until this certainty is attained viewpoint arc straightwire then follows who would it be all right for you to like and as in any of these questions when the communication lag has been fattened by repeated use of the first question who would it be all right for you to agree with who would it be all right for you to communicate with who would it be all right to have like you who would it be all right to have agree with you who would it be all right to have communicate with you the basic formula and goal of this process is to increase the preclears ability to tolerate views the auditor is trying to do two things he is trying to improve the tolerance and comfort of the preclear in viewing and experiencing knowingness lookingness emotingness effortingness thinkingness symbolizingness eatingness sexingness and mystery r226 remedy of laughter the earliest known psychotherapy consisted of getting patient to laugh laughter is rejection preclear being continually inflowed upon by the physical universe at length may find it difficult to reject anything getting him to reject something could be made an auditing goal the best manifestation of this is laughter laughter includes both surprise and rejection the individual is surprised into rejecting in order to laugh he must have laid aside some of his ability to predict an individual who is serious has laid aside so much of his ability to predict that he now cannot be surprised into rejection the anatomy of mystery consists of in this order unpredictability confusion and chaos covered up because it cannot be tolerated therefore this is also the anatomy of problems problems always begin with an unpredictability deteriorate into confusion and then if still unsolved become mystery which is massed confusion it will be observed that as person falls further and further away from the ability to laugh he becomes more and more confused until at last he sees points in any jokes he sees only embarrassment when confronted by laughter and the whole action of laughter itself escapes him the ability to laugh is rehabilitated in general by scientology as it advances the ability of the preclear to know which is to say predict the remedy of laughter could be entered simply by having the individual predict that wall would be there in ten seconds count off ten seconds on his watch and then ascertain with thoroughness that the wall is still there to establish if the wall is there then to predict that it will be there in ten seconds then to count off ten seconds on his watch and ascertain if the wall is still there by thus bringing solid objects into the realm of prediction an individual at length comes to point where he can predict very slowly moving objects cheap train and track could be set up for this purpose and the preclear could be led to predict with accuracy the position of engines on the small circular track however the preclear can be made to watch automobiles on the street process which serves just as well with such equipment the preclear would then be led to predict the positions of his own body first by predicting that it was going to be in certain spot then 34moving it there and seeing whether or not it had arrived at that spot he would then be brought to swing his arm in circle predict that it would swing faster and swing it faster and thus being led to predict the motion of his body with these simplicities he could be exercised in making his body go tense and go limp by his command until he was thoroughly certain that he could both predict the tension or relaxation by doing it then he could be led to predict the positions of people walking on the street until he felt some security in predicting without exercising physical control by thus remedying his ability to predict one brings the preclear up into tolerance of motion he is then led to put his attention on one moving object then on two moving objects at once and so forth using the processes of spanning attention on moving objects direct mockup process can be applied to the remedy of laughter by having the preclear mock up alternately himself and others laughing or by having him mock up an acceptable level of amusement and remedy his havingness with it until he can have people laughing very broadly in his mockups the preclear can also be made simply to stand up and start laughing he at first will demand to have something to laugh at but at length will be able to laugh without reason the goal of the process is contained in the last line to regain the ability to laugh without reason in this intensive procedure only two steps are employed to remedy laughter the first consists of these commands be completely certain that the wall is there and when the preclear has become with considerable conversation completely certain that the wall is there touching it pushing against it and so forth the auditor then says sit down take this your watch now predict that the wall will be there ten seconds from now have you done so all right wait ten seconds by your watch and when this is done is the wall still there and when the preclear has answered now make absolutely certain the wall is there and the preclear does so by touching it pushing at it kicking it now make very sure that the wall is there and when the preclear very vigorously has done so now predict that it will be there in ten seconds and when the preclear has done so the remainder of the commands are given and this is repeated over and over then the second part of intensive procedures process of laughter but only after the preclear has experienced considerable relief and is absolutely sure that he can predict that all parts of the room will be there not only in ten seconds but in an hour although such timing is used and only ten seconds of time is employed start laughing and matter what the preclear says thereafter or what arguments he advances or how many things he asks about or how many reasons he wants or gives the auditor merely says adding words that urge the preclear start laughing and when the preclear at length does so matter how half heartedly keep on laughing the two commands which are used in addition to words necessary to urge the preclear without giving the preclear any reason whatsoever are start laughing and keep on laughing this process is then done until the preclear can actually enjoy laugh without any reason whatsoever without believing that laughing without reason is insane without feeling selfconscious about laughing and without needing any boost from the auditor the auditor in this second part need take pains to agree with the preclear by laughing he need not chuckle or smile nor need he even particularly act seriously his laughter is not needed or used in the process an auditor can be as serious as he pleases and indeed if he wishes to do so can be even more serious than is usual when running this second step of r226 in earlier scientology it was learned that serious preclears would often recover considerable ground simply when they were made to do things without any reason whatsoever this achievement is much greater when they are made to laugh without any reason r227 resolve dangerousness of environment resolving the dangerousness of the environment could be done in many ways but by experience it should not be done by deleting various things which could be dangerous by the use of mockups if there is any trouble with the preclear it is that the environment is insufficiently dangerous and so does not produce sufficient amusement the physical body was built in the time when escapes from death by wild animals by falling were routine it was built in an operating climate of great hazard over period of many millions of years it requires about three escapes from sudden death daily to stay in present time many of the preclears being audited in scientology are being audited simply to experience new adventure 35however it can be said with some truth and was said in excalibur in 1938 that man is as sane as he is dangerous to the environment what occurs is that the environment becomes dangerous to the man and the man cannot be dangerous to the environment and his answer to this is immobility and general deterioration the basic remedy of this condition consists of getting living thing pet child sick person to reach out towards ones hand at that moment without moving so suddenly that the living being will be startled the person doing the process would withdraw his hand the auditor would then advance again to be driven away over and over and it would be observed that the living being would strike out with more and more enthusiasm and would recover considerable sanity this of course is done on gradient scale while an auditor should know and use this basic process in assists or when processing animals very small children or people who are extremely ill the remedy which is used in intensive procedure is cause and effect parts of the body can be used in this process the whole body or the thetan but the auditor must be specific about what he is addressing the basic commands are what are you willing to cause and when the preclear has answered this and the communication lag on the question has been fattened what are you willing to be the effect of and when the communication lag has been flattened by the repeated use of this question what are you willing to cause and so forth using just these commands one can additionally apply this particularly when the preclear has psychosomatic illness to limb or organ of the body as an assist but in intensive procedure the most permissive of these questions as given is used r228 nothing something nothing something is run by asking what distance wouldnt you mind making nothing of and when there is communication lag on this what distance wouldnt you mind making something of making longer the process is completed by making certain the preclear can tolerate many nothingnesses and many somethingnesses with complete comfort if the preclear found r224 unreal or did it peculiarly use r228 immediately then r110 then r224 the goal of this process is the toleration of nothingnesses and somethingnesses by the thetan r229 time tolerance this uses the velocity factor of the communication formula ask the preclear now much time can you tolerate between yourself and the door the window etc then make him walk it out in the interval of time he named have him do this until without coaching he can tolerate very very slow velocity or very fast one b then use this command start lying about your past and when he finally does keep on lying about your past until he can lie with complete comfort about all phases of his past c then use this what is the significance of your past and keep on asking the question matter what the preclear says until his past is not important then what is the significance of your future or goals if that communicates better what are your goals in your future and keep on asking it until the preclear feels free to live an unplanned life note the present time problem is best resolved by remedying the havingness of the preclear on the subject or people involved in the problem have him mock these up in acceptable form and accept many then in rejectable form and reject many until his acceptance level and rejection level are the same r230 position by security sop 8d this is used in intensive procedure for only two purposes to resolve present time association with person present time problem or to resolve body recruitment of the thetan by some part of the body such as teeth eyes stomach etc in the matter of present time problem using the person involved with the preclears name where would be safe and where would find you safe as the sole commands actually having the preclear spot the locations in the mest universe in the matter of fixation on teeth etc where would be 36safe where would find you safe body recruitment is suspected whenever preclear cannot exteriorize after few hours of processing the part of the body he is most anxious about is then run as responsible for dragging in the thetan another method of running this problem is variation of description processing the commands are now close does your seem to you now this is the only command employed body parts such as head genitals teeth or the body itself are used in the place of the blank r231 beingness processing the cardinal rule where mental or physical compulsions are concerned follows whatever the thetan is doing obsessively or compulsively have him do it on selfdetermined basis this applies to machines habits twitches etc there is gradient scale of exteriorization which could be described as follows first the thetan without contact with universe then thetan in full contact with universe then thetan in contact with part of universe who considers the remainder of the universe barred to him then thetan in universe without any contact with any part of the universe then thetan unknowingly in contact with large part of universe the first condition would be true static the last condition is called colloquially in scientology buttered all over the universe as it is with universe such as the physical universe so it is with physical bodies the thetan who has already gone through the cycle on the universe itself may be in contact with physical body in the same order at first he would be without association with physical body then with occasional contact with bodies then with fixed contact on one body but exteriorized then interiorized into body but easy to exteriorize then in contact with and interiorized into body but withdrawn from the various parts of the body and then obsessively buttered all through the body then obsessively and unknowingly drawn down to some small portion of the body and so forth this is the gradient scale which includes inversion and then inversion of the inversion the auditor will discover preclears are very variable in the matter of exteriorization some preclears even when they have dark field exteriorize rather easily others after great deal of work are still found to be difficult to exteriorize the matter of exteriorization is the matter of which level of inversion the preclear is in one of the more difficult levels to work is so inverted that he thinks that thetan is running him in other words here is thetan functioning in body and actually running it through various covert communication lines who yet believes he is body to such an extent that he considers himself or any life around him to be some other being when discussing the matter of thetan this preclear is likely to tell the auditor im over there this is about the only signal the auditor gets from such case which tells him that the preclear is being body and considers that he is being run by another thetan very often an auditor will exteriorize such person he thinks only to have the preclear say im over there thetan who knows he is thetan is always here and never there the diagnostic manifestation however which the auditor first encounters in any case where he is having difficulty with exteriorization is contained in beingness those on lower levels of inversion are having great deal of difficulty being anything such people are below the level of being body therefore it would be far upscale for this person to be able to be body with certainty person who cannot exteriorize easily must be brought up to the level where he can be body before he can then be exteriorized from the body in other words an auditor exteriorizing anyone has to follow such scale as beingness processing oddly enough beingness processing is an excellent exteriorization tool and i say oddly enough because in one sense beingness processing is an alterisness process when case is extremely inverted it is necessary to get the case up to level where it can identify itself with something beingness is essentially an identification of self with an object 37the commands used in beingness processing should begin with the environment and the vicinity of the preclear one has the preclear look around the auditing room and select an object let us say chair the auditor does this by saying look around the room and discover some object which you dont mind being present remember always that when an auditor asks question that question has to be answered by the preclear it is the auditors bad luck if he asks question which introduces an enormously long communication lag in the preclear the preclear must still answer the question at this question then discover something you dont mind being present it is necessary that the preclear actually locate something even if dust mote the auditor then asks the preclear to locate something else you dont mind being present and when all communication lag is gone from this level of process the auditor then picks out an object which the preclear was comfortable about and says now see this chair here all right what else wouldnt you mind this chair being and then as the preclear answers this and using this same object the auditor continues to ask the same question until all communication lag is gone from the question what else wouldnt you mind this chair being the auditor then selects other objects in the area and uses the same question on them what wouldnt you mind this couch being what else wouldnt you mind this couch being when the preclear is perfectly willing to have anything in the room be large number of things including the walls the ceiling and the floor the auditor asks now what wouldnt you mind your body being and whatever the preclear answers and now what else wouldnt you mind your body being finally when the preclear is able to do all the foregoing in beingness processing the auditor commands him now lets find something you wouldnt mind being and as this is the question for which the auditor has been working he uses this question for very long period of time asking over and over what else wouldnt you mind being it will be discovered in working beingness processing that the entire mechanism of winning valences occurs here for instance is thetan who is caught in theta trap after while he will consider that the trap itself is surviving which is to say that the motions of the trap have themselves set the thetan into motion so that he now thinks of himself totally as trap this is how anybody gets to be anything by getting set into motion by the vibrations in his vicinity at first the thetan is willing to be the trap but after while if asked to be the trap and then asked to be the thetan and this is not process the most terrible apathy will be found to intervene between the two steps the thetan while fairly comfortable being the trap on beginning to recover some of his own identity will be found to be at point on the tone scale so low as to contain an unbearable and agonizing apathy beingness processing recovers the various valences which the thetan is trying to avoid as practical example in life we find housewife who is incapable of keeping house although intelligent and able in most things we find she cannot sweep make beds or even shop for the house we discover that her mother was an excellent housekeeper an excellent cook and could shop very well if this is the case then we would also discover that the one person in this world our preclear does not want to be is her mother in other words by being unable to be her mother she is also unable to be all those things which her mother could do or be in other words the matter of valences is also matter of packages of abilities and where an individual is unable to be something which has certain definite abilities he also cannot achieve those abilities and this in itself is the heart of disability in running beingness processing it will be discovered that the imagination of the preclear revives to marked extent this is process which requires skilled auditor patient auditor and one who is willing to level every communication lag he encounters by repeating the same question over and over each time waiting to receive definite answer it is not process which one starts and leaves uncompleted r232 assignment of attributes 38the forerunner of this process was significance processing significance processing was done as follows one had the preclear take some picture or object and assign innumerable significances to it this is an excellent process even now for those who are always looking for deeper significances in everything it will be discovered that the preclear with whom one is having difficulty cannot duplicate he cannot duplicate because he has to make everything more complicated everything which is given to him has to be given deeper significance however significance processing is quite limited in its effects upon the preclear and it is not to be compared with sop 8c opening procedure where one has case who is introducing deep significances into everything who is pondering and philosophizing during processing one will discover that significance processing is far too heavy for the case opening procedure of 8c is all that is indicated for this case for many hours and this should be followed by opening procedure by duplication for many more hours the assignment of attributes is process which uses the principle whatever the thetan is doing obsessively or compulsively have him do it on selfdetermined basis here we have the entire environment assigning meanings and attributes to the preclear it seldom occurs to the preclear to assign attributes to himself throughout life he has been insulted made nothing of or complimented and he has begun to depend upon other determined assignment of attributes the commands of this process are as follows assign some attributes to other people now if at this stage the preclear wants to know what an attribute is the auditor can tell him quality characteristic or ability factual insulting or flattering the auditor continues with this command for some time and then as now have some people assign some attributes to you and have them assign you some more attributes then some more and have them assign you some more attributes one then returns to the first command assign some people some attributes and so forth finally when the preclear is able to do this easily the auditor goes to this step of the process now assign your body some attributes and continues to have the preclear assign to his body attributes preclears have exteriorized on this process the preclear uses insults compliments abilities skills and various states of beingness and will be found to be coming up the tone scale with the attributes he is assigning on each stage of this process the auditor should not overlook the fact that this process can be very widely used with the same type of command on any of the dynamics or on the knowtomystery scale such as assign some attributes to mystery assign some attributes to sex assign some attributes to women assign some attributes to spirits using each question repetitively until such time as all communication lag is gone in the preclear on this process r233 perfect duplication had this process existed in 1950 there would have been difficulty in dianetics for in the perfect duplicate we find how to vanquish an engram all one needs to do is to make perfect duplicate of the engram and then make perfect duplicate of having perfectly duplicated the engram in present time and the engram is gone this would also apply to ridges or any other energy manifestation it is not the purpose of the scientologist today to process engrams or to use this particular process and it is only called to his attention that by making perfect duplicate of an engram the engram disappears entirely except for the action of making the perfect duplicate in 39present time but when this is perfectly duplicated then the engram really is gone engrams or whole chains of engrams can be vanquished in few seconds by perfect duplication thus it may be seen that the theory of perfect duplicate is very valuable one there are two kinds of duplicatesthe word duplicate is used rather sloppily to indicate copy however copy is not complete duplicate copy is facsimile and will remain in suspension as such perfect duplicate is one which is made in the same time in the same place with the same energies as the original now if you have not had this explained thoroughly in class you may discover it eluding you slightly so let us take good solid look at this for it means exactly what it says perfect duplicate is one which exists in the same instant of time in the same place and has the same mass or particles as original thetan placing perfect duplicate does not do it along side of the original nor does he put another image inside the original nor does he mock up more particles he makes perfect duplicate by simply duplicating the original with itself with its own time mass particles space and motion there is something else he can do with an original object he can simply look at one and claim that it is his duplicate the perfect duplicate violates the law of universes which keeps space stretched and causes things to come into existence in the first place and this law of universes is that two things cannot occupy the same space at the same time we then discover that universe will vanish or any part of that universe will vanish the moment this law is violated perfect duplicate restores the asisness of an object perfect duplicate may also have to contain in it the persistence of the object it is simply made by postulate and because the body itself is making imperfect duplicates continually which is to say is copying and making facsimiles continually it may be that the thetan has fallen into this and the making of perfect duplicates is necessary part of his ability the auditor should then take an object right in the room with the preclear and have the preclear make perfect duplicate of the object then consider it is there again then make another perfect duplicate of it then consider it is there again then make another perfect duplicate of it then consider it is there again with some preclears who are having difficult time it will be found that the object will become more pronounced and more real for short time and only then will begin to vanish with thetans who are in fairly good condition the object dims with the thetan in excellent condition the object vanishes the commands are as follows do you see this ash tray now make perfect duplicate of it duplicate in the same time in the same place with the same energy as the ash tray the preclear may have some difficulty getting this the auditor should be very watchful and should coax the preclear using any language necessary to bring about the preclears making perfect duplicate however the auditor should not tell the preclear that the object will vanish or that it will seem to vanish for the preclear the auditor should simply insist that the preclear make perfect duplicate of the object in its same time and same space with its same mass or energy when the preclear finally has this the auditor then says now consider that it is there again when the preclear has done so the auditor says now make perfect duplicate of it and when the preclear has done so now consider that it is there again make perfect duplicate of it the preclear should be drilled in this until the object appears to vanish very thoroughly for him if the preclear is actually in very good condition the object simply will vanish this skill and understanding should be thoroughly mastered by the preclear before he is taken on through to description processing r234 making perfect duplicates of the whole track which is to say returning to incidents and making duplicates of them at that moment or sending remote viewpoint down the track and 40having it make perfect duplicate of incidents and then making perfect duplicate of having done so in present time to vanish the present time picture is the process of vanquishing engrams however if the process is done to wipe out engrams remember to remedy the preclears havingness as in the last sentences of r218 this practice of asisness by the way is the reason why people do not consider it polite for other people to stare people have hangover in that they know instinctively that if they are completely looked at they would disappear having had the preclear learn how to make perfect duplicates now ask him this question give some things which are not making perfect duplicates of you many times give some people who are not making perfect duplicates of you give some things of which you are not making perfect duplicates give some people of whom you are not making perfect duplicates healing at glance is done by thetan not interiorized making perfect duplicates of the illness of body without perfectly duplicating the body itself it is not done with energy r234 description processing before engaging in description processing it will be necessary for the auditor to perform with the preclear r233 it is not that the preclear is going to make perfect duplicates with this description processing but that the preclear has some understanding of what he is confronting description processing is the single most powerful process in scientology it uses asisness in present time to remedy the restimulations beheld by the thetan the total command content of description processing is the phrase how does seem to you now this is used over and over and over by the auditor in the blank he puts any difficulty the preclear is having for an oldtime auditor for instance who has become rather laggardly about auditing the single question how does auditing seem to you now asked over and over for about three hours would most probably bring about complete rehabilitation of the auditor as such here all we are asking the preclear to do is to view the situation we do not care whether he makes perfect duplicate of it or not we merely want him to observe the situation his observance of the situation determines its asisness and his health depends upon his ability to accept things as they are as we run this process we will find that considerable amount of change takes place in case energy masses move alter shift and the environment takes on different aspects this is not particularly good manifestation it is the manifestation of time or persistence we are running an asisness of alterisness thus the occasional interjection of does it seem to be persisting on the part of the auditor calls the attention of the preclear to the persistence of the manifestations and clears up hangups now here in this process we view the entire philosophy of life we see quite adequately here that an individual still retains anything which he has never accepted asis in other words if man has fought evil for years he has never viewed evil asis thus evil will remain with him if he has fought ugliness for years ugliness will remain with him terribly enough because he has accepted asis the goodness of life and the beauty of life these things are continually being unmocked we eat good food we leave bad food alone when something smells bad we turn our face away from it here we have the entire anatomy of the dwindling spiral we see that individuals continually take the upper cream off life and leave the skimmed milk and then take skimmed milk and leave the drowned flies until they are trying to go all the way to the bottom to close with the basic asisness of existence and this basic asisness is mystery and stupidity this works in other ways an individual walking through life and seeing for instance beautiful people comes at length into condition where he does not believe beautiful people exist for he has taken their asisness so long that the only thing which can make any effect upon him are less beautiful people these he has not unmocked thus we get the entire 41engram bank backing up those things which were never observed directly one can understand then that ten thousand years ago in the civilizations of earth there might have been incredible beauty and one can easily see that these would have background in the bank of the preclear however the ugly spots of ten thousand years ago would still be there and so would bring up the humdrum routine present time existing without valor gallantry or beauty this is the anatomy of what krishna might have meant when he inferred that the bad must be taken with the good here we see then the explanation of why some men can tolerate only disease and dirt why some can tolerate only poverty and we behold in short the entire mechanism behind acceptance level acceptance level processing as contained in the pabs was one method of reaching betterment of conditions description processing is far better method of reaching that condition now let us take more or less in their order of importance the various things with which we fill in how does seem to you now the auditor be cautioned that he must never start in on one of these subjects without flattening the communication lag resulting any one of these items which is mentioned here might very well take ten hours of questioning before it could be run entirely flat for these are very powerful items an auditor might as well poison his preclear as to run this list one item after another without repetition of the question the keynote of this entire process is that the auditor asks this question how does seem to you now over and over and over and over interjecting only does it seem to be persisting the auditor can add dunnage irrelevant remarks aimed solely to stay in communication with the preclear only so long as he does not distract the preclear from this process the items used follow time change motionlessness creation survival persistence destruction distance agreement disagreement stupidity copying beauty ugliness people you seriousness resistance restraint objection nothingness any one of the dynamics and any part of the fundamentals of scientology in the matter of time the preclear must necessarily have been run at least on sop 8c opening procedure and opening procedure by duplication before the process is attempted additionally he must have been run on perfect duplicates so as to gain some stability for him in present time on the subject of looking at things the question once posed is used over and over and over again remember that the process which is to say the phrase which turns on somatic if repeated many times will turn it off now we have special cases of preclears who seem to be having peculiar difficulties the first of these is the preclear with the black field to such preclear before anything else except r216 and r217 are run blackness should be run how does blackness seem to you now obviously thetan has always looked toward the light the brightness the form the object and has ever neglected the dark areas this can be run objectively by having the preclear sit in dark room and simply have him look at the darkness which is the poorer of the methods by test or the auditor can have the preclear close his eyes and run the process if an auditor must address psychosomatic illness it is only necessary for him to ask how do your legs hands eyes seem to you now using one of them at time the lame can walk simply if asked how do your legs seem to you now enough times another version of this was developed by the staff by combining r220 problems and solutions with description processing with these commands can you recall problem which concerned you when the preclear does how did it seem to you then when he describes this how does it seem to you now he is then asked for another problem using the same commands do not forget to remedy havingness on preclear when you run any asinness process such as r234 r235 location processes 42this is an entire class of processes which depends upon the utterance of one challenging question as to location and repeats that question over and over many times the simplest phrasing of this is where are you now the auditor matter how maddening it may seem to the preclear simply continues to ask this question this question asked for an hour produces singular results in preclear but word of warning this question should not be asked of some preclear who is still struggling on sop 8c opening procedure or who is definitely out of contact with present time for the process is butchery very effective use of this process is contained in the phrase where is your face this applies very specifically to people who are exteriorized it does not occur to them sometimes for an hour of where is your face that they themselves have face and that they are still locating the bodys face they have to understand this on their own r236 selfdeterminism as an uptodate scientologist knows selfdeterminism as an ideal state went out the window with dianetics as long as you consider yourself intimately one thing confronting another thing which is not yourself you are not balanced in your environment self determinism is much higher peak than that attained by homo sapiens previously but in scientology there is much better concept that of pandeterminism there are all manner of traps and social twists to keep person located and identified with one object the society insists that one have label it should be called to the attention of anyone interested in auditing that symbol has three ms mass meaning and mobility as soon as one accepts entirely meaning such as name and accepts intimately mass and is made to be mobile one is then dependent to some degree upon some orientation point in order to have space one is inhibited in constructing space therefore the goal of processing in scientology is not selfdeterminism the goal of processing is pandeterminism spanning of attention and other processes go in this direction the practicality of pandeterminism is immediately seen in an elementary if uncommon situation where one is being robbed if one continues to be solely ones self the determinism of the robber is left entirely free the way to combat robber is while one is being robbed be the robber and go away here immediately we cross the bridge into complete first dynamic complete first dynamic is pandetermined dynamic all earlier processes of dianetics and scientology audit mainly the third dynamic the subject of pandeterminism is very touchy subject on social line for it becomes apparent immediately that bravery in the face of odds while dramatic is less than optimum one should simply be the target and the odds at the same time here we have the whole question of randomity randomity comes about when one selects out and gives determinism to another entity or object this tells you immediately that the problem of healing at distance could be looked upon with some favor and this would be true if the concept of nirvana were true where all life comes about as fragmentation of life but this is essay or determination of whether it is bad or good to heal at distance or to do healing of the kind which christ did the only thing i would care to say on the subject at this time is that if one does healing of this character simply that he should do it well and thoroughly such healing does not happen to make selfdetermined individuals out of those so healed but this again is matter of ethic and not matter of practicality an auditor by applying processing skills is actually making somebody well but he is also bringing that person up to the line toward higher goal of selfdeterminism and if he wishes up to higher goal of pandeterminism there could be billions of pandetermining individuals since universe is composed of time continua of particles in common as long as one does not cross particles into other time continua and so get two timecontinua one would not get mergence of universes while there are many processes yet to be delineated on the subject of selfdeterminism and pandeterminism one can expect people to confuse the condition of buttered all over the 43universe clairvoyance telepathy and other halffelt halfexperienced things to be taken up in lieu of clearsighted knowing pandeterminism the first goal of the auditor is to get somebody up into the selfdetermined category and then to remember afterwards that person can be in pandetermining category all thetan has to do to be pandetermining is simply move in back of somebody elses head it is as simple as this thetan should also be able to make perfect duplicates of himself the recovery of pandeterminism is necessary to get somebody out of the rut of obsessive selfdeterminism beingness processing r231 directly processes obsessive self determinism under the heading of selfdeterminism and pandeterminism we have also the subject of control the necessity to predict with actual force or energy the future course of an object is refusal to have something asis thus with control we get persistence and that individual whose case will not change is in such level of persistence and obsessive self determinism that he must control everything the easiest process with which to approach this problem is contained in the command phrase indicate something which is not making space for you and when the preclear has indicate something else which is not making space for you and so forth until we have recovered certainty and clarity on the viewpoint of dimension it will be discovered very rapidly that there are many people making space for the preclear and that he is to some degree contained in the universe of each one of these people and has many particles in common with them r237 yelling in that man has for long time used words to make space and as any barbaric people uses noise to make itself big it will be found that an inhibition of making noise is major difficulty on the case of any preclear when this process is done the auditor should be very careful that the preclear will not be suppressed by his environment it is more than the auditors simply being careful of the neighbors it is the auditor being careful of the preclear for the preclear will be careful of the neighbors the auditor should take the preclear to some place where the preclear would be free to yell the auditing command is start yelling and keep yelling the preclear can be sent off by himself to yell if group is being processed where its noise will not disturb others back and forth interchange between the auditor and the group will be found beneficial this process is very limited and has tendency simply to make people cheerful but occasionally some cases are so inhibited on the making of noise that they are having difficulty with their vocal cords or with their mouths tooth trouble can be traced to the inhibition of making noise distaste for singing is equally traced to the making of noise this process can also be done by creative processing the making of mockups this is at first glance body process but it will be discovered in processing thetan who is exteriorized that he is very afraid to make noise in such case the auditor should exteriorize him into some place far from the auditor and far from the body and the auditor should use description processing for while on the thetan how does making noise seem to you now and then start yelling keep on yelling this is an exteriorized process r238 holding anchor points there are innumerable drills concerning space in that thetan to have vision must be able to tolerate or make space and in that threedimensional space requires four points one sees that thetan must be able to view three separate anchor points at once to have the illusion of space the hypnotic effect of the body on thetan is created by narrowing the thetans view to two eyes one point the optical trick of seeing depth with two eyes is not seeing three points at once 44the remedy of the hypnotic trance of the thetan which makes him believe he is body is the remedy of his looking through eyes at one point the simplest and most workable remedy which results in exteriorization most often if then after some time is holding corners the preclear is seated in chair preclears are audited while seated or standing or walking these days never lying down and is asked to close his eyes the commands then are close your eyes locate an upper corner of the room behind you when he has done so now locate the other upper corner behind you all right hold on to these two corners and dont think the preclear is quietly enjoined from time to time to continue his attention on the corners and not to think at the end of 15 minutes the auditor says now find the third corner behind you meaning lower corner when the auditor is assured the preclear has done this he says now hold on to the same two you had before and the new one when the preclear has all three corners at once the auditor says now hold on to those three corners and dont think the auditor has the preclear continue to do this for at least fifteen minutes then now find the fourth back corner now hold all four corners sit back and dont think this is done for at least fifteen minutes the auditor then has the preclear locate all eight corners of the room and says now hold on to all eight corners of the room sit back and dont think occasionally and quietly checking to see that the preclear is following the command the auditor has the preclear do this for at least fifteen minutes if this process is to be done longer than this total time of one hour as indicated in the above commands go through the above sequence of commands again as process for another hour do not simply have the preclear hold eight corners for another hour put him through two corners three four and eight again as given in other words use this sequence every time you use the process if i were processing difficult preclear i would do opening procedure 8c r216 for at least fifteen hours then opening procedure by duplication r217 for five hours then description processing r234 for five hours and finally this holding corners for five hours and if he stumbled or deteriorated on the way i would go to r216 again and return to where he had stumbled and finish that off r239 conceiving something interesting interest is the keynote of interiorization preclear who is difficult to exteriorize has become so deeply interested in his body that he has become involved with it experimental proof of this exists when the preclear who wont exteriorize becomes so ill that he cannot envision any future for his body he will exteriorize indeed this is the mechanism at death the body will not be useful has reached past interest to finality and so the thetan exteriorizes it is remarkable with what ease in testing i have purposely brought experimental preclears who were as resistive to exteriorization as any to be found to point where they believed it was all up with the body they left the body then interest is the consideration above the mechanical action of control controlling is starting changing stopping deepening of interest is manifested by passage from watching to participating as the thetan watches several particles or bodies in motion he may become prejudiced in favor of one he sinks from pandeterminism to selfdeterminism where self is the one in which he became interested to the exclusion of others or counter to these others now having become the object his interest is its interest it against its environment is problem the thetan involves himself in solving he may do this with something he creates or something he finds already created his interest led him to seek to predict its actions in favor of its survival when he fails to predict he may enter confusion of motion for he does not know the next movement of the object confusion then leads to mystery thus the anatomy of mystery begins with interest leads to selfdeterminism leads to prediction of starting changing and stopping control leads to shortening of communication lines may become at length confusion and end with mystery 45interest is not bad simply because it leads to interiorization for interiorization ceases by test when the thetan can longer feel there is anything more in which to be interested thetan is indestructible there are several stages of interest the qualities of these are represented by the know sexmystery scale most notable are those used in the chart of human evaluation interest is at first without particles then as selfdeterminism effort to determine the future of self enters postulates dedicated to control are used as misprediction occurs particles are employed to guide and these are of many qualities and solidities such as enthusiasm or anger play or work see scales inversions take place at those points where the thetan uses the self to acquire notably eating and sex when the thetan becomes doubtful of the continued interest quality of the self either for other selves or himself there ensues an undecided period where he is not interested this is most marked on social level but it also occurs on self level in such condition he has not actually despaired of future interest and has not abandoned the self but he declares often to continue to be interesting that he has given up he only gives up when he abandons the group as body or when he abandons the body as thetan the auditor is attempting to exteriorize the preclear so that the preclear can assume higher pandeterminism on the dynamics and usually so that the preclear can again run body from outside where the auditor so fails the preclear is under the impression that the auditor is trying to get him to abandon the body thus sort of grief ensues see r240 when interest becomes fixed we have attention when attention becomes fixed we have an unawareness of other things than the object of fixation and decrease of pandeterminism down to selfdeterminism when this fixity of attention goes to an extreme we have lessening of selfdeterminism to point of otherdeterminism as selfdeterminism lessens we find an hypnotic state of total other determinism which becomes then selfdeterminism dramatization we discover in this last all the mechanisms of the engram and as well the mechanism of shifting valences for the preclear assumes the valence of greatest determinism winning valence as being the valence of greatest interest the process used to remedy fixation of interest to the exclusion of self consists of broadening interest by the broadening of interest we do not achieve liability which will again collapse but greater freedom broaden do not contract preclears width of interest the spheres of interest are the eight dynamics series of concentric spheres each one larger than the last with the first dynamic at center and the eighth dynamic at the extreme of any universe gives spatial picture of interest when retreat or inversion occurs the eighth the extreme outside sphere becomes the inverted first dynamic the seventh becomes the inverted second the sixth the inverted third the fifth the inverted fourth the fourth the inverted fifth the third the inverted sixth the second the inverted seventh the first the inverted eighth then they progress in interest and alterisness outward again the inverted eighth becomes the reinverted first the inverted seventh becomes the reinverted second and so forth each inversion is occasioned by falling back of interest while yet retaining contact with the area from which one fell back hence we get such manifestations as buttered all over the universe and my thetan is over there and such ridiculous manifestations the processes of spanning attention etc resolve this sort of thing here is the process specifically aimed at interest for homo sapiens badly interiorized mock up get an imaginary picture on the most interesting body form other people would conceive the preclear may not be able to get visible to him mockups but he will mock up something black or invisible and this will be the most interesting body form he can conceive he is so fixed on it he cannot do otherwise than mock it up 46then have him mock up another by saying do it again and another and another have him pull these visible or not in upon him to remedy havingness by saying all right now pull those in upon you then mock up the most interesting body form you can conceive and now another and another and another now pull those in upon you now repeat the first command other people have him remedy havingness with what he got then the second phrase his most interesting body back and forth time after time he will learn exactly what he conceives to be interesting and what he believes others would find interesting do this for at least half an hour four hours would be better his ability to mock up his acceptance levels will change the second part of the process consists of more objective and better process as the preclear is man we can suppose that he is interested in his species but we may have learned in part one of this process that he is more interested in other forms than man the auditor assumes that thetan interiorized into man would be interested in men or with an earlier clue substitutes another form the auditing command is what other person could you be interested in and now another one and another one until broad array of people are disclosed getting the preclear to pretend he is various objects with various viewpoints also resolves this fundamental way of looking at interest is to qualify its two major divisions as interested and interesting thetan in good condition is interested when he has become self he feels he must have energy from exterior sources and so he becomes interesting interested could be said to be an outflow interesting could be said to be an inflow being interested yet leaves one considerable freedom being interesting pulls in particles upon one and so restricts him an interested thetan is the solver of problems an interesting self is problem more broadly thetan is interested in problems mest is problem the passage from interested to interesting has many phases when one is not longer interested but is only interesting he has lost his principle quality as thetan freedom and the ability to change at will having the preclear mock up interesting bodies forms machines and universes discharges much of his interiorized condition and fixation then having him look at actual people and objects and get the idea of how it would be to be them and move them about brings him again towards pandeterminism next to the opening procedures this is the most important process in intensive procedure lets find something in which you could be interested and when the preclear does find some more things in which you could be interested and when he has some more things and so on with these commands for at least an hour do not use interesting use only interested in other words process the preclear towards theta interested not towards mest interesting you can see that the preclear is asising situations that he is also broadening attention and unfixing from the body the only thing you can do wrong with this process is not to run it long enough 47the process works subjectively but it is well if the preclear reaches an impasse to have him find things in the present time environment in which he can be interested without directing the preclears attention to specific things just by running the commands some things in which you could be interested exteriorization takes place the factors which make interest very important process is the fact that interest is the entrance point to havingness heretofore we have used attention but have used it very sparingly in processing the reason for this is that attention is into the field of mechanics it has however become evident that interest is more consideration than attention and is therefore attention with intention interest therefore could be defined as this attention with an intention to give or attract attention if you will have the preclear look around his environment and point out things which have the intention to alter things and other things which have the attention to keep them from altering things we will discover that we are running time the intention to alter and the intention to keep things from altering are together the two factors of change interest added to this gives us the determinism of attention the auditing commands for this would be look around the environment and find some things which have the intention of altering things now look at them again and get interested in them and so forth took around the environment now and find some things which have the intention to keep things from altering now get interested in these items one after another thus directing the preclears attention and inviting him to mock up interest it will be readily discovered that he will shift on the time track and that he will consider himself detached from time the keynote of preclear who is having difficult time is that he has interest in outside things one who is having less difficult time would be interested only in things in his immediate vicinity preclear who is fairly well off has an interest in altering things or in keeping them from altering but unless interest can be given on postulated basis it is obsessive the only reason preclear keeps psychosomatic illness around is that great deal of residual interest has accumulated in that preclear will have discovered roles up and down the time track which interested people and he will be trying to occupy these roles in order to increase his own havingness if you were to ask preclear what were your parents interested in he would eventually recover from the very things he is suffering from quite normally the whole career of child is established by the things in which his mother is interested and the child will try to be those things in which his mother was interested if his mothers attention and interest in him has been slight here is the complete backbone of orientation points and symbols if the orientation point is interested the symbols are interesting when one can longer be an orientation point he of course becomes symbol and tries to get interest from the orientation point the basic orientation points in family are the parents or grandparents and the symbol is the child usually the preclear has come to the auditor because he feels that the auditor will at least be interested in him and when the auditors interest in the preclear is not demonstrated in such ways as not keeping appointments or in failing to let the preclear communicate the preclear will worsen in the process however such an omission can be remedied although it shouldnt have happened in the first place by running interest processing much later process other people can be run by picking out in the preclear some obvious difficulty such as bad eye or bad leg and have him get interested in the bad eyes and bad legs which he postulates at people in his vicinity this puts the preclear into the role of an orientation point and takes him out of the role of symbol by making him the one who is interested and makes other people in his vicinity the ones who are interesting great many significances can of course be entered into this process one can have the preclear be interested in things under attack interested in things not under attack picking them out one after another in the environment the auditor can have the preclear be interested in the weakness of mest the forgetfulness of mest the nondeterminism of mest and other factors 48the mystery to know scale with the addition of inhibited enforced and desired can be run adding the factor of interest with the following commands pick out some things which are inhibiting mystery now one after the other get interested in them now pick out some things which are enforcing mystery now get interested in them one after the other now pick out some things which desire mystery now get interested in them this can be run straight on through the mystery to know scale which is mystery sex eatingness symbols thinkingness effort emotion lookingness and knowingness to give it in its most complete form r240 conceiving static this is heavy process it is not recommended for cases having any real difficulty here we use the discovery and principle of ultimate truth see summary of scientology if one has prior postulate and makes postulate then that postulate cannot be lie if one then makes denying postulate second to this primary postulate he then has accomplished lie prime postulate on any subject cannot be lie second postulate can be lie in such case the second postulate permits the prime postulate to exist but in such case it is the second postulate the lie which persists all second postulates depend on prime postulates for their force 1 all evil depends upon prime postulate of goodness if the evil is to persist 2 the satanists claim that satan is god after he made the universe 3 hatred of person depends for its only strength upon love for that person prior to the hatred the hatred persists but only has strength from the love 4 man considers himself to be worthless this state of mind persisting denotes that he must have had considerable opinion of himself before he felt worthless but beware of thinking that all is good or all is evil the force comes from prime postulate the state persisting from the second postulate example 1 doctor considers himself good charitable man wholly unselfish healer on examination we see the second postulate persists so his goodness must be the second postulate it must have force from prime postulate it denies and so we find this doctor entered medicine because it had more chance of easy sex then he denied this to himself and argued he did it from humanity his pious mien ceases to persist and he is freed from this pose by straightwiring the prime postulate rule always straightwire out condition contradicting the condition which exists example 1 we have preclear with bad legs we see that bad legs are persisting thus we know that the forceful postulate is prior and opposite so we straightwire out good legs 2 man is sick because of jilt in love we straightwire out not the jilt but the times he loved the girl 3 our interiorized preclear is stuck wont exteriorize we straightwire the time he was free and so discharge the stuck the second postulate and thus exteriorize him rule that which is closer to an ultimate truth the static gives power to that which contradicts it the process and vicious one it is contains only the command repeated over and over conceive thetan 49caution this is long process the auditor may have to remedy the havingness of the preclear do not forget sop 8c opening procedure if the preclear bogs the top buttons of the chart of attitudes see scientology 88008 are the main qualities of static static has quantity it does have quality and consideration r241 via via via via is the curse word for existence via means relay point in communication line to talk via body to get energy via eating alike are communication byroutes we are trying to string in preclear straight line from cause to effect the reasons we cannot are all vias or complete stops enough vias make stop stop is made out of vias there is real reason one should go into the past to straighten the present there is time but postulated time thus it is all present why not then postulate the desired condition in the present it is painful to do so for the moment one does he tends to slip from the ideal to the first lie one slips because the first lie was time time persists because it is lie deriving its force from the absence of time in the static then forthright postulation of the static at first restimulates time when the time postulate restimulates the literal blackness of lies somatics etc come into view all one has to do is endure these and repostulate the static the reason earlier efforts along this line failed lay in their restimulating the second postulate each time the lie and then not repostulating the static mooning over the lie or the sign recent efforts such as coueism did not postulate the static but validated time every day in every way i am getting better and better dont postulate to become beautiful postulate current beauty i am beautiful thus postulating the static at first swings one into time and the second postulate then finally the static itself occurs remember static has mass wavelength energy location or time but it can consider and it has qualities those qualities are its basic definition plus the top buttons of the chart of attitudes plus beauty solution would be something which solves the problem thus the asisness is the problem is the solution for it would vanish the problem thus in scientology we have attained an ultimate solution the static and an ultimate truth the static to work this clearly the auditor commands get the idea of having infinite leisure when the preclear does now get it again get it again and better again and so forth regardless of what somatics or locks appear he does this for at least fifteen minutes then now get the idea of complete freedom again again for at least fifteen minutes then get the idea of having total ability for at least half an hour now use this command but include in it the chart of attitudes and beauty assume complete again assume complete again again the chart of attitude buttons are survival rightness responsibility ownership mankind duration motion as source truth faith knowingness cause beingness and beauty do not do these briefly let the preclear explain how these seem to him but dont mix this with description processing r242 r243 and r244 are processing group 50r242 pandeterminism pandeterminism is new idea in scientology its validity is demonstrated by the fact that it is fivestar process pandeterminism is the ability to regulate the considerations of two or more identities whether or not opposed previously our goal was the relatively limited goal of selfdeterminism it was for some time realized that this did not embrace the total concept since selfdeterminism expresses in the main the first dynamic but the moment one begins to consider the fact that the thetan is controlling the body one sees that he is not dealing with person or identity with the first dynamic but is dealing with the third dynamic thus we have selfdeterminism as misnomer we see that survival is as successful as determinism is stretched across the environment in other words up the dynamics certainly where man is concerned it is never problem then of selfdeterminism it is problem of pan determinism for here we have in one individual several items each distinct under control when thetan came into full control of himself and his activities we would have and only then have selfdeterminism but thetan in his playing of the game is attempting pan determinism and is assuming selfdeterminism his first goal might be said to be pan determinism under pandeterminism we have of course the problem of control the component parts of control are start change and stop thus person controlling something is trying to start change and stop that thing where he loses his ability to start and stop it he only retains his ability to change it and thus we have lowlevel case trying desperately to change being unable to change and very certainly being unable completely to start and stop his last effort is to change any time you are addressing preclear you are addressing something which is attempting pandeterminismhere is thetan trying to control body an engram bank and the various symbiotes of the body such as its possessions vehicles and servicing items in pandeterminism we are not concerned with either bad or good we are only concerned with the fact that thetan is trying to control many identities some of them opposed to others and that his inabilities in the past to control certain beingnesses have brought him to level of belief where he does not feel that he can control anything and as result we discover him unable to because thus unable to find himself or be at the sourceend of communication line pandeterminism is the direct reason why one becomes buttered all over the universe this effort toward pandeterminism is the monitoring point in all processing the discovery of pandeterminism was the difference between success and failure in many cases under the heading of pandeterminism we discover such things as owning protecting and hiding bodies one declares the ownership of something so that he will be given the right to control it one protects something because he considers that something else is trying to control it one hides something because he is afraid something else may appear to control it an enormous variety of processes stem from pandeterminism here any and all of the training of an auditor can exert itself this is the common denominator and the one fast line through to the upper ranges of the tone scale there is second line that which is described in r243 fighting pandeterminism is what one is fighting for it is the reason why behind existence the auditing commands for the running of pandeterminism are as follows what do you feel you could control and some more things and some more things one runs this so as to improve the considerations of the preclear he can fully expect the preclear to drop into very deep apathy on occasion but the process carried forward determinedly by the auditor and not pattycaked or left off simply because the preclear is having difficulty will produce all by itself considerable resurgence of case r243 takes care of most of the factors which are encountered as the reason why one does not feel one can determine the course of something 51r243 fighting basically this universe is game the mest universe pretends to be universe of peace in order to become universe of peace it is necessary to stop everything from fighting in order to have game it is necessary to have opponents if one has opponents there must be fighting this universe is organized to immobilize thetan so eager is thetan to have game that he will adopt to himself all manner of liabilities in order to have parity with his opponents one cannot have game with people who are too inferior in strength or cleverness thus one reduces his own strength and cleverness in order to have game as given in r242 pandeterminism one uses as his reason why he is fighting the necessity of controlling something else the effort to control is the reason why for fighting fighting itself is the game r242 and r243 are very close together in workability and between them worked one against the other back and forth will lift the preclear up through the barriers of force it could be said that preclear stops fighting when he considers that other forces or ideas or emotions are too much for him as given in the philadelphia lecture series one has to go up through force before one can cease to use force if one does not rise superior to force then one is the subject and slave of force peace is only to be found at the high levels of the tone scale any effort to have peace after one has become the victim of force and is afraid of force simply involves further struggle there is peace below the level where one cannot fight we are not here concerned with moral values we are only concerned with the workability of processes and whereas it might be said of scientology that it is attempting to sell fighting and war this would only be said by those who were themselves badly defeated and afraid of force here we have as well automaticity and randomity in order to have more attention to control other things one sets up the things he is already controlling as automatic having done so he has given to them determinism of their own and having so given them their own determinism they can if he ceases thus to control them attack him thus we have the machines of thetan these machines work only so long as they are in control of the individual and then begin to work against the individual thus it is with the remainder of the universe one only fights those things which he has selected out as not under his control any thing which is not under an individuals control but which has taken the individuals attention is likely to be an identity used to fight the motto of this universe is we must have game games consist of opponents and reasons to have game and things to have game about reasons to have game are summed up under pandeterminism things to have game about are summed up under havingness the game is the thing the wins and losses are not the thing one loses every time one wins for he then has game any cessation will bring about change in the status of an individual for he will then impose upon himself other penalties and liabilities and impose reasons why upon others so as to create new game although it is antipathetic to most preclears as you will discover by processing them game is more and less than fighting an opposition one falls out of having game when one begins to believe that the forces being used against him or the ideas being used against him or the emotions being used against him are too great to oppose once he has this idea he can then be subjected to other forces as all forces emotions and efforts in general can be categorized under considerations to have consideration about force has greater actuality than having the force itself changing ones mind about force is senior to changing force 52it must be realized that an individual who has drawn away from force has also drawn away from the material of which his engram bank is made people on whom engrams collapse are people who have become afraid of force this is best approached not by using work or other factors but by directly approaching the problem of games and running fighting only it will be discovered that most individuals are involved with fighting themselves after all an individual is third not first dynamic the body the engram bank the thetan his machines form four items which can be at war one with another and when an individual has an insufficiency of fighting out in his environment he will begin to fight with himself the condition of most preclears who come to an auditor is this one of the ways to handle this is with the auditing command point out some things in the environment which are fighting themselves this run for an hour or two out where the preclear can actually see things and point them out will key out most of the engram bank with which he is in conflict he will recognize fully and clearly very shortly after he has started on this process that he is fighting himself in view of the fact that there is scarcity of fighting imposed by police mores and the motto peace peace peace of this universe you will discover that you have to start and run for very long time the factor of wasting thus the first entrance to this problem could be wasting fighting one would do this in brackets with the following auditing commands waste some fighting and when the commlag is flat on this have somebody else waste fighting waste some fighting have somebody else waste fighting it will be discovered that the preclear will do this for many hours of processing all with betterment of his case before he actually gets up to the point where he can touch the next level of this process which is accepting fighting however one does not at this stage run accepting fighting the next part of this process is done with the following auditing commands waste some opponents have somebody else waste some opponents after the preclear can handle this without any appreciable commlag one then goes to the next part of this process waste some liabilities have somebody else waste some liabilities waste some liabilities have somebody else waste some liabilities and this too will have to be run for long time until the individual has flattened his communication lag having handled the subject of fighting directly opponents and liabilities one can then go on to accepting but one does this only when the communication lag on wasting of fighting opponents and liabilities has been done one uses accepting in this case by remedying havingness mock up something you could fight pull it into you mock up something else you could fight pull it into you even though the mockup is invisible or black it is still done if you are having the individual point out things he could fight in the environment itself do not be surprised at this stage if he simply pulls out of his body as thetan and occupies the area of that which he thinks he could fight one follows this with mock up an opponent pull it into you mock up another opponent pull it into you one follows this with mock up liability pull it into you mock up another liability pull it into you you should run fighting in conjunction with pandeterminism and the process must and must not happen in other words do not run r243 without also running interspersed with it r242 and r244 these three processes work together any time communication lag is fairly flat on any one of these you should shift to either of the other two remember r2 42 r243 and r244 work together interspersed and make themselves process if you have preclear out in the open you can have him point out things in the environment that he could fight just as if you have him out in the open you can have him point out things he wouldnt mind controlling and in the case of r244 things that he wouldnt mind having happen or not happen again what would it be safe to fight until the commlag is flat what would others find it safe to fight what would it be safe to fight what would others find it safe to fight in continuation of fighting as process what thoughts would it be safe for you to fight what thoughts would it be safe for others to fight run back and forth many times until the commlag 53is flat what emotions would it be safe for you to fight what emotions would it be safe for others to fight run back and forth until the commlag is flat what efforts would it be safe to fight what efforts would others consider it safe to fight run back and forth until the comm lag is flat what imaginings would it be safe to fight what imaginings would others consider it safe to fight indicate some things which are fighting spot all the spots where you had to stop fighting them spot all the spots where you won is excellent since either win or lose is stop fighting and therefore loss of opponents you will find many preclears hung up in past moments of victory this is only because they lost their opponents at that moment and the loss stuck them on the track by bringing about motionlessness what would you need to fight things what would others need to fight things if you have the preclear out in the open where there are lots of people very good method of processing have him place into these people unknown to them the preclears own attitudes about fighting take one attitude and have him place it in several people another of the preclears attitudes about fighting and have him place it in many more people and you will discover considerable changes take place in the preclear what mechanisms could you use to continue fighting is another fine process what changes could you make and still fight is yet another interesting process describe some fighting that would interest you is another facet of this process the key process to alter behavior is invent some things you could fight invent some things that could fight you r244 must and must not happen preclear is stuck on the track where motionlessness occurs one of the reasons he has used to fight was to make something happen or to keep something from happening thus it is of interest in the case to undo these stuck points in the preclear there are many ways these could be undone but there is apparently only one way that is actually effective this is done with the following commands tell some things you wouldnt want to have happen again tell some things you would like to have happen again the preclear will get in accordance with these commands various recalls incidents facsimiles or environmental situations or future fears or hopes and may be steered more directly into these i first discovered this process by running concepts but in the running of concepts it has very limited workability by pointing out live or imaginary situations great workability is achieved the auditor must be very careful to do this process long enough so as not to leave the preclear hung up in an incident this is the basic key of time r245 an enormously effective process for exteriorization but its use is frowned upon by this society at this time r246 r247 and r248 are processing group r246 other people here is one of the more curious and one of the more swiftly workable processes an auditor may find himself reluctant to use this process but experiment has demonstrated that it did not bring harm to other people this is one of the fastest ways of getting rid of psychosomatic known in scientology it is practically the only method known to get rid of the unknowns in the bank it is direct environmental process utilizing actual visible other people to run this process one must be in heavily populated area where people are on the street walking about sitting down or otherwise directly visible to the preclear the process is not run in mockups this process has been known to get rid of heavy chronic somatics in few minutes 54the auditor takes the preclear into railroad station or park or has him sit in car on heavily used street and says to him what do you think is wrong with you he has the preclear name some specific thing and having named it the auditor then says all right pick out one of these people and have that thing wrong with that person and when the preclear has done so now pick out another person and have this same thing wrong with that person the auditor continues to have the preclear place into these people this thing which is wrong with the preclear only so long as the item is wrong with the preclear for this is very rapid process and very rapid change takes place any concept or idea of any kind can be utilized in this process the auditor can pick out obvious things the preclear has and have the preclear find these things wrong with other people around this also works if the auditor has the preclear find each person one after the other which he actually sees during the process perfect in other words the auditor can say postulate perfection into that person now postulate perfection into that one this is mixing other people with conceiving static but for that matter almost any process in scientology can be employed in this fashion one of the very effective ways of using this process other people is to have the preclear place into them lostness or stupidity inability to locate themselves and in short all the factors making up unknown as covered in r252 blackness inability to get mockups and other scientological liabilities can also be placed into people in this fashion it is interesting to note that the preclear being incapable along the lines of energy and postulates only very rarely gets through to anybody with this postulation for the preclear is too weak to cause such effects however he should do this with great sincerity and with full belief that he is doing it after preclear has exteriorized it is interesting to note that he still does not have this same effect upon these people but postulating such items actually does bring about the condition r247 body differentiation this process is done in the same manner as r246 r246 r247 and r248 being group of processes one has the preclear note the differences between himself and the bodies of the people he can see in his immediate environment this process is done in park or railroad station or on the street seated in car the auditing command is point out difference between that persons body and yours this command is used over and over r248 separateness this is key process attacking individuation in his effort to control thetan spreads himself further and further from the universe and in his failures to control withdraws from things he has attempted to control but leaves himself connected with them in terms of dead energy thus we get the manifestation buttered all over the universe this was the process which told that we are not natively sprung from one common body of theta if you run separateness accentuating the difference in unity of thetan from other thetans and things and spaces he continues to gain in tone if you run this process in reverse how he is the same as or is connected to various items he continues to dwindle in tone by handling this latter process one can press thetan down into the rockbottom state of aberration we have long known that differentiation was the keynote of sanity and that 55identification was the basis of aberration this fact is utilized in processing by running separateness it can be concluded that the thetan is an individual separate from every other thetan and that he has never been part of any other thetan there are many phony incidents implanted on the track whereby an individual is made to feel that he is result of explosion having occurred to larger body he is also made to feel that he was at one time whole and is now only splinter of himself this is only an effort to reduce him he has always been himself he will always be himself down to time when he is entirely identified with this universe at which time he would longer be himself simply because he would longer be conscious it seems that the only aberration can occur by enforcing basic truth here we discover that the individual being separate is then forced to be separate and so develops complex of the only one and tries to fend off the rest of the universe from himself and finally merges with it with his impossibility of fending it off all you have to do is accentuate truth and force it home as another determinism in order to create an aberration there is some basic truth then in whatever is wrong with thetan and of course the basic wrongness is that he is not static separateness is best run by having the preclear out in an open place inhabited by great many people as in r246 and r247 the auditing command is point out some things from which you are separate point out some more things from which you are separate point out some more things from which you are separate you might believe that there might be some value in having him point out some things from which he is not separate in order to asis his connections to things however if you started this process on having him find things from which he is not separate you will very quickly discover that your preclear is deteriorating in tone and that he does not resurge this is onedirection process having him point out things from which he is separate it should occur to you that as we learn in r243 thetan desires lots of opponents of course the more separateness that he discovers the more opponents he can have and the more fighting he can see before him this makes him happy by conceiving himself identified with an enormous number of things he is of course rendered very scarce in opponents and this makes him unhappy and makes him choose out only things which he could then fight without being challenged such as his engram bank or his body or his own machinery the basic reason thetan conceives great many remote viewpoints is to have separateness from himself thetan can actually be separate from himself as remote viewpoint and choose out himself thetan as his opponent many person who is thoroughly interiorized is being the body so he can fight himself thetan this is also inverted when i was making some of these basic discoveries i was puzzled to encounter the fact that in many preclears the preclear was entirely sold on the fact that he was attacking demon which was attacking his body he would analytically conceive himself to be thetan but actually was being the body and as the body and remote viewpoint in it was attacking theta body which actually contained himself thetan this complexity came about when he was not even permitted to fight the body as the totality of misemotion and weakness is exhibited solely when thetan lacks opponents and feels he cannot have fight you will discover in running separateness that many misemotions weaknesses and so forth rise to the surface this is relatively long process by itself but it should be done in conjunction with r2 46 and r247 remember that the preclear should be absolutely certain that he is separate from the item do not take any maybes 56r249 dei scale the scale of desireenforceinhibit is repeated over and over in that order as we go down the tone scale and is therefore repeated in reverse order as we find preclear rising in running almost any process it will be discovered that what the preclear is currently desiring will shortly be inhibited by the preclear and what is being inhibited will shortly be enforced by the preclear and what is being enforced by the preclear will shortly be desired by the preclear and this in turn will again be inhibited by the preclear and so forth step iv of sop 8 of expanded gita gives great many items which are useful in raising tone the number of items which produce the greatest effect when used as prescribed in step iv of sop 8 given in this book follow fighting selfdeterminism engrams health sanity peace evil present time imagination and control using any one of the above fitted into the place of the blank in those auditing commands one runs the dei scale in this fashion waste some fighting have somebody else waste some fighting this is done until the communication lag is flat then mock up and pull in some fighting waste some have somebody else waste some and so forth until the communication lag has been levelled mock up and pull in some mock up and pull in some mock up and pull in some again until the preclear has communication lag desire some have somebody else desire some the dei scale then is approximated in processing by waste for inhibit accept for enforce and simply the idea for desire there are many other factors which could be utilized in this process and which have been utilized in this process such as problems healthy bodies and so forth but these are not as effective as the abovegiven list which is the choice list of all the other factors which could be utilized another list can be used with considerable effectiveness and this is the know to mystery scale one would then have the preclear waste accept and desire in that order the following items in this order mysteries problems sex eating symbols effort emotion vision hearing and thought it is interesting to note that person who has sonic shutoff is hanging on to silence one can have him waste accept and desire sonic and vision pain and unconsciousness by running pain with the dei scale one will discover that the thetan actually desires pain any sensation is better than sensation r250 changing minds the basic process of thetan is simply getting him to change his mind most thetans fall below the level of mechanics they have to be brought up to point where they are not being handled by mechanics before they can simply change their considerations if changing minds worked on any thetan it would then be the only process in scientology but it does not work on thetans who are interiorized since they are being other things than themselves and when they start to change their minds they are simply changing something else when you have thetan exteriorized all you have to do is ask him to change his mind and unless he is still very badly burdened by mechanical considerations with which he has so thoroughly agreed that he cannot immediately change his mind he will do so 57this process can be used on nonexteriorized thetan however and on those who are uneasily exteriorized by having them stand in one place with an idea that they have to appear there and then change their minds and disappear there or simply have them stand in one place until they change their mind and then go to another place and change their mind and go to another place and change their mind this is done actually by moving the body around as most auditing these days is done the auditing commands for this would be walk over to this spot indicating spot to the preclear now decide you have to appear there now change your mind and decide you have to disappear there now change your mind and decide you have to appear there and so on this can also be worked into opening procedures by having preclear select spot then change his mind about the spot select another spot change his mind about that spot and select another spot until he knows that he himself is changing his mind when exteriorized the thetan can change his mind very easily on any subject simply when told to do so very often he does not realize that he can change the factors of his life around simply by changing his mind and so has to be asked to do so by the auditor note of warning this does not work on interiorized preclears with any great value r251 rising scale processing this is one of the older processes of scientology it consists of the individual being asked to get whatever idea he can about the buttons of the chart of attitudes and then change his ideas upwards using this process the entire endocrine system of the preclear has been altered for the better the auditing commands would be dependent upon the chart of attitudes the buttons of the chart of attitudes are dead survive nobody everyone distrust faith lose win right wrong never always i know not i know stop start responsibility fully responsible stopped motion source full effect cause identification difference owns nothing owns all hallucination truth i am not i am had being the auditing commands involved in this process follow how close can you come to trusting everybody now do you have that idea and when the preclear has all right shift that idea as high as you can toward trust do this many times with the preclear on one item of the list before going on to the next r252 unknowns one of the liabilities of dianetics was that it took all the data off the bank and left on the bank effort and unknown substances efforts and unknowns were not asised one of the basic auditing commands of this is give some unknown incidents the preclear as he tries to do so will immediately find known incidents turning up rapidly he is asising unknownness one of the best ways of using unknownness is with group of separatenesses where the preclear is outside looking at other people have him get how much is unknown to each one of these people with the following auditing command now find person and put some unknowingness into him now find another person and put some unknowingness into him 58a variation of this is put unknownness of location into person now another person and so on the reason why location is used is because it is part of the definition of stupidity one can also use time with the following command put some unknown times into that person now put some unknown times into that person and so on remember to always run the same auditing command over and over and over until change has ceased to occur in the preclear r253 repair fourstar process it seems rather obvious that we should handle repair as process since that is what we have been doing in dianetics and scientology if preclear cant himself repair he gets some help doctor minister if the auditor cant repair he wont run processes to make the preclear well granting of beingness has repair as major part of its sphere the cycle of action of the mest universe for this process could be create repair change deteriorate change destroy the auditing commands for this process are what wouldnt you mind repairing what wouldnt you mind letting others repair what would you mind repairing what would you mind others repairing what dont you know how to repair what dont others know how to repair the above is the main process and should be heavily stressed the commlags are very long and the process must not be briefly run finish one command reducing all lag by many times using it get the question answered every time use for hours other indicated questions are run by substituting the following for repair in the above question form create repair change deteriorate destroy or start change and stop the factors of control specific group of processes which have been discovered to do great deal for preclears consist of r253 repair followed by r244 must and must not happen followed by r243 fighting followed by r242 pandeterminism this series run with the auditing commands as given is enormously effective complete audit of preclear in very bad condition could follow this plan r216 opening procedure of 8c for several hours r217 opening procedure by duplication for several hours r220 use of problems and solutions using the commands given in the last paragraph of that section then r253 repair r244 must and must not happen r243 fighting r242 pandeterminism r239 interest as given in its last paragraphs r254 flows r255 importance used in this exact order continuous and very wonderful changes can be made to occur in preclear even though he began the process as entirely psychotic many such routes could be designed but this particular one happens to have been tested in this order on preclears and found workable r254 flows the processing of flows has several times been tested in scientology and each time it has been discovered that there were many preclears who could not handle them with the processes which have already been advanced the static and the object were therefore concentrated upon and flows were avoided however r254 overcomes this past difficulty this is very splendid way to make preclear change his considerations but it should be run long enough to take away the somatics which it turns on for the somatics which r254 turns on can be severe 59the process is extremely simple to run but must like all other processes here be run exactly as given to produce the desired result it consists of having the preclear point out things which inhibit enforce and desire flows the auditing commands would be as follows look around you and point out some things one after the other which inhibit flows now point out some more now point out some more then look around you and point out some things which enforce flows now point out some more now point out some more now look around you and indicate some things which desire flows now point out some more now point out some more now look around you and point out some things which inhibit flows now point out some more now point out some more and so on if the preclear is indicating people he will discover with some rapidity that people are enforcing and inhibiting flows he will discover also that speech is flow he will discover also that the universe is built of these flows the preclear should be permitted to discover these things for himself he will find for instance that blackness forces flow if preclear wishes to know what flow is point out to him that light bulb is flowing light waves out into the room and that an object is reflecting them this process is of course worked best as part of the group where the preclear is taken outside and made to point out people and actually belongs with that group this is definitely fourstar process r255 importance fivestar process it might be very bad thing to run this process immediately and at once upon preclear and an auditor should never begin with such process on case auditors today begin only with opening procedure of 8c and follow that with opening procedure by duplication and ordinarily follow that with problems and solutions and only then go off into processes as difficult as this process although this is difficult process it is not difficult to do it is difficult because it produces such rapid change upon the preclear that he is liable to be left in some state where he considers all things unimportant and is made by the process to be out of balance with the universe and his life and his environment and if it were run on preclear who was having difficult time without first running opening procedure of 8c and opening procedure by duplication he would of course have tendency to stop being audited for he would be plunged into the unimportance of everything including auditing the keynote of importance is simply this anything which is important is solid or big and the more important person believes himself to be the bigger he is liable to get or the more important person believes something to be the more solid he is liable to make it anybody who believes that minds are important is liable to make them solid hence we immediately get the type of bank which some people have with their solid facsimiles and in consequence masses and ridges we began to hit this number of years ago when we discovered that whatever we validated became more prominent i did not at that time know why this was and have now discovered that it is because things which are considered important become more solid this could also be called games processing for we are handling here the most important part of importance the fact that in order to have game there must be something important to defend to have to attack there is game unless one has some item which is important for it would not be visible to anyone but himself if it were not solid important and solid can be considered to be for our purposes synonyms 60the auditing commands which run this are very simple and are pursued for some time without change of command first tell some things which are important tell some more things which are important tell some things which are important to other people tell some more things which are important to other people back and forth on this then point out some things which are important point out some more things which are important point out some things which other people consider important point out some more things which other people consider important then tell some things which are unimportant tell some more things which are unimportant tell some things which are unimportant to other people tell some more things which are unimportant to other people back and forth on this then point out some things which are unimportant point out some more things which are unimportant point out some things which other people consider unimportant point out some more things which other people consider unimportant in view of the fact that each consideration that something is important tends to add mass and each consideration that something is unimportant tends to detract mass and in view of the fact that the consideration that something is important is the second postulate to the truth that it was unimportant we discover the mechanism which causes minds to form large masses such as facsimiles and engrams at first one considered his mind unimportant then he considered it important and then again unimportant and then again important and this cyclic activity brings into existence the mind as mass which is to say creates the reactive mind we occasionally discover people who are having considerable difficulty and the wideopen case and the occluded case with considerable energy mass which they are calling their mind they do their thinking by facsimiles they do their behaving at the orders of the facsimile this can be traced immediately to the consideration that the mind is important unimportant important unimportant important unimportant in repeating cycle an indicated process to remedy this condition would be spot some spots spot some more et cetera and spot some spots where others thought the mind was unimportant spot some more such spots and so forth spot some spots where you thought the mind was important spot some more such spots and so forth spot some spots where others thought the mind was important et cetera this sequence of commands should be run each one until the communication lag is flat and then as in all such sequences in this book should be gone through again several times vital if somewhat murderous process very important to be run on scientologists is spot some spots where you thought thought was unimportant some more etc spot some spots where others thought thought was unimportant etc spot some spots where you thought thought was important etc spot some spots where others thought thought was important etc this crosses importance with conceiving static another indicated question is what important things could you be give some more important things you can be and then give some more important things you could do as thetan give some more important things you could do as thetan general formula on importance would be to spot spots where the preclear considered everything on the mystery to know scale important emphasizing words sounds sights blackness and energy by running this process you can expect considerable regain of education on the part of the preclear almost all education has been hammered into the preclear as terribly important activity actually it will be as much use to him as it is considered casually this accounts in some measure for the tremendous difference in the attitude toward education of one trained by casual and interested tutors and one trained between the millstones of the public school system with all the horrors of the examination for passing and accounts for the complete failure on the part of universities to educate into existence leadership class the secret lies entirely in the fact that education is as effective as it is pleasant unhurried casual and is as ineffective as it is stressed to be important for example giving arithmetic the 61category of something terribly important is to bring the student at length into possession of solid lump of energy which utterly useless to him will lie there as arithmetic this also accounts for the failure of the child genius generally his parents consider his career so important that eventually his piano playing or painting will be an energy mass he will be as good as and as effective as he can change his considerations and one does not easily change his considerations in the face of such energy masses auditors have often wondered at the resistance of the preclear toward turning on sonic and visio and at the persistence of blackness here again we have problem of importance the deafer person becomes or the leas sonic person has the more he tends to believe it is important for him to have this attribute and of course the less he has it for the more solid it gets solidity could be said to be stupidity here also we have the tremendous stress as given in book one on words the more important instructions are the more important words are the more important speech becomes as in general semantics the more buried and therefore the more effective words become in the reactive bank if you were to choose single process out of importance the one which would probably pay off best would be one which wasted words accepted them and desired them in brackets and then which caused the preclear to spot all the spots where words were considered unimportant and words were considered important for himself and for others we are looking at the master trick person is as welloff as he is free and lacking in uncontrolled energy deposits but these gather to the degree that certain facets of existence are stressed as important r256 games processing games processing 1954 is quite different than its predecessors but the fundamentals are the same in scientology as they have been always the highest activity action or ambition is to have game game requires that one create or have an opponent the whole series centering around fighting is actually the lower range of games processing which accounts for its tremendous effectiveness processing games directly the first indicated process would be one taken from description processing which would asis certain undesirable characteristics this would be done with the command give some games which are fun give some more games which are fun give some more games which are fun until the apathy and antagonism toward games in general has been to marked degree asised as an opponent is an essential part of games the processing of opponents in general produces interesting results in case we could simply improve the considerations of the preclear with regard to opponents by asking him what sort of opponents could you have and carrying this forward until all communication lag is gone or one could have the preclear waste accept and desire opponents where the accepting is done by having him mock up an opponent and remedying his havingness for it another interesting process which produces excellent results is name some unromantic roles name some more unromantic roles and so forth name some romantic roles name some more romantic roles and so forth name some unromantic roles name some more unromantic roles and so on back and forth until the preclear has regained the ability to imagine some roles actually he has been given roles by the motion pictures and television and his propaganda textbooks until he will only accept role which is generally approved by this society as represented in fiction this could be said to be an intentionally fictionalized society marriages quite often go to pieces simply because jim jones and mary smith did not get married jim jones posing as alan ladd marries mary smith posing as lana turner and fictional alan ladd married to fictional lana turner is going to be disappointed whereas there is reason under the sun why jim jones shouldnt be good and interesting guy doing an interesting role and why mary smith should not be doing role herself as herself for people are interesting to the degree that they can postulate and act into existence the roles required of them in life the bard of stratfordonavon said that all the worlds stage but 62didnt give us the process by which we could be players your preclear has been audience and this process boots him out of being audience into being player which is more or less what the auditor is trying to do with preclear he cant have any games where everybody is being an audience and nobody is playing the scarcity of roles which person can actually occupy in this society is such that we commonly discover preclear continuing to act out any role which he has been given in some school play which he found romantic i know several preclears whose total difficulty is that they have never ceased to be the gangster they did so well in the high school production of officer 666 or the prostitute they did so excellently in the college drama club production of rain not recommended and rather deadend process would be involved in asking the preclear for things worth fighting for in that he can only postulate things worth fighting for and that he is so far down the scale on this the process is difficult one but can be used preclear quite commonly has play and work nicely and neatly separated the difference between play and work is that play is fun and work is fun in the common parlance until today we have only work in view of the fact that effort is stupidity unless understood working at trying to play is the general difficulty with people quite often medical doctor will advise somebody to stop working so hard and start playing the actual fact of it is an executive quite commonly has his work as his only play and so the medical doctor has consigned him to some hard work by telling him he has to play thus we have an inversion what kind of game could you have give some more games you could have is useful process what would you have to be to have game some more things you would have to be to have game carried forward interspersed with an actual description from the preclear of each game he lists is very effective the following process ranks very high in effectiveness in all these procedures what kind of game could you have involving in asking this question the auditor points out some object in the immediate environment and the preclear is made to describe what kind of game he could have with that object the auditor then points out another object in the environment and asks what kind of game could you have involving it will soon be borne home to the preclear that he has been trying to play games with the absence of opponents that he has hung on to most of the disasters that have happened to him in his life because they meant the loss of opponents here we find the child who has been raised alone dreaming up illusory opponents and later on we discover him mocking up demons any time you walk into an insane asylum and discover somebody involved with battle with demons or who has demon or who has guardian angel or who has any one of these mythical assistants or opponents we are looking at somebody who found opponents so scarce that he had to mock them up and having mocked them up was unable to unmock them for new opponent came along the reason war mobilizes everyone into action and speeds up production in country is because tangible opponent has been introduced and people will accept tangible opponents above illusory opponents mans activity in fighting himself thetans activities in fighting themselves all stem from this effort to play games in the absence of opponents what kind of game could you have involving should be run until the preclear is cognizant of everything he is doing with regard to opponents without ever mentioning opponents to him r257 processes the processing of processes actually belongs to via it is an intensely important thing to do cells trees the whole of life is engaged in working processes normally they work them unconsciously one of the methods of straightening out this fixation on processes is to have the preclear plan to do something very simple such as move an ash tray have him plan it out in its entirety and then have him execute it exactly as he planned it one does this many times with many objects 63another way of working this process is discover things in the environment which are using processes and discover things in the environment for which you could invent processes r258 loss the subject of loss is an entire study in itself it is the subject of havingness as well loss results in degradation memory failure blackness and what we used to call stuck on the track so it is an important subject loss itself can occur only when the consideration that one wants needs has to have has occurred first when one loses something important one supplants it by dragging in energy deposits facsimiles on himself here is the scale of substitutes acquired by reason of loss cumulative spiral of stopped time object loss of this substitute object owned loss of this substitute object others loss of this substitute mockup loss of this substitute mockup owned loss of this substitute mockup others loss of this substitute problem loss of this lost by solution b lost by occlusion substitute problem owned loss of this substitute problems others loss of this substitute blackness something in it loss of this substitute blackness owned loss of this substitute blackness others loss of this substitute unconsciousness loss of this substitute unconsciousness others loss of this substitute unconsciousness own loss of this substitute unconsciousness loss of this substitute blackness others loss of this substitute blackness own loss of this substitute blackness loss of this substitute problems others loss of this substitute problem owned loss of this substitute problem loss of this substitute mockup others loss of this substitute mockup owned loss of this substitute mockup loss of this substitute object others loss of this hallucination the remedy of havingness is good process to overcome loss however loss is consideration 64the following processes remedy considerations involving havingness what assistance do you need to survive what assistance do others need to survive the most effective straight were on this is name some important possessions some more important possessions and so forth name some things it is important not to have as we have havingness going down to ownership then to protection then to hiding we have name some things it is important to protect name some things it is important to hide name some things it is important to display exhibit these are lower level manifestations important possessions will exteriorize r259 survival whenever i have found process unworkable in the past sixteen years i have found that the unworkable process avoided the dynamic principle of existence survive in other words it did not greatly matter how this principle was embroidered if it was included in the process or rationale some workability resulted the dynamic principle of existence survive and its application as the dynamics is easily the greatest discovery in dianetics even when we add to it the remainder of the curve of the cycle of action of the mest universe create survive destroy we find survive is the potent truth in it so scientology or dianetics processes if we neglect survival in our rationale become unworkable survive has as its dichotomy succumb when one is below 20 on the tone scale all survival looks evil to him live evil in the succumbing case to punish is to declare thing evil to be evil is to refuse survival the dynamics are breakdown of the dynamic survival into eight parts each dynamic in turn breaks down into many parts thus we have life and these interplays of survival are life if your preclear is not clear he is avoiding survival on one or many dynamics his considerations about survival are his personality i tell you this lest we forget dianetics is precision science it stems from this study and codification of survival survival is the reason why opening procedure of 8c r216 works because the preclear in spotting mest is recognizing look after all ive been through ive survived having preclear spot in crowd peoples survival potential is great processing the auditing command point out some things in your surroundings which arent surviving will spring grief or apathy point out some things which are surviving is quite potent point out some unknown methods of surviving is one of those fader questions he can almost answer it for hours as thetan is immortal he cannot do other than survive when he realizes this his game may become how can i succumb survival has pay that pay is the sensation of pleasure this is acquired by interest one tries to survive by being interesting he demands of life that he be interested thus with the preclear in crowd what could that person auditor indicating one have do be that would be uninteresting what could that person have do be that would be uninteresting to your ally the preclear has asised all the interest from life and has left 65intact uninteresting thing when he tries to get interested anew uninteresting ridges soak up his interest what dreams goals would you find uninteresting is interest plus future survival murderous auditing command while the preclear is outside looking at people and the world is what dream could that person have that would not interest you that would not interest your mother and other allies interest of allies makes survival possible anything which succeeds in interesting allies orientation points and symbols then may be successful mockup for the preclear all his life syphilis fatness stupidity may be interesting enough to allies to leave the preclear with them all his life for an interested ally means future and that is survival get list of all people he has known since birth ask him for each one many times what would be interesting to ally and you will find his service facsimile and the source of his aberrations and psychosomatics what dynamic could you abandon could be used on scientologist the most basic question about bodies being cellular organisms is what wouldnt cell survive what else wouldnt cell survive and so on this is very old but very potent dianetic process for the repair of bodies organs body parts and types of bodies can be substituted for cells in the above question remember your goal is to improve the preclears survival if he thinks survival is evil if to succumb is the only way he can get interest your road will be eased by remembering and processing the dynamic principle of existence survive on all or any dynamic by any type of process and this is the rationale of dianetics which may be freely used by scientologist r260 the hidden communication spot some hidden knowingness is an auditing command which pursued properly opens the gates to freedom in scientology 880 and scientology 88008 you will find scale which begins at its lowest rung with hidden above that is protection above that is ownership i have recently discovered that the dei cycle and the above low scale join to make the scale read curiosity desire enforcement inhibition ownership protection hidden and i have discovered that the road upward through this scale is communication knowingness condenses trying to know becomes the first level of communication this looking to know condenses into emoting to know which condenses into effort to know which in turn becomes thinking to know which then condenses into symbols to know which and this is the astonishing thing becomes eating to know which becomes sexual activity to know which then turns into oblivion of knowing or mystery an energy particle is condensed knowingness trying to discover or move one is an action with the goal of knowingness gravity grim thought becomes in the mind and is the effort to know to pull in knowingness otherdeterminism is only other knowingness 66the aspects of know are the common denominators of any scale in scientology when knowingness is done by communication we get emotion and effort particles changing position this struggle to know is not just and thee working on scientology and gone mad in the process it is life and all its manifestations including space energy matter and time each is only barrier to knowingness barrier is barrier only in that it impedes knowingness barriers do not exist for complete knowingness and what is there to know only that knowingness can vary one has to invent things to know for there is only knowingness and knowingness has data since datum is an invented not true knowingness the motto of any particle below knowingness is only energy can tell you we handle r260 hidden knowingness in this wise spot some hidden communications and now spot some more hidden communications and so forth we may have to direct the preclear closely with point to the spot how far away does it seem are you spotting hidden communication there and such questions meanwhile keeping good arc he could be asked to spot specific kinds of hidden communications as with this command spot some hidden disease communications some hidden poisonous communications or spot some hidden but uninteresting communications but use the question to flatten all communication lags before you change it if he goes into the past let him hell come back to the present hell find his chronic somatic and do many interesting things including perhaps the data in the text of r260 here it is curious that the above spot some hidden communications does not seem to require remedy of havingness but it will turn on many heavy ridges and somatics having thoroughly worked hidden communications you can now use this command spot some protected communications and when that is null spot some owned communications and after that has communication lag spot some inhibited stopped communications then spot some enforced communications and then spot some desired communications now when all that is done proceed as follows spot some hidden knowingness are you spotting it in the physical universe if so all right point to it how far away does it seem spot some more hidden knowingness and so on until after an hour or two or six this command is commlagflat now start upscale as follows making the preclear point and give the distance to the spot even when trillions of miles away spot some protected knowingness and after many times of that then spot some protected knowingness many times then spot some owned knowingness many times then spot some inhibited knowingness then spot some enforced knowingness then spot some desired knowingness then spot some knowingness that people could be curious about in r260 hidden knowingness we can use the know mystery scale spot some mysteries spot some hidden sex spot some hidden eating spot some hidden symbols spot some hidden thinking spot some hidden efforts spot some hidden emotions spot some hidden looking spot some hidden knowing then spot some protected mysteries spot some protected sex and so on you can using the principles of hidden knowing and communication combine any other part of scientology with them and discover an excellent process however the first commands given in r260 are the easiest to communicate and to use 67r261 good and evil the factors of good and evil are the factors of accepting other determinism good and accepting or giving blows evil that which cooperates is good that which is punished is evil this is the totality of consideration involved good and evil are third dynamic phenomena but unlike most words one might process these have definite emotional connotations which to the preclear speak louder than the words these apply from mystery up to know just as good and evil are the primary fixation of philosophy so are they primary fixation in preclear so confused are they in philosophy or in preclears that an enormous complexity results their resolution would resolve either philosophy or preclears the basic auditing commands to handle this extremely important process are spot place where you decided to be good now spot spot in this room spot the place again spot spot in this room spot the spot again where you decided to be good spot spot in this room etc until all commlag is gone for one distant spot where the decision was made to be good then now find another spot where you decided to be good spot spot in this room etc and so on until many spots are cleared actually the auditor wants the distant spot to come into present time before he leaves it but at least reduce commlag for each spot now do exactly the same procedure using the following auditing command spot place where another person decided to be good now spot spot in this room alternating back and forth until commlag is reduced the same is now done for evil with this slight variation spot spot where you decided you were evil spot spot in this room spot spot again where you decided you were evil spot spot in this room etc as for good picking out new single spots and clearing each one as far as possible then follow the same procedure with the command spot place where another person decided he was evil spot spot in this room etc reducing commlag for each spot then point out some unknown evils and point out what other people would find an unknown evil you may have to remedy havingness for the preclear for this is very destructive of havingness the preclear will come up with many considerations and changing ideas let him voice them but continue with the process dont let your preclear leave the session with good or evil spot uncleared or in restimulation he will become neither saint nor devil from running this he will become more capable of good action r262 overt acts and motivators one of the primary discoveries in dianetics was the overt act motivator phenomenon an overt act is harmful act performed against another motivator is an overt act performed against oneself by another if one receives motivator he then may consider himself licensed to perform an overt act against the person who harmed him when one commits an overt act without having received motivator he attempts then to mockup or acquire proper motivator or justify his own harmful action 68an overt act delivered in the absence of motivator we call an unmotivated act justifier is the technical term we apply to the mockup or overt act demanded by person guilty of an unmotivated act in that thetan cannot possibly actually be harmed having mass wavelength or actual location any harmful act he performs is an unmotivated act thus thetan basically cannot have motivator overt act sequence and always has an unmotivated act justifier sequence the catch in this is the idea of harmful good and evil an act must be considered harmful or evil to be an overt act to need justifier person must have believed his act to have been harmful as the thetan cannot experience motivator overt act sequence we have then the dwindling spiral he is always justifier hungry thus he punishes and restimulates himself thus he is always complaining about what others do to him thus he is problem to himself only permit thetan to get the idea that it is possible to harm others and you have then the dwindling spiral use of these data in auditing is simple and intensely profitable for example we have preclear who continually complains about his father how mean his father was to him this means precisely that the actual facts of the past include many unmotivated acts against father by the preclear even though the preclear seems to recall such acts by himself and many overt acts against himself from father this is an excellent process to get sudden result on preclear ask him straight wire for things he has done to his mother father any and all allies dont let him run things they have done to him can you recall doing something to your father or other ally or person is the only auditing question having him remedy his havingness with motivators is also fair process r263 accept reject from acceptance we get tenstar process whatever else you may do with preclear he must be brought to accept the physical universe and his own and other bodies all in every kind of condition the way out is the way through in eastern practices the goal was abandonment desertion scientologys main difference from eastern practices is this it accepts to free and it frees that which one cannot accept chains one for instance revulsion to sex inclines at last to slavery to sex rulers motto could be make them resist and his people would become enslaved in 1870 we find capitalists resisting marx in 1933 we find marx the basic text of us government resistance and restraint are the barbedwire of this concentration camp accept the barbedwire and there is camp on test this process exteriorizes the worst case if run long enough this process is important because it is one of the few like r216 which does not have alterisness as its operative factor this is not then an altering practice confirming somatics and aberrations it is freeing process that which one cannot accept he cannot asis 69the commands of this process are as follows find something about yourself which you can accept something else find something else you can accept etc etc until there is commlag then find something about yourself you can reject find something else about yourself you can reject etc etc until there is commlag then find something in this room you can accept something else find something else in this room you can accept etc etc find something in this room you can reject find something else in this room you can reject etc etc then find something about this universe you can accept until the commlag is flat then find something in this universe you can reject remember this is not an altering process it is high value escape process if your preclear keeps putting conditions of change into everything before he can accept it you must persuade him to find things he can accept without changing them r264 touching most thetans are inside because they are afraid to touch the outaide baby is slapped out of touching things by mamma and the mest universe some thetans are afraid that if they touch mest theyll stick to it and so remain safely inside there are two possible ways to run this one is simply what are you willing to touch the other is as thetan what are you willing to touch if the preclear savvy being thetan use the simpler form the command is as thetan what are you willing to touch what else are you willing to touch what else are you willing to touch etc etc then what are you willing to have touch you what else are you willing to have touch you the mind can change without bringing alterisness into play changing the mind is the only possible way to improve without liability this process alters only the mind this is very valuable process eight stars r265 alteration as any energy or space condition survives only because it has been and is being altered the primary unmotivated act would be changing the condition of energy space and objects the mind can change without liability when mind changes energy or space we get persistence of that energy or space as persistence or survival is good and bad only to those who desire to succumb we do not see in alteration of energy or space any crime but when we alter only bad conditions of space and energy we make the bad conditions persist hence it would be of value to case to at least straight wire out some of the times when he attempted to alter energy spaces or bodies of people to an auditor who works to exteriorize preclear and change his mind there is small liability and great personal advance to an auditor who works only to change the body the ridges the somatics there is failure fixation of condition in the preclear and restimulation occurs successful auditing of the thetan actually improves the auditor failure is the biggest lock on alterisness of course the preclear who is obsessively trying to change himself by selfauditing or whatever means has failed many times to effect change in the condition of this universe or in the bodies of others or has the space and energy of this universe as stable constant the commands are can you recall time when you failed to change some energy in this universe etc etc and when this is flat can you recall time when you failed to change some space then can you recall time when you failed to change body this last question is the one you stress he may get nothing on the space question at all but such incidents are in his recall or space would not exist at all for him 70also can you recall time when you failed to change memory etc etc wherever or however the preclear is stuck in tone or condition there he has failed to change something or somebody this can also be run on the theta aide of the ledger can you recall time when you successfully changed something until the lag is flat even more simply can you recall time of change r266 electing cause worry and anxiety have their root in the changing election of cause people who elect cause other than self are often shifting responsibility and refusing to fix actual cause the black five is noresponsibility case this process is brutal one but it is fivestar process it often sets off worry machine and runs it out the auditing command is point out some things which are causing things point out some more things which are causing things etc etc until the lag is flat r267 objects to person who cannot hold the two back corners of the room the simple location of objects is valuable when person is selfauditing this is very valuable solo process the command is locate some objects etc the person looks at them or puts his attention on them and notes what they are this is all there is to the process for variation one locates some more objects by object is meant physical universe present time visible objects r268 incomprehensibility thetan is understanding space or mass is understanding thetan is mass an object is mass duplication is thus difficult thetan must be able to be mass or space and to experience at will incomprehensibility in order to see spaces and masses it is new understanding to understand that something can be incomprehensible the tone scale is study of varying degrees of arc affinity reality and communication comprise understanding with knowingness at the top of the scale we come down in understanding third dynamic knowingness then down through relative understandings and increasing incomprehensibility until at bottom scale mest we have total incomprehensibility and total noncomprehension difficult case is simply an incomprehensible case the processing on this is done by the command spot something incomprehensible repeated many many times this ups iq and raises perception this is good process r269 please pass the object this process was developed by longtime auditor and dscn jan halpern it is very fine process and is recommended anywhere on the scale 71throughout the process the auditor doesnt say word he doesnt answer possible questions he doesnt explain in words what he wants under all circumstances he makes like the tar baby and dont say nothin he uses any gestures necessary step 1a auditor stands in front of preclear holding out small object to him until the preclear takes it from his hand as soon as the preclear takes the object the auditor holds out his hand palm up until the preclear places the object in his palm the auditor immediately offers it to the preclear again this is continued until without commlag the object should be offered to the preclear from variety of positions once he has gotten the idea from down near the floor or off to either side over the preclears head the palm should be held in variety of positions for the return of the object both hands may be used get the preclear doing this really fast step ib when step 1a is going swiftly and easily the auditor introduces switch after the preclear has just accepted the article the auditor instead of extending his palm for its return places his hands behind his back briefly then conveys by gestures that the preclear is to offer the object to him when the preclear does so the auditor takes the object from his hand but does not return it until the preclear holds out his own hand palm up to receive it this exchange is continued until the preclear is offering and accepting the object from as wide variety of positions as the auditor used and all other commlags are flat step ii the auditor just having accepted the object makes gesture that this part is over then deliberately puts the object down where the preclear can see it stands back and indicates that the preclear is to pick it up when the preclear picks it up the auditor gestures that he is to put it down again anywhere he likes in the room the instant the preclear does so the auditor snatches it up and puts it somewhere else this is continued until the auditor and preclear are racing around the room seizing the object as soon as the others fingers have let go of it the object isnt necessarily placed in different spot each time it may be picked up and put down again in the same place but it must be handled each time all sorts of tacit rules and understandings will probably develop while this is being run this process rehabilitates the sense of play validates nonverbal arc shortcircuits verbal machinery lets the preclear position matter and energy in space and time gets the preclear up to speed murders there must be reason for doingness processes both auditor and preclear equally and besides its fun r270 expectance level this is future type acceptance level the process was contributed to by bscn millen belknap the commands are what do you expect from the auditor fills the blank it is cousin of description processing this process is not for lowlevel cases r271 answers relative of problems and solutions is give some answers as constantly repeated question it is valuable process 72r272 security processing it is safe to do what your parents do and that is evolution death failure rejection are safe if your parents did them the auditing command is tell some things it is safe to be etc tell some things it is safe to do etc tell some things it is safe to have this works very well r273 making something for the future the auditing command is point out some things which are making things for the future this is brutal process r274 processing the auditing command is point out some things that are processing things this cures obsessive selfauditing r275 knowingness as everything is condensation of knowingness the following commands explain much and do much tell something you wouldnt mind knowing something you wouldnt mind others knowing invent something to know tenstar process 73lenvoi as summary comment on these processes it cannot be indicated too strongly that preclear who is psychotic neurotic or who is having any psychosomatic difficulty must be run on opening procedure of 8c r216 for many many many many hours it will be discovered that on such preclears the use of subjective processes which is to say those processes which intimately address the internal world of the preclear is fruitless the processes which produce large results and effects will not make the preclear well as an example of this many persons have been run by the best processes for fifty hours or more only to have their cases remain stagnant and then these same persons being run on r216 opening procedure of 8c have day after day with an hour or two of such running per day commenced steady and stable gains which they have retained when in doubt then on any process run r216 and when the case claims that nothing is happening run r216 and when the case is going very jumpily forward with many losses and few gains run r216 and when r216 has been thoroughly run then turn to r217 the reason why r216 is so effective is that it immediately addresses the problem of barriers the preclear who is having difficulty will be found to be confounded by mechanics which is to say the barriers of space energy and mass and that these barriers have entered into his own universe so that he himself in his own thinking is encountering barriers by making the preclear put his attention on objects walls floors ceilings the preclear will eventually come into the state where he himself is stopping his sight on the barrier rather than the barrier stopping the sight of the preclear for all perception is done by stopping the perception on what is looked at this is only one of the reasons why opening procedure 8c works use it although the foregoing is the totality of what we are using and calling intensive procedure any well trained auditor is expected to have at his command any of the processes of scientology and to use them when the occasion arises it will be found that the older processes are complexities of these intensive procedure processes and it has been found by experience that the simpler processes produce results on even the more complicated and difficult cases in fact it requires the simplest possible process to acquire the greatest possible recovery on difficult case subjective processes should be avoided by subjective processes is meant consultation with the preclears own universe with his mockups and with his own thoughts and considerations for it will be found that any homo sapiens is far below the point of simply changing his mind to make new condition take place this is the basic process of the thetan thetan who is in good condition need only to change his mind or change his postulates in order to alter condition on case which does not exteriorize easily or which when exteriorized is found to be using large quantities of energy subjective processes must be severely avoided the formula of communication itself as contained in intensive procedure and in this order should be very closely observed processes which are not included in intensive procedure but which are very effective are end of cycle processes an end of cycle process run subjectively would be what are you willing to destroy what are you willing to have destroy you as the preclear is sitting on survive persist and will not change and as this is what is wrong with the preclear we see that he has drifted far from being able to create and being able to destroy thus this process will be found to achieve results however it is omitted because it is too much of temptation for an auditor to run such process on heavily interiorized preclear the preclear will recover much better by use of the formula of communication the keynote of intensive procedure is making and breaking communication when in doubt all you need do is have the preclear make and break communication with objects or spaces in the physical universe and remedy any difficulty in havingness which results by having the preclear duplicate anything he can see this would apply to an interiorized or exteriorized case actually the sole use of mockups today is in duplication and in the remedy of havingness all processes except the remedy of havingness itself are done with 74great attention to the certainty of the preclear this is stressed in the matter of remedy of havingness it is beneficial for the preclear to remedy havingness with mockups which are vague and of which he is not even vaguely certain as havingness itself does not depend upon any reality so does the remedy of havingness work in the absence of reality only in the case of the remedy of havingness however is uncertainty or unreality on the part of the preclear tolerated at all other times the auditor must be very certain that the preclear is sure of what he is doing the attitude of the auditor giving intensive procedure is not today expected to be sympathetic or coddling one scientology processing today is done overtly challengingly an auditor is expected to be top scale on the chart of attitudes in all departments except trust he is expected to distrust the preclear and even act like he distrusts the preclear this attitude will be found to be far more acceptable to the preclear than trustful one while the auditor never gets angry at the preclear never dramatizes at the preclear and sticks to his task in auditing he should be markedly insistent on the certainty he should be very challenging about the fact that the preclear said it was certain the auditor does not believe the fact that the preclear found whatever it was real by doing this the preclear is made to postulate over and over and over that he is in communication many preclear does something then sits back to see if anything happened this when severe condition the observer where the preclear cannot be anything cannot occupy source point or receipt point can be remedied by having the preclear touch part of his body or the room with his finger and then stand back to see if anything happened his communication lags can be long on this the commands are touch your nose now let go and see if anything happens this must be done to be effective for some time its goal as process is to wipe out fear of consequences for preclear who has suffered much loss the auditor can have the preclear place an object matches handkerchief or anything the preclear owns out in front of the preclear then have the preclear let go of it sit back and wait for it to come to him which it wont of course without volition on the part of the preclear then he repeats the action waiting for the object to go away from him the communication lag of recognition of the process and the somatics can be severe the waiting should be in terms of many minutes each time important in processing psychotics and neurotics of whatever degree use only r216 opening procedure 8c each part until the person is sure who is doing it use only r216 until the case is fully sane use other process of any kind the first and most basic definition of any part of communication is that communication or any part thereof is consideration if this were not so communication in this universe would be impossible as perfect communication requires an exact duplication of source point at receipt point duplication to be perfect would mean copy in the same time same space with the same mass the law that two objects cannot occupy the same space is peculiar to the mest universe and is the law which keeps it space stretched thus perfect duplication defies the basic law of the universe but as duplication is consideration communication is possible to the degree that the preclear can freely make considerations any process which improves the ability to duplicate by removing the fear of it or improving the ability of the preclear to consider freely without large reasons improves as well duplication things you are not duplicating things which are not duplicating you is one of variety of processes the game of the preclear is to set up things which cannot be duplicated and to duplicate anything set up he can play it as well as he can consider freely or as well as he can duplicate considerations are bettered by having the preclear put considerations into any object for long time then having the preclear make the object have considerations about him the 75commands are put some considerations into that have the have some considerations about you all commlag as in all other processes must be reduced havingness may have to be remedied 76this is list to be run by change of space processing 1 the first geographic location of the thetan in the mest universe as soon as he came from the home universe 2 the geographic location where he created his first facsimile 3 where the thetan received his first motivator in the mest universe 4 where the thetan committed his first overt act in the mest universe 5 where he started the first spiral also the end of the spiral do this with all spirals up to present time 6 the geographic location where the thetan first was in contact with body in any way 7 the jackinthebox 8 the obsession 9 the first blanketing 10 the halver 11 facsimile one 12 before earth 13 before mest universe 14 the joiner 15 the assumption 16 his first borrowing 17

38 implant station 77sop 8d this procedure is for use by trained scientologist it can be used in conjunction with advanced course procedure and its primary goal is the delivery of heavy cases however it can be extensively applied to all cases it is better to run step 1 well on 8c before using this process upon him opening procedure have pc move his body around the room locating spots in mest space have him locate many such spots and designate them with his finger have him do this until he can do it very well and until he obeys an auditors directions easily step i ask preclear to be three feet back of his chair this is the total step the auditor does not press the matter further even if the pc is step ii have preclear look at his environment and whatever he sees have him duplicate it many times then have him duplicate nothingness he makes or finds many times step iii have preclear hold the two back corners of the room 2 minutes at least or two or more hours then have him locate spots in space where he is not step iv an emeter step give pc full assessment by putting him on an meter at this point and asking him to name the people with whom he has been associated since birth the auditor writes these down and indicates by symbol after each name whether the action of the needle is stuck small medium or violent on consistently stuck needle use next to last list of self analysis until needle frees then choose that person who got the biggest reaction on the meter and using this person have preclear find spots or spaces where this person would be safe the preclear must be certain of the fact the auditing command is find some places where would be safe one continues this until the needle shows further reaction on just this first person then one goes to opening procedure and starts all the way through the steps again now one takes the same person as the auditor first chose and runs this processing question only spot some things which your does not own this is the total question one to two hour communication lag may not be unusual the auditor continues to ask this question and the preclear continues to spot things which this person does not own until the needle is relatively inactive then the auditor goes to opening procedure above and continues through the steps but now he takes new assessment and proceeds exactly as before places where would be safe is universe processing things does not own is ownership processing variations of command of any kind whatsoever should be used by the auditor as these are not dichotomies and variations can be very hard on the preclear even making him ill the auditor should add the spirit of man the spirit of woman god and the body study this process well before using it do not depart from it or vary it until preclear is stably exteriorized the actual goal of this process is to bring the preclear to tolerate any viewpoint 78outline of lectures 13 of professional course july 1954 scientology its background

from the legendary hindu sage dharma whose many progeny were the personifications of virtue and religious rights we are familiar with the dhyana in the form of buddhism bohdi is one who has attained intellectual and ethical perfection by human means comparable to our thetaclear in scientology gautama sakyamuni 563483 b looked upon as founder of the dhyana never claimed to be anything but human being did not profess to bring any revelation from supernatural source did not proclaim himself savior he professed only to teach men to liberate themselves as he had liberated himself from the dharmapada collection of verses said to have been written by gautama all that we are is the result of what we have thought it is founded on our thoughts it is made up of our thoughts by oneself evil is done by oneself one suffers by oneself evil is left undone by oneself one is purified purity and impurity belong to oneself one can purify another you yourself must make an effort the buddhas are only preachers the thoughtful who enter the way are freed from the bondage of he who does not rouse himself when it is time to rise who though young and strong is full of sloth whose will and thoughts are weak that lazy and idle man will never find the way to enlightment strenuousness is the path of immortality sloth the path of death those who are strenuous do not die those who are slothful are as if dead already the religion of buddhism carried by its teachers brought civilization into the existing barbarisms of india china japan and the near east or about two thirds of earths population here was the first broadcast wisdom which summated into high cultures 79the hebrews their definition of messiah is teacher or bringer of wisdom their holy work known to us as the old testament leans heavily on the sources we have already mentioned jesus of nazareth the legend of his study in india age of 3033 teaching and healing use of parables like gautama buddhist principles of brotherly love and compassion death by crucifixion spread of christianity into the barbarism of europe religion with fur breechclouts close of the trade routes western seekers of wisdom the separation of science and search from religion artificial division the early greeks lucretius spinoza nietzsche schopenhauer spencer freud we think of these as beginning our intellectualism they quickened it the bulk of their sources was asiatic definition of religion webster 3 the profession or practice of religious beliefs religious observances collectively rites 4 devotion or fidelity conscientiousness religion religious philosophy scientology has accomplished the goal of religion expressed in all mans written history the freeing of the soul by wisdom it is far more intellectual religion than that known to the west as late as 1950 if we without therapy simply taught our truths we would bring civilization to barbaric west 80this is scientology the science of certainty foreword for nearly quarter of century i have been engaged in the investigation of the fundamentals of life the material universe and human behavior such an adventure leads one down many highways through many byroads into many back alleys of uncertainty through many strata of life through many personal vicissitudes into the teeth of vested interests across the rim of hell and into the very arms of heaven many before have made their way across these tumultuous oceans of data where every drop of water appears to be any other drop of water and yet where one must find the drop almost everything i have studied and observed has been evaluated otherwise somewhere at some time in relation to this or that what equipment must one have to venture upon these wastes where are the rules books the maps the signposts all one perceives when he peers into the darkness of the unknown are the lonely bones of those who reaching before have found their hands empty and their lives destroyed such thing is lonely drama one must cheer ones own triumphs and weep to himself his despair the cold brutality of the scientific method fails far back almost at the starting point the airy spirallings and dread mysteries of india where i drank deep lead only into traps the euphoria of religion the ecstasies of worship and debauchery become as meaningless as sand when one seeks in them the answer to the riddle of all existence many have roved upon this unmapped track some have survived to say fraction of what they knew some have observed one thing and said quite another some looked knowing and said naught one engaged upon such quest does not even know the answer to that most important question of all will it be good for man to loose upon him all in rush as an avalanche the knowingness of eternity there are those who would tell you that only fiend would set you free and that freedom leads at best into the darkest hells and there are those to inform you that freedom is for you and not for them but there are also men of kind heart who know how precious is the cup and drink of wide unbounded ways who is to say whether man will benefit at all from this knowledge hardly won you are the only one who can say observation application experience and test will tell you if the trek has been made and the answer found for this is the science of knowing how to know it is science which does not include within it cold and musty data data to be thrust down the throat without examination and acceptance this is the track of knowing how to know travel it and see 81the factors summation of the considerations and examinations of the human spirit and the material universe completed between ad 1923 and 1953 1 before the beginning was cause and the entire purpose of the cause was the creation of effect 2 in the beginning and forever is the decision and the decision is to be 3 the first action of beingness is to assume viewpoint 4 the second action of beingness is to extend from the viewpoint points to view which are dimension points 5 thus there is space created for the definition of space is viewpoint of dimension and the purpose of dimension point is space and point of view 6 the action of dimension point is reaching and withdrawing 7 and from the viewpoint to the dimension points there are connection and interchange thus new dimension points are made thus there is communication 8 and thus there is light 9 and thus there is energy 10 and thus there is life 11 but there are other viewpoints and these viewpoints outthrust points to view and there comes about an interchange amongst viewpoints but the interchange is never otherwise than in terms of exchanging dimension points 12 the dimension point can be moved by the viewpoint for the viewpoint in addition to creative ability and consideration possesses volition and potential independence of action and the viewpoint viewing dimension points can change in relation to its own or other dimension points or viewpoints thus comes about all the fundamentals there are to motion 13 the dimension points are each and every one whether large or small solid and they are solid solely because the viewpoints say they are solid 14 many dimension points combine into larger gases fluids or solids thus there is matter but the most valued point is admiration and admiration is so strong its absence alone permits persistence 15 the dimension point can be different from other dimension points and thus can possess an individual quality and many dimension points can possess similar quality and others can possess similar quality unto themselves thus comes about the quality of classes of matter 16 the viewpoint can combine dimension points into forms and the forms can be simple or complex and can be at different distances from the viewpoints and so there can be combinations of form and the forms are capable of motion and the viewpoints are capable of motion and so there can be motion of forms 17 and the opinion of the viewpoint regulates the consideration of the forms their stillness or their motion and these considerations consist of assignment of beauty or ugliness to the forms and these considerations alone are art 18 it is the opinions of the viewpoints that some of these forms should endure thus there is survival 19 and the viewpoint can never perish but the form can perish 20 and the many viewpoints interacting become dependent upon one anothers forms and do not choose to distinguish completely the ownership of dimension points and so comes about dependency upon the dimension points and upon the other viewpoints 21 from this comes consistency of viewpoint of the interaction of dimension points and this regulated is time 22 and there are universes 23 the universes then are three in number the universe created by one viewpoint the universe created by every other viewpoint the universe created by the mutual action of viewpoints which is agreed to be upheld the physical universe 24 and the viewpoints are never seen and the viewpoints consider more and more that the dimension points are valuable and the viewpoints try to become the anchor points and 82forget that they can create more points and space and forms thus comes about scarcity and the dimension points can perish and so the viewpoints assume that they too can perish 25 thus comes about death 26 the manifestations of pleasure and pain of thought emotion and effort of thinking of sensation of affinity reality communication of behavior and being are thus derived and the riddles of our universe are apparently contained and answered herein 27 there is beingness but man believes there is only becomingness 28 the resolution of any problem posed hereby is the establishment of viewpoints and dimension points the betterment of condition and concourse amongst dimension points and thereby viewpoints and the remedy of abundance or scarcity in all things pleasant or ugly by the rehabilitation of the ability of the viewpoint to assume points of view and create and uncreate neglect start change and stop dimension points of any kind at the determinism of the viewpoint certainty in all three universes must be regained for certainty not data is knowledge 29 in the opinion of the viewpoint any beingness any thing is better than thing any effect is better than effect any universe better than universe any particle better than particle but the particle of admiration is best of all 30 and above these things there might be speculation only and below these things there is the playing of the game but these things which are written here man can experience and know and some may care to teach these things and some may care to use them to assist those in distress and some may desire to employ them to make individuals and organizations more able and so give to earth culture of which we can be proud humbly tendered as gift to man by l ron hubbard april 23 1953 83this is scientology scientology is the science of knowledge it contains many parts its most fundamental division is scientology itself and parascientology under scientology we group those things of which we can be certain and only those things of which we can be certain knowledge itself is certainty knowledge is not data knowingness itself is certainty sanity is certainty providing only that that certainty does not fall beyond the conviction of another when he views it to obtain certainty one must be able to observe but what is the level of certainty we require and what is the level of observation we require for certainty or knowledge to exist if man can stand before tree and by sight touch or other perception know that he is confronting tree and be able to perceive its form and be quite sure he is confronting tree we have the level of certainty we require if the man will not look at the tree or although it is observably tree to others if he discovers it to be blade of grass or sun then he is below the level of certainty required and would not be able to grasp scientology some other person helpfully inclined would have to direct his perception to the tree until the man perceived without duress that it was indeed tree he confronted that is the only level of certainty we require in order to qualify knowledge for knowledge is observation and is given to those who would look things about which there is observational difficulty such as mirror mazes items hidden in smoke objects guessed at in the dark are outside the boundaries of scientology in order to obtain knowledge and certainty it is necessary to be able to observe in fact three universes in which there could be trees the first of these is ones own universe one should be able to create for his own observation in its total form for total perception tree the second universe would be the material universe which is the universe of matter energy space and time which is the common meeting ground of all of us the third universe is actually class of universes which could be called the other fellows universe for he and all the class of other fellows have universes of their own complete clarity on all three universes would be well above any goal attempted even in scientology and it is not necessary that one be as certain as this of three universes before one can be certain of scientology for certainty of scientology requires only the same order of certainty one would have to have to know he was confronting physical universe tree parascientology is that large bin which includes all greater or lesser uncertainties here are the questionable things the things of which the common normal observer cannot be sure with little study here are theories here are groups of data even groups commonly accepted as known some of the classified bodies of data which fall in parascientology are dianetics incidents on the wholetrack the immortality of man the existence of god engrams containing pain and unconsciousness and yet all perception prenatals clears character and many other things which even when closely and minutely observed still are not certain things to those who observe them such things have relative truth they have to some high degree of reality they have to others nonexistence they require highly specialized system in order to observe them at all working with such uncertainties one can produce broad and sweeping results one can make the ill well again one can right even the day which went most wrong but those things which require highly specialized communication systems remain uncertain to many because dianetics is placed in this category does not mean it is disowned it means simply that it is specialized thing based on theory which matter how workable requires specialized observation it does not mean dianetics will cease to work but it means that dianetics is not easily nor quickly forwarded into complete certainty 84yet dianetics is more of an exact science than many which have before borne that name and dianetics is an intimate part of scientology for it is through its special communication processes that the data was won which has become scientology also under the heading of parascientology one would place such things as past lives mysterious influences astrology mysticism religion psychology psychiatry nuclear physics and any other science based on theory doctor for instance may seem entirely certain of the cause of some disease yet it depends upon the doctors certainty for the layman to accept that cause of the disease here we have specialized communications system we may have an arduously trained observer highly mechanistic observation resting upon theory which is not even at this late date entirely accepted even in the best circles that penicillin cures certain things is certainty to the doctor even when penicillin suddenly and inexplicably fails to cure something any inexplicable failure introduces an uncertainty which thereafter removes the subject from the realm of an easily obtained certainty hypnotism matter how certain the hypnotist may be that he is effective on some people is wild variable and even in expert practice is definite uncertainty the use of drugs or shock produce such variable results that they class far down gradient scale which would begin with fair degree of certainty and which would end with almost certainty of any kind we have here then parallel between certainty and sanity the less certain the individual on any subject the less sane he could be said to be upon that subject the less certain he is of what he views in the material universe what he views in his own or the other fellows universe the less sane he could be said to be the road to sanity is demonstrably the road to increasing certainty starting at any level it is only necessary to obtain fair degree of certainty on the mest universe to improve considerably ones beingness above that one obtains some certainty of his own universe and some certainty of the other fellows universe certainty then is clarity of observation of course above this vitally so is certainty in creation here is the artist here is the master here is the very great spirit as one advances he discovers that what he first perceived as certainty can be considerably improved thus we have certainty as gradient scale it is not an absolute but it is defined as the certainty that one perceives or the certainty that one creates what one perceives or the certainty that there is perception sanity and perception certainty and perception knowledge and observation are and then all of kind and amongst them we have sanity what will scientology do it has already been observed by many who are not that doubtful thing the qualified observer that people who have travelled road toward certainty improve in the many ways people consider it desirable to improve the road into uncertainty is the road toward psychosomatic illness doubts anxieties fears worries and vanishing awareness as awareness is decreased so does certainty decrease and the end of this road is nothingness quite opposite from the nothingness which can create it is nothingness which is total effect simplicity it would be suspected would be the keynote of any process any communications system which would deliver into persons hands the command of his own beingness the simplicity consists of the observation of three universes the first step is the observation of ones own universe and what has taken place in that universe in the past the second step would be observation of the material universe and direct consultation with it to discover its forms depth emptinesses and solidities the third step would be the observation 85of other peoples universes or their observation of the mest universe for there are multitude of viewpoints of these three universes where observation of one of these three is suppressed hidden denied the individual is unable to mount beyond certain point into certainty here we have triangle not unlike the affinity reality communication triangle of dianetics these three universes are interactive to the degree that one raises all three by raising one but one can raise two only so far before it is restrained by the uncertainty on the third thus any point on this triangle is capable of suppressing the other two points and any point of this triangle is capable of raising the other two points 86the triangle of certainty of awareness this drawing could be called the scale of awareness it is also the scale of action and the cycle of action the numbers represent entirely arbitrary levels which yet can be found to mean levels of predictable attitudes it would be found that humanity at this time hovers in terms of awareness at the level of 20 slightly above or slightly below here is scarcely any awareness at all compared to the awareness which is available it is very puzzling to people at higher levels of awareness why people behave towards them as they do such higher level people have not realized that they are not seen much less understood people at low levels of awareness do not observe but substitute for observation preconceptions evaluation and suppositions and even physical pain by which to attain their certainties in the field of zen buddhism there is practice of administering sudden blow by which is obtained feeling of certainty here is relatively false certainty the certainty of impact although all certainty actually is derived below the level of 100 from prior impact for its conviction after brutal accident or operation under anaesthetic it can be observed that individuals will sometimes react with an enormous conviction which yet does not seem to be based upon any fact certainty has been carried home to them in terms of physical impact this then is not selfdetermined certainty and the selfdetermined certainty carries one into high echelons the mistaken use of shock by the ancient greek upon the insane the use of whips in old bedlam all sought to deliver sufficient certainty to the insane to cause them to be less insane certainty delivered by blow and punishment is nonselfdetermined certainty it is productive of stimulusresponse behavior at given stimulus dog who has been beaten for instance will react invariably providing he has been sufficiently beaten but if he has been beaten too much the stimulus will result only in confused bewilderment thus certainty delivered by blows by applied force eventually brings about certainty as absolute as one could desire total unawareness unconsciousness itself is certainty which is sought by many individuals who have failed repeatedly to reach any high level of awareness certainty these people then desire an unawareness certainty so it seems that the thirst for certainty can lead one into oblivion if one seeks it as an effect an uncertainty is the product of two certainties one of these is conviction whether arrived at by observation causative or by blow effected the other is negative certainty one can be sure that something is and one can be sure that something is not he can be sure there is something matter what it is present and there that is nothing present these two certainties commingling create condition of uncertainty known as maybe maybe continues to be held in suspense in an individuals mind simply because he cannot decide whether it is nothing or something he grasps and holds the certainties each time he has been given evidence or has made the decision that it is somethingness and each time he has come to suppose that it is nothingness where these two certainties of something and nothing are concerned with and can vitally influence ones continuance in state of beingness or where one merely supposes they can influence such state of beingness condition of anxiety arises thus anxiety indecision uncertainty state of maybe can exist only in the presence of poor observation or the inability to observe such state can be remedied simply by eradicating from the past of the individual first the conviction that the matter is important next the conviction that it is totally unimportant next all the times when he was certain of the somethingness and then all the times he was certain of the nothingness one merely causes the individual to observe in terms of the three universes we face then two general types of mind one is an analytical thing which depends for its conclusions upon perception or even creation of things to perceive and bases its judgment on observation in terms of three universes this we call the analytical mind we could also call it the spirit we could also call it the awareness of awareness unit we could call it the conscious individual himself in the best of his beingness we could call it the mathematical term thetan whatever its name we could have precisely the same thing viewpoint capable of 87creation and observation of things created which concludes and directs action in terms of the existing state of three universes as they are observed directly the other type of mind resembles nothing if not an electronic brain it receives its data in terms of conviction delivered by force it is directed by and reacts to hidden influences rather than observed influences and is to large extent the reverse image and has reverse intentions to the analytical mind this we call the reactive mind it is an actual entity and it operates in terms of experience and theory it sets up thinking machinery around uncertainties and the course of its thinking is downward it seeks to direct and dictate out of pain and the effort to avoid pain the primary difference between these two minds is that one the analytical mind is without finite duration and the other the reactive mind is susceptible to death these two minds are certainty since they can be observed by anyone even in himself he knows he is aware of things around him and he knows that he has definite desires which are perfectly reasonable and he knows if he is homo sapiens or animal that internal commands and compulsions even those which tell him to eat and tell his heart to beat are not directly within his control all thinking can then be divided for our purposes into thinking based upon direct observation and conclusions from observation and thinking which has to know before it can be or observe analytical thought can be called analytical thought because it directly observes and analyzes what it observes in terms of observations which are immediately present the reactive mind concludes and acts entirely on experience and with only fragmentary regard to things present which could be observed the reactive mind begins and continues with uncertainties and where the course of the analytical mind is progressively upward the course of the reactive mind is progressively downward the reactive mind comes into being as servant of the analytical mind and is set up by the analytical mind to work upon and store data about the basic uncertainty that there might be something and there might be nothing the reactive mind then continues in growth and from the servant if the analytical mind does not observe it tends to become the master the goals of the two minds are not separate goals the reactive mind is makeshift effort on the part of the viewpoint to perceive things which it believes to be unperceivable except by comparison of uncertainties both minds are seeking to persist and endure through time which is to say survive the analytical mind can unless it becomes too uncertain and by that uncertainty has set up too many reactive mechanisms persist indefinitely the reactive mind pursues the cycle of life span the analytical mind seeks by creation to cause an effect the reactive mind seeks by duplication borrowing and experience to cause an effect both minds then are seeking to cause an effect and this is their entire motivation for action each of the three universes seeks to persist indefinitely each is continuously caused and each is continually receiving an effect each has its own adjudication of what it should receive as an effect and what it should cause time itself consists of continuous interaction of the universes each may have its own space each has its own particular energy the urge of any of these three universes towards survival is subdivisible for each of the three universes into eight dynamics there are then four groups of eight dynamics each the eight dynamics of ones own universe the eight dynamics of the physical universe the eight dynamics of the others universe as well as the eight dynamics of the triangle itself 88these dynamics could be subdivided as follows the first dynamic would be that one most intimate to the universe which could be said to be the dynamic urging the survival of self the second dynamic would be that one of the persistence of admiration in many forms in ones own and the others universe this admiration could take the form of sex eating or purely the sensation of creation such as sex and children in the physical universe it would be that light emanation similar to sunlight the third dynamic could be said to be that dynamic embracing persistence of groups of objects or entities the fourth dynamic would concern itself with an entire species the fifth dynamic would concern itself with other living species and would embrace all other living species the sixth dynamic would embrace in terms of survival the space energy matter and forms of the universe as themselves the seventh dynamic would be the urge to survive of the spirits or spiritual aspects of each universe the eighth dynamic would be the overall creativeness or destructiveness as continuing impulse each impulse is concerned wholly with systems of communication communication requires viewpoint and destination in its most elementary form and as this grows more complex and as it grows more important communication grows more rigid and fixed as to its codes and lines the reason for communication is to effect effects and observe effects each of the three universes has its own triangle of affinity reality and communication these three things are interdependent one upon another and one cannot exist independent of the other two affinity is the characteristic of the energy as to its vibration condensation rarefaction and in the physical universe its degree of cohesion or dispersion reality depends upon coincidence or noncoincidence of flow and is marked mainly by the direction of flow it is essentially agreement communication is the volume of flow or lack of flow of these three communication is by far the most important affinity and reality exist to further communication under affinity we have for instance all the varied emotions which go from apathy at 01 through grief fear anger antagonism boredom enthusiasm exhilaration and serenity in that order it is affinity and this rising scale of the characteristics of emotion which give us the tonescale the tonescale can be certainty to anyone who has seen other beings react emotionally who has himself felt emotion and who has seen the varied moods of the physical universe itself the periodic chart of chemistry is itself sort of tonescale there is downward spiral on the tonescale and an upward spiral these spirals are marked by decreasing or increasing awareness to go up scale one must increase his power to observe with certainty to go down scale one must decrease his power to observe there are two certainties here one is complete certainty of total awareness which would be at 400 on the tonescale and the other is certainty of total unawareness which would be 00 on the tone scale or nearly so neither end however is itself an absolute for the analytical mind and the analytical mind can go below 0 of the reactive mind however these two classes of certainty are very wide in their satisfaction of the qualifications of certainty because the two extremes of the scale are both zeros in terms of space it is possible to confuse one for the other and so make it appear that total awareness would be total unawareness experience and observation can disabuse one of this idea the scale is not circular the characteristics and potentiality of the top of the scale or near the top of the scale are unbounded creation outflow certainty goingawayness explosion holding apart spreading apart letting go reaching goals of causative nature widening space freedom from time separateness differentiation givingness of sensation vapourisingness glowingness lightness whiteness desolidifyingness total awareness total understanding total arc the bottom of the scale and the vicinity around it includes death inflow certainty comingbackness implosion lettingcometogether pulling together holding together withdrawing effect goals ambition to be an effect rather than cause contracting space time or infinite time in moment connectingness identification identity receivingness of sensation condensation blackness solidification noawareness understanding arc the various characteristics or intentions are observable for any dynamic and any universe 89between these two extremes is the mean of action where complete freedom to do any of these things of the top or bottom of the scale is exercised therefore somewhere between 35 on the tone scale and 365 there is action the above conditions of top and bottom of the scale of course reach away from the extreme and towards each other as awareness becomes more fixed intentions become less flexible in action communications systems become more rigid more complex and less susceptible of alteration one alters these communications systems however by raising or lowering certainty on the three universes the principal difference between the analytical mind in state of awareness itself and the reactive mind is that the analytical mind highly aware knows that it is not the thing but is the viewpoint of things of this it can be very certain as it increases in awareness the reactive mind conceives itself to be the thing the analytical mind is in state of becoming without reaching the point of being the reactive mind conceives itself to be in state of being and so resists becoming perception is accomplished by the analytical mind in high state of awareness by its own outflow and inflow or by its receipt of inflows which it can outflow the reactive mind perceives by inflow only and makes complete recordings of the inflow the analytical mind is capable of developing its own energy it is the energy of the analytical mind which empowers the reactive mind but the reactive mind can be empowered as well by the energy of other minds and by the life energy contained in any living thing thus the reactive mind can become the servant of all things it can believe it is anything it can believe it is owned or has the identity of anyone regardless of whom it was created to serve the analytical mind serves itself in continuing knowledge of serving itself but it serves as well and knows it serves the other two universes the analytical mind extends from it points or observes points extended from it and thus conceives space space is only the viewpoint of dimension the dimension depends upon those points which give it boundary within these dimensions called space the analytical mind can create energy and form and thus by change of form beget time whether created by or within any one of the three universes flow of energy is accomplished by setting up terminal and flowing towards it from viewpoint stream of energy or by setting up two terminals and causing flow between them each universe could be said to be twoterminal universe but flows can be set up on basis of more than two terminals the basic unit of any universe in terms of energy is two this however does not restrict nor qualify the number of viewpoints which any universe can have physical universe however is observably twoterminal universe and twopoint universe and it is also observable that the other two universes set up almost invariably two terminals or more and utilize two viewpoints each very low on the scale in terms of awareness the analytical mind conceives itself to be the reactive mind and so does not act or perform to put out dimension points so as to get space and does not generate for its own accountability energy it does however always generate energy whether it admits it is doing so or not the concern of two viewpoints is attention each viewpoint is apt to be curious about or desire the attention of another viewpoint the most valuable part of an attention interchange is admiration admiration is special particle it is universal solvent it is the very substance of communication line and it is that thing which is considered desirable in the game of the three universes admiration goes into the interplay of the universes in the form of madeup objects or 90even in the form of bodies these madeup objects could be called creative pictures these as they become more complex in form take on the aspect of life of their own and become animated beings two viewpoints setting up terminals to be viewed by the other viewpoint demand attention one from the other and will invent all manner of reasons to command the continuing attention of the other viewpoint one of the primary methods of operation is to make ones object or action of object so strange that the other viewpoint cannot look away another is to make the object or action of object so artistic or colorful or interesting that the other viewpoint cannot look away another method is the command by force for attention another method is to inhibit the attention so as to invite it solely to ones objects one can plot this as cycle of demand for attention with curiosity below 400 desire below that enforcement down to as low as 15 on the scale and inhibition at 11 on down the lowest methods of this scale are quite observable amongst men and the primary operation very low on the scale is inhibition of attention elsewhere by cutting the communication lines of another viewpoint an effect is created on the other viewpoint by which that viewpoint fixes with whatever emotion since any attention is better than attention upon the products or objects of that one who cut the communication line there are many methods of cutting communication lines common one could be summarized as its too horrible over that way for you to look viewpoints are thus given the understanding that they are surrounded by horrible things which they have never perceived and which indeed have never existed but which are said to be there so that they will be forced to give attention hidden influences are the commonest methods of enforcing attention of course any analytical mind is itself hidden influence since it cannot as itself be perceived only its energy and objects can be perceived thus comes about the worship of the hidden influence the fear of the hidden influence the neurosis about hidden influences the goal of seeking attention is to receive the particle admiration one creates effects simply in order to create effects but he is given the bonus of admiration when he creates sufficient effect or what is most important when he demands commands and is able to effect admiration by duress it might be said that there was eating until one was so furious about not being admired that one slew as punishment the tiger walking through the woods with his beautiful stripes it could be humorously offered would never have eaten thing and would not be eating today if some monkey had not chattered insults at him instead of admiring him the tiger compelled the admiration of the monkey by pinning him down and eating him up it can be observed that the eating of living flesh or live cells delivers kind of admiration to the taste and it can be observed that under torture duress of all kinds the tortured one will suddenly if degradedly admire his torturer energy pictures which we call mockups are created things which themselves contain admiration it could be said that these are prior to bodies the acquisition of admiration by pain by eating or by devouring something that belongs to somebody else was later succeeded by better communications system which would prevent eating on such rigorous scale this thing was sex which is an interchange of condensed admiration particles which forwards new bodies into being so far as the body of homo sapiens is concerned its desire not to be eaten has been answered evidently by sex and sex performs the function of continued survival of form thus so long as one has the symbol of sex to offer one feels relatively secure and when he does not have that symbol to offer one feels insecure but of this evolution of admiration and of evolution itself we have high degree of certainty as we first begin to observe and it is offered here as an explanation of why it is thing we do not particularly need and thing of which we will or will not gain future certainty as we go up the scale of awareness many things are nonexistent low on the scale many things are uncertain on the scale at low levels which become high level certainties up on the 91scale but this certainty only depends on the positiveness of observation or the positiveness of observation which says the thing does not exist it is not the purpose of scientology to present an uncertainty and then demand that it be accepted for here is the gradient scale of process by which one can become more certain if there be immortality or even the lack of necessity on the part of the analytical mind to be specific object then one will find it out in due course as he is processed if they do not exist again one will find it out this would be matter of progressive observation where thing exists in the form of an uncertainty it has tendency to plague the reactive mind for the reactive mind itself deals only with uncertainties and its convictions are based entirely on blows and pain very basic uncertainty comes about on the subject of applause high on the scale one performs for an effect and knows that it is an effect whether or not there is any attention or admiration which is to say applause little lower on the scale one desires nod or the actual substance of admiration if it does not come he is not concerned but even lower on the scale the individual actively invites and requests applause lower than that he becomes angry in the absence of applause lower than that he exhibits fear grief and apathy in the lack of applause apathy is the realization that there will never be any applause for any effect that which is not admired tends to persist for the reactive mind does not destroy one can become fixed upon producing certain effect simply by insisting that it be admired the longer it is not admired the longer one is likely to persist in demanding that it be admired which is to say exhibiting it until at length it breaks down scale to lower level and he realizes it will not be admired at which time he becomes the effect of it here one has become the effect of ones own cause here is the psychosomatic illness which began as pretended infirmity in order to create an effect perhaps it was once applauded but not sufficiently and after while was not applauded at all and one was forced to applaud it himself and believe it himself and so it came into existence and was for him certainty this too is the course of responsibility which degenerates into irresponsibility at the top of the scale one knows that he is causing the effect lower on the scale he says he is not causing the effect even though he is causing the effect only he knows he causes it even lower on the scale he does not take the middle step he causes an effect and instantly believes that something else caused the effect rather than himself and that he is the effect of the effect one can see cause and effect working in terms of viewpoints if one has not been applauded for many things one will begin to take the position of the audience one does the trick creates the thing and then goes out front sits down over the whole theater and applauds it for one can be knowing viewpoint from many places this is often the case with writer who is seldom confronted by his readers indeed most editors are so low toned that they cut off all the admiring letters of writer and leave him to wonder as other things influence the writer he goes down scale to point where he believes the things he writes are not admired and so he has to go out and sit in the audience this is the first step to becoming the effect of his own cause after while he thinks he is the audience when he does this he is longer the writer thus with the painter thus with anyone the little child is quite bent on causing effects and getting things admired he is continually being evaluated in terms of what is to be admired evaluation is the reactive minds conception of viewpoint the reactive mind does not perceive it evaluates to the analytical mind it may sometimes appear that the reactive mind has viewpoint the reactive mind does not have viewpoint it has an evaluation of viewpoint thus the viewpoint of the analytical mind is an actual point from which one perceives perception is done by sight sound smell tactile etc the reactive minds viewpoint is an opinion based on another opinion and upon very small amount of observation and that observation would be formed out of uncertainties thus the confusion of the word viewpoint itself it can be point from which one can be aware which is its analytical definition and it can be somebodys ideas on certain subject which is the reactive definition 92because the analytical mind and reactive mind in men can become confused one with the other one is most prone to assume the actual perception point of that person who has most evaluated for him father and mother for instance have evaluated about art habits goodness behavior badness how one should dress what manners are to such degree that the child has choice it seems to him but to assume their points to look from and so we will find the child observing things as his father or mother would observe them and even wearing his fathers glasses or his mothers glasses as he grows older he has confused evaluation with actual perception where he has been told that he is bad looking ugly ridiculous unmannerly crude and so forth by somebody else continually his reactive mind which like prostitute cares nothing for its master and serves anyone eventually causes him to lose his viewpoint of himself and he sees himself not by observation but by evaluation as something undesirable of course he would rather be something than nothing he has indeed horror of being nothing so it is better to be something ugly about which he is guessing than to be nothing at all and so he persists and continues as he is furthermore because he has been talked to so much about talking about looking about perceiving in general he has gotten the idea that his communications system is unalterable his whole business of living actually is communications system with the motivation of causing effects thus the lower he is on the tone scale the more he persists without change except downward the characteristic actions of the energy produced by the analytical mind are summarized above in terms of the top and bottom of the scale however the most important of these seem to be reaching and withdrawing in the mest universe we have start stop and change as the characteristics of motion the analytical mind however with its dimension points is more concerned with reaching and withdrawing this is the way it perceives it can control by creating or using energy such as that in the physical universe and it uses this energy to start stop and change other energy but in itself its handling of dimension points direction consists of reaching and withdrawing compulsive reaching compulsive withdrawing bring about many odd and interesting manifestations the sensation of pain is actually sensation of loss it is loss of beingness loss of position and awareness therefore when one loses anything he has tendency to perceive less for there is less to perceive something has withdrawn from him without his consent this would be the definition of loss this brings about eventually condition of darkness this could also be called an arc break if he has lost something the guilty party is probably in the other two universes it is either the physical universe or anothers universe which has caused the loss thus he has less communication since he is unwilling to communicate which is to say put out things in the direction of something which is going to take them and carry them away without his further consent this brings about reduction of the desire to be aware which is the reduction of affinity reduction of agreement reality and the reduction of communication in general in moment of severe disappointment in ones fellow man the universe around him actually grows dark simply as an experiment one can say to himself that he has the only viewpoint there is that all other viewpoints are simply mocked up by him he will get an almost immediate diminution of lightness around him this is the same mechanism as the mechanism of loss the result of too much loss is darkness another mechanism of the darkness and unawareness settling over person is brought about by the loss of viewpoint which has greatly evaluated for one one has had mother or father who over evaluated about everything and then this parent or guardian or ally in life such as teacher died or inexplicably disappeared one was depending for actual looking seeing hearing upon the continued existence of this individual suddenly that individual goes and all becomes dark after that one is not able to perceive ones own universe for one was most of the time actually perceiving the lost persons universe and now that universe is longer there which gives one the idea that he has universe to perceive this even dims his perception of the physical universe of course because of the interdependence of the triangle of the three universes when one has had an insufficient amount of admiration from sexual partners the physical body which depends mainly upon sex for its sensation and continuance to almost as 93great degree as upon eating will actually begin to change viewpoint to the other sex thus we find some older men becoming as women some older women becoming as men thus we get the failure of the androgen and estrogen balances and the resultant decay of the body here in the matter of sex one finds reaching and withdrawing rising to considerable magnitude the reactive mind operating the body conceives itself to be withdrawing and does not know from what it is withdrawing for it perceives itself to be under the compulsion of reaching and does not know for what it is reaching in terms of processing it is withdrawing from or reaching towards sexual partners when it withdraws great deal or when it has been withdrawn from great deal the reactive mind conceives the body to be covered with blackness this resolves in terms of sex and eating it should be fully understood however that this is the resolution of the problem of the body and this resolution is employed only when the analytical mind cannot be brought itself into an immediate height of awareness using sop 8 when one addresses the body itself and only the body one addresses the subject of sex and the subject of eating in terms of reaching and withdrawing the particular processes used on this are called matched terminalling or double terminalling this is done in the following fashion even when the individual cannot create forms of his own he can at least create two ideas in front of him he can put form with an idea or an idea itself facing another idea out in front of him both of them exactly alike withdrawing from sex reaching towards sex he will very often find other terminals he did not create suddenly appearing when he has run withdrawing those things he puts up will be black and the object from which it is withdrawing will be white he should get the idea that the whitish object is reaching and the blackish object is withdrawing he should then run this identical terminal as though it is being put up by somebody else not himself again with withdrawing for blackness reaching for greyness and then he should run it as though somebody is putting it up for somebody else other than himself these three causations of putting up this identical idea facing itself are himself another for him and others for others this is called matched terminalling double terminalling simply puts up two pairs of matched terminals the pairs may each be of two different things but each pair contains one thing the same as the other pair in other words husband and wife is one pair and husband and wife is the other pair these parallel give one the twoterminal effect necessary for discharge one will find that these terminals discharge one against the other however this is physical body technique and it is limited in use if one becomes very ill in doing it he should turn to what is called later on an unlimited technique or he should do the next to last list in the book self analysis in scientology and do it over and over or he should simply go straight through short eight it has many remedies this matched terminalling for oneself others for oneself and others for others on the subject of reaching and withdrawing on sex can of course be considerably expanded as technique it can have in it compulsion to reach compulsion to withdraw compulsion to reach while somebody else is withdrawing compulsion not to reach and it can be addressed in terms of all those complexes and things which sigmund freud observed empirically while investigating in his practice sigmund freud observed even as you may have observed that persons concern and trouble with his body commonly began at the age of puberty and that curve of his ups and downs did sudden changes at those points where he was defeated sexually where his sexual impotence ceased and where it increased dr freud unfortunately developed fast or deeply workable techniques to resolve problems posed by these observations mainly because the 94selection of sex as the prime motivator was not the selection of the basic mechanics of beingness however the brilliance of freuds theories and his extrapolations from limited amount of data and his courage in standing before whole world and declaring that an unpopular subject was the root of all evil has parallel in history the complexes he mentioned each and every one are discoverable in the mind by direct observation or electropsychometry and are resolvable in the body by the technique of matched terminals in brackets which is the proper name for the above where the level of the case is step iv or step v or below in sop 8 it is necessary to free the analytical mind of the grip of the body the analytical mind cannot withdraw the body is most swiftly reduced to compliance by running the second dynamic this is very far from the end of all of processing but it is the fastest method i have developed for remedying occlusion or accomplishing exteriorization in low step cases in sex and eating the body desires to be an effect most strongly and in these things one does find the strongest desire on the part of the body in terms of immediate accessiblity the analytical mind on the other hand can create its own sensation but it has become dependent upon the body even so it is that part of the beingness which desires to give sensation rather than receive it thus one has the conflict of desire to give sensation crossed with the desire to receive sensation on the part of the reactive mind the bodys desire to receive sensation is so strong that an extremely powerful and persistent uncertainty maybe develops and the primary conflict of the analytical mind and the bodys reactive mind comes about i cannot help but give forth my own admiration to man who working without prior art without electropsychometry without nuclear physics without any broad observation of primitive tribes or ethnology in general separated from his conclusion by every convention of his age yet hit upon and set forth with the weight of logic alone the center of disturbance in the human body he did not live to see his theory completely validated he was deserted by his students who began to write fantastic theories completely unworkable and far from the point which yet were better accepted in discouragement at the end of his career he wrote paper called psychoanalysis terminable and interminable freud with method of direct observation spoke of pre natals birth trauma and verbally if not in writing of past existences and of the continuing immortality of the individual praise can be great enough to give such man and the credit i give him for my own inspiration and work is entirely without reservation or bounds my only regret is that i do not know where he is today to show him his 1894 libido theory completely vindicated and freudian psychoanalysis delivered beyond his expectations in five hours of auditing the analytical mind can be processed directly and it improves simply by changing its mind about things but so long as it believes itself to be closely dependent upon the reactive mind and the body it cannot change its opinions these opinions however are not simple shifts of mind they are changes of experience the analytical mind must discover that it can perceive that it can perceive accurately in three universes that it does not need to be dependent upon the body and that it can handle any reactive mind this is done by increasing its powers of perception increasing the number of viewpoints it can assume and increasing its ability to locate spaces actions and objects in time and space and by increasing its ability above that to create space energy and objects this is done by drills and by the procedure of the first three steps of sop 8 it should not for one moment be thought that one is trying to perform by the gradient scale of increasing certainties in scientology all the tricks and exhibitions of which the ancients speak we are not even vaguely interested in moving physical universe objects throwing 95lighting about or in creating solids which can be seen by others we are only interested in the rehabilitation of the analytical mind to point where it can handle any reactive mind whatever its proximity to that reactive mind we are not interested in other words in the objective reality from another viewpoint of the capabilities of the analytical mind in performing various types of tricks whether it can do these things or not do these things falls into the realm of scientology for it is completely beyond the ability to be certain where the analytical mind is not processed well up and where the observer is very low on the tone scale we are not trying to achieve the certainty of mysticism necromancy or to be blunt the indian ropetrick we are trying to make sane well beings the analytical mind when it is in close proximity to the body is unwittingly continually restimulating reactive mind which some say evolved through very difficult and savage stages just as freud said the suppression in the mind is the suppression of things so bestial so savage that the preclear undergoing professional processing is extremely shocked almost anything and almost any impulse including thirst for pain and desire to create any kind of effect matter how bad will manifest itself while processing the reactive mind cannibalism purely for sensation so as to get the last remnants of admiration of the tortured and dying being becomes subjective certainty to the preclear who undergoes processing and has to have his reactive mind addressed before he can be himself which is of course his analytical mind the more suppression his reactive mind gets the more it restimulates its beastliness the analytical mind is basically good it has suffered from this proximity to the reactive mind it is wonder that plato wrote as he did in an essay about the conduct and behavior of man it is wonder that states are completely convinced that man is beast and must be held in check at pistol point the wonder is that in civilized world so few crimes are committed our desire is to reach the basic goodness of the individual and bring him into level of activity where he does not have to do terrible and gruesome things in order to produce an effect there are various levels as one goes up scale where these manifestations seem to be the all and everything of existence one becomes completely downhearted at the thought that one goes upscale simply to get to point where he can kill and maim and hurt with impunity ones feelings of honor ethics all his finer beingness is revolted at the idea that this is in actuality life he should say instead that this is life in stupid conflict of uncertainties the goal is not to get above such things and ignore them the goal is to achieve the basic decency which is inherent in all of us although i have given you here matched terminal brackets on the subject of reach and withdraw with particular attention to sex you must understand that this is professional auditors technique the first three steps of sop 8 when they can be done can be done by alert interested people from step iv down professional auditor is not simply desirable he is completely necessary this technique which i have given you here turns on when one runs its compulsive aspects particularly when one must reach and cant reach the emotion which we see in sanatoriums which is called insanity and although the turnon is brief and temporary and would wear away in about three days an inexperienced auditor could become quite frightened simply by carrying on with the technique or by getting back to unlimited techniques or by taking self analysis with its next to last list these things could be remedied but these techniques walk on the rim of hell where they are addressed to cases below the level of iv if the test subject or the preclear cannot make space which is to say step iii of sop 8 let professional auditor have him the professional auditor by using matched terminal brackets of reach and withdraw with attention to sex will be able to exteriorize this analytical 96mind and turn on its perceptions this is skilled work however and is little too shockingly intimate to the seamier side of life for tender hands and tender minds even the operation of wasting which is contained in expanded gita is capable of turning on vast amount of illness and somatic on the part of the preclear expanded gita is limited technique which is to say it can be audited perhaps only for ten minutes and at the most for 50 or 60 hours without finding the preclear on the down grade one has to turn to an unlimited technique such as contained in short eight if the preclear becomes too ill trying to waste things just because an unlimited technique is labelled unlimited is reason why it is faint technique these unlimited techniques are extremely powerful theyre very simple but again when one of them becomes too strong for the preclear it is necessary to turn on to something simpler and easier simply getting the idea in two places the idea so to speak facing the idea there by nothing will turn on sick sensation in many preclears this fear of being nothing is very great he will be anything rather than nothing safe technique is that technique which always i repeat always deals in things of which the preclear is certain when one deals with uncertainties one is dealing with circuits one can use double terminalling which is to say two pairs of matched terminals of the preclear being certain of things one never runs things or puts the preclear up against things of which one is uncertain or of which the preclear is uncertain if one wishes the preclear to come on up the tone scale as an example of this on any object thing or idea on any psychosomatic ill or numb portion of the body one has only to run there is something there there is nothing there have it saying there is something here there is nothing here one can do complete bracket on this having the numb or painful or injured area saying there is something here there is nothing here having it then say there is something there there is nothing there having the preclear say about the area there is something there there is nothing there and then the preclear about himself there is something here there is nothing here this makes complete bracket this turns on and off interesting somatics professional auditor could get the somatic or numb area to get the feeling it is reaching while the preclear is withdrawing the preclear reaching while it is withdrawing and bring about change in any somatic as one is dealing with communications systems one must realize that communication depends upon certainty of despatch and receipt and certainty of what it is that is being despatched and received thus one does not deal in uncertainties there is something there is nothing are of course observable certainties because one is topscale the other is bottom scale one does not say what the something is and of course nothingness needs qualifications in the case of the person who has been and is trying to become again one should run out by concepts the former successes the triumphs of that person and the times when he was absolutely certain he had failed one does this with double terminals or matched terminal brackets this is professional technique it was mentioned to by meredith starr one of the great mystics from cyprus that jung had once had great experience and had sought ever since to recover it he gave this as another mans opinion of jung this gives you some clue as to what happens to someone who has great triumph he ever afterwards is not seeking to duplicate the triumph he is seeking the triumph itself this puts him back on the timetrack this is particularly applicable to old 97people one hangs then on to certainties the certainties are important the uncertainties are important only in their production of psychosis it is possible to take sick animal and rehabilitate his idea that he is dangerous by dodging every time he strikes out matter how faintly at one it is possible to rehabilitate an individual who is very low on the tonescale merely by coaxing him to reach out and touch the material universe and touching it to be certain that it is there and having touched it to withdraw the touch and to be certain that he could withdraw certainty is wonderful thing the road toward realizing what certainty is has led these investigations through many uncertainties one had to find out what was before one could find out what could be that work is done it is possible to take large groups and using short eight to bring them each and every one into higher levels of certainty and bringing them into higher levels of certainty brings them into higher levels of communication communication not only with their own bodies but with others and with the material universe and as one raises that level of awareness one raises also the ability to be to do to live today this world suffers from an increasing incidence of neurosis brought about by dependency upon mechanical things which do not think which do not feel but which can give pain to those that live it suffers with an overdose of agreement that there is only one universe so long as it believes that there is only one universe that there is only one universe to study to be studied only one universe to agree with it will continue to seek the lowest end of the scale which is to say that point where all universes become one universe where the triangle vanishes to single point it vanishes completely and where one studies but one corner of the triangle and ignores the other two corners of the triangle and agrees only with one corner of the triangle such as the physical universe one will tend toward that point where that corner of the triangle is coincident with the other two corners and this is death the curse of this world is not actually its atom bomb though that is bad enough the curse of this world is the irresponsibility of those who seeking to study but one universe the physical universe try to depress all beings down to the low order of mechanically motivated undreaming unaesthetic things science as word has been disgraced for the word science means truth and truth means light continual fixation and dependence upon only one universe while ignoring the other two universes leads to darkness to despair to nothingness there is nothing wrong with the physical universe one should not cease to observe the physical universe but one certainly should not concentrate upon it so that he can agree with it and its laws only he has laws of his own it is better far better for the individual to concentrate upon his own universe than to concentrate upon the mest universe but this in itself is not the final answer balance is achieved in the three universes and certainty upon those universes all control is effected by introducing uncertainties and hidden influences look how bad it is over there so youll have to look back at this slavery is effected solely by getting people to fix on one thing that one thing in this case is the physical universe science so called today produces machines to blow your nose produces machines to think for you produces every possible argument as to why you should consider your body frail and unexpendable science under the domination of capital creates scarcity it creates scarcity of universes in fixing one upon one universe only those things which are scarce are those things which the individual has lost his faith in creating in having an individual who cannot create has to hold on to what he has this leads him into holding on to what he has had where he has had certainty in the past that something existed he begins to grip it closer and closer to him his space lessens his beingness lessens he becomes less active the reactive mind that cannot create children has 98lost its hope of creation it then can influence the analytical mind into believing that it can longer create the analytical mind creating artistically in the mest universe and not in its own universe at all and not in other peoples universes that it can recognize goes down scale until it meets on its own level the reactive mind and here at this level we find the enslaver the person who makes things scarce the fellow who uses his ethics so called to enforce his crude judgments and to make things out of beings that could be men here where the reactive mind and the analytical mind have come into parity we have the only effect that can be produced the effect of pain where we have an active desire for pain masking in thousand guises where every good impulse high on the scale is turned into mockery here we have crime here we have war these things are not awareness these things merely act on stimulusresponse mechanism up scale is the high bright breadth of being breadth of understanding breadth of awareness to get there all one must do is to become aware of the existence of the three universes by direct observation 99standard operating procedures step i ask preclear to be three feet behind his head if stable there have him be in various pleasant places until any feeling of scarcity of viewpoints is resolved then have him be in several undesirable places then several pleasant places then have him be in slightly dangerous place then in more and more dangerous places until he can sit in the center of the sun be sure to observe gradient scale of ugliness and dangerousness of places do not let the preclear fail then do remaining steps with preclear exteriorized step ii have preclear mock up own body if he does this easily and clearly have him mock up own body until he slips out of it when he is exteriorized and knows it thoroughly the condition of all exteriorization do step i if his mockup was not clear go to step iii immediately step iii spacation have preclear close his eyes and find upper corners of the room have him sit there not thinking refusing to think of anything interested only in the corners until he is completely exteriorized without strain then do spacation constructing own space with eight anchor points and holding it stable without effort and go to step i if preclear was unable to locate corners of the room easily with his eyes closed go to step iv step iv expanded gita this is an extension of give and take processing test preclear to see if he can get mockup he can see matter how vague then have him waste accept under duress desire and finally be able to take or leave alone each of the items listed below he does this with mockups or ideas he must do the sequence of waste etc in the order given here for each item he wastes it by having it at remote distances in places where it will do good being used or done or observed by something which cannot appreciate it when he is able to waste it in vast quantities the auditor then has him accept it in mockup form until he longer is antagonistic to having to accept it even when it is unpleasant and great force is applied to make him take it again with mockups he must be able to bring himself to desire it even in its worst form then by mockups of it in its most desirable form he must come to be able to leave it entirely alone or take it in its worst form without caring expanded gita remedies contrasurvival abundance and scarcity it will be found that before one can accept very scarce to him thing he has to give it away person with milk allergy must be able to give away in mockup enormous quantities of milk wasting it before he can accept any himself the items in this list are compounded of several years of isolating what factors were more important to minds than others the list lacks very few of the very important items if any additions to or subtractions from this list should not be attempted viewpoint work and pain should be heavily and often stressed and given priority waste have forced upon desire be able to give or take in that order each of the following order of items here is random viewpoint work pain beauty motion engrams ugliness logic pictures confinement money parents

sad thetans personalities cruelty organizations try first healthy bodies strong bodies good perception good recall warning should your preclear become unstable or upset doing this process take him to step vi then return to this list comment the mind is sufficiently complicated that it can be expected to have computations on almost all the above thus there is single clearing button and search for it is at the dictate of circuit the mechanism of circuits being to search for something hidden thus your preclear may begin to compute and philosophize and seek to find the button that will release all this all this releases all the buttons so tell him to relax and go on with the process every time he starts to compute note running the above will bring to the surface without further attention the computation on the case and the service facsimile do not audit these run expanded gita step v present time differentiation exteriorization by scenery have preclear with his bodys eyes study and see the difference between similar real objects such as the two legs of chair the spaces between the back two cigarettes two trees two girls he must see and study the objects it is not enough to remember the objects the definition of case v is mockups only blackness have him continue this process until he is alert use liberally and often then exteriorize by having the preclear close his eyes and move actual places on earth under him preferably places he has not been have him bring these up to him find two similar things in the scene and observe the difference between them move him over oceans and cities until he is certain that he is exteriorized then preferably while exteriorized have him do step i 101this case has to know before he can be his viewpoint is in the past give him present time viewpoints until he is step i by the methods given for step v comment present time differentiation is very good general technique and resolves chronic somatics and improves tone assume other peoples viewpoints as drill not what they think about things but as they look at things in the material universe attempt to be in the location of leaf blade of grass car headlamp etc and view the universe step vi arc straight wire using next to last list of self analysis in scientology which asks preclear to recall something really real to him etc then use the list in self analysis this level is the neurotic it is identified by the preclear having mockups which will not persist or which wont go away use also present time differentiation then go to step iv at any drop in tone return case to step vi step vii psychotic cases whether in or out of body the psychotic appears to be in such desperate straits that the auditor often errs in thinking desperate measures are necessary use the lightest possible methods give case space and freedom where possible have psychotic imitate not mock up various things have him do present time differentiation get him to tell the difference between things by actual touch have him locate differentiate and touch things that are really real to him real objects or items if inaccessible mimic him with own body whatever he does until he comes into communication have him locate corners of the room and hold them without thinking as soon as his communication is up go to step vi but be very sure he changes any mockup around until he knows it is mockup that it exists and that he himself made it do not run engrams he is psychotic because viewpoints in present time are so scarce that he has gone into the past for viewpoints which at least he knew existed by present time differentiation by tactile on objects restore his idea of an abundance of viewpoint in present time if he has been given electric shock do not process it or any other brutality work him for very brief periods for his attention span is short always work psychotics with another auditor or companion present note all steps for all cases if in doubt as to condition of case test with step vi note an operating thetan must also be able to manufacture particles of admiration and force in abundance 102appendix to sop 8 1 any alterations in sop 8 will appear in appendices as they are expected to be minor and to make radical change in the design of the steps in general step i the operating thetan must be able to manufacture and experience to his complete satisfaction all sensations including pain in mockup form and all energies such as admiration and force it will be found that some step i cases will not be able to manufacture admiration particles step ii be very careful not to make lower step preclear while still in body mock up his own body too long any mockup will appear if it is simply put there often enough and long enough providing the preclear doesnt spin in the process the long term manufacture of mockups of ones own body and of admiration may not produce quite the results expected communication lines which should remain shut may open with bad results these lines that are shut appear like hard black cords to the preclear there are two types of techniques in general positive gain and negative gain as defined in the above text positive gain can be administered in unlimited amounts without harm negative gain techniques such as the reduction of engrams and locks doubleterminalling black and white are often limited in the length of time they can be given after few hundred hours of early type auditing the case could be found to slump thus we have in positive gain the unlimited technique which improves the analytical mind in negative gain we have limited in terms of the time it can be audited technique in sop 8 the following steps and processes may be audited without limit step i step iii step v step vi step vii the following steps are limited and should not be audited many hours without changing to another type unlimited for while after which the following steps could be resumed step ii step iv the following steps can be used on groups step iii step v part i and part 2 step vi step vii 103appendix 2 sop 8 certainty processing the anatomy of maybe consists of uncertainties and is resolved by the processing of certainties it is not resolved by the processing of uncertainties an uncertainty is held in suspense solely because the preclear is holding on so hard to certainties the basic thing he is holding on to is i have solution i have solution one of these is positive the other is negative complete positive and complete negative are alike certainty the basic certainty is there is something there is nothing person can be certain there is something he can be certain there is nothing there is something there is nothing resolves chronic somatics in this order one gets the preclear to have the center of the somatic say there is something here there is nothing here then he gets the center of the somatic to say there is something there there is nothing there then the auditor has the preclear say towards the somatic there is something there there is nothing there and then he gets the preclear to say about himself there is something here there is nothing here this is very fast resolution of chronic somatics quite ordinarily three or four minutes of this will resolve an acute state and fifteen or twenty minutes of it will resolve chronic state this matter of certainties goes further it has been determined by my recent investigations that the reason behind what is happening is the desire of cause to bring about an effect something is better than nothing anything is better than nothing if you will match terminals in brackets there is nothing you will find that lot of your preclears become very ill this should be turned around into there is something the way one does matched terminals is to have the preclear facing the preclear or his father facing his father in other words two of each of anything one facing the other these two things will discharge one into the other thus running off the difficulty by bracket we mean of course running this with the preclear putting them up as himself as though they were put up by somebody else the somebody else facing the somebody else and the matched terminal again put up by others facing others the clue to all this is positive and negative in terms of certainties the positive plus the negative in conflict make an uncertainty great number of combinations of things can be run heres list of the combinations the button behind sex is i can begin life anew i cannot begin life anew i can make life persist i cannot make life persist i can stop life i cannot stop life i can change life i cannot change life i can start life i cannot start life very effective process something wrong nothing wrong with you they my mind communication various allies very basic resolution of the lack of space of an individual is to locate these people and these objects which youve been using as anchor points such as father mother and so forth and putting them into matched terminal brackets with this there is father there is father there is grandfather there is grandfather in the compulsive line this can be changed to there must be father there must be father one takes all the allies of an individual and runs them in this fashion the basic law underneath this is that person becomes the effect of anything upon which he has had to depend this would tell you immediately that the sixth dynamic the mest universe is the largest dependency of the individual this can be run out but then any dynamic can be run out in this fashion there is myself there is self and so on up the dynamics any dynamic is preventing from communicating any dynamic is not preventing 104from communicating is intensely effective any such technique can be varied by applying the subzero scale as found in scientology 88008 which is also to be found in an earlier issue of the journal of scientology one runs any certainty out because he knows that between this certainty there is an opposite negative certainty and that between these lies maybe and that the maybe stays in suspense in time the basic operation of the reactive mind is to solve problems it is based on uncertainties about observation thus one runs out certainties of observation the mest general shotgun technique would have to do with there is sex there is sex there is force there is force this could be run of course in terms of matched terminal brackets or even as concepts but one must not neglect to run the overt act phenomenon which is to say getting somebody else getting the concept the processing out of certainties would then embrace i have solution there is solution these two opposite ends would take care of any individual who was hung on the track with some solution for that solution had its opposite people who have studied medicine begin by being certain that medicine works and end by being certain that medicine doesnt work they begin by studying psychology on supposition that it is the solution and finish up believing that it is not the solution this also happens to superficial students of dianetics and scientology thus one should also run dianetics is solution dianetics is not the solution this would get one off the maybe on the subject we are essentially processing communications systems the entire process of auditing is concentrated upon withdrawing communications from the preclear as predicated on the basis of the body and that the preclear cannot handle communications thus the preclear can handle communications the preclear cannot handle communications is shotgun technique which resolves maybes about his communications an intensely interesting aspect of certainty processing is that it shows up intimately where the preclear is aberrated here is the overall basic technique one runs there is there is not the following communications talk letters love agreement sex pain work bodies minds curiosity control enforcement compulsion inhibition food money people ability beauty ugliness presents and both the top and bottom of the chart of attitudes positive and negative in each one basic in all this is the urge of the preclear to produce an effect so one can run i can produce an effect upon mama i cannot produce an effect upon mama and so forth for all allies and one will resolve the fixations of attention on the part of the preclear thus fixations of attention are resolved by certainty processing processing out the production of effect one can occasionally if he so desires process the direct center of the maybe which is to say doubt itself in terms of matched terminals this however is risky for it throws the preclear into general state of doubt the key to any such processing is the recovery of viewpoints i can have grandfathers viewpoint i cannot have grandfathers viewpoint and so on particularly with sexual partners will prove intensely interesting on case there are viewpoints there are viewpoints i have viewpoint i dont have viewpoint blank has viewpoint blank has viewpoint resolves problems one should also realize that when one is processing facsimiles he is processing at one time energy sensation and aesthetics the facsimile is picture the preclear is being affected by pictures mainly and so there are pictures there are pictures forward the case towards handling pictures which is to say facsimiles 105a person tends to ally himself with somebody whom he considers capable of producing greater effects than himself so i she he it can create greater effects i she he it can create effect should be run when one is processing he is trying to withdraw communications reach and withdraw are the two fundamentals in the action of theta must reach and cant reach must withdraw and cant withdraw are compulsions which when run in combination produce the manifestation of insanity in preclear i can reach i cant reach i can withdraw i cant withdraw open up into the fact that remembering and forgetting are dependent upon the ability to reach and withdraw you will find that preclear will respond to you must or you can you must not you cannot there is there is not forgetting and remembering the only reason person is hanging on to body or facsimile is that he has lost his belief in his ability to create the rehabilitation of this ability to create is resolved for instance in person who has had an ambition to write with i can write i cannot write and so forth the loss of this creative ability made the person hang on to what he had the fact that preclear has forgotten how to or longer can himself generate force makes him hold on to stores of force these are very often mistaken by the auditor for facsimiles the preclear doesnt care for the facsimile he simply cares for the force contained in the facsimile because he knows he doesnt have any force any more it should be kept in mind that reaching and withdrawing are intensely productive of reaction in preclear but that preclear who does not respond to reaching and withdrawing and certainty thereon is hung up in very special condition he is trying to prevent something from happening he also prevents auditing from happening he has lost allies he has had accidents and hes hung up at all those points on the track where he feels he should have prevented something from happening this is resolved by running i must prevent it from happening i cannot prevent it from happening i must regain control i must lose all control blackness is the desire to be an effect and the inability to be cause i can create grandfather or ally i cannot create grandfather or ally solves scarcity of allies i want to be aware i want awareness is technique which is basic in attitudes run this as others in matched terminal brackets or in expanded gita certainty there is past certainty there is past certainty there is future certainty there is future certainty it means something else certainty it does not mean anything else certainty there is space certainty there is space certainty there is energy certainty there is energy certainty there are objects certainty there are objects 106short 8 this is short form of standard operating procedure 8 of scientology 8 8008 it can be used on any preclear without any survey of the case and will not get him into any difficulties and should resolve his various computations this can also be used on groups just do the lettered steps in order next to last in self analysis remembering something real etc until auditor is certain preclear has and can do so easily in group ask for show of hands the moment something real is recalled take those hands that went up in couple of seconds and use them for the rest of this take the nohands or slow hands as special group under somebody else and simply drill them on this step until their speed is well up then put them back into the main group or keep all in one group and so on b examine and compare two similar mest objects or spaces and tell the difference keep this up for at least 20 minutes it can be kept up for hours with astonishing case improvement c run wasting healthy bodies then accepting them under duress then wasting them then accepting them under duress do this for 20 minutes or an hour until preclear or group shows signs of relief or amusement d run next to the last list of self analysis for five minutes run duplication this process is the basis of making facsimiles have preclear or group look at mest object then have him or them mock up mockup similar to it but beside it have the mest object and the mockup compared to tell the difference some people get none of the duplicates for quite while but will eventually some start making much fancier objects of the same sort in any result keep this up for 20 minutes f have preclear or group close eyes and locate the corners of the room behind them and keep interested in those corners and not thinking for several minutes g have preclear or group move mest scenery under them individually but at the command of the auditor the scenery is preferably that not before viewed by the preclear or preclears dont let them invalidate what they see this is exteriorization by scenery keep up for 20 minutes h do next to last list of self analysis 5 minutes i examine and compare two present time objects j have one of the members go to the window and look out of the window have the remainder of the group assuming his viewpoint to see what he sees out of the window do this for 10 minutes k start at beginning again and use list over and over what they waste each time through can be changed to work and anchor points avoid pain with this short 8 run healthy bodies for it instead sop 8 is professional auditor technique which deals with the problems of the reactive mind sop 8 from step iv down and including step iv is professional auditor technique short eight is done by someone who has been trained preferably by professional auditor it can be done on group matter how large self analysis in scientology is group technique aimed at the rehabilitation of ones own universe so as to bring it up to level of comparability with ones observations of the mest universe and can be delivered to groups of children or adults by person trained only through the text of self 107analysis in scientology associates have courses in group auditing which are given free of charge and which consist of six hours of tape lectures by l ron hubbard on the administration of self analysis in scientology and the general techniques of group auditing 108sop 8c the rehabilitation of the human spirit scientology the science of knowing how to know has been developed for various applications in the field of human experience where it is utilized by skilled persons to enhance the personal ability and knowledge of others recommended process is standard operating procedure 8 c sop 8c was developed after almost year of observing sop 8 in action in other hands than mine and after observing the frailties and talents of human auditors sop 8c might be called sop 8 modified for clinical laboratory and individual human applications the goal of the system of operation is to return to the individual his knowledge skill and knowingness and to enhance his perception his reaction time and serenity it is entirely incidental that sop 8c is effective on psychosomatic illness on human aberration and social difficulties it is not the intent or purpose of scientology to repair the science is creative science if the fact that human illness disability and aberration uniformly cease to be because of scientology the effect is not intended to be primary and the goal of sop 8c is not their remedy indeed if sop 8c is used to remedy these only it fails as system sop 8c succeeds only when it is addressed towards higher knowingness and beingness ironically in using it human ills vanish only when the auditor concentrates on the goals of the system and neglects the obvious physical disabilities of the preclear in that one creates that which one concentrates upon treatment of illness which validates it in treatment will always tend to be unsuccessful sop 8c was the subject of the camden indoctrination course b from 16 november to 23 december as well as the subject of the phoenix international congress of 28 december 1953 specifically the use of these processes obtain when correctly used without further evaluation for or indoctrination of the preclear the knowledge that he is not body that he is creative energyproduction unit and demonstrates to him his purposes and abilities this energyspace production unit we call thetan that being coined word taken from mathematical symbol the greek letter theta this is the preclear one does not send ones thetan anywhere one goes as thetan when preclear is detected being in one place and finding his thetan in another im over there he is not exteriorized to be exteriorized the preclear must be certain that he is outside his body an uncertain exteriorization requires more work before it becomes an exteriorization sop 8c brings about condition designated as theta clear this is relative not an absolute term it means that the person this thought unit is clear of his body his engrams his facsimiles but can handle and safely control body the state of operating thetan is higher than theta clear and means that the person does not need body to communicate or work it is accomplished with sop 8c the highest theory of sop 8c is that the being is engaged upon game called physical universe this is game requiring barriers which is to say walls planets time and vast distances which last two are also barriers in engaging upon this game he has at last become so conscious of barriers that he is limited in his actions and thoughts he thinks in the case of homo sapiens that he is body barrier hemmed in by vast distances barriers and pinned in timestream system of moving barriers so as to reach only the present these combined barriers have become so formidable that they are not even wellperceived but from being 109strong have become unreal to him the matter is further complicated by invisible barriers such as the eyes or glasses in actuality the thetan is knowingness total in cleared state who yet can create space and time and objects to locate in them he reduces his knowingness only to have action knowingness is reduced by assuming that one cannot know or knows wrongly knowingness is reduced by assuming one must be in certain places to perceive and so know and that one cannot be in certain places space is but does not have to be the first barrier of knowingness with scientology we have the first definition of space space is viewpoint of dimension given viewpoint and four eight or more points to view one has space space is problem of observation not of physics there is question here of whether space energy or objects are real things are as real as one is certain of their reality reality is here on earth agreement as to what is this does not prevent barriers or time from being formidably real it does not mean either that space energy or time are illusions it is as one knows it is for one makes by process of continuous automatic duplication all that one perceives so much for theory in application this theory obtains results of considerable magnitude in changing beingness the thetan is continuously engaged upon cycles of action the basic cycle of action is create resist effects survive and destroy this can be stated in various ways create an object have it resist effects survive and then destroy it or create situation continue it and change it and destroy or end it when thetan leaves cycle which is important to him unfinished he tends to strive to finish it elsewhere or later in disrelated circumstances further he can become overly concentrated upon creating or persistence surviving or upon destroying and so form an unbalanced state of beingness time exists in those things thetan creates it is shift of particles always making new space always at an agreedupon rate thetan does not change in time but as he can view particles objects spaces barriers from many viewpoints he can consider himself to be in timestream which he is not thetans ideas postulates commands beliefs change particles change the thetan does not change either in space or in time just as he is making an effort to do something he cannot help but do survive he is also fighting against doing the only thing he does sit fixed in one position the thetan to produce interest and action operates as paradox he cannot die so he firmly insists and proves continually that he can die he never changes location but only views new locations and constantly lives in horror of being fixed in time and space above that he knows the past and the future and all of the present and so fights to obscure the past and guess the future less theoretically the individual who is processed is at first usually in the body and perceiving with the bodys eyes when exteriorized placed three feet back of his head he is actually out of the body and still in physical universe space he can exteriorized move about and be in places just as though he had body seeing without eyes hearing without ears and feeling without fingers ordinarily better than with these aids this is not like astral walking which is done by the individual who sends body or viewpoint to some other place and perceives with it thetan is as much present where he is as if he were there in body he isnt somebody else than the preclear moving dimly about he is the preclear he is there at first he may be uncertain as to what he is seeing this faculty becomes better as his ability to look hear and feel while exteriorized improves sop 8c improves this perception because the body only perceives what the thetan is perceiving anyway looking feeling hearing of the body is also better with sop 8c but this is only incidental 110when thetan believes too thoroughly he is body he is generally unhappy afraid doubts his own and validates the bodys existence and worries about his inabilities when he is out of the sphere of influence of the body very small one he becomes serene confident and knowing he can handle body better can act faster can recall more and do more while exteriorized than he can while in body society thirsting for more control of more people substitutes religion for the spirit the body for the soul an identity for the individual and science and data for truth in this direction lies insanity increasing slavery less knowingness greater scarcity and less society scientology has opened the gates to better world it is not psychotherapy nor religion it is body of knowledge which when properly used gives freedom and truth to the individual it could be said that man exists in partially hypnotized state he believes on other determinism in many things to his detriment he will be as well as he is selfdetermined the processes of scientology could be described as methods of unhypnotizing men to their own freer choice and better life 111the use of sop 8c this process is designed to be administered by one person the auditor to another the preclear sop 8c is first used step by step from step i on until the person to whom it is addressed knows he is back of his head and longer in the body if the preclear is very difficult to exteriorize the person should be referred to an auditor trained at the hasi clinical center for there are special methods of exteriorization for difficult cases which are contained in but are not at once visible in sop 8c the first three steps are exteriorization steps they should be repeated over and over until certain exteriorization takes place the auditor can go through the first steps many times one after the other with the preclear until exteriorization occurs doing steps iv to vii on person not exteriorized should be minimized earlier sops used all seven steps for exteriorization practice not followed in sop 8c where only the first three steps are used when the preclear has exteriorized one then begins again with step i and continues to step vii in order with the preclear exteriorized here in sop 8c the emphasis is upon an exteriorized thetan when the auditor has taken the exteriorized preclear thoroughly and correctly through steps i to vii at least twice one has then what may be considered theta clear to repeat one uses sop 8c steps i to iii in that order on one of these the first time through the majority of people exteriorize with certainty as soon as exteriorization takes place the auditor starts with step i again does it thoroughly on the exteriorized preclear then the auditor applies step ii thoroughly and so on until all seven are done the auditor knows when the preclear exteriorizes by asking him or by the preclear volunteering the information caution do not ask the preclear to look at his body if the preclear fails to exteriorize sometime during the first three steps the auditor should simply do them again if the preclear fails the second time the auditor patiently goes through them third time and so on if the matter then seems too difficult contact an auditor trained during late 1954 at london by the hasi itself the least possible result in going over these first three steps many times will be considerably bettered condition of the preclear superior to all past results only very few preclears fail to exteriorize after steps i to iii have been several times repeated caution although this process is as foolproof as it can be made it can be maliciously used in this wise by giving the preclear constant losses by giving him chance to win by bullying him by evaluating for him by insisting he is outside when he is not by invalidating him by pretending to see him or his mockups or saying that one does if he does 112sop 8c formulas and steps opening procedure 10 minutes to two hours with mest body send preclear to exact places in room one place at time b have preclear select places in the room and move to them one at time still under auditors direction c have preclear drill in physically holding on to and letting go of objects and spaces on his own decision to hold on decision to let go step i location prelogic theta orients objects in space and time axiom in life experience space becomes beingness formula i permitting the preclear to discover with certainty where people and things are not in the present past and future recovers sufficient orientation to establish his knowledge and certainty of where he is and they are the application of this is accomplished by negative orientation of beingness havingness and doingness on each of eight dynamics in the present past and future step i ask preclear to be three feet back of chair ask him for things people which are not giving him directions orders for things persons he is not giving orders to for things persons which are not giving directions to other things ask preclear for goals he does not have for goals others do not have for others for goals another does not have for him for goals he does not have for another for persons he is not for animals he is not for places where he is not where bacteria is not where objects are not for places where he is not thinking note all of the above are done in brackets for present past and future b if exteriorized have him drill while exteriorized into holding on to and letting go of objects on his specific decision ask him to be in places which are safe dangerous pleasant unpleasant beautiful ugly step ii bodies axiom in life experience energy becomes doingness axiom compulsive position precedes compulsive thinking axiom that which changes the preclear in space can evaluate for him formula ii permit the preclear to discover that he handles bodies and allow him to handle bodies in mockups and actuality and remedy his thirst for attention which he has received by contagion from bodies step ii have preclear mock up bodies and unmock them have him get somethingnesses and nothing nesses of bodies until he feels better about them ask him to be three feet back of chair b if exteriorized have him complete iia many times and then move body while he is outside step iii space prelogic theta creates space and time and objects to locate in them definition space is viewpoint of dimension axiom energy derives from imposition of space between terminals and reduction and expansion of that space formula iii permit the preclear to regain his ability to create space and impose it upon terminals to remove it from between terminals and to regain his security concerning the stability of mest space step iii have preclear hold two back corners of room and not think b if exteriorized have preclear complete spacation note if not exteriorized return to step i 113step iv havingness axiom in life experience matter becomes havingness observation to thetan anything is better than nothing observation any preclear is suffering from problems of too little havingness and any reduction of his existing energy if not replaced will cause him to drop in tone formula iv the remedy of problems of havingness is accomplished by creating an abundance of all things b as the preclear has rendered automatic his desires and ability to create and destroy and has thus placed havingness beyond his control the auditor should place in the control of the preclear his automaticities of havingness and unhavingness and permit him on his own self determinism to balance his havingness c how to make havingness have preclear put out eight anchor points of size thus creating space have him pull in these eight to the center and have him retain the resulting mass do this using large and various objects for anchor points do this until he is willing to release such old energy deposits as engrams and ridges but still continue to make havingness step iv have preclear remedy problems of havingness by mocking up and pulling together sets of eight anchor points do this many times do not have him make anchor points explode in this fashion have him save masses thus created have preclear adjust anchor points in body step v terminals axiom space exists by reason of anchor points definition an anchor point is any particle or mass or terminal axiom energy is derived from mass by fixing two terminals in proximity in space axiom selfdeterminism is related to the ability to impose space between terminals axiom cause is potential source of flow axiom effect is potential receipt of flow axiom communication is the duplication of the receipt point of that which emanated at cause point axiom wrongness in terms of flow is inflow formula v the thetan is rehabilitated as to energy and terminals by remedying his postulates about outflow and inflow and drills relating to the outflow and inflow of energy according to the above axioms step v ask preclear for times he could do something times when he couldnt do anything for things he can do for things he cant do for things other people can cant do for things other people can do for others for things another specific person cant do for him for things he cannot do for another or others b ask preclear for objects actions persons ideas he is not destroying for objects actions persons ideas he is not making survive persist for objects actions persons ideas he is not creating present past and future in brackets note ideas are the most important here in brackets c ask preclear for objects persons energies times which are not touching him which he is not touching which are not reaching for him for which he is not reaching for objects persons times from which he is not withdrawing which are not withdrawing from him in brackets d ask preclear for sights which will not blind him for people he will not blind if they see him for noises which will not deafen him for people he will not deafen for spoken words that will not hurt him for spoken words which will not hurt others in brackets ask preclear for ideas that will not destroy cause to survive persist create or upset others in brackets f ask preclear for ideas sounds sights that will not fix people or unfix them from specific places g ask preclear for ideas he is not trying to fix in things for ideas he is not trying to unfix from things in brackets h have him unmock and mock up terminals and move them together and apart until he can make them generate currents 114step vi symbolization definition symbol is an idea fixed in energy and mobile in space formula vi the thetan who has been moved about by symbols is strengthened by mocking up and moving about and fixing in space ideas which have formerly moved him step vi have preclear create symbols which mean nothing ask pc for ideas he is not trying to destroy for ideas he is not trying to make survive persist for ideas he is not trying to create note the above are done in brackets have him mock up ideas and move them about step vii barriers axiom the mest universe is game consisting of barriers definition barrier is space energy object obstacles or time formula vii problems of barriers or their lack are resolved by contacting and penetrating creating and destroying validating and neglecting barriers by changing them or substituting others for them by fixing and unfixing attention upon their somethingness and nothingness step vii have preclear reach and withdraw physically then as himself from spaces walls objects times b have preclear do six ways to nothing c have him create and destroy barriers step viii duplication fundamental the basic action of existence is duplication logic all operating principles of life may be derived from duplication axiom communication is as exact as it approaches duplication axiom unwillingness to be cause is monitored by unwillingness to be duplicated axiom unwillingness to be an effect is monitored by unwillingness to duplicate axiom an inability to remain in geographical position brings about an unwillingness to duplicate axiom an enforced fixation in geographical position brings about an unwillingness to duplicate axiom inability to duplicate on any dynamic is the primary degeneration of the thetan axiom perception depends upon duplication axiom communication depends upon duplication axiom in the mest universe the single crime is duplication formula viii the primary ability and willingness of the thetan to duplicate must be rehabilitated by handling desires enforcements and inhibitions relating to it on all dynamics step viii ask preclear for actions forms and ideas which do do not duplicate specific other people for actions forms ideas by which specific other people do do not duplicate specific other people for actions forms ideas of others which do do not duplicate him b have preclear duplicate physical objects and people and possess himself of duplicates c have him make noduplicates of objects and people d have him duplicate somethings and nothings group c group c is process used on large numbers of people it is composed of the following steps of sop 8c step 1a step iia step iiia step va to h step vi step vii step viii 115glossary pc stands for preclear person being processed mockup selfcreated image the preclear can see bracket is done as follows for preclear for another others for others others for self another for preclear preclear for another see step ia special note the first three steps of sop 8c could be classified as beingness steps the remaining five steps of sop 8c could be classified as havingness steps sop itself in all eight steps constitutes doingness thus approximating as described in scientology 88008 the spacebe energydo timehave triangle special note in its entirety sop 8c could be considered as various exercises in formula h which involves the most basic action of the thetan which is reaching and withdrawing special note it will be noted that the negative orientation techniques are done in such way as to make the preclear without his being told to do so create space the auditor should pay specific attention when the preclear is discovering where things are not that the preclear be caused to note specifically each time the exact location and position where the thing does not exist this calls the preclears attention to various positions which in themselves thus located create space thus throughout sop 8c the rehabilitation of space is also to be found the definition of space being space is viewpoint of dimension special note in his auditing if the auditor does not get communication change on the part of the preclear whether better or worse every five or ten minutes either the auditor is using the wrong step at the time in which case he should progress on into the steps or the preclear even if he says he is is not complying with the auditors orders the auditor thus should remain in continuous communication with the preclear so far as possible and should ascertain with great care what the preclear is doing after he indicates that he has complied with the direction and to discover every five or ten minutes if there has been change in certainties or communication the commonest source of failure in any step in sop 8c is failure on the part of the preclear to execute the orders given as it was intended to be executed or on the part of the auditor in failing to ascertain whether or not the preclear is executing properly or if there has been communication change careful check of auditors and preclears utilizing sop 8c has demonstrated in each case where its use was becoming lengthy that the auditor was failing to ascertain from the preclear whether or not there had been communication changes and it was also uniformly discovered that the preclear who was failing to get results while being audited with sop 8c was not doing the steps as directed but was either avoiding by not doing them at all although he said he was doing them or was failing to understand the direction and so was executing the step in some other way the first goal which an auditor must achieve is willingness in the preclear to receive directions the condition of the preclear is such in nearly all cases that he has chosen as main point of resistance in life direction of himself other than his own because the physical universe is designed to resist and overcome that which resists it continuous resistance to other direction than ones own results finally in loss of ability to greater or lesser degree to direct oneself in that it is the ability to direct himself which the auditor is seeking to return to the preclear it must be demonstrated to the preclear solely by the process of good auditing that other direction is not necessarily harmful or in the worst interest of the preclear thus to some degree he ceases to resist incoming direction and by ceasing to resist it longer validates it as barrier and so is not concentrating attention on resisting direction but is able to use it freely in his own selfdirection the selfdeterminism of preclear is proportional to the amount of selfdirection he is capable of executing and deteriorates markedly when great deal of his attention is devoted to preventing other direction directing himself the preclear becomes 116capable of execution preventing direction of himself resisting the direction of others brings about condition where he is mainly devoted to resisting his environment the latter results in diminishing of space of the preclear the first step in the rehabilitation of the preclear in selfdirection is therefore limiting of the amount of resistance he is concentrating on other direction and demonstrating to him that his following of the steps of sop 8c under the direction of an auditor is not harmful but on the contrary increases his command and control of himself and brings him at last to the point where he can neglect and ignore the continuous stimulus response operation of the physical universe it can be seen clearly then that the auditor who sets himself up to be resisted will fail for the preclear is mainly concentrating upon resisting the auditor this is the primary factor in all auditing the preclear is brought to point of cooperation in terms of direction without the use of hypnosis or drugs and without argument or convincingness on the part of the auditor by which is meant overbearing demeanor at the same time it should be the sole intention and operation of the auditor that his own directions be carried out explicitly by the preclear and that these be performed with minimum of communication break and with maximum of affinity communication and reality using the formula that that which changes the individuals position in space can evaluate for the individual the auditor in using sop 8c should use at the beginning of the first session and in any session where the preclear becomes unreasonably uncooperative in following simple directions the following procedure the auditor has the preclear walk to specific points in the room touch hold and let go of various specific objects the auditor should be very exact in his directions the auditor should do this even on an apparently co operative case at least twenty minutes before going on to the next step in opening procedure when the preclear drilled in this fashion has at length realized without being told that the auditors directions are quiet reliable exact and to be performed and not until then uses this process preclear is asked to send himself to various parts of the room and do specific things the auditor is very specific and exact about this in that he has the preclear decide on his own determinism and before moving from the spot where he is standing what part of the room he is going to send himself to when the preclear has decided this and only then but not necessarily telling the auditor the preclear then takes himself to that part of the room the auditor must be very exact that the decision to go to certain part of the room and to reach or withdraw from certain thing is made before the preclear takes an actual action and then the auditor should make sure that the preclear has done exactly what he decided he would do before he moved in such wise coached by the auditor the preclear is led to direct himself to various parts of the room until he is entirely sure that he is directing himself to certain parts of the room and that the orders are coming from nobody but himself of course before each new place is chosen the auditor tells the preclear to choose new place and tells him when to go there the third stage of this opening procedure is then as follows the auditor has the preclear be in one spot in the room and then has the preclear decide there to go to another spot in the room the preclear leaves the auditor has the preclear change his own mind and go to yet another spot this last is done to lessen the preclears fear of changing his mind to strengthen his decision and to lessen his reaction to his own mistakes the last two steps of opening procedure are done at some length it is profitable by the experience of many auditors to spend as much as an hour on opening procedure even in case which is not in poor condition when opening procedure is omitted or is not carried on far 117enough the auditor may discover that it will take him from five to ten hours to get the case working this time is saved by the expenditure of much less time in using opening procedure even when the preclear is complacent even when the preclear is an obvious step 1 even when the preclear shows outward sign of resistance to other direction than his own the first communication lag lessening which the auditor will perceive on the case will probably occur during the use of opening procedure further the certainty of the case is heightened further opening procedure is for any level of case an excellent process the preclear who is familiar with sop 8 may conceive that he is doing step which is reserved for psychotics the preclear should be disabused of such concept since the step is used today on all cases in the case of preclear who is very resistive opening procedure can be used with considerable profit for many hours for such activity however an auditing room of the usual dimensions is usually too constrictive and the drill may be carried on as well out of doors even if only on street 118group processing for successful group processing the following are near absolutes 1 the group auditor must be able to grant beingness to the group stage fright and timid commands have place in group auditing an auditor who is afraid of group will q and with the group as soon as it gets an effect he changes the process he changes commands when the group changes aspect 2 commands must be simple clear concise evenly spaced without sudden breaks of pace or jarring interjections of loudness 3 the processes should be objective addressing the environment not the thinkingness of the group opening procedure adapted to group run long enough would exteriorize everyone present 4 every command given should be run long enough to flatten every communication lag present 5 every process used should be run long enough consecutively to flatten the process itself 6 the auditors code in full should be obeyed if these rules are vigorously followed good results can be attained in group processing here are some standard processes for groups each is one hour session session 1 spot some spots on the front wall spot some more spots spot some more spots and so on for some time then spot some spots on the floor spot some more spots on the floor and so on for some time then without turning around spot some spots on the back wall some more spots and so on then spot spots on the front wall again then the floor then the back wall if the ceiling is used in this their necks get tired very quickly session 2 spot some spots in your body pause spot some spots in the room pause spot some spots in your body pause spot some spots in the room alternate these two commands for at least one hour session 3 examine your chair pause examine the floor pause examine your chair pause examine the floor and alternate these for at least one hour session 4 wheres your face pause wheres your face pause wheres your face pause and so on for at least one hour session 5 start laughing pause keep on laughing pause laugh pause keep on laughing just these for at least an hour session 6 where are you pause where are you pause where are you pause for at least one hour session 7 very arduous one opening procedure by duplication have each person in the group hold two objects one in each hand be very sure as an auditor not to vary your commands call the object in your left hand object one call the object in your right hand object two look at object one what is its color temperature weight look at object two what is its color temperature weight look at object one what is its color temperature weight look at object two what is its color temperature weight use these over and over for at least an hour never give less than an hour of 119opening procedure by duplication never do it for only half an hour much less fifteen minutes this is the first step of what scientologists call dirty 30 for the convenience of the auditor this list is given object one color temperature weight object two color temperature weight session 8 this is very arduous duplication by attention put up two black pieces of material somewhat above eye level at least ninety degrees apart from the preclear hang them up on the walls ahead of the group so all can see them one on the forward right wall one on the forward left wall is best describe them to the group as object one and object two put your attention on object one now put your attention on object two now put your attention on object one now put your attention on object two do this without variation for at least an hour on duplication processes somebody in the audience usually claims this is hypnotism for it runs out hypnotism it induces trances people who think so simply dont know much about hypnotism session 9 this is in four parts do each part exactly fifteen minutes it is run with the groups eyes closed find the two back corners of the room hold on to them and dont think the auditor repeats this quietly and reassuringly every few minutes until fifteen minutes is reached then at fifteen minutes past the hour he says now find third back corner of the room hold on to three of the back corners of the room sit still and dont think he repeats hold on to three of the back corners of the room and sit still and dont think at the half hour he says now find all four back corners of the room hold on and dont think he repeats every few minutes the four back corners of the room and dont think when the fortyfive minutes mark of the process has been reached the auditor says now locate the eight corners of this room hold on and dont think and repeats eight corners dont think every few minutes at the hour mark the process could be repeated if so do it again exactly as above session 10 description processing should not be done on the groups some of whose members have questionable stability use only sessions 1 to 6 on such groups when group has been much run almost any form of description processing can be used session 10 however consists entirely of one command which is not changed for at least half an hour this is how close does your body seem to you now pause how close does your body seem to you now pause how close does your body seem to you now and so on in processing groups duplication of command is part of the process keep it simple grant them beingness keep them in contact with present time and out of their facsimile bank and youll get group processing clears make it complicated make them figure be shy and the group wont come back never worry about boring them the reason theyre spun in is because the body and the confusion were

the entity or machine set up to carry out the automatic functions of the body this entity or machine in lower level case may work at considerable crosspurposes with the thetan grand tour process used on an exteriorized thetan to free him from the craving for mass and to bring into present time greater portion of the mest universe havingness mass occupying the same space as the preclear over his total experience the preclear has become accustomed to having or identifying himself with considerable mass both in the form of physical universe matter and in the form of energy masses such as facsimiles until the 123thetan has rehabilitated his considerations that he can create mass at will the loss of any mass causes discomfort and lessened awareness when havingness is remedied by having the preclear bring in masses these symptoms disappear i the thetan the center of awareness that part of the total organism that is fundamentally cause invalidation statement action or inference that makes the preclear appear wrong invalidation along with evaluation ie pressing on the preclear an otherdetermined consideration are the two shuns to be most strenuously avoided by the auditor

deceased line charge prolonged spell of uncontrolled laughter or crying which may be continued for several hours once started line charge can usually be reinforced by the occasional interjection of almost any word or phrase by the auditor the line charge usually signals the sudden release of large amount of charge and brings about marked change in the case lock an apparently minor incident which assumes an unreasonable importance due to its containing some similarity to and restimulating an earlier engram or engram chain also an incident containing enforcement or inhibition of affinity

point point of reference from which the position of other objects is judged people are often found still using orientation points from childhood which may be thousands of miles from their present time

motion something one picks out and agrees not to predict at very low case levels it appears that everything is randomity but as the case level rises it can actually reach point where the preclear

is to accept that one operated as cause in the matter responsibility refers solely to cause and not to other considerations such as goodness or badness of the thing caused it should be clearly distinguished from such lower level considerations as blame praise etc which include further evaluation sanity the degree to which an individual is able to operate with selfdeterminism or above this with pandeterminism an individual is as unsane as he is motivated by other determinism sanity is also measured by the degree to which the individual accepts responsibility for himself his actions and his environment scientology the science of knowing how to know answers it is wisdom in the tradition of 10000 years of search in asia and western civilization it is the science of human affairs which treats the livingness and beingness of man and demonstrates to him pathway to greater freedom selfdeterminism the ability to regulate and take responsibility for ones own considerations motivation by the thetan rather than by the environment lowlevel case is determined almost entirely by its present and past environments the goal of processing is to restore to him selfdeterminism and above this pandeterminism somatic pain the physical origin of which is in the past the pain may have perfectly valid present time causes such as constriction of the blood vessels tensions in the muscles etc however the original injury to the body by the environment is not in present time but has been restimulated by something in the present environment similar to that at the time of the original injury

characteristics of another individual an individual may have number of valences which he puts on and off as he might hats often these changes are so marked that an observant person can notice him dropping one valence and putting on another the shift from valence to valence is usually completely outside the awareness and control of the individual doing so in other cases an individual has one valence not his own in which he is thoroughly stuck valence winning the assumption by an individual in particular situation of the characteristics of another individual who in the consideration of the first was habitually successful in similar situations for example if the preclears father was domineering toward the mother and usually got his own way it would be quite common to find the preclear assuming the valence of his father in his dealings with his wife or even with women in general viewpoint point from which to view the first consideration of thetan in creation is the assumption of viewpoint from which to view that to be created viewpoint remote viewpoint without the consideration by the thetan that he is located at that point the thetan may have any number of remote viewpoints

simply locations and spot that same location repeatedly without variation the auditor says spot spot in the space of this room the preclear does so the auditor ascertains whether or not the spot has color mass or whether it is simply location in space which is what he wants the spot should not have color or mass it should have only location the preclear is asked to locate several such spots in the room and is asked to walk over and put his finger on them spotting spots markedly decreases havingness so remedy of havingness is necessary after very few spots have been spotted in this fashion the auditor will discover that if the preclear is asked to put his finger on the same spot and take his finger off and put it back on several times that preclear in bad condition will locate the spot in various places close to the original spot but will not locate the original spot again preclear must be brought to point where he will locate the original spot every time good two way communication as in all processes is maintained while spotting spots is progressing when the preclear can adequately locate repeatedly and without upset spots of mass or color in the room he is then asked to locate them outside the room the ordinary phenomenon is that the preclear has various spots in this universe out of location much more modern method of running spotting spots in space is to locate spot and say hello to it and have it say okay back and then have the spot say hello and have the preclear say okay back to it until the spot itself is in present time the auditor can go into this even further having the preclear sending showers of hellos and receiving back showers of okays from the spot and having the spot sending showers of hellos and having the preclear sending showers of okays back to the spot this can be done with any spot whether significant or not it can be done to the place where an accident has just occurred it can be done to the area where the delivery of birth was effected on the preclears body it can be done to his school it can be done variously and continually grand tour is the route 1 or exteriorized version of spotting spots the auditor asks the preclear to be in spot of certain description such as his home town asks him to be in the auditing room asks him to be in his home town asks him to be in the auditing room this is the modern way of running grand tour the modern way of running grand tour is when the preclear is asked to be in spot immediately above his home town to have the preclear send showers of hellos and receive showers of okays from the home town and then when he is asked to be back at the auditing room to send showers of hellos and okays at it in otherwords any position or any motion in the grand tour is accompanied by hellos and okays on twoway basis naturally once one has had showers of hellos sent to spot and it has sent back showers of okays one must now have the spot send showers of hellos to the preclear and he must send showers of okays back at it this will be found to remedy positional difficulties with the preclear as well as time difficulties the reason an engram comes into being and expresses itself on preclears body is lack of communication the communication has become solid it expresses itself as an engram as facsimile as lock as secondary this expression comes about through absence of twoway communication the moment that one runs twoway communication in upon the process the spot has tendency to go back to its original location this is the phenomenon known as snapping or closing terminals it quite often occurs that when the preclear is asked to spot let us say london he actually points in an entirely incorrect position and direction london is sufficiently disoriented as far as he is concerned to cause him to lose it he may have picture of london sitting right in front of him and yet he is being audited in south africa he will spot this picture as the location of london london has snapped terminals upon him or he has snapped terminals upon london in other words there is distance between the spot where he is and where london is this means that the material on the subject of london is engramic lack of mass is one explanation of why the terminal snap occurs fear of and resistance to the spot is the actual reason why it closes terminals in doing the grand tour one will discover if he sends the preclear between the empire state building in new york city and the washington monument in washington dc that preclear who is having difficulty with havingness and locations will at first discover the empire state building to be some distance from the washington monument and then will discover that the empire state building and the washington monument are almost exactly together and then will discover that they have sprung apart the auditing command producing this phenomenon is simply be over the empire state building okay be over the washington monument okay be over the empire state building okay be over the washington monument okay in other words the spots snap together actually the spots themselves are not snapping together what is snapping together is the facsimiles of the spots as long as location is expressing itself in terms of facsimile one knows immediately two things that the havingness of the area is low and there is lack of communication in existence about this spot the preclear does not want to communicate about it one remedies this in the crudest form by having hellos sent between himself and the spot one by adding the factor of communication to this would have process run with the following commands be over the washington monument when the preclear is there send shower of hellos at it have it send you shower of okays have it send you shower of hellos send it shower of okays the auditor of course each time the preclear performs any action in any auditing of any kind acknowledges the fact aloud with an all right or fine or good or an okay thus adding to the amount of communication on the subject failure of the auditor to do this has tendency to stick the preclear in the sessionminor 4 1955 ca early may the magazine of dianetics and scientology from phoenix arizona the scale of awareness l ron hubbard this article is transcription of an important preliminary discussion by ron of his investigations out of which have come very practical advances in the handling of communication and the discovery of the preclears level of reality in processing the talk was given at staff auditoracc conference of april 4 1955 ill give you quick rundown on some data which has just materialized hereits an experimental scale and this experimental scale is quite interesting it really is scale of awareness scale of awareness would begin at the top with of course aware of being aware if person were really aware of being aware it would be sufficient communication for him merely to be aware of the existing environment if he were simply aware of the existing environment he would feel he was in communication and would feel very goodhe wouldnt have to talk about it you get that level all right now we drop down from there and its easier to describe from the bottom up on the bottom is communication with self with significance worry he can communicate with himself and he can worry now that isnt the exact bottom of the scale but the next lower leveland thats unconsciousnessbecomes questionable as communication level but nevertheless it really belongs with this scale so we look at this and we find out that the guy could be aware of thinking thought containing much significance but not expressing it immediately below this level as i say is unconsciousness which of course goes off the awareness scale and is the reverse of awareness but as we work up from absolute unconsciousness we find unconsciousness is the only thing which each higher step has in common with the last step until we get to total awareness of awareness so each one of these steps is to some degree salted with unconsciousness and up to the moment when you would get to absolute complete unconsciousness every one of these steps would have some unconsciousness in it but absolute complete unconsciousness happens to be an absolute it happens to be unobtainable complete unconsciousness is not obtainable nobody has ever been or ever will be completely unconscious and this is fact because processes do work out on unconsciousness so the bottom of the scale would be absolute complete unconsciousness but its not the bottom of the scale because that cant exist so we would go up there to lesser and lesser degrees of unconsciousness and greater and greater degrees of consciousness now one of the best descriptions around that i have written on this unconsciousness business is self analysis the first few chapters on self analysis is discussion of unconsciousness and when we consider alertness we are considering ability now weve been talking about this for some time we consider alertness then we consider ability awareness if person is aware of something he normally can control it all right we look this over and we find out that the place for person to be on the tone scale would be at awareness of awareness and we find out that he there would have sufficient communication just with his environment to stay cleared get that he could stay cleared but now lets start out from this level of complete unconsciousnesslets go intothe first point on the scale which is actually there on the scale some small matter how small awareness that he is thinking thought and communicating with the thought he is thinking and that level includes the deepest anaesthetic possible and it includes death he always has some tiny little spark of awareness there in spite of the ambition of the medico the anaesthetist etc he is aware that he is thinking something matter whether he thinks that its somebody elses thinking or not hes just aware of some thinking the next broad level here is communication with significance of course in between thinking thought and thinking it to himself we get gradients of that so the individual knows when he is thinking thought and knows when hes not thinking thought naturally thats part of that same scale the next broad level is this communication with significance with somebody else you know what we mean with significance its got to have reason its got to have meaning there has to be an intent the next big broad scale thats parked right up above this is simply communication with intent to communicate the next broad level up above this simply requires that one knows of the existence of communication and the next level above that is simply awareness of an environment as sufficient communication now as we go down from that to the bottom we find out we are more and more fixed and less and less capable of spanning attention so lets look at communication between two people as fixed doubleterminal affair the individual is less aware of his immediate environment at communication with self hes not aware of his environment out here at all and so we get the contracting perimeter of the dynamics which weve discussed before as we go down this awareness scale which is also communication scale we get the individual closer and closer in untilone of the early symptoms of ithe doesnt think anybody could possibly hear him unless hes standing with his face right in their face and the next spot below that is real worry now this individual may be across the room it doesnt matter now lets add to this and we get the actual name of this scale and it is the scale of reality that is the name of the scale now this seems strange if it has to do with awareness and communication that we call it the scale of reality because it is the scale practical scale which is useful in processing now how is it useful in processing were looking at preclear that cant find anything real very easily we suspect he doesnt even know he cant find anything real you know its just the way the case behavesits kind of spooky well this guy the realest thing he could do would be to think thought and know that he thought the thought thats the realest thing the guy could do now if you were to graduate him upscale from this the next thing he could do that would be real to him would be to get the idea of saying something to somebody that has lots of significance to it and having that person say something to him mythical personnel and thats their reality with significance now we go up above this and we find out that the individual could have something real just by hello and ok and one of the reasons were using hello and ok is that it is an unreal communication if preclear can handle hello and ok without balking and consider it real communication this preclear is at that band if he insists that thats bad replyyou know he really wouldnt say hello and then somebody else wouldnt say okhe would go at it possibly on hellos back and forth but he would go on it much better with significances what could you say to pop what could you say to your mother and hed give you significances now what could your mother say to you the funny thing about this is the way this scale was traced out its very interesting it was traced out by watching the separation of universes and when these universes come apart they first come apart as worry worrythen think thoughtthink thought the other fellow would thinkthink thought that you would thinkthink thought that the other fellow would think and all of sudden the individual differentiates between the kind of things the other universe thinks and the kind of things that his universe thinks so we get this differentiation our next differentiation up the line would be something you could say to that other universe and something it could say to you and significance significance significance and then i discovered that we had point in the separation of each one of these universes whenhello hello hello with the answer hello was real perfectly real and acceptable the preclear was not even vaguely uncomfortable about it and then hello and oka perfectly real communication and then the fact that the person existed was itself communication and then the fact that the universe existed and the rest of the environment existed too was sufficient cognition without any further processing when you start to pull universes apart on the individual these universes have tendency to go through that span and the universes we dont see are the universes which are totally introverted an individual is actually being his body you see he is in his body he is actually really being his body and then his body is being his fathers universe we could start in by thinking that the most basic universe to separate would be father and mother from him but this isnt the case at all it would really be the thetan so you could separate these other universes but dont forget that we have an artificial enclosure of universe with the thetan in the body and here were immediately talking about exteriorization arent we so you could be almost any one of these universes youd find youd go up on this gradient of reality at first you could have the preclear think thought and think thought and think thought you of course making him express thought youre making him communicate with you but he doesnt notice that and think another thought think another thought now what kind of thought could this other universe think another thought the other universe could think another thought when these become at last flat and squared away youve got these universes well on the way towards separation and then you can go into communication and separate them now this is not hard and fast rule because i have to do considerable more experimentation on it im just letting you in on particular echelon of the spirit this might not hold true we might be able to separate them all all the way up the line by simply thought thought think thought what kind of thought would the other person think what kind of thought would you think the way ive been doing it with great success has been just ask the individual what he could then say to his father now he has just discovered he can separate out his fathers pattern of thinking from his own pattern of thinking now its time to communicate now weve got distance so we get what could you say to your father well have him say okay thats fine now what else could you say to your father etc and then you get this very flat in its turn thinking thought itself became flat thinking his fathers thoughts became flat and then we got communication with significance flat and then we got both ways flat on that and then we got to this point where it is enough for him to say hello or have his father say hello and he says hello and his father says hello he says hello and his father says hello and then you couldyou dont have to move him out of that bracket and have him say hello and his father say ok and this is still real good communication and then he becomes aware of where his father is and at that moment you run into spotting spots got this up to this time all spots are misplaced with connection with this person but right about that time the spots start to go into their proper places the same phenomenon occurs somewhere in that band of hello and ok with pop if its sneaked up on in this fashion as occurred in running 8d in limited number of cases and all of sudden his universe starts to unspin and hes aware of this and aware of that and aware of where his father has been and aware of where he has been in regard to his father and he starts to get directionally accurate directionally and distantly accurate and up to that time its just enough to be aware as far as his fathers concerned just be aware of existence of father and not aware thats enough thats cleared sphere now do you see where we sneak up on something like this well thats an interesting scale its scale of reality ive been working for some time trying to get some way to sneak up on reality now how does this fit in with the real universe and objects well theres little kicker in here along about the time of what could you say to your father and what could your father say to you and what could you say to your mother what could your mother say to youin other words separating part of these universeswe know that sooner or later we would take up what could you say to body what could body say to you we know wewill run into that one but thats not so real sometimes weve got to get him out of some other universes before we get him out of the bodys universe right about the point where we would pass from that into communication by hellohello the individual on an 8c level can spot unrealities isnt that good he can spot unreality your pc today crystal was just about ready to take look at the environment but he could spot unrealities much faster than he could spot realities now you know what i mean by unreality supposing you ran 8c on unrealities its along about that point you could take up something like this if you wanted to youd run 8c spot something unreal in this room spot something else unreal in this room then the individual would spot lot of things the wall behind him might be unreal or something like that you see and hell get out to point where hell recognize that his sight line to the horizon is real but beyond that its unreal and he gets the idea of sort of living on saucer its little saucer which goes exactly out to the horizon and further and everything beyond that is unreal ask him to spot some unrealities in his environment until its real to him it sneaks up on the preclear after while because he finds out things are getting less and less unreal its asising unreality when were graduating pc up the line it is very easy for the auditor to monitor the pc so that the pc can apparently run the most impossible complex the most advanced processes you ever heard of and just stall right there the pc goes right on running them its all unreal and it doesnt matter anyway and he just goes on through it and the auditor kind of monitors the preclear in every step and sneeze if we just keep on going well there is where we sometimes come cropper in auditing we audit somebody in rather advanced process and its unreal now weve just had an experience of this happening the guy apparently was just going bangity bangity bang and yet it wasnt real well it wont do them any good unless its real this is the way to sneak up then on preclear and make sure its real all the waypab 52 professional auditors bulletin from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 163 holland park avenue london w11 _____________________________________________________________________ 13 may 1955 auditing the whole track let us move into topechelon scientology and utilize anything we know from book one right on up to present time one is quite aware of the facsimile phenomenon the engram phenomenon and one can use this with spotting spots and communication see earlier pabs when preclear has an engram he is out of position with regard to the spot where the incident occurred there is very adequate description of this in book one centering around the activities and engramic content in the bank of fish now under spotting spots and communication processing we can at last handle this and here come emeters back into the picture the hasi is at this moment building new and better emeter than has ever been built before under the trademarked name of physiogalvanometer or ometer it has very little in common with the old type emeter nevertheless an old type emeter can be utilized by asking as in electropsychometric auditing one discovers the length of time back to where the preclear is stuck it does not matter how far back he discovers the preclear to be stuck as soon as he ascertains where the preclear is stuck on the whole track he swings into spotting spots and communication processing with the following commands let us say he has discovered the preclear to be stuck on the genetic line as plankton in the ocean the auditor says tell some things you can say to plankton the preclear then says something that he could say to plankton although there may be great deal of comm lag connected with this as soon as he has made this statement the auditor says now have the plankton say okay the auditor runs this on the preclear using only the plankton until the preclear has communication lag in giving things he could say to the plankton as soon as this occurs the auditor then says give some things which the plankton could say to you the preclear then gets some statement that the plankton could say to him and the auditor has the preclear say okay to that statement this then is run until the communication lag is flat the auditor can then take up the sea with what can you say to the sea and when the preclear has made some statement as to what he could say to the sea the auditor has the preclear have the sea say okay to the preclear then when this has been run thoroughly what could the sea say to you asks the auditor the preclear gives aloud some statement the sea could say to him and the auditor has the preclear say okay to that statement it will be discovered that the preclear has certain energy masses connected with the sea the plankton and that he is out of location which is to say that these spots these facsimiles are not in their original position but are impinged upon the body itself and as this process is run it will be discovered that the original location tends to assert itself and become stripped of the energy masses connected with it which keep it out of present time the location will become clean after while which is to say the spots are in present time now this particular process can be run on anything in any fashion whether book one what to audit history of man or universesto run this process on universes it is necessary to select out what universes the preclear is interiorized into it will be discovered immediately that he was probably interiorized into his fathers or his mothers universe one ascertains this by asking the preclear whom do you most resemble in the family and after careful questioning of the preclear establishes that the preclear is thinking the thoughts of and having the problems of some member of the family then the auditor says what could you say to this person mentioning the person and the preclear tells the auditor something he could say to this person the auditor now has the preclear have that person more or less located where the person actually is say okay back to the preclear the preclear of course makes the person say this okay when this is flat the auditor then says now what could that person say to you and when the preclear has told the auditor something the auditor says all right now say okay to that person working this back and forth one gets the preclear out of various universes which is to say out of coincidence with various spots where he has interiorized into another universe the whole problem of interiorization is problem of coinciding spots which do not actually coincide according to the preclear and the body the place where he had an automobile accident yesterday is right here with him today its not down on the comer the trick is to get that spot clean and into present time and at its proper distance from the preclear naturally the process could be extended to exteriorizing the preclear out of this universe and should be but remember this is probably not feasible until great many incidents have been run with the preclear brought into present time practically any and every psychosomatic illness there is is represented by and caused by facsimile on the whole track which is in suspension with its location out of location as far as the preclear is concerned so we are running engrams again so we are using mechanical aid in order to establish this the reason we are doing this is because the preclear does not get out of body which is so out of position that the preclear doesnt really know where he is the body has birth in restimulation has some whole track incidents in restimulation and the preclear being used to taking his data from the body does not know where he is getting the body into present time more or less will permit the preclear to exteriorize further cases which have not exteriorized easily in the past or which have not stayed exteriorized can be made stable by the use of this communication process in conjunction with spotting spots one does not have to pay too much attention to the remedy of havingness while he is running this type of process it is an oddity that twoway communication applied to mass will asis the mass without particularly depleting the havingness of the preclear the reason he had the mass in the first place evidently was to have something to talk about he is being permitted to talk about it over it and through it and so is ending the cycle of why he would have that mass in actual practice very little remedy of havingness is necessary when running this type of communication processing as given in the above paragraph however there is tendency on the part of most preclears to chew around or change the direction or position of the energy masses which they are handling and when this is the case there is certain loss of havingness by reason of heat and friction thus remedy of havingness sooner or later is actually used even though communication processing itself does not materially reduce havingness it is very astonishing to find ourselves at this late date suddenly scooping back and encompassing tremendous amount of data which we thought had been passed over and forgotten it is startling to discover that everything we know about engrams facsimiles secondaries the whole track of the interiorization of the various types of traps of adventures and misadventures of the thetan without number are all of use suddenly and forcefully to the auditor as case history an individual who has been run for some five hundred hours by various good auditors and who is reputedly one of the toughest cases ever seen in scientology had his case broken completely few days ago by the use of spotting spots andcommunication in combination as given the individual was stuck in certain present lifetime area he was not so much stuck in one incident as he was stuck in all the incidents which took place between his eighteenth and twentysecond year everything and anything in that area was engramic and it was totally in restimulation with all of its spots out of position and surrounding the preclear one was then not auditing preclear in present time at all he was auditing preclear in the area of the eighteenth or nineteenth year the preclear was trapped in that area the auditor asked the preclear for some things he could say to that area the preclear then gave them to the auditor each time the auditor had the area say okay back the auditor finally asked the preclear for things that area could say to him and the preclear each time gave an okay back to that area the area at length sprung out and took its proper position and came up to present time and at this moment exteriorization was possible for this preclear mass can be disintegrated matter what type of mass it is by twoway communication there are two types of mass there is the first type which is simply mocked up mass in mocked up space this we know by agreement to be the physical universe there is second type of mass which is the spacemass experience mass which we call facsimile or an engram this type of mass has been our target and goal since the earliest days of dianetics and twoway communication used in the above fashion can resolve this some more data on this subject will be given in your next pab the announcement which this pab contains is definitely major point in the research and investigation in dianetics and scientology and pulls together many of the loose ends and details over which we have gone i have worked very arduously to discover first data about the anatomy of man and his mind second the full details of this data and third methods of handling this data at this time we have method of handling this data which is very superior to anything we have had in the past and which can evidently work at any level i invite you to try this on your preclears and then tell how it works for you best regards ronpab 53 professional auditors bulletin from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 163 holland park avenue london w11 _____________________________________________________________________ 27 may 1955 ownership special pab i wonder if you realize that research is paying off and has continued to pay off over the last hectic five years in 1950 when organizations and the paper chains within them threatened to engulf all of my time and when the absurdities in california where elseof personal attack all but wrecked the continuing advance and finance of research i pulled back sharply from organization and organizational matters and made the decision that whatever else happened i would continue this line of investigation which i had begun in 1932 and would bring it forward to completion it was my belief that this subject would go as far in the society as it worked and further i confirmed this opinion in 1951 and 1952 when big business decided that the thing to do with dianetics was to make millions of dollars with it and that any further research in the matter was nonsense the whole theory lying behind dianetics and scientology is very easy one to comprehend where it comes to its development and that is the subject will go as far in the societies of man as it is workable and further and amount of advertising and amount of frilly stationery is going to push it an inch beyond its workability thus i have continued research whatever else i have done whoever and whatever has gone on harassing and barking and whining and snarling on hypercritical level in whatever part of the country i have known and continued to act upon this formula at one time i envisioned huge staffs capable of correlating data and discovering many things these staffs have never materialized where research department has been formulated as in the elizabeth foundation it has been joke and has actually done more to impede the forward progress of research than otherwise the sole purpose of organization has been to continue the finance of research and investigation into the human mind the amount of finance demanded has not been very great general electric throws away more money on research in any month than has been spent on the entirety of dianetics and scientology and they buy less for it one of my friendsand i certainly do have themcommented the other day that dianetics and scientology in the field of research present the most astonishing picture that has ever appeared in the field of research more actual biting data has been developed by myself under less money and under greater duress than in any other time or place maybe his statement was merely kind but from where i sit it certainly looks like it very often student or preclear of the hasi wonders why he is paying what he does to be trained actually it costs about half the sum he pays to train or process him the remainder is devoted to research when person buys membership of whatever classification almost all of that money goes into research or financing the dissemination of the material although it costs quite bit to keep the skeletal framework of an organization as big as the hasi running it is yet capable of continuing on the funds it receives very few people even students and preclears realize this but here is what is being done and its time you took good square look at this when people out in the bullrushes start whining about the hasi every dime spent with the hasi is guaranteeing the continued freedom of dianetics and scientology these subjects have been lucky enough not to get into such financial straits that they could not extricatethemselves from ownership and control of persons who would have utilized them to the detriment of man dianetics and scientology have not depended upon large donations from personally interested persons it is highly doubtful if the hasi would accept colored donation which was meant in actuality to guide or steer the policy of develop and disseminate although various materials of dianetics and scientology have occasionally been tendered to official and private agencies any effort on the part of these to monopolize or to classify under security headings this data would not only have been resisted it would have been defeated because dianetics and scientology and the existing organizations have been financed in this fashion dianetics and scientology are free and will not be used in the direction of some george orwellian nightmare if you find something wrong with the organization of the hasi its personnel or people and if you criticize this weakly or strongly remember you are criticizing your own organization its not somebody elses organizationits yours and if you criticize constantly and continually about the various ills to which any human organization is subject allowing of course that the hasi is human organization youre making it just that much tougher to get this job done actually flatly there is nothing wrong that cannot be corrected with any part of the organization of dianetics and scientology anywhere in the world the hasi is far more efficient than most modern businesses but rubbing elbows as it does with the human race day after day it is subject to breaks and omissions the difference is that when it becomes aware of them it repairs them if you think this level of efficiency should be raised then why dont you come down to phoenix or london or any other central office and get to work its your organization or why dont you do better job of dissemination right where you are the hasi today on the local scene is cutting very deep swath into the society where it is immediately centered its main job of course is an international job and it pays most attention to this it is actually doing very great deal these days right here in phoenix it is working on very friendly terms with most of the civic organizations in town and it is now working with the probation officers on juvenile delinquency and criminal problems maybe one of the first things people should learn about dianetics and scientology is that there is nothing selfish in its forward thrust and the only toes it ever steps on are the inefficient or the vicious ones if the hasi makes an error or some auditor makes an error it should be put down to inefficiency or lack of time or too much to do and from my experience exempting of course those few auditors whose certificates have been yanked for very good and ample reason the heart with which people in scientology work is good heart they may make mistakes but they dont make them knowingly and what is most important they correct them when they have made them i hear lot of whining and moaning here and there about how bad it is over here but i notice it is always from people who are totally incompetent and who depend for their communication line on their imagination and with as little recourse to fact as possible it is quite interesting that almost any influential person who is interested in dianetics and scientology sooner or later will begin to be the target of squirrel publications these publications are uniformly run by people who will not accept processing and none of these squirrel publications are written or published by personnel trained in dianetics and scientology and most of the people back of these squirrel publications are mds or psychologists now it is remarkable thing that influential people receiving this literature believe they are receiving material from dianeticists or scientologists the moment i became aware of the fact that this was going on and that poorly informed people actually did believe that dianeticists and scientologists trained in the subject were the authors of this barrage of nutty literature i began to take action on punitive level and i can solemnly guarantee you that in relatively short space of time none of these squirrel publications written by unlettered and untrained goofballs will be in existence for it has been clearly indicated to that they have very often impeded the organization and made the hasi struggle in order to get this job of research done if one of these publications prevented just one desperate preclear from seeking and obtaining the help heneeded from the hasi then frankly i can promise short circuit we have begun to act very punitively in this directionas minor endeavor to be sure but nevertheless as an effective one for remember that we have never done anything that is not eventually effective that is very awesome record i would also like to point out to you that each and every one of the squirrels of yesteryear have met disaster the biggest squirrel in great britain derricke ridgway was recently to be found in bankruptcy court i wonder how he got there we wouldnt know anything about that of course recently we tackled california where half dozen people have been keeping several million from having any respect for or interest in dianetics and scientology these people would call vast number of potentially interested public in and then tell them things which were calculated to disgrace and discredit the subject the auditors in california sat around supinely and thought there must be some very good reason why these people kept on doing this of course the amazing thing is the apathy of the auditor himself who would permit this sort of thing to go on i know if anybody were operating in my area with mediatype of attitude toward scientology who sent out vast numbers of postcards to mailing lists and got all the people in so that he could make an ass out of himself about how awful scientology really was and how bad the organization really was and how it was all wild and flighty anyhow i would have had good fight on my hands and somebody would have lost and i dont think it would have been personally if i were an auditor and found my area being muddied up to that extent i would have definite feeling if i permitted it to go on that i was not doing all i could do to spread scientology in my area i would have taken such screwball out of the running so fast he would have thought he had been hit by mack truck and i dont mean thoughtwise but then the difference between and an apathetic auditor is that i fight and i get things done of course there is always liability in attacking source of entheta one always gets certain amount rubbed off on himself but i am not so scared of this stuff that i wont contact it right after we found that the cada in california was trying to put out of the running any and all dianetic auditing in the entire state by having legislation passed to forbid it and after we pulled the certificates of the ringleaders for this entheta activity great many things happenedvery strange things i dont intend to stop anybodys communication line as long as it has shadow of truth in it but when communication line is woven from totally selfinterested lies i will not only cut the line i will make it bounce now the only real trouble with dianetic and scientology organizations in the past is because of this matter of research we have not been very alert to people working their ill will from whatever reasons or causes in our own ranks we just havent been interested the important thing was to get the material researched and to get people trained when we had that job done and when it was done very very well the spread of dianetics and scientology in the society would be inevitable we need five thousand trained auditors that is our first step toward this dissemination for believe what we are doing with cases today wasnt done last year and has never before been done in the history of the human race we need clear public presence and so we are taking bulldozer to the communication perverters we are putting ourselves in solid on every front where we can be effective it is interesting that the american psychological association lost hands down bill which was directly aimed at the hasi in arizona it lost so badly that it is doubtful that it will ever recover we are not even vaguely propitiative toward medicine or psychiatry and we are overtly intent upon assimilating every function they are now performing we have great belief in the value of welltrained doctor and the psychiatrist is certainly welcome to the psychotic we do not believe that the organizations of these people should have any bearing or influence in the world at large for they have used their influence in the past to impede research we get terribly amused when some auditor writes in and says he has managed to address the local medical association and when we hear that somebody is now calling himself psychologist these shortsighted people believe that the labor union called the ama or theapa is worth propitiating and will be there long enough to influence anything the general attitude amongst the powers that be in these organizations has definitely changed toward dianetics and scientology they now regard these as very serious and deadly menace these people are getting scared we know this because we had recent reaction at very high echelon there is real danger in these organizations there is more danger in our own stupidity and in an apathy which would permit our fields to be plowed by any untrained fool who wants to tell us all how bad it is over there weve been told how bad it is over there for seventysix trillion years its about time somebody said how good it can be somewhere and thats what we are doing i am telling you this because i want you to know how i feel about this and maybe knowing how i feel about it and knowing how inevitable i feel about the success of dianetics and scientology in this society of man you will be better able to understand both what we have been doing what we are doing and what we are going to do in dianetics and scientology5506c03 asmc3 history of research and investigation one good thing about hellfire and brimstone type of religion is that it at least acknowledges the existence of the spirit the scopes trial was turning point in which the theory that man is merely machine became fashionable in past years there was great spiritual awareness and perception even as recently as the sixteenth century duelists used to have an embarrassing thing happen when they killed the opponent hed exteriorize and zap them and pester them afterwards as mechanical knowledge increased spiritual awareness decreased people thought this was progress despite the increase in amount of madness if theres spiritual liability to destroying other people and their possessions one would expect crime to become more prevalent and so it does5506c06 asmc15 what scientology is doing we need better social order when an organization says its above reproach or an individual claims hes untouchable chaos ensues the control and direction of man depends upon the good will and good state of man not upon iron bars cells shock machines society is as sick as it has sick members the way to make society well however isnt just to cure the sick only if the members of the society were sufficiently well theyd have problem pulling the fallen out of the mud this depends on the condition of man not on few specialists when it becomes specialty man is dead because the best of man comes into being when he can aid his needy fellows when men are made to feel they have right to assist their fellows the society is sick in creating an organization lrh doesnt want to merely replace one despotic system with another one using the existing comm lines this is what happens in revolution nation is ever overthrown they are just substituted for if scientology did this they could probably create an organization powerful enough to overrun all in its path but then this would just have to be overthrown scientology possesses great potential for good or evil depending on how it is relayed poorly relayed used just for gain it could be very destructive lrh has already had three offers by persons in places of power to hand over great deal of information and stop talking helping the insane is usually an effort to reverse whatever selfdeterminism they have left person who is psychotic has at one time decided to die he has not subsequently decided to live they abandon the body unable to let go and unwilling to reassume responsibility the longer you stop being that wants to die from dying the worse off he gets the truly insane should not have therapy but space sunlight minimal restraints quiet food this gives the individual chance to change his mind and decide to live again exhaustion and insanity are almost synonymous person who is sane who wants to live who is willing to take responsibility for doing something about his condition can be in much worse shape than an insane person but he will be auditable and will get better because he wants to live insanity is death wish of great magnitude sanity returns when person decides to live psychosomatic illness is overrated being universally present as unwanted sensation or absence of sensation its not illness it comes about when someone is called upon to prove something and fails some processes for this 1 what have you got that would prove it not about anything specific or 1a what will disability get you into b what will disability get you out of then when flat 2 what can you prove with it the disability here we run into the computation that any sensation is better than sensation and that he should have something to get sympathy and avoid guilt but the thetan is to be able to invent whole new category of ills before hell give up one hes got hence invent something worse than illness death was invented on the whole track as substitute for insanity which was being so irresponsible that punishment was pointless you could get anyone to change his mind about wanting to die if you could get into comm with him i want you to come into possession of all that you know and i want you to use that knowledge with security and any mission i have here on this planet at this time will be successful at that time when what i have just said has been accomplishedpab 54 professional auditors bulletin from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 163 holland park avenue london w11 _____________________________________________________________________ 10 june 1955 reality level of preclear find the reality of the preclear this is the watchword of processing although communication as completely outlined in dianetics 1955 is universal solvent remember that there are also two other comers to the triangle and that one of these corners is reality that r corner of the triangle is very important to you as an auditor because you having very great certainties on this and on that are very prone to forget that your realities are greater than those of your preclear the reality level of the preclear is dependent on how much he is notising his environment if he is notising it he must believe that it is dangerous and must believe that he himself does not have the power to make anything in it disappear or vanish for himself therefore his reality level is as great as he is strong and it is as poor as he is weak do you know that you are processing preclears who do not believe that thought has anything to do with action you are processing preclears who believe that thinking thought will influence nothing you are processing preclears who believe that thinkingness is one thing and actingness is an entirely different thing and that amount of thinkingness is going to influence any amount of actingness this is apathy indeed and along with that goes an unreality which would appall you yes these preclears can get mockups they can get concepts they can be very obedient they can even be run with sop 8c and somehow or another muddle through it but the joker here is that the auditor is actually monitoring the body of the preclear and of course body can respond to orders and will respond probably faster to the auditors orders than to the thetan the auditor is processing thus preclear can be put through any number of contortions and convolutions in processing without getting anywhere at all the auditor is simply doing it find the reality level of your preclear unless you find the reality level of the preclear you are not going to reach the preclear because the preclear is as alive as things are real now if this is so important then let us see how far south we would have to go to reach some preclears mechanical twoway communication might very well be much too tough for 75 of the preclears you will process just ordinary conversation is actually over their heads people that we are trying to reach do not know the auditor is acknowledging them when he says okay let us look at this acknowledgment of the preclear and let us discover that the auditor in order to acknowledge the preclear must also make the preclear aware that he is being acknowledged thus when an auditor says okay or all right or thats fine the other part of the statement is to make the preclear aware that an acknowledgment has been delivered thus did you hear is quite often beneficial when the preclear finally admits that he did hear the okay and when the auditor makes sure that he time after time hears the okay you will notice that the communication on the acknowledgment level starts to work with the preclear but it wont work as long as the preclear is oblivious of the okays the auditor isgiving of course you must give the preclear an okay for every action or completed thought he performs you must acknowledge what he has said or done but you must also be very sure that he receives that acknowledgment it is not out of order to face him squarely and hold up one finger and say wait minute did you hear say okay now there are two processes which are at once the most basic of processes and which are very low on the reality scale as well as high on it person processed on these processes should not believe that the auditor believes his reality level is low quite the contrary such process as this one happens to be very good anywhere on the tone scale and this process is think thought receive thought you are in essence processing thinkingness i wonder how long and how often you have processed preclears who could not clearly or differentiatively understand that they were thinking thought the auditing command is simply think thought the preclear is given this command time and time again and he vocalizes the thought back to the auditor and the auditor acknowledges the fact that he has received that thought aloud and the preclear is run until the preclear knows absolutely that he himself not some machine not some energy mass not his toe or his hat is thinking the thought the preclear will start out thinking thoughts which are actually handed to him from some mysterious source when the communication lag on this is entirely flat and when the preclear knows that he himself is thinking the thought the auditor can then run the other side of the process receive thought is run with the following auditing command tell thought you would be willing to receive this is then run until it as process is entirely flat when it is longer producing any result or comm lag part of the think thought process is to have the preclear place the thought in various locations after he has thought it have his shoe think thought have his hat think thought have lamp think the thought have rug think the thought this gets the preclear into the practice of placing the thought somewhere thus thoughts are less likely to appear suddenly and magically out of his machinery very curious phenomena result from think thought and receive thought it will be found sometimes that it is easier for the preclear to think thought for another universe than for himself to think thought let us take for example preclear who is entirely interiorized into the universe of his mother it would therefore evidently be much easier for him to have his mother think thought than for the preclear himself to think thought as matter of fact it might be an enormous struggle resulting in rebellion for the preclear himself to think thought but it would be very easy for the preclear to have his mother think thought the way to go about this would be to take an emeter or simply estimate by finding out who the preclear most resembles the probable universe into which the preclear is interiorized having established this and you would only do this if the preclear were rebellious about thinking thought himself you would then have this likely universe think thought with the auditing command having established that he is interiorized into his mothers or his fathers universe have your mother father think thought this would then be carried out until the preclear was absolutely sure that he was making his mother or his father think thought this would betoken an initial division of the universe slicing up universes with communication processes is very easy thing to do all one has to do is use the process what could you say to your father and have the preclear say it and get an okay from his father and when this was flat what could your father say to you and when the preclear has vocalized this the auditor would say now give your father an okay to this however this workable process which splits universes in oldtime parlance valences is yet much too high for preclear who is very low on reality and would take very long time to do it would be process into which you would eventually move the preclear who had been thinking thought for his mother but remember that thinking thought for his mother would be only start into communication processing and would be an elementary process run until the preclear is entirely certain that he is thinking thought that hismother would think or that he can make his mother think thoughtthe latter being the most desirable condition you should be aware of the fact that you are processing thinkingness you are not processing spaces you are not processing masses at this day and state of development of dianetics and scientology you are processing thinkingness man is as well as he thinks the more masses and spaces phrases and engrams you process the less you are validating the fact that you are actually processing thinkingness thinkingness that we call thetan to process this directly is of course the most indicated process there could be and sure enough we are producing good results with it but the remarkable thing about the process is that it works on people who heretofore have had very very poor reality now there is process which is little bit lower than this think thought process and this is the process of finding something real in the room recently i have had some very excellent results with find something in this room that is comfortably real this is variation on the initial auditing command as given in the early sops it is apparently better preclear who is notising everything in sight will find things real he says but actually he is not comfortable about it and if you ask him to find something that is comfortably real it may take him long time to discover anything that he would tolerate to continue existence and once you have begun this process of toleration you would be able to do great deal for his case find something comfortably real is not necessarily lowtoned process it will work in varying degrees on anyone it is not recommended for any particular case level if preclear utterly bogs on think thought which isnt likely then you should have him find something in this room that is comfortably real to you i am reminded of an auditor recently processing very bad arthritic who processed him as an exteriorized case for some little time without any apparent gain in the case before it occurred to this auditor that something must be wrong actually great amount of time was invested the auditor asked nibs my boy who was then instructing the acc course in the united states and who is at this writing in england teaching the bscn course there what could possibly be wrong with this hungfire preclear nibs looked him over and discovered that the auditor had never yet gotten the preclear into any kind of situation which was even vaguely real to the preclear the auditor in one chair and the preclear in the other chair was not real situation to this preclear and yet the auditor was running him as an exteriorized case of course he was exteriorized but with such low level of reality that very little benefit of course was resulting from the processing processing is as beneficial as it is real and factual to the preclear and if you cannot raise the preclears reality level by the use of affinity and communication then you are letting the whole triangle hang fire this triangle of arc may have suddenly gotten very important on the c corner but it is still foremost in the toolkit of the auditor now you will want to know why you should use think thought when what is obviously wrong with the preclear you have in mind is withered leg let assure you that if you process directly this withered leg you are processing something and somebody who probably has very low level of reality he wouldnt have withered leg if he had high level of reality where you have anybody who is neurologically physically or psychosomatically ill unless it be from an acute infection or an accident you have somebody who has been trying to notis his body when an individual is notising his body making his legs wither or his stomach get ulcers or his head get migraine headaches or his teeth fall out you have somebody who is trying to notis the environment he is already going in the direction of succumb the one thing that would make him very happy would be the entire disappearance of the physical universe well with modern processing you can make this happen too and maybe this is something you should have happen for him in order to demonstrate that it could happen of course if you did this you would have to go through modern bscn course at least for this is very tricky procedure in view of the fact that unreality is the action of realizing things are there and then saying they arent there notising them see creation ofhuman ability and the axioms of scientology you are dealing with protest against reality which results in unreality person will let things be as real as he is willing to let them exist when an individual isnt willing to let leg or tree or this universe exist then things are not real to him one of the best ways you could get him to raise his level of reality would be to give him some reality on thinkingness it isnt actingness it isnt getting tired it isnt being unable to work it isnt the second dynamic that impedes your preclearit is his thinkingness all you have to do is to get him to change his mind if you could get anyone to change his mind enough he could then command anything that was bothering him but preclear who is notising things is trying to use force and pressure of one kind or another against physical objects and spaces in order to push them out of existence this will never win let assure you energy will never destroy energy i dont care how many atomic bombs the peanut whistly brigade builds they will never destroy any space or energy with them your preclear who finds things unreal has stopped trying to do anything with thought and is trying to do something with force he longer conceives that thought can generate or handle or give existence or life to space and energy now you take this to heart and take good hard look at some of these preclears you have been processing on very fancy and frilly processes and you take think back over all of these preclears who after you processed them didnt think anything had happened when the preclear didnt think anything had happened nothing happened what was in error you were processing him above his level of reality if you could get him to think thought and know he thought it and receive thought and know he had received it even though he put it there to receive it which is what he does you would then be directly addressing the very thing that is doing unreality and reality an individual who has compulsive outflow is simply unwilling to receive thought an individual who is silent simply cant think of anything thus if an individual had control of his thoughts he would have control of the universe we can prove this now in process and dont think you are going to finish this process either side of it in halfhour or fortyfive minutes some of these glib preclears you process will fall in on this process and begin to commlag an hour or two after you start processing them on it the main errors which have been made with this process so far have been failing to run it long enough to have the preclear really know and really understand that he himself has thought the thought and that he himself has received the thought or is willing to receive the thought find the reality level of the preclear is one of those bywords that you cant use too often or look at enoughmajor 4 1955 ca early july the magazine of dianetics and scientology from washington d c straight wire manual of operation l ron hubbard article one modern straight wire on the theory that someone may pick up this book and have only time to read few lines or have constricted ability in amount of material assimilable right here in hurry i wish to give you the type of straight wire which is today producing phenomenal results on preclears the command recall moment of ______ number of times command used until the complete flattening of the preclears communication lag takes place so that he can readily and at some length and quantity give replies without any difficulty communication always acknowledge with an ok or an all right every answer which the preclear gives you always let the preclear originate any communication he wishes to originate or comment on the process and acknowledge his origin of communication or comment in other words do not override his effort to communicate to you as this will considerably reduce his tone rise duplication make sure that you the auditor duplicate the command over and over and over until the comm lag is flat and do not be detoured by any rationale of your own into any other process simply because you are unwilling to continue the duplication of the command application in the blank space of the command can be placed any subject of any concern or consideration of the preclear whether theta or entheta example the preclear is studious the auditor then applies straight wire in this fashion recall moment of studiousness the preclear does so and says that he has or describes the time it will be observed that the first one may take considerable length of time and that the length of time intervening between the question and the reply will vary from here on until the communication lag is entirely flat which means that the process may have to be continued for half an hour an hour or many hours the communication lag is known to be flat when the replies are readily given without pause or hesitation and without any comment on the preclears part the moment the preclear says he has recalled time or describes the time he has recalled which is optional the auditor says ok or all right acknowledging the fact that he has received the preclears communication at which moment the auditor then places the exact question once more an additional symptom of flat process is that the preclear will longer be studious but as preclears do not know how studious they are it is best to run the process until the communication lag is flat it is not necessary for the auditor to demand new times every time the preclear can recall the same time if he desires to do soobserved phenomenon the time track phenomenon will be observed while delivering this straight wire question it will manifest itself in this fashion the first answers of the preclear will probably be relatively close to present time and then will be further back into the past at which time they will begin to progress at some time they will begin to progress forward into the future and will come close to present time again when they will once more turn around and go into the past and then come into the future in other words the preclear will give the time day or so ago when he was studious then time year or so ago when he was studious then time when he was child when he was studious then time when he was sixteen when he was studious then time last year when he was studious then time three days ago when he was studious then time two years ago when he was studious then time when he was three years old and he was studious then time when he was eight years old and he was studious then time yesterday when he was studious and so forth in other words the preclear sweeps up and down the time track the caution to be observed in this is never leave the process when the preclear is recalling moments which are far into the past leave the process when the preclear is recalling times relatively close to present time otherwise you stick the preclear on the track goal of the process the goal of many processes is to raise the selfdeterminism of the preclear memory is an automaticity which is not under the control of the preclear by taking over the automaticities of memory and forgetting the preclear is capable of greater self determinism in view of the fact that all mass could be said to be memory you will see at once that straight wire leads to the control of mass prerequisites to session present must be an auditor preclear place to audit and time in which to audit when the session has begun the session is actually in progress and the process is ready to be administered only when the preclear is aware of the fact that an auditor is present that he is present that the auditing room is present and that an auditing session is in progress twoway communication or asking the preclear to locate objects in the room simply by noticing that they are there lower process than twoway communication should then be engaged upon until such time as the preclear is aware of his surroundings and the condition on what preclear to use straight wire straight wire can be used on any preclear who is aware of his surroundings the auditor and auditing session and who has reality upon the goal of auditing this is signalized by the preclear being in fairly good twoway communication with the auditor straight wire should not be employed on preclears who are in very poor twoway communication subjects on which straight wire can be used straight wire can be employed on any subject or condition it will be discovered that the straight wire processes are probably the best resolution of black cases the resolution of black case is indeed contained rather succinctly in the auditing command recall time when you were looking at blackness the entire hide to serenity scale can be employed with considerable tone change in the preclear the key to exteriorization lies in the auditing command recall time when you were in or associated with body peculiarities physical deformities or conditions of any kind could be used on the above straight wire basis with success i have given you this brief rundown on modern straight wire not because it is all there is to say on the subject but because i wanted to give you the exact essentials present in modern straight wire as rapidly and as efficiently as possible so that they could be used without having to go through great deal of material however person to use straight wire should know great deal about straight wire while he could simply use the essentials above and could produce considerable change in case on any subject an auditor who is not skilled would be held up by the duplication factor he would have tendency under of course very good alibis of his own to desert the command itself before the process was flat he would have tendency to change the command to something else he would have tendency to go on excursive trips into the side roads of the process since great many comments considerations and phenomena will come up while straight wire is in progress the selfdiscipline necessary to continue an auditing command over and over and over and over is not light discipline infact we could say that an auditor who has not himself had great deal of duplication run would find himself very resistive to repeating this auditing command to preclear for long period of time however this does not go to say that an auditor in terrible condition himself knowing this fact could not then grit his teeth and pitch in and go on and continue twoway communication with the preclear and go on and ask this auditing question over and over and over and over until the preclears case was solved not only is this possible but it has been done very often and in fact we have great deal of respect for auditors who although they themselves are in relatively poor condition yet go on and produce tremendous advances in cases we of course get more enthusiastic about auditors who are in good shape producing good results but we cannot but admire the sticktoitivity some auditors have in carrying through processes which are above their own case level now just because we have modern straight wire which is interestingly exact in its application and very predictable in its results is reason why we have to throw away all other processes the six basic steps done as they are done today are of course of great value and do not go into the discard simply because we have more effective more exact and simpler straight wire there is one particular caution which should be observed in administering straight wire that preclear will very often give nocommlag reaction to process which is above his level he will not get well on the process he will not improve on the process but also he does not commlag on the process the process is being done more or less by some circuit it is being done without any reality and it is not involving the preclear at all one has to go far enough south so that the preclear develops comm lag now if you were to run straight wire on some preclear and simply get your answers every two or three seconds and keep getting answers for long period of time you would discover at length that the process was not improving the preclear the reason the process is not improving the preclear is because the process is above the preclear and the preclear has reality upon his recalls or his answers in such wise it would be very wise to start in below twoway communication and get the preclear to spot objects in the room not walk over to them or perform an 8c which is above straight wire on the tone scale but simply to look around and find that there is chair in the room that there is table and so on this done for while orients the preclear and it is discovered that he will go into twoway communication with the auditor twoway communication then about the preclears everyday life should ensue and after this r220 problems and solutions should be run flat on the preclear for the preclear who is very short on problems and who is incapable of arriving at solutions is not likely to give up any case problem and is not likely to arrive at any solution so we understand that there are actually three points below straight wire now preclear who would need problems and solutions run on him at great length is liable oddly enough not to commlag on straight wire and also not to improve upon it in this wise the preclears reality on the question or the response is very low and he is simply being monitored by the auditor the auditor is more or less running all of the preclears machinery an oddity which we observe in some auditing sessions although the auditor is running the preclears machinery neither the auditor nor the preclear is aware of it the auditor isnt aware of it because he would rather not be and the preclear isnt aware of it because he isnt aware of very much anyhow just as an automobile doesnt much care who drives it so do some low toned preclears not care who is running the circuits variation on modern straight wire little older but still quite effective is give something you wouldnt mind remembering and give something you wouldnt mind forgetting these two commands are run independently of each other not alternately and each is flattened these are very very effective commands it is remarkable that give something you wouldnt mind forgetting hits people who are dislocated so hard that manyhour comm lag may ensue on the question these people are afraid to forget anything this is very very effective auditing and is not discarded it can be used little lower on the scale than modern straight wire but it is slower an auditor should test straight wire very rigorously in the recommended form given above before forming any forthright opinions concerning it he should observe that running this straight wire on very low toned preclear produces comm lag and betterment of the preclear this is the first thing he should learn about it then he should learn that run in its proper place on preclear who is in twoway communication and is in fair condition itproduces remarkable stable results which last for very long time it is not trick process it is plowhorse sort of process but once it has hauled the preclear up the scale it leaves him there preclears continued stability for long time after an auditing session is very desirable the trick momentary flash results sometimes do not last an auditor should also learn that he himself is capable of repeating one command over and over and over and over without varying it without getting so bored with it that he himself goes out of the auditing session remember when the auditor leaves the auditing session although he is still there giving auditing commands it sometimes occurs that very little auditing gets done since an auditing session of necessity has to have an auditor and preclear present and auditing in progress it will be startling to you to know that this process is specific process for black case and does relieve the black cases blackness and after and above the black case level this process is specific for nonexteriorization and will produce exteriorization if recall time when you were in or associated with body is employed over long enough period of time there is great deal more to know about straight wire there are great deal of phenomena which occur in straight wire and there are many other data to be studied about straight wire however if the auditor cares to study these first let him learn thoroughly what we mean by modern straight wire and that is laid out above with exactness article two the history of straight wire the old dianetic auditor will have difficulty in recalling the earliest days of straight wire once upon time straight wire was one of the most intricate tricky intuitive processes known there were auditors who were excellent at this but they were alone in their skill there were many many auditors who never did make straight wire work straight wire of the old dianetic type expertly done many times produced such fascinating results that auditors would then specialize in it but because it has often failed their specialization would be tempered with restless search for some other process that would do the job with greater exactness the genus of straight wire immediately followed the release of the first book dianetics the modern science of mental health on may 9 1950 i developed straight wire little too late to get it into the text of that book but taught the first ten students at 42 aberdeen road elizabeth new jersey this process and actually got these students sufficiently expert in the use of straight wire that they could straighten out present time problems on preclears with remarkable facility here is an example of the earliest form of straight wire preclear is observed to be possessed of nervous afflictionthe rapid blinking of one eye the auditor asks him who had that affliction and asks him this with sufficient communication and discussion so that the preclear at length actually spots time when he observed this affliction in another than himself now today with our understanding of ownership processing as covered in the congress of eastern scientologists on june third to sixth 1955 at the shoreham hotel in washington dc it becomes highly technical for naturally the affliction if it persisted must be misowned but it would also be understood that the preclear himself might be the creator of the condition if the preclear himself had created the eye twitch at some time in his past recalling it in somebody else would simply reinforce the eye twitch thus straight wire would not work as let us say crudely this condition exists in about 50 of the cases on whom straight wire was used we certainly would have by the factors involving ownership misunderstanding of the process and great many failures in view of the fact that thing persists only if it is misownedif person himself has created it and says somebody else has created it or if person is saying he created something which somebody else actually createdwe get persistence of the space or mass if person created the condition and then says that he himself created the condition vanishment of the condition will occur if somebody else specific person created the condition and the preclear says that person created the condition then again we get vanishment only when we misownor miscall the creation of condition do we get persistence thus we can see that the earliest straight wire depended in great measure upon calling the correct ownership and recalling the correct ownership by recalling observation of the condition in somebody else would be then sufficient to bring about diminishment of the condition thus repeating straight wire would not work on conditions which the person had himself created as long as the auditing command was recall time when you saw that in somebody else this would have to be supplemented by recall time when you decided this was good thing and if those two auditing commands had been used on any condition and if we had also known about comm lag and duplication of the question then straight wire would have been very successful as matter of fact it was quite successful and quite startling but had the above limitations now the earliest type of straight wire was interesting in that it did not embrace the case that couldnt remember to handle this type of case we invented variation which was simply to ask the preclear to remember something anything and keep him remembering something or anything until his confidence in his own memory rose to point where he could remember and thus could experience the benefit of oldtime straight wire an example of this variation was to ask somebody if he could remember something that had happened today or something that he had had for breakfast and keep on asking him for various things until he did have solid reality on one recall or another but this too was quite limited as to process and in order to further improve memories we came out with what is now known as the nexttothelast list of self analysis which is recall something real recall time when you were in communication with someone recall time when someone was in communication with you recall time when you felt some affinity for someone recall time when someone felt some affinity for you which process capitalized on the arc triangle which we came out with in july of 1950 which was much better described in the book notes on the lectures of november of 1950 and expanded considerably in science of survival which was written in the spring of 1951 and released that summer the above list appearing in self analysis which was written in september of 1951 succeeding this nexttothelast list of self analysis was validation straight wire the theory of which was to validate all the good moments in the preclears past by having him recall them an oddity immediately demonstrated itself however in the use of validation straight wire to the effect that the preclear would recall just so many moments which were good and would then fall off into moments which were very bad indeed this phenomenon had by the way been observed much earlier as comment on the running of pleasure moments process developed by parker morgan in elizabeth in 1950 after validation straight wire the whole subject of straight wire more or less fell into disrepute and decay and great deal of concentration was given to actual incidents on the whole track and an enormous amount of phenomena which had been dug up through my work in wichita only nexttothelast list of self analysis continued to be used right up to the time when we developed something you wouldnt mind remembering something you wouldnt mind forgetting in one of the clinical units of the summer of 1954 immediately great many limitations on straight wire were swept away and straight wire became much more important process because it was getting much better results here for the first time we had entered into the idea that forgettingness was an actual attribute in other words it was skill person forgot things so that he could have things and realizing that this was skill and that it was on full automatic we of course had the reason why people were not able to remember they were so anxious to forget in the spring of 1955 in the tenth clinical unit we discovered that something you wouldnt mind forgetting was far far more important than something you wouldnt mind remembering and made several tests which demonstrated considerable rise in tone as result of using this single command something you wouldnt mind forgetting however because many more interesting things were showing up and occurring we did not give this really the attention it deserved and actually to this moment the process is not as thoroughly tried as it might be it might very well occur that this process would succeed many other processes as something which would produce longcontinued and stable result with the first clinical unit october 5november 16 1953 which was taught in camden new jersey we made considerable codification of automaticity and randomitywhich had first been introduced in the philadelphia lectures of december 1952 the understanding of these two things demonstrated that the greatest automaticity in which anyone was engaged was remembering and forgetting thus exercises on remembering and forgetting were of course very very important it should be understood then that amount of engram running or present time processes would handle this highly specialized thing automatic remembering and automatic forgetting and in view of the role remembering and forgetting play in everyday living we couldnt consider the person very thoroughly processed unless we had taken his memory into account thus whatever other processes are run on the individual something should be done in order to bring this automatic memory factor under control we have rather suspected of recent months that it is not necessary to have great versatility of subject in remembering in order to restore memory the mere act of remembering something is enough to take over the automaticity in other words there isnt an automaticity for every subject you can remember there is simply an automaticity on the subject of memory similarly on forgetting one might think there was forgetting automaticity on every type and subject known but there is only one mechanism behind all of this and that is simply an automaticity of forgetting now if you were to stabilize preclear in present time and do all sorts of other things with him and yet neglect exercising his memory in any degree it is probable that you would have left the sphere of recall untouched to his detriment and would have left him with this automaticity and the automaticity of remembering and the automaticity of forgetting could of course push him on down again so we should say that any preclear who becomes stable should have had exercises in remembering and forgetting the actual history of straight wire is of course very old one much older than dianetics we did not invent straight wire we discovered and observed great many mechanics about memory which had been neglected hitherto but we find that straight wire or memory exercises are actually very ancient and have been used for at least sixtyfive years there were many excursions and experiments made in straight wire in early dianetic days one of these was repetitive straight wire simply asking person to remember something over and over and over again this naturally succeeded from the running of an engram running an engram through and through and through eventually erases it so it was tried with straight wire and it was discovered that this was fairly effective but again was not an answer the old dianetic auditor can probably remember early straight wire with affection and probably can remember great many successes as result of using it and strictly as nostalgic exercise he should know now that with ownership processing as given in the congress of eastern scientologists he could make oldtime straight wire totally effective with the question can you recall time when somebody else had that condition can you recall time when you decided to have that condition on all those cases who are already in fairly good condition in the memory department he would have to ask both of these questions of any case in order to get result and he would have to ask both of these questions many many times until the preclear had flattened his comm lag this would be rather crude form of straight wire but it would at least be completing the cycle of action from olden times straight wire is one of the most agreed upon things in dianetics and scientology there may have been many people who questioned the advisability of running engrams or running secondaries or scanning engrams or doing something else but nobody ever questioned very seriously the efficacity of straight wire when it worked it is and has been broadly accepted as near synonym for dianetics and scientology article three the theory of straight wire memory has played an intimate part in existence since the first thetan the creation of time and the creation of memory were concurrent incidents let us take single particle we find that with this single particle time is possible since the space occupied by the singleparticle would be indeterminate in placing the particle unless of course there were eight particles demarking the space itself at which time you would now have nine particles and it would be very simple to have time but with one particle we cannot have time we have to have two particles to have time and we have to have two particles to have memory we have to have two particles to have memory because we would have to have reference point for establishing where the moving particle had been if one had remained motionless in other words let us take motionless particle and then let us have another particle move in relationship to that motionless particle we would then be able to tell that it had moved by remembering that it had been where it was originally and then remembering successively the positions it had gone through until it arrived at its present time position the moment that it moved further one would have situation again of remembering what had been present time for it but observing what was now its present time position memory is then mechanically the tracking of positions where postulates or considerations are concerned however we must first have the consideration that space particles in time can exist and then that one can remember this latter is more important than the mechanical facts of time for if one continually makes the consideration that he cannot remember he is at once making the consideration that he cannot discover the former position of earlier particles and any advanced student who knows about perfect duplication or if you care to read about that in the creation of human ability will find that it would now be next to impossible for the individual to cause the vanquishment of the particle in other words if the person cannot remember where the particle came from originally he cannot establish its original position and being unable to establish its original position he cannot get an exact duplication of it which is to say perfect duplicate of it and so will get persistence of the particle once one has forgotten its original position which is the mechanical aspect of this one is then longer able to cause it to disappear in processing we very often run into person who has heavy facsimiles in other words these facsimiles are so heavy and so weighty that he can barely push them around this is simply basically postulate that these things are heavy that energy is heavy but next to that it is consideration that one cannot do anything to them one cannot cause them to vanish therefore one cannot cause them to affect one less observing then that things tend to become more permanent and more solid the less one can remember where they came from though this is not total truth you understand we could consider that all objects are memory or more accurately that all objects are mismemory if an object is there one comment you could make about it is that everybody has forgotten when and where it was created and having forgotten when and where it was created it now persists thus you might say that objects depend or persistent spaces depend entirely for their persistence upon forgettingness which is to say memory now as memory applies to postulates and considerations as well as to spaces and masses it becomes obvious that conditions good conditions or bad would tend to persist where they were misremembered in other words if you knew exactly where all the particles of your car were created and how many movements back they were created and who had created them the more important fact and who had assembled them into car you would not have any car it would simply disappear in other words perfect memory would bring about vanishment of all objects and spaces well at least that is the theory and the theory is borne out by the fact that it is only necessary to remember who created something to have it diminish in density or in case of light mass of energy such as an engram to vanish in that thetans become very possessed with the idea of making nothing out of everything their primary obsession memory an exact and persistent memory becomes an obsession with the thetan he knows that when he longer remembers the exact genus of all those things in his vicinity he will longer be able to make them disappear therefore failure in memory causes thetan to be very frantic now we neednt go too deeply into just exactly why this is but i will brush it in passing all things like to be duplicated thetan has mass space wavelength and time therefore to get perfect perception of anything he thinks the best choice would be to look at something which has mass space wavelength and time of course this is impossible but this is thetan beingduplicated and this indeed would be the most comfortable frame of mind for thetanto have persistence or nonpersistence of any kind in its vicinity thus when thetan begins to see more and more spaces and he is not space and when he begins to see more and more masses and he is not mass and when he begins to see more and more wave motion and he is not wave motion he conceives the fact that nothing is duplicating him which is to say that nothing is taking look at his nothingness and becoming nothing in other words hes losing control of things well it just so happens that thetan knows that if he could remember the exact place everything had been generated the exact time and the exact conditions and the exact person who did it he would then get disappearance thus when thetan begins to object to life and considers that this idea of masses and spaces is foolish and should be discontinued as the boys evidently believe in the nuclear physics department they can only think in frantic terms of making nothing out of everything it does not happen to be healthy frame of mind for thetan to be obsessed with making nothing out of things we see people around who themselves have considerable bulk but who are unable to make nothing out of things but who try all the time to do so anyway for instance you tell joke they say well thats nothing and theyve heard that before you buy new hat and they say theyve always liked it you invent new dance step and they say it has been done before they are on covert level trying to make nothing out of something these people already know they cant make nothing out of masses and spaces they are already obsessed with the idea that masses and spaces are dangerous to them and therefore they do have to make nothing out of them and these people at the same time will be obsessed with problems in memory and will probably develop fantastic comm lag on the auditing question give something you wouldnt mind forgetting it does not follow that everybody who wants to improve his memory is obsessed with making nothing out of everything but it does demonstrate how we get these obsessions on the subject of memory actually you could probably remember oneone hundredth of what you are able to remember and still get along certainly i know lots of places where people would employ you if you could remember just onethousandth of what you are able to remember at this moment the income tax bureau is one of them memory strangely enough has very little to do with intelligence intelligence is the ability to pose and resolve problems relating to survival without some memory one would have track of time but an absolutely perfect memory does not necessarily connote perfect intelligence if ones memory were really perfect he would have objects or spaces with which to pose or resolve problems so therefore certain amount of mismemory or forgettingness is necessary to have factors with which to play game when memory is entered as factor into the posing and resolving of problems one then gets the phenomenon of time track one conceives through experience the identities similarities and differences between the present time factors and the factors of the past and here we have the key to aberration theoretically person could not be aberrated who was not living on time track since he would have need of any kind to associate any spaces or objects of the present with any spaces or objects of the past now naturally spaces or objects of the present are ever exactly identical to spaces or objects of the past but person through mismemory will eventually come into situation where he does actually conceive present time situation to be identical with past situation when he conceives this automatically and with great ease he is then in fair way to being aberrated one could not go so far as to say that experience at all is necessary to the living of life but one could go so far as to say that total reliance upon experience or hearsay or second hand observation in life brings person into very frightening state of mind therefore mismemory could be of this kind one sees certain number of factors before him one misremembers some factors that happened to him earlier sufficiently to conceive that these earlier factors are now identical with the factors he faces when he has managed this he has essentially time in other words identity does not give him past he says the factors i face right now are the factors which confronted five years ago but he does not conceive this articulately he conceives this on mismemory basis he feels that the present factors have significance which is due to nothing but themselves but its actuallydue to combination of past factors this essentially is about all there is to aberration aberration is time it does not conceive that there is any earlier position for any particle thus we have the interesting fact that perfect memory to an extreme and absolute that has never existed would bring about situation of universe form mass space and that completely imperfect memory which again has never existed would bring about total collapse of all time and would bring all factors into the present now somewhere between these two lies the game called sanity it is in the effort to attain this game called sanity that the auditor exercises the memory of the preclear he must exercise the memory in such way as to uncover great many similarities which the preclear thought were identities now here is the subject of valence by valence we mean personality theoretically person could have his own valence but more familiarly the term is used to denote the borrowing of the personality of another preclear in his fathers valence is acting as though he were his father the word valence means in latin strength valentia we use it in dianetics and scientology as meaning personality but it has not escaped the value of strength person takes at will the valences of commanding nature or valences of very obedient nature in order to answer up to various situations one person may routinely use several valences in order to handle women he takes the valence of his father in order to handle students he takes the valence of bulldog in order to get drunk he takes the valence of horse there may or may not be any sense to the valence beyond the fact that it was strong valence in situation relating to the subject in other words he has mental image pictures unconsciously experienced by him which have as their dominant or obedient personality things related to the subject which he then identifies with the subject many psychotic is in the valence of bedpost others are in the valence of god but these are totally stuck valences any sane person routinely uses in his modus operandi of existence vast category of valences to say that somebody is capable of two or three valences would be misnomer person takes many valences now it is not necessary to pick up these valences or these personalities or strengths or weaknesses in our expanded understanding of the word in order to handle existence thetan is perfectly capable of mocking up beingness or valence sufficient to the situation simply compounded from the elements of the situation if he does this easily he is very intelligent he has good imagination or you might say good valencination only when he has tremendous successful valence in the past which has enormous command value or enormous obedience value and then when he forgets this and conceives that it is all in the present does he assume anything like fixed valence he then is you might say himself the himself or herself is simply valence which is moderately commanding moderately obedient and which is dreamed up or taken out of past experience the automaticities of memory are dependent upon this valence situation by automaticity we mean anything that goes on running outside the control of the individual this in its severest definition would seem to indicate that everything was automatic except those things upon which the person had his immediate attention and this is not too far from wrong it is not bad to have things automatic it is bad to have placed things on automatic which are detrimental to ones happiness and life the more automaticities exist around the individual the less living that individual is likely to do this is quite interesting to observe off the subject little in business office which is determined to modernize with all the latest machinery and equipment it is the theory that the introduction of all these automaticities will bring down the number of people on staff and will bring up the volume of work now there is makeorbreak point beyond which the introduction of automaticities is detrimental to the business itself and will actually cut down the amount of outgoing communication in fact in great many overly machined business offices the greatest amount of work done is by the repairmen keeping the machinery in action but without certain amount of automaticity in an office it is true that very little work gets done harm comes from this factor of automaticity only when people have forgotten that something has been put on automatic for when thing is put on automatic which is to say when it is put in situation where it is intended to run without any observation of any kind from anybody and without any knowledge on the part of anybody that it is running we suddenly find sphere of deteriorization and we cannot trace it we do not know what has broken down since we did not know what was there and had been placed on automatichere memory plays an interesting role the first requisite to putting something on automatic is to forget that it has been placed on automatic and that in the severest scientological use of the word is what we mean by full automaticity something is going on and we do not know its cause we do not know its cause because we have forgotten that we have placed it there or we have forgotten that anyone placed it there we do not even know that anything is there but something is happening in that sphere now although this relates to many parts of life we are apt to specialize on the psychosomatic character of this manifestation we have forgotten or maybe never did know who put bad leg into this body bad leg is in this body we try by moving it around or by manipulation to change the bad leg and find out that we get an additional persistence to the bad leg only by discovering the ownership of the decision or idea or mass of the bad leg would we get complete vanquishment of the bad leg now if we went just little bit further and remembered also who made the leg in the first place and remembered this fully to the extent of remembering who made all the particles that went together and made the leg and who made all of the organizations of food which fed the leg we would have leg so we see that we could carry memory through to complete vanquishment but automaticity and memory do not happen to be limited entirely and completely to just one factorpsychosomatic illness in fact person who would work memory simply to get somebody over psychosomatic illness has himself very bad identification life does not consist of psychosomatic illnesses as matter of fact the scientology auditor who tells preclears that he is going to get them over their psychosomatic illness has already created new automaticity as far as the preclear is concerned now the preclear isnt going to go do it the auditor by some necromancy is going to do it and were likely to get failure on the part of the auditor to remedy that psychosomatic illness as matter of fact an auditor has business at all promising anybody that he will ever do anything about psychosomatic illness not of course because he cant because of all the professionals in the world the auditor is probably the one most likely to knock out psychosomatic illness but an auditor who says hes going to knock out psychosomatic illness and goes in the direction of knocking such things out is limiting himself so woefully that its hardly worth while knowing how to audit when preclears start telling us that they want to get rid of such and such psychosomatic illness we are apt to gaze at them with questioning eye since the person has an insufficiency of problems or he wouldnt have the psychosomatic illness and if we took it away he would just get another one unless we also remedied problems and all we can see out of this statement of the preclear is that this preclear has his attention fixed on something and he ought to have his attention unfixed off of it well if he has his attention this thoroughly fixed on psychosomatic illness he probably on gradient scale has his attention fixed on great many other and unpleasant things and as result we have problem here in an individual who is stuck all over the track hes identifying hes misremembering he is in to say the least an interesting state and even if we did get him over the psychosomatic illness we probably if we limited the auditing to this would not have made him happy so what we tell such preclear is well i may or may not do something about the psychosomatic illness but i will certainly make you feel happier about it usually he is fairly satisfied with such an answer the earliest coining of the memory exercises known as straight wire came from the formula of cause and effect in 1950 in the early hda lectures we described this as the act of stringing line between present time and some incident in the past and stringing that line directly and without any detours in other words we conceived the auditor was stringing straight wire of memory between the actual genus of condition and present time thus demonstrating that there was difference of time and space in the condition then and the condition now and that the preclear conceding this difference would then rid himself of the condition or at least be able to handle it this essentially was the overcoming of automaticities or the locating of automaticities the preclear had some engram that had command value over him and it was necessary to locate the source of that situation in order to bring it under the preclears control the term straight wire was used to differentiate between dianetic memory exercises and those which had been used by psychotherapy in the past and great need for such differentiation was necessary because theres many dianetic auditor who permitted free association and other unworkable techniques to go on in the guise of auditing hence theterm straight wire and that term seems to be an apt one since it stuck with auditors all during these years the motto of straight wire could be said to be discover the actual genus of any condition and you will place the condition under the control of the preclear article four straight wire and present time one of the earliest observations of straight wire which we made was on less preclear than burke belknap then studying to be an hda in the small reception room at 42 aberdeen road in elizabeth new jersey burke had come in complaining of headache and in an offhand way i said ill handle that and asked him to remember who had headache he promptly came up with memory of someone else having headache and then someone else having headache and finally of someone who complained about headaches and abruptly his headache was gone well this was very triumphant but i did not have enough sense to quit at that exact moment but started to run him through the incident he had last recalled and instantly his headache was back now we are telling you this for more reason than nostalgia this was the first time we observed the difference between straight wire and engram running to the degree that straight wire did not run out the engram but only got it out of present time naturally in theory we had had this around for some time but here was an exact example of this very thing occurring in other words you could remember something and feel good and then could run immediately into the engram and feel terrible all over again now this immediately and instantly gives us the reason why psychotherapy was unworkable before dianetics one would get the preclear into present time and of course the preclear is always in present time but the engrams are there also so it is more accurate to say get the engrams out of present time and then have the engram get into present time again and have the preclear in the same state as before in other words as long as and as often as we wanted to get these mental image pictures of pain and unconsciousness into and out of present time we would have change accordingly in the preclear theoretically we could throw birth into present time and out of present time into present time and out of present time and have the preclear as rapidly have and not have the symptoms of birth now when we realize that our machinery as bodyplusthetan is being continually monitored by the environment and that the machinery which throws engrams into present time is also monitorable by the environment and by others in it we see that simply throwing the engrams out of present time and keeping the preclear in present time would apparently be inadequate processing here evidently we would make preclear well and would then make him unwell just to the degree that we took out of present time and put into present time the engram causing that unwellness now in view of the fact that an engram contains pain and unconsciousness it is very likely to become an automaticity thus we are playing tag with an unknown genus whenever we are playing tag with engrams preclear does not like to look at things which suddenly make him feel like his head is being torn half off thus he will continue to keep out of existence for himself and to refuse control over all engrams by old dianetic standards then straight wire was merely patchup process it did not do too much for the preclear but made him momentarily comfortable it did this simply by slipping out of present time engrams engrams were held in present time by the preclears making bridge between present time and the engram of locks which is to say conscious moments which lay on top of the engram in other words we could have sort of picture of dark lyinginwait engram which had happened or had been created at some early date which had been keyed in by conscious incident little bit later which had been bridged by repetition of similarities until at last the preclear conceived an identity between the moment of the engrams occurrence and present time by this bridge of locks we would then have an engram being present time so much for the early attitude what is the attitude about this now there is real change its just that the preclear can be brought to control mass ofenergy as heavy as an engram by the gradient scale of controlling lighter masses here we have essentially the idea of the person who lifts calf every day until the calf becomes bull then we have person who is able to lift huge animal now i dont know that anybody ever tried this but theoretically it would actually occur certainly it is much more likely that this gradient scale of lifting would more workably apply to locks and engrams than to pure bull by straight wire on modern standards we get the preclear to handle the light keyins over and over and over new incidents or the same incidents until at last he is able to handle the actual genus of the situation at which time the condition of course will vanish the great oddity is that preclear is so wary of heavy hidden mass like an engram that when it comes into present time automatically he will not or cannot throw it out of present time and this is the main thing which is wrong with the preclear heavy mental image from the past comes into present time then the preclear cannot throw it out of present time if he is unable to throw it out of present time it will stay in present time which is to say ride along with the preclear one of the goals of modern straight wire is to get the preclear to throw the engram out of present time or into present time at will in other words to teach him that he doesnt necessarily have to vanquish all energy massesthat he can handle these energy masses and get them up to him or away from him at will clear by definition is somebody who does not have any engrams in present time with him by actual practice clear would have to be stable thetan exterior since the body itself is composed of energy masses which unfortunately contain engrams we are longer trying to rid present time of all engrams we are simply trying to bring about an ability on the part of the preclear to handle energy masses in the past or in present time at will and by gradient scale to cure his fright of being confronted with picture and his compulsion and necessity to obey that picture article five straight wire and pictures with the advent of communication processing new method of handling pictures arose within minutes after the first discovery that communication alone would vanquish masses we found that communication would handle pictures themselves in view of the fact that pictures have been more or less common denominator of investigation since the earliest dianetic days we became very interested in this startling new method of handling the bank whenever person of the usual mark i homo sapiens type is asked to remember something he gets picture along with it this matter what names or description you place upon it is simply picture which has been taken of an event in the past said picture now being in the present this automatic feed mechanism has gone relatively unnoticed but occasionally described back through the centuries it seems that this should be considered very usual however it was not until dianetics that anyone made any kind of thorough study of these pictures in the first place of what were these pictures composed it was an old saw in mysticism that mental energy was one thing and physical energy was another thing i suppose this was stated many times out of hopefulness rather than fact today enough data has come to hand to establish that this mental energy such as is contained in picture and the energy of earth or of the electric light company are different only in wavelength the proof of this is that person by remedying havingness can increase his weight if he only pulls the havingness in and can decrease his actual weight by throwing the havingness away of course preclear has to be in fairly good condition and has to be able to throw away or possess havingness at will in order to do this but in actual experiment weight has been changed many pounds either way by this and believe if you can weigh mental energy on set of toledo scales you certainly have something very intimate to the energy of the electric light company and you dont have anything different than the energy of the electric light company save only in characteristicthese mental image pictures then are actually composed of energy they have mass they exist in space and they follow some very very definite routines of behavior the most interesting of which to us just now is the fact that they appear when somebody thinks of something he thinks of certain dog he gets picture of the dog when person is rather far gone when he thinks of the dog he gets the picture of house when he thinks of house he gets picture of cactus this persons pictures are not associated with his own thoughts but are occurring on total automaticity but what do we have in the first place but an automaticity an individual thinks of dog and he gets picture of that dog this carried on long enough would bring it about where he would think of one dog and get the picture of another dog and little bit further he would merely think the thought and get picture without any relationship between the thought and the picture well if these pictures are actually more or less the same stuff as is sold to you for five cents kilowatt hour by the power company then you could suppose that they would have some effect on the human body and so they do pictures are continually being taken by the body or the thetan or the thetans machinery or the body machinery you never saw such complete cinematographic plant in your life as the thetanplusbody mark i homo sapiens something even takes pictures when he is deeply unconscious and during an operation not only does person take pictures of anything and everything just as you right this moment are taking picture of this page if you dont believe it close your eyes and take look at the page again oh you didnt know you were taking pictures all the time but also these pictures then react back on the individual more or less as the incident itself reacted on the individual thus if person had bang on the thumb from hammer he is certain to have taken picture of this later on this picture gets into present time and his thumb hurts it is picture which is impinged upon his beingness so as to reproduce some of the qualities in the picture one of the oldest obedience stunts on the track was to convince the thetan that he ought to obey the picture in fact according to the ometer people within the last many generations have taught their children to obey the picture in other words made use of these mental image pictures in order to produce higher level of obedience on the part of child certainly it might or might not have produced higher level of obedience but it did produce much higher level of conscience and it is in itself practically the anatomy of conscience overt actmotivator sequence is itself only the action and reaction of these pictures person takes picture and then the picture turns on him thus the handling of these pictures becomes very important if ones going to change the characteristics of an individual one of the first things then that an individual ought to be able to do is to handle these pictures an individual cant handle these pictures hes in bad shape now lets take this thing we call black five this poor fellow is so far gone he cant even see pictures any more he only sees blackness in front of him well this blackness may be some kind of screen it may be anything but at least it prevents him from seeing pictures and hes very often keeping himself from being victimized by all these pictures by having continuous black screen in front of him that the pictures reach through the black screen and do influence him anyhow he hopefully overlooks however remember that this blackness itself is only picture and so we dont have special category of 1 people who get pictures and 2 people who get blackness we have only one category we get people who have pictures of various things and people who have pictures of special things and this is simply gradient scale of how easily does the individual handle these pictures that get into present time when he handles present time returned pictures very poorly more and more pictures get stacked up in present time and pretty soon he is fairly massive case hence you can appreciate our excitement when we found new way of handling pictures there have since been developed as we became more versed in handling special problems additional ways such as ownership processing but to this moment we know of better routine way of handling pictures than combination of straight wire and the data which we are going to give you here before we go very deeply into this you should realize that pictures are not bad and that blackness is not totally bad pictures are used by the thetan to assist his memory they are not necessary to his memory but he begins to play with the idea of taking pictures of everythingand remembering by pictures as sort of game it is an interesting game gives him something to look at gives him some mass and makes him happyup to the point when he collects pictures of great unhappiness then these moments of unhappiness stay with him simply because he has pictures of them and really for other reason as far as blackness is concerned blackness is usually the protective coating between the preclear and the pictures not unusual for preclear to have machine either of his own or belonging to his body which blackcoats every picture that shows up before he looks at it this keeps him from getting stunned by these pictures this by the way is somewhat different than having blackness in continual and total restimulation both of these conditions regarding blackness exist the machine that makes blackness and having black picture in restimulation there is also simply the blackness of looking around inside of head and as yet the modernness of science has not installed electric lighting inside skulls we also get the condition where these pictures are concerned of the thetans machinery taking pictures and then trying to show them to the thetan while the thetan is inside the head this is very interesting condition because the machinery cannot reach the thetan but reaches the head of the body instead and if this machinery is very powerful which it usually is the body becomes very uncomfortable solely by reason of having pictures shoved up against it by machinery which is foreign to it so we get lot of conditions which are germane to pictures but these pictures are not all bad and the whole subject of pictures is not bad subject and again before we go any further you should realize that it is not absolutely necessary for the auditor to handle pictures in the fashion we are going to outline now in order to have straight wire as given in an earlier article work but this is the fillip which really handles pictures and is called hellos and oks to pictures the technique has limitations it is limited by the fact that the auditor can audit straight wire on preclears lower on the scale than those who can handle pictures with hellos and oks in other words rather low toned preclear can simply be run on straight wire as given earlier but when he comes upscale and starts to get pictures this process can then be applied the anatomy of the process is simple indeed every time the preclear remembers something the auditor asks him did you get picture if the preclear did which is usually the case the auditor tells him throw shower of hellos at it the preclear does the auditor then says have it throw shower of oks at you the preclear does the auditor then says is the picture still there if the preclear says it is the auditor simply has the preclear complete the cycle of twoway communication with have the picture send shower of hellos at you and when the preclear does the auditor says throw shower of oks at the picture which the preclear does again the auditor asks him is the picture still there if it is the auditor simply repeats the four commands given above which is to say he has the preclear throw shower of hellos at the picture has the picture throw shower of oks to the preclear has the picture send shower of hellos to the preclear and the preclear send shower of oks to the picture actually the auditor can have the preclear do this over and over until the picture is gone for that is the single and solitary goal of the process to make the picture disappear it will be discovered that early in processing the auditor will have to make the preclear complete several twoway cycles of communication with the picture before it vanishes but as processing continues and as the preclear becomes more and more capable that fewer and fewer twoway exchanges are necessary to make the picture vanish and at length all the auditor has to say is throw it away and the preclear will be able to do so of course the case which can simply throw the picture away in the first place and get it back at will does not need to use communication processing on this fact which most auditors overlookthey neglect to test the preclear to find out whether or not the preclear can throw these pictures away now in the case of blackness this is rather foolish to ask the preclear to throw hellos at the blackness since these screens are very resistive indeed in the case of blackness one would simply use straight wire with the question recall time when you were looking at blackness over and over and over until the blackness was gone if the blackness doesnt go then its machine which is making the blackness but this is found to be handleable too by the same process if it is carried on long enough and even if that did not work machine processing wouldvery well we have here by throwing showers of hellos and oks back and forth between the preclear and the picture method of vanquishing the picture but if you as an auditor assume that all pictures are bad and ought to be thrown away you will have in your hands in very short space of time very unhappy preclear if he is fairly upscale he will tell you why he is unhappy if hes fairly well downscale he will simply hug it bitterly to his bosom the fact is you are getting rid of his pictures and his pictures are not bad phenomenon totally thus you were robbing him continually now the old dianetic auditor who is trained only to make pictures vanish or person who is obsessed with the idea of making nothing out of everything is liable to neglect this vital little step and if this vital little step is neglected this entire process will wind the preclear up in an unhappy state of mind so after the picture has been vanquished by either throwing it away or by throwing hellos and oks back and forth between the preclear and it the auditor must ask the preclear to get the picture back this is of course part of the automaticity cycle the picture got there automatically well the preclear had better take over that automaticityfor all automaticities are conquered by having the preclear do what is being done automatically or by simply sighting the genus of the automaticity thus having completed this twoway cycle of hellos and oks the auditor now says get the picture back this usually startles the preclear for at first the preclear will be very victorious at having gotten rid of this automatic function of pictures but the preclear one way or another will get the picture back he may get back some other facet of the scene he may get back picture different from the first one but what you want is that same picture of course dont badger and hound your preclear until he goes out of communication with you to get the same picture back you can tolerate certain amount of looseness at this stage of the processing but what you really want is the same picture back again now having gotten the preclear to get the picture back you now have him throw once more showers of hellos at it have it throw showers of oks at him have it throw showers of hellos to him and he throw showers of oks to it until it vanishes again and when it is vanished you ask the preclear to get the picture back now before you have handled this picture very much you will find usually that the preclear can simply bring the picture up and throw it away at will at which moment you go on to the next auditing question on straight wire which is recall time when or recall moment of whatever you were asking before and once more you ask him did you get picture you handle it in this fashion you have him throw hellos and oks back and forth you have him throw it away get it back you have him handle it in other words after while you will find the preclear will be able to get all sorts of pictures at will and throw them away at will you will also find that some of his automatic machinery starts to break down if this starts to happen why just continue him on the process you may have to drill him for short time on mocking up pictures if you knock out his automatic machinery which is giving him picturesdoing the mockups for himyou have made it necessary for you to give him the assurance that he can make pictures which will again make him happy very often preclear who is unable to make pictures but is getting everything automatically will recover his ability to create pictures once he brings this automaticity under control hellos and oks to pictures is very valuable process preclear will work up gradient scale to where he can throw some hellos and oks to engrams that pop up and will then be able to bring engrams into present time or throw them out of present time at will and when he can do this he has further worries or upsets about energy masses you will understand that this process of communication is entirely independent of locating the genus of the picture the actual knockout of the machinery making the pictures could be accomplished by having the preclear state that this or that created or owned the machine including himself until the machine was gone but this is not very good process it is robbing the preclear of something on which he has reality however we expect future developments will embrace something which gives us superior process along ownership lines remember now that our goal is not to make the preclear get rid of every picture that pops up our goal is to make him capable of handling those pictures which pop up throwing them away and getting them back at willthis process is also used with the technique tell something you wouldnt mind remembering tell something you wouldnt mind forgetting and was originally employed as part of this process article six psychoanalysis and straight wire when sigmund freud and breuer first began working on the theory that if an individual could recall enough he could be well they were working primarily on the assumption that there was something wrong which they now had to make right and that the wrongness was hidden or buried memory it is notable to remark today that scientology does not try to find something wrong in order to make that wrongness right this introduces via on the line introduces an assumption into the case which is not justified all we assume is that an individual can be more able than he is and we take it from there we are not looking for hidden memories another thing which freud assumed was that guilt underlay these hidden memories as their primary propulsive mechanism this was not necessarily true for you will discover that anyone matter how innocent who has been struck if he has been struck hard enough will begin to believe that he must have been guilty of something in other words he gets reason why he has been punished which may or may not have any actuality in fact in other words any sudden blow or duress can be expected to have as its consequence the feeling that one has been guilty in order to stay reasonable or rational being an individual has to assume that there must be reason for everything this is not necessarily true at all thus guilt comes about merely from blow or duress i imagine if you put man in prison long enough he would be absolutely certain at the end of that time that he had committed the crime for which he was incarcerated i suppose that if you questioned man long enough about his guilt if this questioning were under duress he would begin to feel he was guilty of the crime of which he was being accused which accounts for many of the confessions which are brought forth by thirddegree methods even the police have begun to question these having discovered all too often that the person was really innocent although he now believed he was completely guilty thus we have the fact that physical pain and unconsciousness in memory would produce hidingness in the memory since person would not want to confront painful picture and would bring about feeling of guilt all this is resolved simply by making the individual capable of handling energy pictures or energy masses or spaces regardless of their size shape or threat in performing psychoanalysis emphasis was then laid upon memory and upon things about which society expected people to feel guilty in this alone we have the reason why psychoanalysis is such long drawnout affair and why it leaves person in such careful frame of mind the psychoanalytic patient was expected to talk long enoughwithout much acknowledgment from the analystto disclose hidden memories the actual hidden memories were of course moments of pain and unconsciousness and if the psychoanalyst had ever gotten patient into one of these moments of pain and unconsciousness he wouldnt have known what to do about it but this was outside the theory if well inside the practice in the process of trying to recover hidden memories the analyst was continually in combat with the automatic forgettingness of the patient by asking person to recall and recall and recall and recall and think about the past the analyst often got the individual back down the time track and didnt get him up again in the first place the analyst not being very able in the field of duplication seldom gave repetitive question which would have freed the patient from one line of action further the analyst was insufficiently observant and inquiring he may or may not have noticed this phenomenon of energy pictures but being trained in rather mystic school he probably did not believe that these energy pictures possessed any energy and so could not do the patient any harmbut let us suppose that we were actually trying to uncover hidden memories for the preclear if this were the case then we would have to get his forgettingness off of automatic and into his control if you wish to reform the entire field of psychoanalysis which is not any particular mission for the scientologist as scientology is not psychotherapy you yet could do so by the publication of this material have the patient relax and become aware of the fact that you the analyst are there that he is there that the room is there and that you are about to do some psychoanalysis enter into discussion with the patient concerning his trials and tribulations in the presenttime world permitting the patient to originate communications and become relaxed about talking with the analyst now that these steps have been accomplished ask the patient this question and use other question aside from incidental and momentary discussions and acknowledgments other tell something you wouldnt mind forgetting matter how long the patient took to answer this question do not abandon it and do not go away from the question but at last still maintaining pleasant relations with the patient obtain an answer to this question having obtained the patients statement that he has at last found something that he is very certain he wouldnt mind forgetting the analyst should then say very well as an acknowledgment of the fact that the question has been answered and the analyst should never at any future time omit to acknowledge with very well or some such statement the fact that the patient has completed the analysts command having received an answer to this question the analyst must now repeat the very same question and again must get an answer to this question and again must acknowledge the fact that an answer has been received the analyst should not go into discussions of the material and should not tell the patient what the material means for the analyst should be well aware of the fact that if the patient has already reached this depth in his psyche he must perforce be capable of reaching much deeper depths and that better information will always be forthcoming even though the analyst finds himself becoming inattentive or upset by the repetition of the same question over and over he must continue this he must each time the patient has complied and the analyst has acknowledged ask again tell something else you wouldnt mind forgetting this should be the sum total of the analysis and this program should be continued as long as the patient is being analyzed whether that be four times week for year or four times week for two years other interchange or material should be discussed or addressed than these things the patient would not mind forgetting if an analyst were to follow this program and if he were capable of repeating this question or duplicating so often and so long he would discover that his patient had come into more possession about his life and his beingness than any other program could have accomplished and that it will longer be necessary for the analyst to evaluate for or make decisions for the patient we recommend that this process be coached to analysts in the hope that the field of psychoanalysis could be made into successful psychotherapy for scientology is not psychotherapy and does not intend to take the place of any existing psychotherapy article seven how to do straight wire there is happy medium of twoway communication which must be present in all processing whether that processing be opening procedure by duplication or straight wire enough twoway communication will keep the preclear aware of being audited and aware of the auditors interest an insufficient amount of twoway communication may cause the preclear to feel lack of participation in his case which will cause that case to sag or bog too much twoway communicationwill simply get in the road of the process an auditor must be aware of these factors and have feeling for the right amount of twoway communication whenever he is processing preclear one of the most delicate subjects in all auditing and one of the most delicate skills in auditing consists of knowing how much twoway communication to enter upon as an auditor with the preclear straight wire requires this as in any other process however many errors can be made in straight wire with twoway communication which would have peculiarly detrimental effects the preclear you must understand is indulging in recalling his past and we can forgive preclears for being excited about remembering various pleasant parts or various unpleasant parts of the past we can also forgive the preclear for trying to justify some of the actions he has suddenly recalled having entered upon in his past thus we can understand that it is necessary for the preclear to be permitted to communicate about what he is doing otherwise he will feel suppressed and straitjacketed by the auditor who refuses to let him talk but the preclear who just goes on talking endlessly about what he is recalling is not doing himself any good he is not doing the process he is talking about the process thus to some slight degree he must be checked on this excessive comm lag the auditor should be very definitely aware of what comm lag is before he does very much auditing he must also be aware of what acknowledgment is before he does very much auditing comm lagcommunication lagis the interval of time between the moment of the auditors asking the question and the reply to that exact question by the preclear near reply is not reply reply to some related question is not reply the interval between may be occupied by argument from the preclear talk from the preclear or silence from the preclear it does not matter what goes on between the asking of the question and the answer to the question the internal is communication lag in other words communication is not taking place during this interval communication lag is flat when it is consistent person may have habitual lag of ten seconds he may answer everything after tensecond pause if person then answers after tensecond pause on particular process it could be said that his communication lag was flat since his communication lag is always ten seconds we say that question is flat when the communication lag has been similar for three successive questions now that is flat question the communication lag might be five seconds five seconds and five seconds we would still say with some justice that the question lag was flat however the process lag would not be flat until the actual normal exchange lag was present the question would longer influence the communication factors of the preclear when the process is flat usually because these processes are very beneficial it occurs that the individual under processing talks very rapidly after process is flat his basic lag has changed there is another kind of communication lag with an automaticity of communication which an auditor should understand when the question has excited machine into answer it is quite common for the answers to come very rapidly often too rapidly for the preclear to articulate when this occurs the auditor is advancing against communication speed which is as artificial as communication lag and it will be discovered after the question is answered several times that this communication speed will drop into normal and will then expand out into communication lag acknowledgment is very necessary study an auditor must always acknowledge what the preclear has said this may enter compulsiveness into auditing for the auditor but it is nevertheless true that preclear will keep on talking until he knows he has been acknowledged some people would require sledgehammer in the face to know that they had been acknowledged one auditor stood in front of preclear and waggled his finger close to the preclears nose for several seconds and said very loudly good and the preclear knew she had been acknowledged it very often happens that the auditor is saying ok but is not acknowledging the preclear because the preclear does not understand or even hear the auditor saying ok thus occasionally an auditor should ask i just said ok did you hear that and the preclear will sometimes look rather sheepish and realize that he has not known that his statement was acknowledged very often the crankiness or upset of old people or children simply stems from the fact that nobody acknowledges them they begin to say something and then cant stop saying itand will keep on saying it until it has been acknowledged by someone that they have said it they would have to know that that statement had been acknowledged before they could come off the statement you could say that thing persists until it is acknowledged this by the way is quite applicable to machinery machinery keeps putting up pictures until the pictures are acknowledged and the thetan seldom acknowledges these pictures and so we get into dwindling spiral of automaticity which ends up in blackness it is not cure however to simply have the preclear say ok to all the machinery the auditor should also understand the axioms as contained in the creation of human ability particularly the conditions of existence which are outlined in the axioms these are quite important particularly important are those axioms devoted to isness and notisness we find that person very often notises his pictures or not ises his memory in other words he meets his memory or pictures with force he pushes force against force and then we have accumulation of force and this is not particularly good the apparency or isness condition of existence comes about of course through alterisness where we try to change mass for long time we eventually get mass which is persisting and that persistence is isness so we see that changing masses with anything less than life or memory or communication or postulate brings us into condition of persistence of condition the auditor who knows this well knows that if he were to try to change with notisness or alterisness deformed shoulder he would find that the condition of the deformed shoulder was persisting greater than ever such well informed and skilled auditor might use with great profit an additional commandmaking two straight wire commands in all the additional command would be recall moment of prevented example the process would then be recall moment of studiousness and when this command seems flat recall moment of prevented studiousness the latter command takes out the notisness of the preclear actually the best results are obtained by using these two commands supplying whatever is necessary in the blank one is run fairly flat then the other is run until it is fairly flat then the first is run again when it is again flat run the second and so onas new material thus is developed the duplication of questions is something that is very hard for an auditor who has not had much processing to do he will get discursive he will go off away from this necessity to duplicate it over and over and over thus many processes are rendered null and void by an auditor failing to complete the process he cannot stand the idea of duplicating doing the same thing again and again and again because he apparently is stacking his time track up actually he is not doing so and if he did it long enough if he simply would go ahead and audit and ask the same question over and over and over again long enough he would get drill for himself which would cure him of his inability to duplicate the biggest stumbling block to auditing is the obsessive change factor on the part of some auditors actually when an auditor has an obsessive change factor he seldom makes good auditor because his obsession to change gets into his auditing he has an obsession to change the preclear so he starts to force the preclear into changes which the preclear does not particularly want the preclear may want changes but not necessarily the kind the auditor wants the auditor precomputes the case in other words and decides in which direction hes going to change this preclear thats all right and an auditor can do it but when an auditor obsessively has to change the preclear we discover that the auditor at the same time will change the process in other words both of these are inabilities to duplicate an auditor can also err in the opposite direction he can use the process so long and so consistently and so far beyond its doing the preclear any good that the whole idea of auditing is defeated for more data on this look at the new auditors code which is printed in the creation of human ability and in dianetics 1955 these enjoin the auditor to run the process as long as it produces change when it longer produces change dont run it however an auditor who changes the process and says to himself well i changed this process because it was longer producing change when in reality it was and the auditor couldnt stand the duplication any longer is of course reasoning himself out of good results for the preclearthe auditor should understand that the discovery of the actual creator or genus of anything will bring about its vanishment this is also done by communication only ownership processing can be used very effectively on preclears and in straight wire but actually using communication as given in an earlier article is superior activity ownership processing is run by having the preclear state that this owns the condition or that owns the condition and just have him keep stating that this or that or the other thing and including himself and his machinery and the bodys machinery owns or made the condition or the pictures own or made the condition until the condition vanishes one has sighted the actual owner often enough however if one went on sighting the wrong owner often enough the picture or condition would strengthen in other words you would be misowning it all masses spaces conditions depend on misownership for their persistence in the absence of misownership we own up to the ownership of everything that we did and know the ownership of everything that everybody else did or haswhy everything would disappear ownership processing is declaring the proper owner its very amusing process ownership processing is best done using an ometer or any type of physiogalvanometer here we see at once that the principal ownership is the response that we get on the meter we get greater masses when we get misownership we get more reaction when we get ownership all the needle of lie detector or any such instrument registers is misownership when misownership is present the needle registers and when it is not present the needle doesnt register thus lie detector does not detect lie it merely detects the misownership of the picture of the incident criminal who says that he didnt do thing when he did will of course make the picture of the incident become stronger thus it will register similarly the criminal could say i did it when somebody else did and you would get an additional lie or the same reaction if the preclear says that he caused the picture when something else caused the picture the picture will become stronger and the needle of the meter will register this is about all there is to electropsychometric auditing one of the most notably lacking qualities in the unsuccessful auditor is charity i am reminded of section in the new testament which i misquote because it sounds better to the effect though i speak with the tongues of angels or of men though i have not charity i am as sounding brass or the tinkling of the temple bell an auditor who has charity who is continually critical of the preclear who is trying to change the preclear because the preclear is so bad seldom achieves very great results with the preclear because hes out of arc with the preclear mercy charity kindness are qualities which are not low scale they are the highest and kingliest qualities there are and an auditor should never forget them article eight scientology and straight wire it is great temptation to call anything psychotherapy which uses memory because psychotherapy has devoted itself to memory in the past this is fluke or freak psychotherapy should devote itself to aberration because scientology has process known as straight wire which uses memory it might be very easy to conclude that scientology was then psychotherapy and this of course would be true if the goals of scientology were those of psychotherapy the goals of psychotherapy are to eradicate unsocial or aberrated behavior in an individual the goals of scientology are to create better abilities in the individual scientology is far more closely related to education and its goals than it is to psychotherapy but because of the factors which scientology handles it is perforce not only intimately related to but is basic religion if you find anything disturbing about that associationscientology and religionwe might cockily ask if religion treats of the human soul has there ever been religion before scientologysince there was precious little information available about the human soul until we took our textbooks in hand naturally when you know the broad principles of anything such as memory and forgettingness these being two different items you can apply them to almost anything youwant to and as we have stated in an earlier article you certainly could take an elementary form of straight wire and apply it to the field of psychoanalysis and let the analyst go on and do much of the things he does as matter of fact if i were scientologist practicing in an area which contained some psychoanalysts i would definitely make it my business to associate myself with these people and train them to give the same question as given in an earlier article over and over to duplicate to acknowledge and to get some good works out of their patients this is very simple thing to train somebody in sharp discipline and it would not be out of order for scientologist to take this under his wing because lord knows the analyst has hard time in the society and has hard time with his patients furthermore it is not unusual for the field of psychotherapy to turn to the church when it is blocked and we hope it is not unusual for the church to try to make the world better place to live in but when you are using scientology as scientologist and youre employing straight wire you had better realize that your best results come about by returning self determinism to the preclear which is to say make him better able to handle and control himself and his environment in fact you will not be able to achieve any results of any lasting quality or of note unless you do this for the preclear therefore the degree to which you suppress his selfdeterminism by finding things wrong with him will depress as well the results of auditing as scientologist you should concentrate on increasing the abilities of person in the field of education memory is of the essence unless we could handle memory well we could not educate people well automatic forgettingness sets in on student almost as fast as the textbook is closed this is because he is on forced draft of memory he is expected to remember everything until the day comes when he can forget and remember at will he will be better than the book from which he has studied thus as scientologist you could explain this to an educator and use your skills and technologies to train this educator into the elementary steps of straight wire the delivery of the question the giving of the acknowledgment the duplication of the question you could train the educator into this as necessary step to education since every student he has who is failing is failing not because of real antipathy toward the subject but because the automatic characters of his memory are not properly engaged and in gear before we would spend years and great quantities of wealth upon the education of young man we would certainly see that he was in shape to remember or forget his material at will we would also see to it even as importantly that he was able to pose and resolve problems related to any subject were he able to do these two things he would always be an honor student why should we waste time as educators and as nation obsessed with education in handling minds which cannot remember and forget which cannot pose and resolve problems were we to practice this on an educational level and if we were to be careful at all times with all students to bring them into state of ability with regard to memory and problems and solutions before we gave them things to have memory and forgettingness about and problems and solutions we could probably place eight or nine foreign languages and eighteen or twenty new majors in any standard educational span and do it with success therefore education would be far more effective and would have much greater duration with the individual and as result we would have much higher culture in the field of business efficiency memory forgettingness and the posing and resolving of problems are the difference between an ineffective slavey and powerful executive with these processes almost any secondrate file clerk could be moved into valuable asset and certainly the moving of business executive from the lower brackets of ability in memory forgettingness and posing and resolving problems to an upper bracket might mean the make or break of that business while straight wire does not in any way supplant any of the other of the six basic processes you can be very certain that it can stand by itself as process it is very important to know this for it is the easiest process to teach anyone and it is the easiest way to obtain stable results if you were to essay to teach those people who had the handling of other people in their charge the elements of straight wire exactly how to do it as drill not to burden them in any degree with any theory to reassure them about the phenomena and to turn them loose to do exactly the drill called straight wire on those intimate to them you would have scientology spreading at very rapid ratethe only other solution akin to this would be to teach everyone 8c particularly parents who ordinarily run very poor 8c on their children however 8c appears to be more childish than straight wire straight wire appears to be deep and has great significances connected with it and would be done by adults much more easily furthermore an individual could conceive himself to be very wise in delivering straight wire and listening to the answers he got from it but do not let your student of course get so wise that he will stray from the process in other words i recommend to you that you would take some of the people who have some vague interest in scientology and take certain facet of their existence and run the basic straight wire question given in the earliest article in this series on that one facet until they understand something has happened then teach them how to do the process on others teach them these exact rudiments one awareness of the auditor the auditing room that an auditing session is in progress two twoway communication on casual basis three the delivery of the question four communication lag five the acknowledgment of the question six the duplication of that exact question having taught person to do these things and having taught him to do them well you could see that you have expanded his livingness and his beingness he can mean more to more people by this knowledge this knowledge is not difficult to learn it is not difficult to teach and we hope that we have placed in your hands at this time something which will help you to disseminate the information of scientology and to bring about better culture than that we havepab 56 professional auditors bulletin from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 163 holland park avenue london w11 _____________________________________________________________________ 8 july 1955 axiom 51 and communication processing let give you small review on communication axiom 51 says that mest cannot change mest and we find that postulates and live communication do change mest mest cannot change mest therefore pair of forceps cannot basically change tooth condition this is sweeping and i want you to realize how sweeping it actually is medical doctor would not be able to alter completely broken leg you may say thats silly of course he could he could come in and snap the bone back into place and the fellow would feel lot better im sorry medical doctor cannot over period of time change broken leg do you know what will happen lets look at it from the standpoint of life now and we find out that the individual got attention for his broken leg didnt he it will emerge as rheumatism some day in the next life it will emerge as two broken legs were going to get repetition of this because as soon as you attempt to change mest with mest in one fashion or another you are going to get persistence and that is all persistence of what in view of the fact that all conditions are postulated conditions and that the consideration behind them that they are bad or good is simply again consideration if we say persist it doesnt mean that it is either bad or good it simply means that condition what condition is it the condition we are trying to change and whenever we try to change mest with mest we get persistence of that condition it will crop up one way or another and you will see this time after time dealing as we are in very high echelon of live communication when we try to alter condition with mest we get this persistence restimulation is the condition persisting in the auditor as an auditor who goes around altering energy masses gets restimulated the auditor comes along and says now all i have to do is change this energy mass one way or the other and he may succeed in doing so as far as he can see for the moment so he goes off restimulated that is the condition persisting its going to persist one way or the other the only motto back of mest is persist but we have this licked hence axiom 51 postulates and live communication actually can bring about permanent change and can actually stop persistence now this process what wouldnt you mind____communicating with what wouldnt mind you communicating with is actually not low echelon process lowechelon preclear one with mockups and very little reality one who is not well off will not be touched by this process he cannot assimilate the process why because to run this process you have to have the cooperation of the preclears ability to asis you have to have the ability of the preclear to have cognition and the ability of the preclear to asis piece of energy that is to make perfect duplicate of it where then does that leave this process to be totally functional it leaves it upstairs because when you run it downstairs the individual begins to chew energy just chewing theenergy around doesnt make it persist but with all this chewing he isnt asising anything all he is doing is moving mass to position b anybody who is doing this gets cognition out of it at all he is waiting for that piece of energy to tell him something and this tells you great deal about the preclear who couldnt run an engram he was waiting for the mest to say something the preclear who could run engrams could still play game well enough to make the mest say over and over again what the mest had imprinted on it that is exactly why an engram could run and why we had success in running engrams and when an engram disappeared that is exactly what happened it was up there all right it was up there in lights but it wasnt saying anything it was bunch of sound waves imprinted on bunch of molecules of one kind or another and the preclear had to sort of pretend it was saying these things over and over in other words he made it talk now today an individual gets an engram in front of his face and you just tell him to make it talk make it say if you please exactly what is in the engram or make it say anythingit doesnt matter which as we look over this running of an engram let us say that we are getting an individual to run birth what we are doing is to get an energy mass called birth to articulate to an individual and it would run very handsomely indeed if we had the preclear saying okay this is actually terrifically effective way to run an engram if we wanted to start today running engrams we could full out and achieve tremendously superior successes because we could certainly run any kind of an engram in the bank we could dream it up and the preclear could dream it up could do anything he wanted to just to make these energy masses talk of course very strange phenomena happen on an occluded case when you have him dream up the fact that he has the concept of an engram in front of him you just look at him and you say now lets make believe that you have birth in restimulation in front of you this would be roughie and weird way to go about it and now lets pick up the engram at the point where the doctor is saying if you will just take this pint of strychnine mamma the child will be born much earlier you have him to make this concept say this and have him say okay to that the strange part of it is that you dont have to pay any attention to whether birth shows up or not i counted the number of births on an individual one time and it was several thousand believe and they all go back to fac ones and things like that so we just have him get the idea that he has birth in front of him and have it articulate quite often this totally occluded case will have complete birth show up and begin to run off but he was totally occluded wasnt he he couldnt run an engram we could just buckle right down at that point and actually run that engram with okays from the preclear just as it showed up or we could go on running synthetic engram in either case facsimiles would go out of restimulation in the individual as long as we have communication those energy masses will disintegrate and you will stop the persistence of the condition so lets look at the optimum way that i know of at this momentthe best way i know ofto separate universes on which i have had considerable success and to date have had failures as long as the preclear could at least articulate anything as long as you can make him do anything at all you can make him do this you have seen the process already give some things you could say to your mother if you wanted to make this very perfect if he is unable to play game you dont have to very often the preclear is unable to play game you would say now get the idea mamma is out there saying okay to all of this now give something else you could say to your mother then you say get the idea mamma is out there and have her say okay now give some things that mamma could say to younow you will get positive blowapart in fairly rapid order of the interiorization of the universe we know very well that people interiorize into body into other bodies into mest objects into planets so if you were to run this one all the way backward you would take somebody who is obviously seen to be interiorized into earth and what would you have him do you would say all right now give something earth could say to you if he is really interiorized into earth hell think up something then you have him say okay the next thing you know he will get the ball of earth way out there somewhere maybe its the first picture he has ever had you will say thats fine now give some more things that earth could say to you now give some things you could say to earth and very ordinarily he will come right on up the tone scale you will never see such perfect behavior of tone scale as when you use mest object then we would pick out if we really were bent on exteriorizing mr doakes and mr doakes was interiorized into the interiorizations another universe when we knew that we had the first one blown and we would know that because his physiological condition would very definitely alter we would go on to the next likely universe we find this fellow who has been linotype operator for eight thousand seven hundred and sixtytwo months or something of the sort we dont have to be specific we pick linotype machine and we say if he got into earth he certainly got there via some sort of apparatus he was controlling so we say all right what could linotype machine say to you he would think it over for moment very literalminded fellow would probably say it could say clank okay have it say clank you know i dont get any sonic on this hed say ive had this happen well just get the idea of its saying clank well its going clank all right oh you dont says the auditor aside and to himself have it say clank have it say clank linotype machine cant well i guess it could on thinking it over i guess linotype machine could all right ill have it say clank all right now have it say something else he does and we blow him out of the universe of the linotype machine now lets pick the wife he hates worst or something like that what could she say etc admittedly this is not short process but it keeps going faster and faster next we would pull him out of papa and mamma and maybe grandma and grandpa and so on we are doing one of these schoolbook by the table separations then we say now give something your body could say to you my body say something to and away we would go and we would blow him out of his head it will work with almost that mechanical ease the question is how many hours of auditing would it take to bring somebody who is totally interiorized into planet out through these various stages and finally out of his head as far as im concerned it is the minimum number of hours he could be audited for maximum resultwe could do tremendous number of things for him we could do momentary patchup on lot of things we could do this and we could do that but if we were going straight toward the goal of making this individual into the highest level of condition that we could make him into we would follow process just about like this it would be slow and it would be arduous but we would get better and better and better he would finally get to point where he could feel these things blow off and blow out on him i went so far one time as to try to exteriorize fellow from his engram bank i think i exteriorized lot of thetans from that bank but i never got the fellow out of it entirely because i didnt have the time his track finally stretched out in all directions and he could view it clearly and then he was terribly interested and wanted to run and have to do with each individual engramand there were about seventysix trillion years worth of them then there was the whole ge line so i abandoned that attempt he felt wonderful though and went around telling everybody he was cleared compared to his earlier state he sure was he was cleared easily from eight or nine heavy engrams in about eight or nine hours auditing the articulation of the actual communication would be something you would do on an individual who is having the vaguest difficulty playing game who couldnt asis birth at glance and this is the conclusion i have reached rather arduously over these past weeks on this i give you data when i have it axiom 51 is right it says you cant change mest with mest but postulates and live communication can change it but realization on the part of preclear with cognition is not possible so if he cant realize that means he cant asis so if he cant asis there he is but i have seen preclears pass right on up the line from cognition zero to almost instantaneous cognition in the air force they have ceiling zero we have cognition zero but its the same thingtotal fog it is immensely safe for an auditor to change by communication there is restimulation involvedpab 60 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l

to call your attention to something you might watch with some interest it is the systematized generality with which certain type of preclear answers questions he categorizes you ask him about cat and he gives you all cats many people will answer in that way and they very often answer with system there is nothing mysterious about this but it denotes the existence of groupers good old book one groupers when preclear answers in this fashion his track is very grouped whether he knows it or not in auditing this type of preclear i have countered this with some highly general processes i took up solutions but i didnt leave them specific why did i leave them unspecific why didnt i leave solutions and problems as solutions and problems simply because such preclears attention needs direction one of the handiest ways to go about this is just to take the eight dynamics with the know to mystery scale if you are going to categorize something you will have it well covered and you are going to hit most of the corners of the universe one way or the other by way of example i would like to tell you little more in detail about one such case i audited although his case level was in poor condition psychometrically and actually conversationally this man was sane among sane he had very good impulse toward healing he was very sensible and so forth he was rather intensely local in his scientology interests and he had tendency toward the only one and rather resented anything that might come in from another quarter on this this is the critical level he was not really powerful but he was fine man and had done lot of good processing at the beginning i had to actually work around in the session to get some sort of communication with the man so he could answer questions in other words give some solutions for god was utterly beyond him he couldnt communicate on this basis what is god solution to did communicate so that was the question we settled with and from there he went on down through all the dynamics we did not bother to take up himself very much because his generality was so great that he probably wasnt there now this man was not in bad shape he was in pretty good shape but casewise the mechanical aspects of his casehe was grouped generalized and far far too fixated on others to the exclusion of himself he wasnt there the optimum situation is earth is here other people are here im here my machines are here my body is here the reactive bank is here awareness of all these things he however was so far from being exteriorizable from the bodythat he had to be pulled out of the planet then out of some other bodies and then out of his own head one way or another it took some doing at first i could only try to develop some kind of twoway communication with this man i found him hellforleather on an obsession toward knowledge and telling person that you did not know something was not communication to him if you said when does the train leave and he told you i dont know he would not have communicated to you i almost bludgeoned him into the recognition that there was communication involved in telling somebody i dont know that you did refer to the problem or situation if you said i dont know and went right on off on one of those techniques which can be used on lowlevel case give an unknown datum consider the case reality if i asked him for something you wouldnt mind remembering something you wouldnt mind forgetting i would have actually exceeded his level of reality any man who is as obsessed on the subject of having to know as this normally is sitting in tremendous i dont know so i just used one of the r2s give an unknown datum he didnt interpret the auditing command he missed on each one of them somehow it came out wrong he couldnt be audited on whom he wouldnt mind communicating with it just didnt audit he didnt have any reality there was reality on the process as far as he was concerned we were just sitting there talking somewhere along the line when you have to handle such preclear youve got to find some kind of problem thats real to him or something that is real to him or something that will register if you are trying to get case entrance on case of this kind i get some lulus for some reason or another this man was really very able man there was nothing really wrong with him nothing specifically upsetting with his life but his general tone his general reality was just downreal poor i said give an unknown datum and he started reeling them offand he came into present time with the process he was naming abstractions abstractions abstractions unknown unknown i dont know when train leaves and so on things he wasnt looking at then the next thing you know he was giving unknown data about the material in the immediate auditing room and he gave lot of it so for my money that process flattened thats very covert way of running 8c on somebody isnt it give an unknown datum and finally he just came up splendidly and was actually looking at his environment actually just listening to the preclear and predicting about where he is going to go is quite game with this man i got groups high generalities terrific classifications he was giving back scientology as he had read it out of book there wasnt any thought in it at all he wasnt giving name and energy but by not addressing the point particularly but just drumming it and keeping in twoway communication we were suddenly getting him so specific that he was naming articles in the room we as auditors know whats wrong with somebody its matter of time and energy to resolve it the preclear doesnt know whats wrong with him so theres real talking to him on the subject if he knew what was wrong with him it wouldnt be wrong with him this man was glibly unaware of being there and he saw nothing strange or peculiar in his answers to questions anything everything and so on in situation like this you have to degrade the question down to actual action if you had two universes you would say what are some things you wouldnt mind saying to your mother and maybe he would find them you would go on and on and on until that was flat and then some things you wouldnt mind saying to your mother and make him say them and on and on and on and you would watch those universes go up in smoke always find what universe he is stuck in and then talk him out of it in this fashionthat is make him talk himself out of it you really cannow it is almost unimaginable not to be able to run this process on preclear and yet here was preclear that could not run it in such case you have to take the action dramatization of the communication what wouldnt you mind saying to your mothercome on give and what wouldnt you mind your mother saying to you of course the first answer you get in this case is the tipoff it is anything everything anywhere and then theyll come up with qualifications well if we rule out pain then i wouldnt mind communicating with bang and bang and bang and youd say just moment we havent ruled out pain well thennothing i wouldnt communicate with anything it is interesting in spotting spots in space that this person is very definable you can test him and find this case out immediately you simply say all right lets spot spot in the space of this room and the fellow will say well its there you say now put your finger on it and he will say oh i couldnt do that well go ahead put your finger on it and he will probably say wellwhy and you get into that he will not spot single spot in space when he does that he also qualifies everything he gives everything conditions and in addition to all that its anything and everything when you run up against this case then he cannot run this process very fast or very easily things your body wouldnt mind communicating with and things you wouldnt mind your bodys communicating with because he is in this anything everything class the thing to run then is obviously just what kind of universe he is stuck in and to begin splitting it up with an axe what wouldnt you mind your mother saying theyll hate this process theyll practically if you insist on it long enough get down and chew the rug give some things you wouldnt mind saying to your mother its just horrible the thought of having to go through all that communication but this they cant dodge so we can grade the process we can say this anything and everything process wouldnt be the optimum case and quite possibly wouldnt run at all things you wouldnt mind soandso communicating with your body communicating with or anything else that process is too subjective they cant grasp it enough they cant play the game so you make them sit there and you go on down for this other process how do you find out whose universe hes in just ask him who he most resembles in his family there are two things which will create change one of them is postulates and the other is communication live communication postulates will always create change of one kind or another now the point is how ably can your preclear communicate if he cant communicate very ably then you are going to have to make him dramatize communication mechanical two way communication is one method of dramatizing communicationyou have the preclear refusing mass and at the same time hes communicating this will persuade him to communicate but there is another way of doing this which is what i used on this preclear successfully i actually changed his skin tone and did something to the universes and there was some change on his psychometry as result thereof i went further and did him dirty trick i gave him the same process to run but thoroughly flat on all members of his family and that process was give some things you wouldnt mind saying to you give some things you wouldnt mind saying to now actually it isnt that the sense of the thing he is saying or has said has anything to do with it but with this process your preclear is going to do something peculiar he is going to pick the bank clean any time somebody is supergeneralizing on everythings and nothings you can absolutely count on the fact that he is not capable of creating energy he will be able to create some ideas but this will be rather slow and hes lazy so he will take actual phrases and things that occur to him when his mother really said somethinganything and things he would say to his mother with this particular process we picked his bank clean of things he would say to his mother in about three minutes and he went into horrible comm lag finally he said well actually i never say anything to her i never did say very much to her just as result of that processing and other two hours out of the five i used on that process he had markedly changed his consideration but if you think he had improved you are mistaken he had gone downhill and the reason he had gone downhill is that he had given it all up he had really got into everything and nothing now he was really willing to let his body communicate with cannon balls he was willing to let his body communicate with anything destructive he was not yet covertly hostile to the body he just didnt mind communicating what changed this was separating the two universes the interesting thing about any of these cases is that person who qualifies all statements who can never be specific would apparently suffer intense pain if he were to say oatmeal when you asked him to give something you wouldnt mind eating and he never seems to grasp the fact that the auditor wants him to say oatmeal you can just keep on telling him that this is what you want him to say i have actually made this test too by the way not that it was as good auditor but as good research man i have sat and i have said to preclear now i want you to name specific kind of food that you wouldnt mind eating one is all i want you to name and one is all i will allow you to name now what kind of food wouldnt you mind eating any kind of food now if you get that kind of conversational manifestation it is fellow who disperses away from every spot he tries to look at youve got the case pegged postulatewise and mechanically he cant locate single spot you would say where are you from and he would say im from the new england part of the country if you ask somebody who can spot spot where are you from he is likely to come back with something like this im from bramblebury vermont were you ever there he would suspect you had probably been there you know anybody could locate that place precision spotting but anything and everything is an imprecise spotting its buttered all over the universe and it is peculiar to the mystic and let assure you that it is very unusual to find process short of spotting spots in space which relieves this conditionbut that process is figure out the universe he is in make him say something to that universe by asking him things you wouldnt mind saying to your mother or father or whoever it is he will hate you like poison before you are through halfway through the process he will just as soon cut your throat as look at you you are making him communicate and this will break up im glad weve had good look at this case im glad we have some inkling of this condition but you are going to run into it its the one that makes an auditor blow his brains out most often you give the preclear an auditing command you know this command works then thiseverything anything nothing now let be very specific to you this is the thing that drives an auditor away from using good processes he strikes one of these high generality unable on high semanticsensitivity cases and uses process and the auditing command does not communicate at all he should be sure that the case is incapable of doing that process but instead of that he will feel that the auditing command must be bad or the process must be weak it is simply that the process is above the individuals ability to handle now it becomes study of how far south can human beings go and how far south can we reach and actually audit them now you will understand that twoway communication simply makes the preclear say something to you and you say something to him and he says something to you we could come up above that little bit and we could make him tell us things he would say to people and things people would say to him and it becomes wow of process at that level because you pick the universe and you blow him out of that universe this universe he is in is probably an everythingnothing consideration and you unburden thatand he comes on up this is an indirect version of twoway communication and it hits straight at universe processing there is solution to that case l ron hubbard washington d cissue 14 1955 ca midseptember the magazine of dianetics and scientology from washington dc start that practice l ron hubbard heres new successful way to start practice all over the world auditors are succeeding however in some areas we understand there are auditors who cant seem to get going in one particular area we have heard that some auditors were working at regular jobs what waste in world without assistance real honest assistance from anyone but dianeticists and scientologists the waste of ability in these lines is practically criminal theres lack of willingness on the part of these auditors its finance they cant seem to get paying preclears and to keep on eating they go to work well weve got the solution to that weve been running pilot project right here in washington and although we havent gotten it all the way through the auditor we assigned this project to has now begun to look for an assistant and he has turned over pc to the guidance center i have been alert to this problem of starting practice for long time and i knew that it was crucial in many quarters thus when i got this idea i thought that we had better make good test of it and see what happened and if it worked out then we had our nopractice auditor right into the swing of it we started this month ago the auditor selected had real luck and intensives for about two weeks and then the dam broke here in essence is the project on threetimeaweek basis place in the personal column of the local paperin city of some sizethe following advertisement personal relations i will talk to anyone for you about anything call gr 58906 between 4 and 6 pm reverend charles gringle church of scientology 1899 nevada st putting in the auditors home phone getting an answering service also if you want and his own name we are now ready to go the ad should run tuesday thursday and sunday at least or seven week if you can afford it weve already varied the wording around to test the best and the above is the one that pulled calls you should expect lull for few days people will read it and do nothing theyll think its code but when it appears over and over they will see that its really service and theyll come out of their comm lag now heres the trick dont charge for their service that isnt where you make it you do talk to anyone about anything for the caller you go out and take trouble with his troubles you help him patch things up with his boss or landlady or wife or the government and you dont charge him anything and you dont straighttalk at him about auditingyou have to hand however literature about scientology and you have of course your pro card which gives your ministers rating and this should read this professional card the rev charles gringle hca consulting scientologist gr 58906 452 fro st and you have another card church of scientology the reverend charles gringle pastor meeting every sunday morning at 1899 nevada street at 10 am repair the ravages of the week with scientology services and you hold that church meeting even if you seem to be too busy helping people to spare that hour sunday morning you run the service only until 11 one hours basic group auditing the simplest session in the group auditors handbook session ialways that you vary it and theyll leave after five or six sessions stay with it and the congregation will stay with you now you will discover that most of the calls you get are from people in trouble which is best solved by auditing one or the other of the people concerned will be found to need it badly you give them auditing on an hourly basis you charge 1000 per hour and carry none of it on the cuff take it cash in advance guarantee nothing make sure you stress its spiritual slant and value steer clear of promising cures and dont rush them into auditing theyll beg for it soon enough actually do this to be of service to man try to give it away youll find you cant dont use this just because its preclear getter its lot more than that it will put you in financial condition and get your church going now if several auditors in an area do this there are ways and means of settling rows amongst them given three local papers and three auditors doing this agree amongst yourselves who should have which paper and run one auditor to the paper if you are too many for this then run it all through one switchboard or phone and take watches allot the house calls pool the auditing and cash resulting or do it one group per paper keep that church of scientology in the ads so theres always trademark on the stunt and it cant be pushed into by some untrained quack psychologist or commie psychiatrist actually run that church all right youll learn fast when you start it you need this to begin your ordination must be in good order with an hca you can get that from the founding church its cost is now 1800 you had better have one from the founding church or the church of american science or the church of scientology make sure you have church charter write in to the founding church at 1845 r street nw and make your application if you want well send you literature we have handout piece at the printers into which you stamp your name and address and which advertises nothing else but you when youve got these run your ad and begin dont run your ad unless youve got the above straight now the press will contact you the code of scientologist on the subject of the press is explicit interviewsbut sooner or later make sure you do all you can to get yourself or your group tv spot or radio spot to talk about the calls for help you get and keep it going steadily press is via radio and tv are straight communication relatively speaking so whatever you do dont particularly now fall away from that code of scientologist and always act within the area of ability major 1 the scientologista manual on the dissemination of material which you can get from the hasi for 100 now by the time you have all this started ill have something for you in the way of fast assists if what youve got isnt fast enough for you in other words wherever we can lets get this show on the road we dont care how many churches of scientology there are in town so long as theres leading church so long as theyre actually churches we dont care how many ministers we have so long as theyre good auditors and good people willing to run churches and help their fellows the cost of starting all this is not high if youre working keep on working for little until you get practice started put your interview hours in the right place for you and work harder by putting yourself in two slots at once if youre not working and broke get job doing anything finance your project and then cut loose from the job when you are rolling well here goes main allout push across the world we want 5000 auditors and 5000 churches by 1958 theres not minister anywhere around that measures up to what the public thinks he should be able to doexcept scientologist theres remedy for case like busyness theres remedy for an attack on an outfit like fullscale offense toward theta goals okaypab 61 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard

dianetics and scientology yet we do if this is so then why and how the world does not know that there is any hope for the mind the spirit the intelligence level weariness and disability if you talk to group all about the mechanics of the spirit and fail to talk to them about there is some hope for it youve overshot and right there you have entered the public case too high its data level does not include something can be done about it the careless driver the faithless wife the negligent employee are all severe problems you could confront an individual beset by such problems and talk for half an hour about engrams and have him walk away without asking for help why because his entrance level is something can be done about it youll have to sell him on that before you can sell him anything else does it take selling it surely does the world has been promised and promised and promised for centuries with flop every time today the magazines of the cheaper variety are full of psychiatric articles about the miracles of new drugs even legislation states that psychiatry cures 75 percent of its cases an outright lie it knows that as soon as you promise cures youre lying even the busy business bureaus state that the public should suspect anyone who promises cure for anythingby which we believe it includes psychiatry so your glowing statements that you can take care of it entirely are received by the beset person not at all hes heard it before hes spent his money on patent medicine and medicos and quack psychologists or he knows somebody who has and he knows it wont work that there is hope how do we solve this impasse we dont overpromise our beset person we tell him that we have known such things to be helped by scientology that if we were persuaded we might take crack at it that the thing isnt entirely hopeless since scientology brand new science has been handling things that couldnt be handled in the past and we go on in this vein sort of twoway comm until we bring his tone up to where he thinks maybe there is something that can be done about it if he is very lucky and if we fortunately will make an effort show him the code of scientologist but talk to him not about what you can do or how you can do it but that there is some hope in the matter these days another point is to declassify scientology as medicine psychology psychoanalysis or psychiatry classification with these will doom your point your beset person or the group you are addressing possesses experience along these lines punch this up everywhere scientology is the only anglosaxondeveloped science of the mind and spirit medicine is latin in origin psychology is german prof wundt 1862 psychoanalysis isaustrian freud 1894 psychiatry is russian pavlov and others in the 1890s scientology is an anglosaxon exact science of the mind and spirit another point is the goal of scientology ability now in talking to group steer off from parascientology lay off the whole track stuff huh lay off the fantastic and if you have some chap around who insists on telling people about these things just note him down he isnt working for us fellers the quickest way to lose beset person or group is to load him down with phenomena talk instead about the fact that something can be done talk about the fact that there is spiritual side to man talk about the fact that scientology solves social problems when they are very initiate and its all in good fun and theyve also got their hpa or hca do what you like with the whole track or use it in private sessions dont hand it out to the public raw its too strong to establish twoway communication as you must do if you are going to communicate at all you have to talk within the understanding of your audience remember that understanding is the peak of arc and arc includes communication communication brings about understanding so communicate lot but some understanding must exist to bring about communication so dont tell the ladies aid society about your whole track space opera and expect them to begin cheering your speech if their mouths open at all it will be either to say huh or to snore and they wont come back again this is so much fact that i want you to write and tell who and where anytime you hear somebody spout off about whole track to new audiences or to strangers for by this we find the boys who arent in our camp our world today before were well into it believes that you live one life and get buried and thats that that you dont go to heaven that mechanical gimmicks work better than men that religion was pie in the sky and nobody got to eat it that science may or may not be beneficial that you cant really do anything about it anyway thats pretty dim and inaccurate view but thats the view just the same when raising the tone of the pc do it gently by small gradients the rises can get spectacular but not if you try it with rocket ships and when you do it youll do it by raising his understanding but if you fail it was because you jumped above his understanding and so you became unreal now the first step in auditing is not process as such its find preclear and the next step is establish the existence of an auditor thats why you dont do quite so well with mama you havent established the existence of an auditor to find preclear you have to engage what little understanding you are confronting and then raise it asking preclear to decide to have processing is silly you wouldnt ask him to run part c of sop 8c first would you you tell him within his framework of understanding that auditing is necessary to accomplish his goal and when to report you dont ask an audience to decide to like dianetics or scientology you tell them to like it to trust it to learn to hope again with it you arent scientist and you dont have to be wishywashy and indefinite about what you say be simple be decisive be theta to find pc you have only to establish the fact that there is hope in auditing and the existence of the auditor you dont have to struggle to tell people what scientology is what it is all about scientology applied the exact methods of science to the problem of the human mind and spirit and won it means the study of knowingness its immediate result in application is the bettering of ability in individuals and groups it is practical religion for all denominations and doesnt require faith in anybody until they have experienced something to have faith about it helps people who want to be helped and if they dont want to be helped it doesnt insist on helpingthem it can be used to train and control people its goal is freedom it has more validated cases in its files than any other practice it is not an authoritarian science and is of and for the people it belongs to the little man and woman not to huge interests by using scientology you can talk better to people and understand people better and get things done or keep things from getting done scientology caps about ten thousand years of study that began in asia and wound up with quarter of century of work in the western hemisphere its practitioners are ministers these are trained for years in school and out these ministers abide by code that couldnt be applied to the healing sciences at all by all reason of its clauses if people want to know lot about scientology theyll have to start from scratch like you did you do things you dont just talk about them when and if somebody starts running you and scientology down get amused get superior dont close terminals scientology is like good roads and good weather everybody is for those somebody trying to run it down would be for bad roads and bad weather and you appeal to that few who like things done right and running right and so you become amused at opposition you dont demonstrate scientology on somebody before an audience just to prove it works you handle this problem by insisting if you process at all upon processing the entire group and you use three points in the body three points in the room find three points in the body until somebody pops out then you smile and hand them your card and wonder who is running at epsom downs next week talking or processing you are in poised control of the subject and your person or audience i wouldnt credit it if i were on saturn and somebody told you had to sell science which gives the priceless gift of freedom to everyone that such stupid planet could exist but it does and you are on it good selling ronpab 62 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in

1955 psychiatrists dont be terribly surprised if in the next year or two the psychiatrists start pushing auditors around with even greater antagonism and dont be caught flatfooted when they do you know auditor we have had fight on our hands and we have and will have fight on our hands the old book one black panther mechanism is all right in its place but it doesnt do here nearly all the backlash in society against dianetics and scientology has common sourcethe psychiatristpsychologistpsychoanalyst clique their patter doesnt vary behind the bulwark of authority these people when asked about you an auditor or about the subject or about usually say that it is hoax and that you or i are really just out of an institution for the insane wherever some auditor stupidly decides to cooperate with psychiatrists he has been gobbled up very quickly one cannot cooperate with them any more than he can do business with hitler you think maybe im just sawing out tune when i say this very few people believe the actual true history of our science in the past five years the amount of attack and antagonism to which it has been subjected but let it suffice that about two million have been spent to put dianetics and scientology out of the running because the people trying to do it are by and large pretty stupid and lowtoned the campaign has not succeeded but the amount of fast action necessary to combat that much money has been to say the least exhausting i could tell you lot more about this i could tell you about the strange finances of the bdr of dianotes of other squirrel publications i could tell you about three actual murders i could tell you about long strings of psychotics run in on the foundation and the association sent in to us by psychiatrists who then using lsd and paindrughypnosis spun them and told everyone dianetics and scientology drove people insane i could tell you about the strange politics and ambitions of psychiatry so well covered in the book psychopolitics and give you proper riddle as to why we small group the only anglosaxon development in the field of the mind and spirit have been subjected to so much attack and finance but i am not telling you stories or being dramatic i am inviting your cooperation in your own future security whether you believe this war exists or believe the psychiatric rumor that its all figment of my mind its best to be safe in this battle its best to be safe because it isnt our battle and it isnt our objective to ruin psychiatry or medicine we dont care about these our goals are to make more people more able to make rather inefficient society lot more fun in order to attain these goals we had better scan the river ahead for shoals and fit our craft so as to survive any and having done that lightheartedlycontinue on our way dianetics and scientology are not political they desire to overthrow government each auditor anywhere is expected to continue his longgiven allegiance dianetics and scientology exist to serve and assist any given officialdom in proper way we have in view empire of madmen all screaming for some dictator or banner we have our place in the world of things as they are and we can do an awful lot right in that place seeing that we know more about the mind the spirit and religion and even science than any other group in the world granting this then we should act to best fit our niches and so do our jobs about the only thing which upsets our forward course is the fact that psychiatry and medicine sit close to the advisers of state and these officials on matters of the mind turn to psychiatrists for their opinion and the psychiatrist there can be counted upon by his cult headquarters to give the right amount of sneer to the official about dianetics and scientology the public as whole love dianetics and scientology our wordofmouth praise is remarkable but in the official strata because the psychiatrist is the authority we are likely to be mud similarly the newspaper in wanting an opinion of us calls the local medical or psychiatric board and again gets this formulated sneer and defamation that the public responds to us and likes us is remarkable in the face of this authoritative calumny reversely the public utterly loathes psychiatry you waste time if you try to defame psychiatry to the public the public is already in spitting frame of mind on that subject coals to newcastle strictly psychiatry stands in the public mind for ineffectiveness lies and inhuman brutality the public is better informed on this than you suspect the public only avoids you an auditor when it believes you are psychiatrist or psychologist so there is teamup there never will be the busy business bureaus advised by psychiatry will always give dianetics and scientology bad report matter how hard you work to get them to give good report the answerignore them we are an organization for and of the people but dont fail to take the steps to secure yourself an immunity from attack auditor make sure all your papers are in good order make sure matter where you are in the world for the last attack upon us was in central africa that your ordination is in good order make sure that you are running good and orderly congregation every sunday morning make sure your church is registered properly make sure your literature says you make the able more able and that insanity and illness are more your problem than they would be the problem of any minister stay out of that slough of insanity and severe illness for you dont belong there and never will practically i dont know any auditor who ever came out unscathed entirely when he attempted to work with the severely ill or the insane the amount of enturbulence caused by contact with such is fantastic now not to scare you but to inform you psychiatry has armed itself with several new drugs one of these lsd has the total goal of driving persons insane for 15 to 25 hours just long enough to convince people that your auditing spun the preclear when you see process solve case and then the case spins dont even bother to look for the needle mark on the pc the apa spent their whole may convention in atlantic city drooling over the effectiveness of this lsd which has never made anyone well and is well known to have the total purpose of producing insanity grim fantastic ask the few auditors whove had this done to the pc for the pc or his family often has psychiatrist looking in unknown to the auditor and it has happened wild its lot wilder when its happening to you as an auditor the answer dont process people with psychotic histories thats simple enough now if it does happen to you dont just abandon the case give the case few exercises and observe the recurrence of the weird spin observe this carefully and then bluntly inform the family or the authorities if you are questioned or called in that you as pastor of the congregation to which this person belongs have vested interest in the life and health of this person and that you believe that undue influence was used and that specifically you gave exercises to and observed the person in question to determine whether or not that person had been given the insanity drug lsdso that you could report it to the proper authorities and dont testify otherwise sounds wild well always do it if involved in such thing youll find the family physician or psychiatrist was called in midway in processing which consists remember entirely of making able people more able youll find there is vested interest somewhere in the insanity of this person and so testify that you suspect it we will have to hand lots of literature on lsd in fact well have the apa convention reports on it for you if this happens to you you minister are the only policeman who would suspect it if then psychiatry plants one on you look it over report the sudden occurrence of insanity promptly testify your suspicion of lsd produce the literature on it and get the sheriff looking around for that medico or psychiatrist as fast as possible but dont look for trouble in the first place leave insane people alone i know we can do things for them we can also shed light on how to solve the national debt too dont ever promise people you will cure them if they want to know if scientology will help their arthritis tell them it often has been known to do so but that that isnt an auditors goal if person becomes more able hell usually feel well but dont advertise that you cure things if you have to advertise ill give you some tips that work they dont include curing ills and insanity you as the most educated people on earth on the subject of the human spirit and man certainly deserve high role in the field of religion we can reform all of religion and make it vastly better why clash with healing quacks scientology is for the people and of the people it belongs to them they are receiving it they like it bear with our troubles with the dull official and authority and go out and make happier world l ron hubbard5510c03 4lacc1 the fundamentals of scientology the rudiments of auditing part one while book one has place close to the top in scientology the most fundamental fundamental was invented later it appears on page 23 of the ability issue called the hca manual the rudiments 1 awareness of the auditor that an auditing room is present and that session is in progress 2 two way comm on casual basis 3 delivery of the question 4 the comm lag 5 the acknowledgment 6 duplication of the exact question by the auditor in order to make any auditing work these fundamentals must be observed if the session is not precisely conducted the processes can fail to work this even explains why one might not have practice if the public couldnt find the auditor there would be practice this also explains one difficulty in auditing ones parents you need awareness of an auditor not child to start the session the pc must first find out hes pc and he must find the auditor in the auditing situation students must learn to assume the beingness of auditors and pcs not students if you exist as auditor there will be pcs this depends upon an ability to be the relationship between auditor and pc is not so much one of altitude as one of arc you must keep the r in when you are auditing an auditor for instance it doesnt inspire confidence to have to stop and look up the process theres process that makes pc into pc what are you doing run until he cognites hes being audited pc goes out of comm with an auditor before he observes that theres something wrong with the session like code break an auditors code break only occurs when the pc thinks the auditor has bad intentions and where the auditor does not repair the out comm with little two way comm the auditor may if the out arc is severe have to use another process on lower gradient until arc is restored gradient scale in auditing need not take long time for each type of processing for instance to get the pc to remedy havingness need not take 5 hours if you stay in two way comm and see what is really happening when the pc throws away mockups so as to really get rid of them this could take only 6 to 8 minutes if youve actually got an auditor and pc you must continually be aware of these rudiments since the pc can stop being pc at any time then two way comm gives out whenever two way comm gives out the session stops as far as the pc is concerned what starts this is too little two way comm and too little acknowledgment in the first place the pc will get stuck on the time track at the point where he has not been acknowledged and the session at that point is in fact over its all now in the past for the pc when he gets restuck later on in session hell blow or threaten to sometimes this can be handled merely by the auditors starting all over with the session thus subtly calling the pcs attention to the fact that hes in session pc may blow 28 minutes after failure to ack the auditor must learn to differentiate between pcs dropped willingness and an increased comm lag where willingness is not there auditing can occur the only thing there in thefirst place is willingness to play the game nations topple if they forget this fact willingness to work if taxed too heavily can become willingness to succumb whip extracts the last atoms of willingness but this can easily be turned around the only thing that any nation can tax that any group can exist on is the willingness to play the game to do to survive to continue if you decrease pcs willingness to play the game of auditing you can hardly expect to increase his willingness to play the game of life he must always audit better than he can live or hell never live better than he can be audited in session he should observably be getting brighter and more alert pcs always sag bit when session is over so dont be disappointed when life seems harder than the session helpful hints you must duplicate the question time and time again without killing the pcs willingness to answer it this can be done by adding some dunnage but dont vary the question the dunnage consists of casual twoway communication before and after the question twoway comm is light airy it has life in it and can be terribly casual and fantastically therapeutic to remedy havingness is to remedy the need to have regret is running the time track backwards5510c03 4lacc2 the fundamentals of scientology the rudiments of auditing part 2 here are the reasons why the human mind has not been solved 1 i dont know 2 idea to know about something is necessary to notknow it first this was an incomprehensibility to philosophers of all ages to understand the source of ideas you had to understand idea one has to be able to notknow something in order to know something about it dialectical materialism is dramatization of idea idea is workable concept but as long as the dialectical materialists are only dramatizing it and dont know it it is unworkable dialectical materialism says that all new ideas are the result of two old forces hence idea can be really new so there is possibility of getting new idea if someone dramatizes something as with the dialectical materialists it must have existed earlier as postulate that went solid things begin with consideration and end with solidity eg dramatization or solid reality so an idea is senior to all matter and conditions above that is the thetan in his native state if thetan wishes to return to his native state he often bungles it by assuming that he is in native state when he is actually in very bad shape this leads to the idiocy that everything that is true of thetans native state is what continues to be dramatized clear down to the bottom of the barrel and that every aberration is reflection of native state and the first and second postulate theory axioms 36 and 37 native state is having idea the thetan knows all about all he has ideas because he has all the ideas there are now he says that he will have an idea here we get axiom 36 the first postulate gives the second postulate power so the thetan in native state knows all he then makes first postulate that he has idea from here as per axiom 36 he can make the second postulate that he can have an idea this is an harmonic on native state but it is alterised so it persists and we get time the force of having an idea is the statement that he didnt have an idea before an idea is barrier stop on the track even manic idea or win can be stop so we get 0 native state the thetan knows all but has specific idea 1 first postulate idea i dont know 2 second postulate specific idea this is an harmonic on native state i know something 3 third postulate forget 4 fourth postulate remember for the first time in the history of mankind it has become safe for man to know something it was not safe before because youd stick to it because every mystery could then pull you into it the more you knew about it the more you were enveloped by it this gives the manifestations of thetans blackness dropped havingness illness etc things known on second postulate basis are solid and persist studying anything will produce this phenomenon scientology has been safe subject because it has progressed toward simplicity and has never pretended to contain all knowledge theres limited amount of knowingness and unknowingness available what gets scarce is unknowingness we let unknow go on an automatic basis we dont take responsibility for it so it gets pulled in on an unknowing basis youd never get into trouble in processing if you kept on supplying lots of noidea instead of using old noideas when you keep on using old noideas to get new ideas eventually the new ideas jam into the existing noideas which have become so precious that we interiorize into them here weve ignored the first postulate which provided the power forthe second postulate one gets stuck in dramatizing noidea and loses the volitional ability to postulate an idea into existence people who get stuck in know about are in the second postulate if they exteriorize its into the blackness of the third postulate which is the harmonic of the first notising the knowingness thus ive forgotten it the fourth postulate is remember an alterisness of notisness this is getting to be very persistent stuff from this sequence we get most solidities and spaces except for directly postulated solids and spaces perhaps the fifth postulate would be occlude all you need to get space is lookingness which is dramatization of knowing in lookingness space is on an automaticity thats why space continues to exist this automatic space because its automatic tends to fold up on people producing condensed spaces and figurefigure at lower levels the above was discovered by the fact of the relative effectiveness of running something you wouldnt mind forgetting compared with the bogginess of something you wouldnt mind remembering notknowingness evidently is the only solution to prevent interiorization into bodies of knowledge or solid objects per axiom 36 if you take out the first postulate you can knock out the second one for instance you realize that over there theres bus running it doesnt affect you does it until you knew there was bus over there and then you probably got picture of it or something get the trick probably countertrick would be saying i dont know whats standing right here inventing something to stand here then remembering you said you didnt know what was there so theres automatic i dont know before the knowingness running an i dont know process for two hours gives more gain than 50 hours of i know the unworkability of remember processes shows that psychoanalysis never gave stable gains it gives solid ridges if you keep remembering you can asis it by having him recall all the times he remembered or better still use forgetting to dissolve the ridge take any troublesome engram ask the pc what he doesnt know about it and it will blow in minutes it upsets the pc to have him make perfect duplicate but this way only causes fogginess if you dont acknowledge well and stay in two way comm this also solves the case with the stuck picture its also safe to use what dont you know about it on chronic somatics notknowingness is not the goal of humanity or scientology its just the barrier that has to be crossed5510c08 lpls1 the goals of dianetics and scientology hubbard concluded that the problem of the mind was soluble in 1938 at this time the ussr offered him 100000 and lab outside of moscow for his manuscripts later the russians stole the manuscript for dmsmh structure can only modify the mind but the mind monitors structure sometimes one decides to die then changes his mind without unmaking the first decision this can produce chronic somatics if the persons decision to die gets restimulated he wont be conscious of the first decision at this point he thinks he wants to live but has to do some irrational thing like be professional invalid succumb postulate the basic datum is the q and of survivedestroy neither fully decided when one gets audited and decides to survive his iq can go up and he can become happy and able its mathematically impossible that accidents could account for evolution darwinian theory suggests that there is reincarnation although it doesnt state

_____________________________________________________________________ 14 october 1955 playing the game the highest activity is playing game when one is high toned he knows that it is game as he falls away down the tone scale he becomes less and less aware of the game and thereby less and less the greatest ability of thought is differentiation so long as one can differentiate one is sane its opposite is identification when one begins to identify one has closed terminals too closely and believes one terminal is another terminal the failure to differentiate between two terminals in an electric motor would bring about moting in pc it brings about power or ability to handle power the legal definition of sanity is the ability to tell right from wrong and that is very sooth statement therefore the highest ability in playing game would be the ability to know the rightness and wrongness rules of that particular game as all rightness and wrongness are considerations and as the game itself is consideration the playing of the game requires high ability to differentiate particularly it requires an ability to know the rules and the rightrules and the wrongrules when an individual is prone to identify he is longer able to differentiate the rightrules and the wrongrules and the rightrules become wrong and the wrongrules become right and we have criminal criminal cannot play the game of society he plays then the game called cops and robbers person who strongly identifies is not necessarily criminal but he certainly is having trouble playing the game of society instead of playing that game he gets tired gets sick he has these things happen because he doesnt want to play the social game he has game of sorts in hypochondria now if you had culture which was running nogame game for anybody culture which itself had game for everybody to play culture which had in its government fixation on keeping anyone from playing the game they wanted to play we would have as its manifestation all manner of curious ills such as those described in various ideologies like capitalism or communism the entire government game would be stop playing your game the degree of sanity in government would be the degree it permitted strong and active participation in the game of government in the game of playing your gamebut if people who cant play the game cant differentiate similarly sane person could find himself very confused to be part of game which wasnt differentiating and where the rightness and wrongness rules were unclearly defined thus government without exact and accurate codes and jurisprudence would discover in its citizens an inability to play the game matter how sane they were thus the game can be crazy and its players sane or the players can be crazy and the game sane either condition would affect the other when we get crazy players and crazy game the end product of either of the two imbalances above we would get anything except game we would get chaos into this chaos then could be injected new game and on this alignment we would be able to have people who could play game playing game that could be played as useful example of this let us take people who cannot see anything wrong with slanderous materials on the subject of scientology these people perhaps also see nothing wrong with scientology they read the aberree or the daily worker with equal facility with ability and see difference we have here people who see difference they dont differentiate they dont differentiate because they see game they see game because they cant play game or habituated to social structure which had rules or rightness or wrongness they have lost like so many students of various universities their criteria by axiom 36 lie is second postulate statement or condition designed to mask primary postulate which is permitted to remain basic rule is that to asis second postulate it is necessary to asis only the first postulate preceding it for upon that one depends the strength of the second to run out all games one would only have to find where there are old games spotting these one after the other he would then hit the various cognitions that game was in progress for the game was always preceded by game and all games are tailored by considerations various effects from games are to become the only one on games to become all apathetic about games to have the rules of the games in reverse so as to counter games the remedy of having game or not knowing game is in progress would be to asis the first condition and the current condition by simply spotting here and there absences of games then make one l ron hubbardpab 64 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 163 holland park avenue london w11 _____________________________________________________________________ 28 october 1955 first postulate weve got ourselves little piece of data here that you might be interested in it will make this first postulate little clearer to you the native state of thetan would be the first real postulate wouldnt it there is an oddity that occurs he continues to insist on this native state clear down to the bottom of the scale lets take look at this actually in his native state he knows everything without looking or anything but he doesnt know any particulars of data these are all invented so what you would really call this would be potentiality or panknowingness now as we go on down the scale he insists upon knowingness all the way downscale only he puts it into the form of data and he gets his knowingness inverted so that all he knows is data and he loses his capability of knowing another thing that occurs as he goes downscale from top to bottom he is not looking at anything and we discover that eventually he begins to insist upon this condition he starts wearing glasses not seeing seeing blackness and so forth all he is doing is insisting that he is not looking at anything we take another one of these things in his native state he didnt have any space and so he goes all the way down the tone scale clear to the bottom insisting on space only how does he make space finally he begins to pull in all the energy upon himself and crowds himself in real tight and he is making space by getting everything jammed together but he is still insisting on the native state there are lot of these native states that you can look over and you will see that you get whole string of first postulates out of them here they are native states and they actually are first postulates this is peculiar to note that thetans insist to each other that they be in their native states and the way they do this is to say youre stupid you dont know about it you dont know any data you ought to be in jail you should have space at all you shouldnt be moving cops are always objecting to people for moving you know and they insist one way or the other that he doesnt have anything they say you cant have anything in other words the whole society will dramatize this native state to some degree but on what horrible harmonic so thetan after while begins to believe that all these native state postulates are bad therefore he must avoid them so therefore he gets entangled and trappedwe look this over in processing and we then move from the locational process up through twoway communication up into the subjective processes the subjective processes therefore should all be first postulate processes and the lowest of them would be something you wouldnt mind forgetting you wouldnt ever run something you wouldnt mind remembering all right there are two other processes that go along in this subjective band which are intensely interesting they are quite workable now you understand that you do union station or objects on locational processing on what dont you know about that object and what doesnt that object know about you but now we have other places we can go and one of the places we go is of course up into the subjective process band which lies above twoway communication some of the subjective processes which are the most interesting are find some space tell some things you are not looking at tell some things that are not looking at you you see at once that these are native state situations so these are very very good subjective processes they are run on straight wire basis so you see what neat group that makes but the ones that run fastest are these first postulate processes what arent you looking at what isnt looking at you locate some nospace what dont you have to locate something you wouldnt mind forgetting all these are intensely workable we would move up from there into new oddity and that would be 8c did you ever hear of 8c before do you know why 8c works 8c works very interestingly it is totally on tolerance of command and the continuous postulation of feeling or seeing something 8c as process assumes the native state in thetan and then tells him to go to the second postulate here is thetan you are processing him you are evidently assuming that he is in native state because you are saying look at the wall so you assumed that he wasnt looking at the wall before you said look at the wall you are taking over the automaticity of the second postulate thats why it works the third part of 8c is just taking over more second postulates he says im not looking at anything now im going to look at something now i look at that thing now i see it we could probably dress up 8c little more workable just on this basis but i dont think its necessary at this time because it works just the way it sits but maybe you should understand it little better just on the basis that we are assuming all during 8c not that the guy is crazy but that he is in native state and that his attention has to be directed to things so we take over all these automaticities and he comes upscale now lets apply this native state principle to opening procedure by duplication we are again telling him to look at one object and telling him to look at another object natively he was able to totally duplicate the object now he doesnt know anything about the object so we could run dont know in here again we could say see that book walk over to it pick it up and now we run higher first postulate on him what dont you know about it all right put it down in exactly the same place do you see that bottle walk over to it pick it up all right tell something you dont know about ityou could run this on this same basis on first postulate too and it would be an intensely workable process of course when we go up to remedy of havingness we are assuming he doesnt have anything and we are giving him something so we are taking over the automaticity of having something but we are again assuming that he is in native state the process assumes this and then makes him dramatize knowingly the second postulate have something he hasnt got anythingnow he has something as far as route i is concerned route i is far more native state than being in body and just drills on it all by itself of course would accomplish great deal but you could take route i and ask him what he didnt know about these various locations on the grand tour and these incidents all up the track would blow our assumption as auditors that the thetan is in native state and that we are then going to make him take over the automaticity of living by doing it himself is very valid one and is evidently the one that produces the greatest result at this time so here is just little change of mind in the way you look at processing we take the native state of thetan we figure out what is the thetans native state he is not in contact with space energy mass he doesnt have any dimension we take this as the first condition he can make postulate out of this condition and then he makes second postulate and the second postulate is lie you can assume that he is in native state and make him make the first postulate and you will have an intensely workable process we assume he knows all there is to know about people and then we say all right tell something you dont know about that person we are running the first postulate right away now if you assume thetan is bad off plowed in and is not even vaguely in his native state you will tend to run processes which will spin him in if you are running him from the attitude that he has to come upscale to feel wall this is bum deal the attitude you should run him from is heres this poor little thetan all stupid and were going to show him wall we will find out that understanding of him then proceeds at much higher rate you will get sooner or later very important thing here it is actually the auditor being there twoway communication and the assumption about the native state of the preclear that produces auditing when you particularize too solidly on process without paying attention to these three things you dont get any auditing done l ron hubbardpab 65 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 163

selfdeterminism is immediately and directly established in ratio to his handling of mest selfdeterminism goes down as person goes down the tone scale so what do you finally get you get person around 05 this persons selfdeterminism is out they are not selfdetermined they are determined by something elsenot by themselves furthermore they cant handle mest the i confuses the organism itself with the mest it cannot handle and selfdeterminism deteriorates it happens something like this the i gets to point where it obviously cant handle other mest so it cant handle itself either it cant handle space not only is it unable to put somebody else through space it cant put self through space and so on so here you have the tug and pull below 20 on the tone scale here is an individual riding at 15 and here is another individual riding at 05 the 15 is trying to make the 05 into the 15s mest here is an individual confusing an organism with mest here is the 15 trying to take this other person and own him as mest if you have also 11 here the 15 is trying to make the 11 into his mest and the 11 is fighting back to the extent of trying to nullify the 15 to the point where the 15 is 05and then the 05 becomes the 11s mest here is the leading order of the tone scale below 20 nullification is worked on the 15 so that the 15 can be owned by the person occupying the lower band on the tone scale the 15 will take 30 and try to move him on down to 05 so that the 15 can own him the organism below 20 is more mest than theta actually and entheta being confused and chaotic like mest behaves to large degree like mest here is your battle of the strong and the weak in other words the battle of the 15s and the 05sthe only way you can possibly get along is up in the bracket of arc because these other things dont win nobody ever succeeded in owning another organism it cant be done you can own horsewith arc you can be nice to the horse and the horse understands you and you just get along fine the horse is very glad that you are riding him and everything is happyand that horse stays in good shape but lets own the horse okay you brute you beast you will do exactly what i say before long you have 05 horse and that 05 horse will develop spavins spasms and everything else the only way 30s can operate is on data and exchange of ideas and reaching an agreement with relationship to that data _____________________ this is an added observation which i now realize i have been adding for long time 2 and 2 make four unless you insist on having spots before your eyes instead of stripes when they make either 22 or 22anyway have you ever seen person so called below 20 on the tone scale who ever accepted the fact that scientology was real i have seen them say why sure its wonderful but i have also had the privilege of processing some of these characters and so far i have yet to see one who had any reality on it just an observation but it continues to explain so much they will sell it or use somebody elses idea of its reality to make for their own stack below 20 barn is too much mest to own and they have already started in on organisms but for themselves just you try to process one on an advanced technique and you will see what i mean and so as sweet thought for the day i give you all those tough cases please sir will you prescribe process for the processing of processing toward

_____________________________________________________________________ 25 november 1955 first second third and fourth postulates identification and differentiation are the two extremes of processes an auditor really ought to make this experiment just to show him the way things go he should sit preclear down and ask him what things are like things something curious occurshe plows right on in its the second postulate what thing is like what thing is the second postulate now we turn around and run him on what things are different from what things and he clears right up and gets as bright as dollar so if we ask somebody to look around at all those people and find people he is like we immediately find out why old dianetics straight wire had such terrific limitation it had this limitation simply because we were saying all right who had that manifestation oh you have twitch there well who had that it would only run for four or five questions before it would plow in so it was hitand run process the reason for this was we were running identification so if we were to take somebody out to railroad station and say all right now pick out some people around here that you are separate from he would get sharp and bright and he would feel wonderful lets just take shadow of that now get person there that you are the same as now get some things you have that are the same as the things you have the same the same the same and all of sudden this guy goes gug he doesnt like it so if we ask him what do you know about that person something else you know about that person something else you know about that person we dont have the full effect but we have some little echo of this identification effect very searching look at whether it is better to hit and runone person another persontells us immediately something that is quite interesting that if we found lot of things you know about that one chair for instance the process would be effective but it would be only about onetenth as effective as what do you know about that chair what do you know about that table what do you know about that lamp we find they fit on scale as follows first postulate not know second postulate knowso far we have been going with nothing but material objects or spaces now the third postulate is forget and the fourth postulate is remember forget and remember stand in relationship to each other as an abstract first postulate you might say forget and the second postulate is remember therefore remembering processes and knowing processes simply make the person able to handle second postulate therefore they are long however they dont run out very well if we wanted to run out knowingness we would run notknowingness in view of the fact that lot of people just know things that are horrible it would be to some advantage to run out some of this knowingness it is very false knowingness isnt it so we have the consideration added to each one of these postulates good bad survive succumb and that is added to notknow good or bad to notknow taking the second postulate we would have good or bad survive or succumb as know good or bad survive or succumb as the third postulate forget and good or bad survive or succumb to the fourth postulate remember now lets look at that in conditions of existence and we discover that an object or something must have presented itself about which the individual didnt know and hed have to decide that he didnt know about it before he would decide that he would have to know about it so he is notising his notknowingness by knowing in order to forget about it he has to notis his knowingness so he has to notis knowingness in order to forget to remember it he will have to have forgotten it therefore he notises forgettingness by this pattern and scale we have all the difficulties mind can get into this is all thetan can do really now we get the curiosity desire enforce inhibit scale we are familiar with that scale we call it the dei scale actually it has curiosity just above desire so we find one could be curious about desire enforce and inhibit notknowingness we have the consideration which is good or bad survive or succumb and now we have the volition the volition of person about this notknowingness is to be curious about it desire it enforce or inhibit itor just plain not know it take it as its asisness but if he decided not to notknow it it would disappear so in order to keep it there he decides to know something about it everything you get to know anything about becomes more solid because it is second postulate now this very tricky set of values is evidently closer to the truth than we have been before but it has to be worked experimentally now to discover how much of this is valid and how much isnt validi made test on one preclear who has black field and made him good and sick so we take the fourth postulate now get how solid things would become if you were using fourth postulate i had him look at pieces of blackness and instead of looking remember them it would have been easier for him to forget them instead of looking at themand it was we didnt carry the experiment any further we just carried this as far as forget and rememberinstead of look lets remember it made him good and sick it didnt run out his occlusion we can understand if we search little further in this what this blackness is then an individual decides to know what is in that blackness and immediately that he decides to know what is in the blackness he will get solidity to the blackness wont he its second postulate so you see how far this figurefigure carried us if we run something about that person that you would be willing to notknow and something you would be willing for that person to notknow about youwe will unravel the secrets out of people this way the people get better and we are running closer to the truth than we have been in the past i just want to repeat to you as i often have to do one of those primary principles that is liable to go astray this is the principle of mystery the principle of mystery is of course this the only way anybody gets stuck to anything is by mystery sandwich person cannot be connected to his body but he can have mystery between him and his body which will connect him now the oddity is that it is the desire to solve the mystery which does the connection so really the know to mystery scale on this day has become the notknow to mystery scale we have pushed our information up just that much further you have to understand this thing about the mystery sandwich its two pieces of bread one of which represents the thetan one of which represents the body and the two pieces of bread are pulled together by mystery they are kept together by volition to know the mystery and then people run the curiosity desire enforce inhibit scale on that mystery that keeps them interiorized and this is really the secret of interiorization the secret is secret q anda survive and succumb are simply consideration to being who cannot possibly succumb succumb is always second postulate but it is second postulate to an actuality to really asis thing you have to make perfect duplicate of it dont you the thing originally appeared but was not known so the second postulate came around and altered it into knowingness therefore in order to get the basicbasic on any chain of actual physical objects you would simply have to say what could i not know about it this is the cycle of alterisness and notisness of any perception the evolution of thinkingness 1 object seen not known asis possible2object known prevented asis by alteris 3 abstract forgotten notisness 4 abstract remembered an alteris of notis if you look carefully at number four you will find that fixation on remembering produced that tangle which is called mind now do you see how mind could be loused up now added to any of the four above are the following considerations good bad survive succumb volition curiosity desire enforce inhibit this is really not scale it is timeplot added to all this of course would simply be confidence and at any portion of that plot you could add this factor of confidence but confidence goes into conviction at any point you have these two things taking place you have confidence which then shifts off into conviction confidence becomes conviction so any one of these four conditions can become fixed and so unalterable but you tackle anything on this scale simply by running the first postulate right now waterloo station is quite stable just the way you are running it actually waterloo station on know or running enough remember would do this terrific thing it would make the person totally competent to handle that second postulate he would longer be upset about the second postulate he could handle it or not handle it as the case might be but he is liable to come upscale faster if you run what he would be willing to notknow about that personhubbard communications office 1 brunswick house 83 palace gardens terrace london w8 bay 5780 operational bulletin 8 13 december 1955 handling press if it is absolutely necessary to admit press or talk to press the only thing which really convinces them is result and i would refuse to go on with long line of speculation concerning press or about it if it begins to crowd such an operation as the washington operation too hard for material on scientology i would follow this procedure i would take them up to the big grey file case at 2315 15th street and say that it will do all the talking and that they can if they wish bring any expert in to look over these records i would then not go along any further along the line whatsoever but would simply tell them to look over these case histories which are the case histories of scientology in other words i would make the file case do the press talking we are getting along fairly well right now on our policy of communication with the press but this sooner or later may trip us up and i think such means of communication as simply insisting that the only thing that talks around there is this grey file case might possibly become press gimmick which would be appreciated and taken up permit them to bring in any experts to examine these files in other places than washington dc it would be very good idea to simply accumulate records of this kind and throw them into file case and instead of talking about scientology and what it does on various fronts to give people who have to have material about scientology the run of that file case one which has fifty or sixty cases in it will do more talking in the long run than anything else we are entering new era with scientology and we should be prepared to hand out data to authorized persons who want it but i do not think the data handed out should be speculative i have this afternoon granted an interview on myself as personality to the daily mail feature editor he may go away and write great deal about scientology instead of about and i decided to make this little test just to find out how it came out now we will see what he does write certainly he was corrected in an impression he had of which he had gained from the rumour line he had all mocked up as wildeyed crusader and he was quite astonished and friendly during the interview we talked mainly about hubbard as the writer but he did have an awful lot of questions about scientology brainwashing manual the brainwashing manual which came into our possession so mysteriously is being released not with any intent to unmock psychiatry but as necessary piece of information for auditors who are confronted with the problems of brainwashing some of these cases are now turning up and unless the basic philosophy of the brainwasher is understood they are more difficult to handle slp issue 6 or 7 will very undoubtedly handle brainwashing7 by the way is not yet released but 6 will do until it comes along therefore there is point in writing an additional manual to handle this as specific problem some of the mystery concerning the manuscript on brainwashing which came into our hands in phoenix was resolved when it was discovered that book called psychopolitics spelled with k is in the library of congress it is in german it was written by man named paul fadkeller and was published in berlin in 1947 although i may be misinformed and i definitely do not read german this book is probably the russian translationit is simply our intention to make the book available for 50 cents copy to people in dianetics and scientology so that they can be informed as to the actual character of brainwashing and the mechanics of it to that degree it is technical book there is intention of handing it around into official quarters since i am sure official quarters must know about it since the book is apparently on file at the library of congress and naturally if it is on file at the library of congress officialdom must know about it thus there is point in beating the drum concerning it if i am asked by press or persons in authority concerning our release of this which i may well be i will have to reassure them that there is political significance attached to it we couldnt be less interested but brainwashing happens to be facet of the human mind and it has been necessary to make available to our own people any and all texts which exist on the subject we probably should get hold of the book at the library of congress and translate it in full but we do not have the money or the time to do this just now thus don has been asked to mail copy of the manual as printed to our various professional members and to make other copies of it available through box 242 silver spring maryland for 50 cents copy this is certainly reasonable enough i dont think there is any point of any kind in placing it in official hands as i have said since even the u s army and air force must be fully cognizant of brainwashing since as i have noted copy of it is on file at the library of congress it could also be noted at the same time that there is general movement among psychiatry to correct their own profession and to do something to those psychiatrists in it who are hurting and killing people with electric shock and surgery and thus this is concern of ours i repeat our interest in this is professional not political brainwashing has become so much of subject that it is very well for anybody having to do with the field of the human mind to be able to understand the intentions behind it and how it is done this is the only work we have on the subject if there are any political repercussions to be expected by us i would consider that we are being very selfconscious since obviously if there were any political repercussions to be expected they would have come before this since as i say this book has evidently been in very wide circulation already and is on file at the library of congress so far as we know i think the general reaction of the public is that they couldnt care less ______________ out of letter from frank sullivan randomity found an interesting gimmick tell someone we have formed new club we call it the

london daily mail feature editor john hall took it upon himself on december 13 1955 to personally interview and write exactly what he found he published in the daily mail first run paper published in london edinburgh manchester and paris very long and friendly story which will probably do us more good in the british isles and france than anything which has happened for long time time magazine has written eight pages there have been about 80 columns in us magazines such as life liberty look and there has been untold press released on the subject of dianetics and scientology but aside from one young communist who spent about three minutes talking to on the stairs at elizabeth and fellow who wandered in from life he said and never wrote anything in angeles there has been press reporter near since before the publication of dianetics the modern science of mental health that feature editor john hall did take it upon himself to actually do an interview and that the results were favourable caused to make little investigation concerning how press has been operating before and on what it has been operating evidently the total activity of press has been to pick up slanted and hearsay information so i was interested to find out how this information came into being apparently it works this way to make some sort of face somebody who met at cocktail bar then pretends considerable knowingness on the subject of all of my life and activities and gives forth at considerable pace not handicapped in the least by the possession of data and this by and large whether done by scientologists or casual acquaintances has been the total sum of information which has been circulated about myself since the late 30s as even john sanborn can tell you i have been very chary about releasing any actual information about myself i had rather large collection of oldtime photographs which i thought we might put into ability and at the last moment made john put in something else i have not been anxious in other words to put up big show of myself thinking that scientology was enough for its own sake in this i have apparently made an error i look over possible available sources of unbiased information concerning my own past and discover that while it could be traced down on official records in libraries and other places and confirmed there is one who even knows enough about it to do that job of coordination thus it is necessary that i release some accurate biographical information to supplant some of this rumour and hodgepodge which has been spread around in the name of information there is plenty of authenticating and documenting material if one cares to look for it now i know that it is extremely bad taste to put out any data concerning oneself or to talk about oneself but if people see fit to talk about one and having nothing to talk about therefore lie about one and if this rebounds as widely as it has through presses books plays and motion pictures certainly one has some responsibility for putting out something like an accurate biographical narrative to say the least and so we are doing so at this time and then i can forget about it and go on doing something more important for sure however the tide has turned on the subject of press which doesnt mean however that we should give the technical materials of scientology to press the best way totalk to press is to sort of twoway comm process them and show them stacks of case histories and let the deeds speak brainwashing manual history in our studies of brainwashing it has been necessary to procure what information existed on the subject fortuitously in phoenix there came into our hands two manuscripts on the subject as well as i can recollect they were left there at the front desk with the request that they be mailed back to their owner we are not sure exactly from whom these came but we understand now that this is unimportant since the subject is broadly rather well known in book on psychopolitics it is to be found in the library of congress it is in german but we suppose it is the same manual as we needed this material for research we read it off onto tape compiling the two manuals and removing from them some of their very verbose nomenclature substituting for it more common english terms and we have had few copies of this struck off for use in our research it is necessary if one is confronted by case of brainwashing to understand the motives and general procedures of the people who did it i must say an inspection of this manual does not make for much respect for the motives of people who brainwash other people in the early pages of this manual there is letter from the person who purportedly gave these manuals to the organization charles stickley supposed to be professor at columbia university in new york city this letter included in the manuals as printed makes it definitely and adequately clear that these manuals were reprinted for study by research workers however in handing out copy of one of these manuals to one of our own people who had not heard of it he made several wrong estimates of the manual itself at first he thought it was piece of communist propaganda then he thought it was something the organization had composed then on further inspection he did not know what to think and it had to be pointed out to him very specifically that this was synthesis of russian instruction book on the subject of brainwashing and it had to be pointed out to him that it was reprinted for the benefit of people working to remedy and heal brainwashing it had to be pointed out to him additionally that there was cover letter in it which explained these things thus if you have one of these copies and it gets away from you which it might you may find it necessary to explain exactly what it is we certainly have the right to have in our possession materials covering something as intimately connected to mental research as brainwashing we have the right to know why and where and who furthermore this material is evidently well known to various governments and is not classified since the subject psychopolitics which is the technical name for brainwashing is to be found in the major libraries of the world in the original text of this book there was warning to psychopolitical operatives that they must stamp out dianetics christian science and practical psychology as these alone represented menace to the brainwashing programmes this reference in the text to dianetics which has been known to the russians since 1938 makes the matter very much our business quite aside from research yet if most of the vagaries and upsets from which we have been suffering have stemmed from desire on the part of some political group attempting to accomplish political coup and in the road of which we have been standing then we certainly have the right to know why we have been knocked around by press and governments to the degree that we have been hardly word uttered against dianetics and scientology has had any truth in it the prevalent official but not the public opinion regarding dianetics and scientology is that they are phony sciences tricked up to hoodwink people contrast this with the fact that in dianetics and scientology alone in all the world of mental healing lie the answers to increased intelligence and ability and not very incidentally in dianetics and scientology and in dianetics in particular we have the total antidote for the eradication of brainwashing in other words we could unbrainwash them with dianetics as fast as they are being brainwashed givenenough staff furthermore we can put troops and persons in condition where they cannot be brainwashed this we can do in scientology thus if brainwashing is being counted upon heavily to accomplish great deal inside and outside the nations under attack there would be only one organization which would be standing thoroughly in the road of that programme and if that programme inside country had advanced to point where officials could be influenced then you would discover of course this odd official opinion of dianetics and scientology that they are quack sciences we are not planning to use this reprinted manual for purposes of propaganda however to prevent any misunderstanding from occurring the highest police in england and america have both received copies and have been told that this is reprint manual and that we do not wish to cause them any extra labour in case another one of them falls into their hands actually however it is my belief that they have had the original which is to say the communist version of these manuals in their possession for years and have simply been unable to credit it or unable to do anything about it thus our reprinted version should come as shock to them it has been my experience with anglosaxon governments that where idea propaganda line attacks were concerned they couldnt care less they do not believe that propaganda is effective otherwise they would themselves engage in more propaganda activities the anglo saxon traditionally depends upon force in order to accomplish his ends this is one of the reasons why communism has made such vast progress across the face of the world it is an idea advancing against arms and the arms of course will never be able to stop an idea an idea will be necessary to stop the idea we may very unfortunately be those persons in possession of the idea that will stop the other idea certainly the way things are going if we dont use our ideas to stop the incoming ideas across the face of earth we are going to wind up one of these days in the middle of total communism living in totally brainwashed society the way i look at it washington congress my very best wishes to the congress and my hopes for highly successful time by all i have made several recent tapes on material of some interest and value which have been sent swiftly and rapidly across so that the latest material would be available at the congress i have not made however welcoming tape as i ordinarily would and take this opportunity to thank those people who came and hope that they go away feeling better and feeling happier about things there is doubt that the washington operation is on the steep upgrade and my principal communication in scientology is between myself and the washington operation where bill young julia lewis ken barrett don breeding have things pretty well in hand the silver ministers crosses are ready now and are supposed to be knockout the coauditors manual is ready the brainwashing pamphlet is being released to those who are interested in the subject and it should be with all very successful congress indeed i wish i were there newest processes i am tabling up all those processes which have been successful in starting low toned cases these have amounted to about 24 new processes in the last three or four months this table will be available in the near future with an analysis on it however i wish to call to your attention the singular success of waterloo station in handling lowordered cases not knowingness is time if person cannot notknow he becomes the slave of time one of the more interesting late developments is process called orrible fates you ask the preclear to tell you some orrible fates the theory of this is very simple and will probably become axiom 55 which will be to the effect that the cycle of action of the physical universe is create change destroy thus anyone trying to make things better and in very closeagreement with the physical universe in reversing this cycle will bring upon himself some regret we have wild example of this in the cycle of action imposed upon us by christianity in the good works the hounding and the death of christ this mechanism also handled in fac one gives us the oddity that we are trying to put create forward in time whereas destroy lies forward in time one then either masters the subject of time by running notknowingness processes or he puts into the future inventions of horrible fates for various persons and himself and this universe until he runs out the considerable regret which is accumulated every time he has envisioned good action naturally the final solution of this is the solution of agreement with the physical universe when one breaks this and it is longer disagreement or agreement he has really done something and the keynote of doing this thing is of course in notknowingness new auditing style i have made direct deliberate test not of process but of the auditing style itself as helpful agent the keynote of new auditing style is that any boiloff somatic anaten swing of attention or going out of session on the part of the preclear is occasioned by some sort of error or miscomprehension on the part of the auditor and the preclear i used general process not ordinarily very therapeutic but not destructive and starting with this process and preclear worked only in one direction to keep the arc of the preclear advancing continually throughout the session proceeding from the level of arc of the preclear just before he came into sessionin other words consistently and consecutively bettered him i did this by twoway communication and communication bridges every time the preclear tended to go out of session even slightly every time any slightest sign of dropped awareness occurred i assumed at once that something had gone wrong with the session i assumed that something had been said which he didnt understand or something had been overlooked or that something had been done in error on the twoway comm formula and immediately researched this fact to put the session straight again in other words during this entire session i did nothing but put the session straight with twoway communication and run relatively noncommittal duplicating process on the preclear the process i knew of old was not going to produce any grand rise in tone however this preclear who was usually difficult to audit finished up halfhour session in much better condition than this preclear had been in in years the assumption here on the part of the auditor is that if the preclear goes into slump has somatic or otherwise drops in arc then difficulty has arisen with the session we calculate this from the following that at the top of the tone scale we have knowingness and awareness in the middle ranges we have arc in the lower ranges somatics and in the far lower ranges varying degrees of unconsciousness thus when we say that the preclears tone should be promoted throughout the session we mean of course that he must not be slumping toward unconsciousness he must be advancing toward higher levels of consciousness therefore today it can be said that good auditing does not result in boiloff and somatic unconsciousness dopeoff or pain but results in constant and consistent advance of the arc of the preclear from the first moment of the session to the end of the session when it should be much higher and that any time there is anything wrong at all with the session the preclear will reply by getting more unconscious this was about the most arduous and rigorous test that could be made of new auditing style with difficult preclear and following very solidly the precept that it would be an auditing error if the preclear dropped off in attention or consciousness thus when i have said that in the new auditing style we should always advance arc i meant exactly what i said and have even gone so far as to run an auditing session which was nothing more than an auditing session to demonstrate that an auditing session all by itself with the twoway communication consequent to it would result in increased tone for the preclear by the way this type of auditing also results in increased tone for the auditor so we are winning both ways reports from washingtonwashington has recently received stack of forms from which they were supposed to fill out weekly and send through as reports on conditions finances etc this is really not so much an effort to fill up my vacuum of information as it is to get the washington operation to pay very close attention to these details themselves the theory is that if they have to compile these data they will then know these data and knowing them they will see what the situation actually is i believe much of the activity which goes on in an organization is done without any real realization of what the condition of the organization is and it may very well be that for the last five years only myself and few others have been actually conscious of the real condition of dianetics and scientology organizations with regard to their business organization and finance this sort of situation cannot of course continue dianeticists and scientologists working inside of organizations and keeping them running would be as competent as they knew what was going on in the organization and they would know as well what was going on in the organization as they were acquainted with the problems which the organization actually faced in terms of business and finance probably one of the things which has held us back more than anything else was good working knowledge of business itself the basic maxim of business is simplicity itself and that is first that there must be an organization there and second that it must perform its duties and functions and third that it must originate communications as well as receive communications and fourth that its income must be slightly greater than its outgo and fifth that persons inside the organization should know what was going on generally in the organization i instituted this report system when i discovered that the washington operation could sit there and not notice that the training department itself had never originated single letter of procurement to prospective students mary sue was originating all these letters and when she left washington to come over to london having stayed behind to square things away the training department which had the responsibility for emanating all communication on the subject of procurement of students wrote not one single letter to anyone anywhere thus washington is involved in slump similar to australia where internecine warfare kept people from communicating out to the world at large washington was brought into an intensified usual christmas slump by failure to originate communications another circumstance came to my attention which was very amusing over period of two weeks i was being asked by the downtown office if silver spring had received cheque for expenses downtown washington was communicating with to find out datum about silver spring which if map is inspected will be found to be eight miles away silver spring was not communicating this information to downtown washington and downtown washington evidently never thought of asking silver spring i let it ride until they eventually got together on the subject interdepartmental bulletins and meetings to exchange information are absolutely necessary if an organization is going to continue in healthy state it is time that the central organization of scientology began to circulate bulletins on what it is doing i know definitely that in each department branch of the entire washington operation everyone with very small exception is doing his allout level best to keep everything rolling and they are doing wonderful job of it i think however that from department to department the washington operation doesnt know this how about

and second postulate here is some very fundamental material that has come up on the first and second postulate i have been going over this very carefully and discover that we can know more about knowing we take our first and second postulate axiom and we find in this that if you run the first postulate the second postulate runs out and difficulties because of the second postulate run outthat there can be really difficulties with the first postulate our first test on this is to have somebody look around and instead of looking at something remember it he is looking at the wall so you say remember that wall so he looks right straight at it and remembers it he looks at chairs and things like this and remembers them instead of looking he remembers of course it is right there in present time but he is remembering right there in present time this will do some interesting things to ridges it is just an experiment its not process now we have him look at some things and forget them we just have him look around and forget some things what in this room are you willing to forget now instead of looking at it just forget it the next experiment would be to have him look around and know about some things in the room do you see how that fits in with r246 other people the next experiment would be to have him look around and see if there is anything in the room he can notknow about he is perfectly willing not to know about these various things if we run these in this order we will discover an oddity remember and know are sticky and forget and notknow are not sticky but will run well this becomes very very fabulous doesnt itwhat we have here has already been mentioned in self analysis 1951 fall and that is the first ascent into the abstract and away from real objects forget and remember those are the first abstract actions person can take mentally forget and remember now for the first time with this axiom about the first and second postulate forget and remember fit into their proper relationship and we get them in relationship to the conditions of existence the only thing that gets wrong with thetan you could say is that his attention gets stuck on something then when you go ahead as an auditor and stick his attention on something you have the other thing there is some more data that i think you ought to have its little bit advanced in some respects but it wont do anybody any harm the first is short note here on intentions we have process which is assign some intentions this is quite interesting because it reveals great deal of automatic machinery you run process on student such as this now i am supposed to and you have him finish the sentence and acknowledge it and talk about it then you have him say now i am supposed to and he tells you you just have him say this each time now i am supposed to and have him finish the sentence of course it could be run on the basis of now what are you supposed to do it is quite interesting that we find student and preclear set up in school is now i am supposed to learn some processes or now i am supposed to have short comm lag now i am supposed to do thisnow i am supposed to do that now i am supposed to

_____________________________________________________________________ 6 january 1956 six levels of processing issue 7 this issue of the six levels is dedicated to only one thingthe clearing of any level of case careful analysis of its every part of every step will discover it is process in itself slp 7 does not include many processes found in earlier sops and slps they are omitted not because they are not good but because they are not entirely direct they will reappear in later issues of slp doubt in this 7 we do not have something which will then become something else we have unique process series which while it retains form enforces simplicity the reason for this issue and its standtotheside of the evolution of processing in scientology is that issue 5 and even 6 with its emphasis on creativeness used without enough selectivity lose us the intelligence and personality gains prominent earlier in the fall of 1955 the processes are still therethey are not being concentrated upon lost bit in the multitude of choices of 5 and 6 thus 7 is especially made for staff auditors in slp 7 the goal or finite end of any process given is detailed the actual rationale is delineated and the entirety of the processing is done in accordance with one positively asserted assumption as follows when the pc goes more anaten than he is when not being audited he is in the grip of real or affected code break and is out of session any drop of alertness is drop of arc first with the auditor second with the bank always therefore drop of consciousness denotes break with the auditor which must be repaired before the session continues done without the above strict rule i cannot guarantee any success from 7 it is too strong process series in other words to omit any precaution twoway comm must be stressed at all times level one this is what gets the case moving problems chronic somatics the body of your preclear is quivering hunger for overt acts on consideration level these are problems the auditor begins his auditing with this first barrier he must surmount it by 1 twoway comm to establish good arc2 directly remedying havingness of problems or 3 remedy of overt acts by creative processing 4 alleviating chronic somatic or problem by remedying their scarcity or 5 increasing arc until all problems or somatics seem unnecessary 7 i find the auditor 7 i b find the preclear 7 i c find the auditing area light locational processing 7 i d establish that session is in progress 7 i accept discuss every comm preclear originates 7 i f acknowledge every command execution by preclear 7 i g agree on process and command before using it and do not confuse it 7 i h use twoway comm liberally 7 i i follow the auditors code 7 i j changed remedy havingness of problems by selecting communication terminals or universes not conditions and use command invent specific problem could be to you note lcan be run with best gain by discovering weakest universe by twoway comm about weak people and things and then using this person so discovered as the name in the blank above note 2 invent specific problem could be to you has reverse command invent specific problem you could be to however this is the overt act side and should be handled with care if used note 3at slp 7 i 1 chronic somatics can be alleviated and should be by invent problem your leg or stomach or liver never your lameness your ulcer your illness as these are conditions not terminals could be to you using mockups of overt acts to body and having pc when he has created them even black ones get how each part or fragment of the mockup is entirely dedicated to destroying the pcs body and so make mockup vanish to the body separation can occur from anything only when it has done enough overt acts to the body to cancel all obligation obligation being the first bargain or agreement possible to free being pledged word note 4it is distinctively understood that within this or the next step the chronic somatic will be alleviated before the clearing is continued note 5a very few pcs have lost the ability to invent problems with any reality these run on tell some lies about the environment and then on problems as above 7 i l run pc on orders two methods opening procedure 8c and direct command latter preferred tell some orders you wouldnt mind receiving tell something that would obey you note 6these commands are phrased to be permissive to the pc commanding from pc to environment note 7orders are an alltheway route the wall is an order postulate complicated by the order to be solid and endure the reality of the preclear depends on his ability to receive orders note 8dont stick the pc on one subject or object in running orders if the bank turns up an engram dont insist he gets part of it he can receive orders from also do not insist he take orders from various parts of environment note 9in level one dont solve any problems increase by various means as above the problems preclear can have 7 i m what could change youwhat would leave you unchanged run alternately one question then the other 7 i n to prevent all the problem and motivator techniques from adversely affecting the thetan or if the above processes did run alternately the following questions tell something your body doesnt have to reach tell something you could reach level two this is what changes the scientometric tests 7 ii waterloo station in populated area park rr station etc have pc tell auditor something he wouldnt mind notknowing about persons which auditor spots for him or the persons notknowing about him commands auditor do you see that man woman described slightly pc yes note 10make allowances for your pcs ability to see people clearly run if possible with glasses off if he still has them auditor tell something you wouldnt mind notknowing about that person note 11the pc selects things he already can know to notknow he does not give things he does not know anyway this stress is the willingness to notknow things one already knows otherwise pc will become confused note 12if twoway comm wont keep the pc alert he is on stuck flow see scientology 880 run other side as below when pcto spotted person has been run flat or to dopeoff reverse to auditor tell something you wouldnt mind that person not knowing about you note 13run one side for hours then the other side in ordinary use note 14observe that in slp 7 we omit all other spottings these are good but waterloo station is the cream of level two slp 5 and auditors have been too involved in lower steps to run waterloo station for gods sake dont neglect it its the most valuable process in scientology it handles time note 15the goal of waterloo station is not to make the pc make one thing vanish that phenomenon is just the start auditors have been quitting when the pc made somebodys hat disappear when the pc can make the whole universe wink on and off at his consideration to know or notknow it youre getting somewhereso dont stop at hat note 16dont give the pc back what he has just notknown if he notknew it he not knew it note 17if an auditor is so hungry for overt acts that he has to provoke the pc into them by breaks and poor compliance with procedure just ask the pc to hit the auditor few times itll remedy it level three this is what exteriorizes them decisional processing run in quiet placespreparatory what contracts could you break 7 iii think placed thought the object is to train the pc to think thoughts exterior to his head and thetan bank to obviate the cavein phenomena of axiom 51 commands auditor indicating object or position think thought in on that alternate command do you see that object think thought in on it did the thought appear where it is 7 iii b choice rehabilitation using the ability acquired in level three have the pc make choices between two objects indicated by auditor command from indicated point make choice between indicated positions or objects 7 iii c directed decision rehabilitation using the ability acquired in and b exercise the pc on decisions command make decision about that indicated object in or on that indicated object 7 iii d permissive decision rehabilitation using the abilities acquired in b and c turn pc loose on decisions decisions must be outside head and bank command decide something level four this builds back their willingness to live opening procedure by duplication done in an auditing room with book and bottle commands do you see that book walk over to it pick it up notknow something about its color notknow something about its temperature notknow something about its weight put it in exactly the same place do you see that bottle walk over to it pick it up notknow something about its color notknow something about its temperature notknow something about its weight put it in exactly the same place do you see that book etclevel five this makes them able to play games remedy of communication scarcity the object of this step is to restore abundance on any and all communication possibilities done in an auditing room 7 v create confusion commands mock up confusion alternate command what confusion could you create 7 v b creating terminals the pc may have to be coached into mocking up unknown confused black terminals and thus into good terminal mockups commands mock up communication terminal mock up another communication terminal 7 v c what wouldnt you mind communicating with duplicate the auditing command exactly dont redherring go chasing after facsimiles command what wouldnt you mind communicating with 7 v d creating family terminals have pc mock up until he has an abundance of any and all persons he has ever used as anchor points command mock up your father wife mother husband mock him her up again level six this exercises their exteriorization and stabilizes remedy of havingness and spotting spots in space route one an exteriorized step done as given in the

operational bulletins growing up this is the thirteenth issue of operational bulletins so far we have been setting an enviable record of getting operational bulletins out on time they are usually composed on monday and are mimeographed and mailed late tuesday afternoon they are done on special gestetner machine which uses blue ink to distinguish them from other mimeographed material released for the various organizations in every week except christmas week when nobody worked on tuesday and when we were day late the operational bulletin is setting record for coming out on time noteworthy and unusual circumstance in dianetics and scientology publications the purpose of operational bulletins is of course to furnish information of various types to scientology organizations and personnel and to give them the jump the scoop ahead of the rumour line individual instructions by letter to various personnel and primarily and principally to keep key staff personnel in scientology from being embarrassed by the sudden change of direction or the solution or arising of certain incidents so that they can act in the role of people who are in the know this is quite important since we have in the past had many instances whereby things were released to one quarter of the world were unknown in another quarter of the world and people in the field would ask staff members in some has what was going on and these has members would not know much to their embarrassment the operational bulletins give them chance to have the straight dope and enable them to put people right concerning great deal of material further if i started to originate individual letters to each and every key person in scientology and give him regularly all that was going on we would have in effect merely repeat of this operational bulletin thus i am enabled to write to persons material which is directly and intimately in their department and to put all generalized information on the communication network covered by the operational bulletins operational bulletins are sent by airmail to every quarter of the globe and although there are not very many copies of them released they have the effect of very wide distribution system however you should keep definitely in mind the fact that the information which appears in the operational bulletins is not generally well known to the field in fact practically none of this material is intended for direct consumption by auditors and scientologists at large it is not that they would not understand it but in these bulletins i do not spend any time being nice or pulling my punches or being artificially poised about everything and anything from my viewpoint these operational bulletins give chance to vent what bad temper i have and to indulge what puckish sense of humour i might conceive to be ill placed in wider spheresalert yourselves however to the fact that the material in operational bulletins 2 reworded where it is of questionable content to nonscientologists can be freely used and quoted in certainty ability local newsletters in lectures such as those given live by instructors and those given to free group people and indeed it is expected that the material in operational bulletins will get wider release at the direct discretion and good sense of people in scientology who are in charge of various publications everywhere you know how when im right there my closest friends sit around in the office or living room and we take the situation apart well this is not that good but the operational bulletins are at least something of substitute for the much closer type of communication that we like and which is quite impossible on wider publication basis wherein the publication might fall into any set of hands oh my gawd the other day well known figure in british scientology was standing in my office being asked to undertake an activity and i said to him more to make conversation than anything else of course you know that if we were to take on long series of cases suffering from some specific chronic somatic we would at least even if we used group processing alleviate the majority of those cases and this gentleman who has been in scientology for very long time and has done very great deal of auditing said to oh really could you do that now where has this guy been back in wichita when susie and i were combing the whole track trying to plow up the various incidents which eventually became what to audit in england the history of man we took on series of polio cases by means of newspaper advertisement the newspaper advertisement said polio sufferers research foundation is undertaking an investigation of polio any persons so inflicted who would like to participate in this investigation should phone the same ad was also run for arthritics people with arthritis and polio started to call in and we took these people on the polio sufferers up at my house the arthritics down at the foundation and using the oldest known form of overt acts and motivators and using effort processing we alleviated the majority of the cases which presented themselves the first case that came up immediately by the way enrolled in the professional course and other cases took professional auditing afterwards don g purcell cut the program off without informing us because of course the foundation was supposed to fail this program alone would have meant the making of dianetics in that immediate area and as matter of fact is still heard from although it was only in progress ten days it happens to be good gag for any auditor to work but remember this was 1951 and right there auditing these people more than three hours per preclear we made the majority of these people feel so much better about life that they could get on with it one girl threw away her crutches immediately another one an old lady got out of her wheel chair and what we did in that short program just auditing these few hours using nothing but overt acts motivators in the manner of effort processing yet it did so much more for these people than had ever been done for them medically or ever could be done for them medically that they were astonished beyond gratitude and here is this british scientologist who has been in practice for years standing there in front of my desk and asking in surprised tone of voice whether or not we could do anything for polio or other types of illnesses this man is reputed to have more success with auditing than many others but if he has not learned that we can alleviate the majority of any illness in any series as distinct from curing all cases into state of perfection then what does this man think we are doing does he think that scientology is swindle he must either that or hes never applied it even vaguely to people who were ill this matter was considerable shock to as you might well suppose for it told at once why the progress of scientology in great britain was relatively limited further check into this subject with another person much better scientologist discovered to that the british scientologist is not aware of the wild reactions and phenomena obtained from running engrams the preclear rolling up in ball on the bed as he goes into prenatal or wriggling hiswhole body like fish as he hits sperm sequence is unknown in great britain indeed at this late date i suppose that it is more or less unknown in america since it has been two or three years since anybody ran an engram on anybody but here again was the tremendous drama associated with auditing now if we have forgotten in great britain america and if we have not established in south africa or australia first that dianetics or scientology even in its crudest form could alleviate the majority of mans illnesses and that majority of any series of cases of any specific illness would be alleviated and if we have not established the various highly convincing phenomena obtained in running engrams we of course are not making anywhere near the progress we should indeed if we have let this material lapse in america and are longer beating the drum for it longer demonstrating it we of course are going to make very slow progress there is nothing quite as convincing as getting tipped over into prenatal and getting it run out the phenomena of running birth of operations accidents of the loud zip pop that comes from electronic explosions hot enough to burn holes in the emeter electrodes and particularly the fantastic efficiency of dianetics and scientology in alleviating majority of illnesses are any one of them capable of giving enough word of mouth to dianetics and scientology across populace to alert the world to what we really have here however if we neglect these things utterly if our auditors do not know they can happen we are going to make very slow progress of it we can as of this moment process chronic somatic i know that some months ago and earlier than that it seemed rather fatal to us to continue to fixate the preclears attention on chronic somatic but that is not problem with us right now it ceased to be problem the moment i invented an auditing command exactly as follows invent problem that leg arm nose eye body could be to you running this command which is in itself sort of remedy of havingness and repairing and remedying the havingness of the preclear as we go we will discover that practically any and all phenomena associated with the service facsimile will come away and clear up and the limb or nose or eye will get well this can be used as word of warning only on actual terminals never use this command and i mean never on actual conditions never ask the individual to invent problems lameness could be to him never ask him what problem blindness could be to him lameness and blindness are conditions we want to know what problems legs or eyes can be to him since legs and eyes are terminals in running this command we reduce havingness too rapidly whenever we are stressing conditions therefore we run it only on terminals and use only terminals in running it handled in this way we do have the answer as of this moment to chronic somatics this is really not news we have had the answer to chronic somatics for years and we have actually been able to alleviate the majority of chronic somatics which presented themselves to us why we werent winning the exact reason why our progress through the society was limited might lie in part in the fact that we longer stressed the alleviation of chronic somatics but in actuality it is far more important to us that for at least the last year auditors have been auditing in way which i did not suspect and which does not produce an adequate result upon preclear it is very startling news to to review scientology via its psychometric test results and discover that over period of about four months neither washington nor london had been getting anything like the rise in ability in its preclears that it had formerly been getting without at once discovering the answer the answer in this particular case was elusive if you will examine one of the last abilitys published in phoenix arizona you will see two sets of graphs one of them consists of twentyfive hours by staff auditors on series of preclears and the other graph consists of five hours on series of very tough preclears by myself you will see that the gains of the twentyfive hour intensive and the fivehour intensive are quite similar in fact the fivehour i was giving was little bit bigger gain than that being gotten in twenty five hours by the staff auditor now i thought it was merely smoother presence or bettergrip on existence and dianetics and scientology that was doing this but this large generality as statement of the difficulty was inadequate laterally although my own auditing on preclears was getting better and better the staff auditing on preclears and the auditing on preclears out in the field was getting worse and worse less and less gains were being obtained during the last few months i have spent very uncomfortable three months researching and looking hard at techniques in scientology in trying to determine what was happening to preclears who were coming in for auditing and why they were not easily and smoothly progressing as they were being audited only at the last did i look hard at something the auditor himself was doing you have heard say dozens and dozens of times i am sure when in doubt remedy havingness well you aint doing it and you better start right now i cannot entirely congratulate my only alertness in discovering this for the matter was presented to about two weeks ago when i came out with process known as body motivators i had discovered that body is very very hungry for motivators of such very low level that any and all motivator remedy had in the past escaped it all you have to do is mock up mockup of any kind and have the preclear state an intention into it that it is there to kill the body and instantly it goes into the body this hunger was so pronounced and widely spread that one auditor suggested that we invent technique on it called sop slurp it was not until three separate auditors asked how you went about getting preclear to mock up mockup and get it into the body that i awakened to the fact that in our hpahca schools we had not adequately instructed on how to repair and remedy havingness that was the first inkling the next was some auditing i myself got in which havingness was repaired or remedied and even this passed by and the next was just week ago checking case to discover with some astonishment that each and every symptom of loss of havingness was missed by the auditor at that time last week i gave lecture on the subject of remedying havingness and its necessity but at the time i gave this lecture which is available in london and washington and which covers the subject fairly adequately i was not entirely aware of the fact that auditors in general are completely ignorant of the necessity for remedy and repair of havingness it is then with considerable shock that i have to report that one of the basic tenets of scientology invented here in england three years ago and in use for all those three years has been missed and is being overlooked by auditors everywhere and if they are overlooking this then they are messing up preclears at most delightful pace it may not be that every auditor is obsessed with the idea of making nothing out of preclears but it certainly looks as if we have overlooked the repair and remedy of havingness that we have all too many of us been trying to make nothing out of the preclears aberrations the wrong way around the way to make nothing out of those aberrations is to repair and remedy the preclears havingness every time it drops what are the symptoms of loss of havingness running any asising technique the preclear may become anaten or he may become slightly nervous or agitated or want cigarette or seem to break out of the session in some fashion in either case he is down in his havingness in other words he has burned up used up or asised too much of his physical body energy in the auditing itself in view of the fact that every subjective technique puts sort of hole in the middle of the electronic mass surrounding preclear parts of that mass then begin to cave in on the preclear thus running an asising technique on preclear beyond the ability of the preclear to sustain the consequent loss of havingness will bring in on the preclear many new engrams which he did not before have and technique which asises energy if used without repair or remedy of havingness will bring about worsening of the case of the preclearfor instance there are several auditors i have not directly trained on staff now working in washington just as this has missed it has evidently missed julia and in london has missed dr walker careful study of the washington staff auditor reports reveals that the only advance in graph of the preclear which is significant and worthy of the name of scientology during the last few weeks occurred when the auditor repaired and remedied havingness or was using mockup type of technique along with asising types of techniques as an example the preclear audited last week by dick morley was run very largely on repairs and remedying of havingness old time staff auditor dick morley evidently wasnt taking his finger off any number he very carefully repaired and remedied havingness and reported it as such and his case did remarkable jump now exactly what is happening is very simple preclear starts to go anaten and the auditor keeps on running the process this is to some degree my fault the auditor has been indoctrinated into running the process regardless of what happens he hasnt realized that he ought to interrupt any process at any time if the preclear demonstrates loss of havingness anaten is such demonstration of loss of havingness all right another example the preclear becomes agitated or upset he reaches for cigarette he begins to twitch his foot begins to wobble he begins to talk excitedly he begins to cough while being audited all of these things demonstrate loss of havingness even the bulk of the somatics which turn on are demonstration of loss of havingness these same conditions by the way can result from the preclear believing that the auditor has broken the auditors code in some fashion or has treated cavalierly or has overcome his power of choice both repair and remedy of havingness are immediately indicated on the observation of anaten or agitation on the part of the preclear and in addition to this the auditor should carefully go over the session itself to find out if anywhere the preclear believed that his power of choice was being overcome or if the auditors code was believed to have been broken by the preclear you understand that the auditor didnt have to overcome the preclears power of choice or break the auditors code in order to have the preclear believe that this had happened however this could be overlooked entirely if the auditor had been careful enough to repair or remedy the havingness of the preclear the slightest drop of alertness on the part of the preclear or the slightest agitation or somatic on the part of the preclear should immediately indicate to the auditor that havingness has dropped and must be immediately repaired or remedied great deal of time can be spent on the subject of repair and remedy of havingness and it is very beneficial time spent it is better to waste time repairing and remedying havingness than to blunder on through now there is another thing i have noticed with regard to this auditors are running these days toward cognition very well if they expect the preclear to cognite they should not expect him to pull in bank on himself if an auditor runs very obvious process which should bring the preclear toward cognition and if he runs it several auditing commands and then stops and repairs and remedies the preclears havingness and then after that asks him the same auditing question two more times he will discover that he has blown cognition into view in other words you could remedy the havingness of preclear while his mind was on one particular subject and bring cognition into existence the reason scientology has been going slowly is in part as covered above the fact that we have been neglecting its efficacy in the matter of chronic somatics but in the main because auditors have not been repairing and remedying the havingness of the preclears and have been running them downhill at mad rate now boy this is something we have got to jump on in hurry weve got to get in there and grab every auditor by the scruff of the neck and say listen do not run an asising command beyond the point of alertness of the preclear the moment that the arc of the preclear drops or the preclear becomes agitated even vaguely you get in there and repair or remedy havingness this becomes particularly important today since few months ago i discovered that you could remedy the havingness of anybody and i mean just that you can remedy anybodys havingness and you can turn on mockups on anybody the fact that the preclear who has ablack field or even an invisible field can be caused to mock up blacknesses or invisibilities and shove them into his body brings us into an era of being able to make anybody turn on mock ups getting the preclear to postulate that the blackness is bad for the body will cause that blackness to snap into the body getting the preclear to postulate the invisible mass he has mocked up as bad for the body will snap it into the body of course after this has been done few times the consideration of the preclear will change then perhaps the blackness or the invisibility will only snap in when the preclear postulates that it is good for the body he may also have residue left it is very important to get rid of these repair and remedy havingness residues by various postulates such as that the residue is threat to the body it is good for the body it is bad for the body the residue too will snap in lets differentiate at once here the difference between repair of havingness and remedy of havingness we used to call repair of havingness giving him some havingness it needs better technical term therefore let us call this repair of havingness it means having the preclear mock up anything he can mock up and in any way it can be done to get him to shove never pull that mockup into the body and by similar means to get rid of the residue which went along with the mockup that is repair of havingness it is oneway flow it is an inflow now remedy of havingness is getting him to mock up and shove into the body enough masses or simply mock up and copy enough masses to bring him to point where he can eventually throw one away in other words repair of havingness is simply having him mock up things and have him shove them into the body and remedy of havingness is having him mock up and shove in and throw away the same type of mockup remedy of havingness is always superior operation to repair of havingness repair of havingness is very crude stopgap but can be used at any time however preclear who is working well and on whom havingness can be remedied should at all times have his havingness remedied not repaired in other words any mockup mocked up should both be shoved into the body and mocked up and shoved away and this should be done in considerable quantity until the preclear is quite relaxed about that particular type of mockup one does this remember every time the attention of the preclear drops or becomes agitated there is one other little point connected with this which is quite important and that is auditors very often audit preclear into an area of time when the preclear exteriorized this on preclear who does not easily exteriorize brings on considerable grief and sadness the way to get rid of this is of course to remedy the preclears havingness or only repair it and to ask the preclear to recall times when he was not exteriorized this will bring up at once times when he did exteriorize and recalling these and using further remedy and repair of havingness will get him out of those areas on the time track where he did exteriorize and where fear of exteriorization was built up considerably i have noticed another special condition regarding this exteriorization phenomena which is quite important preclear will occasionally repair and remedy havingness up to point where the body disappears he doesnt quite know where to put the mass which he has mocked up since he cannot find the body this is particularly true of preclears who have very low threshold on havingness an auditor would be stupid indeed to simply plow along beyond that point where the preclear has already said that he couldnt find any body to push any havingness into the moment the preclear does that the auditor should suspect that the preclear has gotten into an exteriorization type incident it is not however necessary that he immediately flounder around and try to find this incident as recommended in the paragraphs just above he can also repair and remedy havingness in this fashion and it is very important to know this although it is disastrous for preclear to be asked what could your body have since he will simply strip the bank of various old facsimiles it is very very good repair of havingness to ask preclear what is there around this room area which your body could have and then have him pick out specific objects in the environment which he says the body could have if he does this he will come up the gradient scale of havingness and his havingness will be repaired or remedied immediately or directly on the sixth dynamic preclear who cannot get mockups and wherein the auditor has either been too clumsy to get the mockups turned on or it really was impossible more or less the preclears havingness can be repaired simply by having himdo this process so this is very very important process and one that ought to go down in red letters this whole subject of repair and remedy of havingness and its effect upon auditing and the fact that it has not been stressed at all in training being up there at level six in the old basic processes brings us to slp issue 8 the entirety of level one in slp will be devoted to remedy and repair of havingness in slp issue 7 we have great many phenomena associated with the remedy of the bodys havingness the reason for their position is to bring about an adjustment of the condition of the body before one goes on to other and more complicated ways of processing now in issue 8 all of these various things will be retained but they will be paralleled with complete remedy of havingness as that particular level of slp will be gone over in actual experience it is better to remedy the havingness of preclear matter where he is on the tone scale and matter by what process than to run any significant process further if preclear cannot at least repair his havingness to run waterloo station on him is to invite disaster because in this particular process of level two he is liable to get himself into down havingness situation and of course will not be able to notknow anything he may be chewing up too much energy while trying to notknow thus we would have the failures which have occasionally occurred in waterloo station they were simply havingness failures not failure of waterloo station furthermore there has been new command suggested for waterloo station what would you be willing to notknow about that person this seems to be better command at least for the british isles you may believe i am being rather militant and accusing everybody of having pulled an overt act against by doing this but the truth of the matter is that time in my auditing have i ever permitted preclear to drop in his havingness and i have therefore gone through considerable period of surprise when i find that this particular thing is being neglected elsewhere this tells at once what has been happening to our psychometric graphs has been happening to our preclears where they didnt advance in hurry and has been definitely interrupting our goals any and all field auditors are undoubtedly sinning like mad in this particular direction weve got to make practice to tap these fellows on the shoulder and say here youve got to repair and remedy havingness matter what else youre running on the preclear every time he goes anaten or gets agitated in any way weve got to conduct an educational program in an awful hurry throughout the field naturally we should start closest to home and we should take our staff auditors and we should be very very insistent that they repair and remedy havingness on preclears and we should hold this up as more important in the early parts of case than any change of mind or significance the change of mind occurs after repair and remedy of havingness has been accomplished if our auditors continue to asis everything in sight in the preclear the preclears case is going to hang and that is all there is to it i have not yet run the sequence i wish to on cognition i believe that i will be able to run few commands of specific asising type command and then repair and remedy the preclears havingness and finally ask the same asising command couple more times and get an immediate cognition on the part of the preclear in other words i believe that you can use repair of havingness or remedy of havingness to get an immediate cognition on almost anything with the preclear we also take care of vacuums and separatenesses and everything else with repair or remedy of havingness and running in with it certain other things such as problems etc when we discover by twoway communication weak universe we could then ask the individual preclear invent problem that person weak universe could be to you and then watching him very carefully and repairing his havingness on the subject of that persons possessions get very rapid separation of universes i have noticed that the weak universe phenomena begins when the person elected by the preclear to be weak universe first began to put mest anchor points around the preclear in other words valuable presentsnow although i sound very militant about this you should translate that militance into urgency i feel rather triumphant i have put my finger on something here which has been puzzle to for very long time why did auditors in general fail to get the results on preclears we have sorted out great many points and have straightened out great many things but none of them have been the real thing the actuality is this business about repair or remedy of havingness i am sure that this is it an auditor can almost audit carelessly if he repairs and remedies the havingness of the preclear adequately of course there is great deal to know about the repair and remedy of havingness which has never been put down the gradient scales methods of turning on sonic and visio and host of technologies and techniques relating to the repair and remedy of havingness having yet to be delineated adequately i am however attending to this as fast as i can and you can expect in the very near future considerable rundown on exactly how you go about repairing and remedying havingness i am even going so far as attempting to make training film on an animation principle using live subject and cutouts to show what it really looks like when the preclear is repairing havingness and what it looks like when he is remedying havingness i am as pleased as can be to get finger on this point and i know doggone well that if east west north and south would begin to repair and remedy havingness and stop specializing in the significances without repair or remedy of havingness we are going to start shooting people up to the top of these psychometric graphs we cant help it this is not going to be very easy road i feel for an auditor recently who was very very closely coached on the subject of repair and remedy of havingness did go out and manage to lay considerable egg the auditor just didnt get the idea of the agility of preclears havingness the auditor could not credit the fact that the agitation and excitement of the preclear was actually loss of havingness another auditor could not credit the fact that the continuousness of preclears fear was simply lack of havingness let call your attention specifically to the old phenomena of the emotional scale and the engram we found out that when one engram was keyed in that it fixed the emotional tone of the individual then we had him run this and as he converted the havingness of the engram to usable havingness we found that his tone rose we discover on these psychometric charts that the unhappy section is not moving in recent times the reason it is not moving is because we arent changing the mass of the preclear in order to change his emotional tone we would have to change his body mass the best way to change his body mass is repair and remedy havingness and get him on the road with regard to mockups we started out long time ago to change people on the tone scale well here is the answer to changing that position on the tone scale and we sure better use it lot of this i confess must be lack of observation on my part but i am so happy to have hold of it and to get this point straightened out that i dont much care what the basic cause was in relationship to it i want you to look accusatively at any and all auditors you run into and say why havent you repaired the havingness of preclears youve been running asising processes on well weve got this answer taped lets go brainwashing book recalled washington has recalled the brainwashing manual from all those to whom it was issued on request from the government the manual is not to be issued in general to the public but is to be let out only to our most trusted association members so that they can aid and understand and further their studies on curing brainwashing this manual is an exact text on how brainwashing is done the manual itself had to be written into much more obvious english from the very poor translation which it was originally and thus reads fairly well but is less deadly for the changeyour photo please any and all persons on the operational bulletin distribution list are requested to send as soon as possible either an 8 x 10 studio portrait of self or very good quality snapshot film so that an enlargement can be made we intend to put up in the various hass throughout the world the pictures of the various persons intimately connected with scientology offices as soon as i have these i will either make the enlargements or have the portraits and will distribute remember now i am waiting for picture from you and if you dont send one you will be missing in the halls of the various hass and you dont want to be missing amongst this crew motion pictures needed we are hoping to have reel of 8 mm film of each has in the world and its personnel so that we can have this film copied and copies distributed to these various offices for their view in demonstrating to people what the has looks like in other areas if you are interested in this project let know training schedule released the whys and wherefores of the four levels of courses taught in scientology rather than schedules of class hours have been put together recently by myself and are being distributed this schedule will also appear as pab since it contains for the most part rationale of training brand new way of teaching the indoctrination course is included you will probably be getting your copies of this very shortly the primary difference is the establishing of an auditing attitude on the part of the student before he is taught any processes there is difference procedures to scientology techniques an auditor who does not know scientology procedures is not likely to be able to handle scientology techniques this schedule is to be put into action at once everywhere boss goes unpaid evidently the only staff person who is not now receiving his pay cheque regularly is myself when i left washington there was considerable ballup on pay cheques for reasons best known to himself the former secretary of the founding church was not at all ambitious in getting the personnel paid now i have finally gotten everybody straightened out due to the help of hugh neals the new washington bookkeeper we have been so intent on getting all the records straight one way or the other however that we have neglected to notice that i have gone unpaid here for some months this is very easy thing to have happen to one if one happens to be the actual management of an organization the staff can always strike against the management but who does the management strike against if it were not for my handiness with dice i probably would have starved to death by this time washington gives terrific congress under the management of dr young and ably assisted by dr barrett dr sanborn dr breeding and at the last minute dr lewis as well as the other stout fellows in the washington area terrific congress is reported to have been had naturally the numbers of attendants were not as high as the usual central congress even though the fee was much lower due to my absence but the public was very happy with it which makes very happy i wasnt directly taking the testimony of the washington staff itself concerning how terrific this congress was however people who returned home from the congress then wrote letters thanking forthe terrific new processes and the wonderful advance scientology has had so i guess it is now in order to thank the staff now that it has been proved true l ron hubbard lrhrd copyright 1956 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office 1 brunswick house 83 palace gardens terrace london w8 bay 8881 operational bulletin 14 24 january 1956 after the flood operational bulletin 13 must have appeared to be flood of material and it was actually it contained 1 the road block which has been preventing the progress of scientology and its remedy and 2 the outline of basic philosophy behind courses i hope you read all this because it will undoubtedly have profound influence upon the forward progress we are making the indoctrination course outline in particular is to go into effect at once and it may be expedient to take existing hpa and hca students and feed them back through this regimen as far as repair and remedy of havingness are concerned and body motivators i have made several tapes recently for the coaching course given in london which are available from the london has there are six hours of these tapes or three reels and the set is available for 15 they will be sold to anyone pound is worth 280 if you wish to convert this into us dollars the series includes body motivators recent materials on exteriorization and great deal of material which you will probably never see otherwise the only ones it is fantastic to have to advertise or sell scientology it is the only methodology extant today which alleviates or remedies psychosomatic illness proofs an individual against host of casualties improves reaction time raises intelligence and improves ability that scientology has throughout the world today only about 1200 practitioners in full practice could be true only if these people did not understand entirely the capabilities which lay under their hands the discovery that they were not repairing or remedying havingnessand of course my omission in pointing out this factis about the only thing which has brought about failed cases and which slows down the general progress of cases everywhere now that this is spotted and swept out of the way i dont see any real bar to our forward progress scientologists are the only ones where healing is concerned or where an improved race or culture is concerned scientology and scientologists are the one hope the human race has today lets not make it thin one comparison of results do you recall one of the last abilities issued in phoenix arizona which contained two graphs one of the graphs had to do with composite of all cases audited by staff over long period of time and the other one had to do with very long series of preclears i had audited the staff auditors audited their preclears for 25 hours each i audited my preclears for five hours each the results were comparable with perhaps the slightest edge over the staff auditorin my graph in other words the results i was getting in five hours were being obtained almost in 25 hours by the staff auditor one of the reasons behind this disparity of time was not just the insight of the old master it was the solid reason that i repaired and remedied havingness on my preclears perhaps another influencing point was that i audited these preclears only one hour per day for five consecutive days when havingness was cut into the preclear did not for long have to suffer under that duress but this is probably minimal reason some of the other reasons were acknowledgement and respecting the origin of communication by the preclear condition which was not always met by the staff auditor this graph by the way will explain to some degree my own continuous state of optimism where dianetics and scientology were concerned i always stated what i had found to be true this was not necessarily true and practised by the auditor it has therefore been my contest to find out what i was doing so that i could relay the information on and so make the auditor results comparable this we have evidently more nearly approached today than ever before particularly with our new indoctrinations schedule and what we have just discovered about the repair and remedy of havingness earliest findings on havingness it might be amusing for you to know what the earliest finding was in the field of havingness i wanted to know exactly what happened in terms of intelligence quotient when engrams were run into restimulation and knocked out of restimulation i therefore set up series of tests to be accomplished under very solid regimen as follows the preclear under test was given short form otis iq test this took him about ten minutes the auditor then immediately threw him down the track into such engrams as birth or accidents and when that engram had been run just enough to get into the full restimulation the preclear was given form 2 of the otis iq which is comparable to form 1 this was done in rather long series the engrams were then erased or deintensified and the individual was given form 1 of otis iq again i set this up simply as needful datum i did not anticipate any particular results and was willing to learn from the experiment i did it was found that the iq of the individual raised from five to eight points by the simple fact of being thrown into birth or heavy engram this was such wild result and so unexpected and yet so constant in the testing itself that i had to accept that the restimulation of an engram increased the intelligence quotient of the individual the deintensification of the engram by further erasure did not again lower the iq of the individual fact which is accounted for by the mass in the engram being converted by an erasure not eradicated as we understand this today it was that the preclear was given havingness the havingness he was given did contain vast significances but the significances were less important than the actual mass itself therefore the iq gain this was our first encounter with the relationship between intelligence and mass what actually occurred in this experiment was not visible to for years since the experiment took place in november and december of 1950 the experiment was the only one conducted for directly on the line of actual researchas distinguished from putteringby the hubbard dianetic research foundation of elizabeth nj that organization spent 47000 all told on research it conducted the above experiment and collected some evidence that in one case of spinal arthritis dianetic processing had undoubtedly relieved the condition the research department was at the time conducted by donald h rogersalthough some might not think otherwise i feel that in view of the conduct of the above experiment by that department the 47000 did buy something after all despite all contrary intent it should be noted that when we erased an engram we did not erase the mass connected with it we erased the significance in the mass we took perceptics out of it and it then could convert into acceptable mass what was unacceptable was the perceptics and these restrained the individual from utilizing the mass actually i should say the individuals body from utilizing the mass we can further learn from this that the figurefigure boy is doing just about this he is trying to erase out of what mass he can have enough content so that his body can utilize that mass his figurefigure is actually an effort to erase the answer of course is to give him mass he doesnt have to erase the figurefigure out of the figurefigure boy is way down on ability to have and is going on sort of storage battery philosophy that while he cant create anything he can at least utilize blocks of stuff that he has stockpiled in his bank utilization of operational bulletins it has not leaked through several ridges yet but these operational bulletins are for use in other publications and for use by has staffs having an extremely limited circulation being destined only for key scientologists who themselves are dissemination points these operational bulletins are made to contain much information which should reappear in various publications when utilized in other publications of an official nature one should not say that the material is from an operational bulletin one should simply say the material is from l ron hubbard one can directly quote it or rewrite it giving credit to its source by quoting the operational bulletin one puts into existence into the field the awareness that there is another communication line running which people then begin to desire thus devaluating the value of the pabs certainty and ability if material placed in these bulletins is not so utilized communication line is being cut i could sit down every couple of weeks and write long articles especially for ability magazine i could do the same thing for the pabs i could also do the same thing every month for certainty sometimes i even do this but the material which i am handling is generally vitally needed in one or another part of scientology and i see reason to deny the one and half score people who are the key figures in training and processing throughout the world this data simply to introduce comm lag on it for the benefit of ability magazine thus better answer for it is to put whatever articles i may have for these publications into operational bulletins and send them on through and then have this material released ability certainty and the pabs can duplicate each other it does not matter bit if they do it simply gives some material greater emphasis than others by having it repeated in two publications not all of this material will be utilized by such publications of course i have various ways of getting communications out to people one of them of course is by personal letter and this system i use rather extensively but this has the unhandiness of jamming my own secretarial service since much of the material i handle is equally applicable to many persons i could of course adopt the sloppy system of taking new materials and suggestions and making carbon copies of them and including this in as appendices on various letters this is in effect what the operational bulletins are just because the operational bulletins appear on mimeographed pages is reason they are rival publication they are not rival publication they do not go out to the world of scientology except through the medium of ability certainty and the pabs as well as of course instructors and auditors immediately concerned in the hass for instance in operational bulletin 13 there are exactly four pabs appendix 1 of operational bulletin 13 isto be broken in half and printed in two sections as pabs in the operational bulletin itself if you will glance at it again there are two more pabs but it is not known whether or not they will be so utilized certainly in the main body of the operational bulletin all that material must be repeated to scientologists everywhere it is sufficiently important to be utilized in certainty the pabs and ability if it isnt utilized and disseminated then we are just as far behind as we were last month do you know what german schema is it is graph which shows one source breaking down into two sources which break down into four sources which break down into eight sources and so on well if you fit scientology publications on such graph you find out that the operational bulletins are feeding several sources this publication is not competitive medium to certainty ability the pabs or saturday evening post the london times or the daily worker the operational bulletins are for the aid and assistance of scientology editors of the various publications and the staff of hass throughout the world outside distribution of operational bulletins as such is not only discouraged it is forbidden and remember never give credit to the operational bulletins give credit to l ron hubbard as byline at the beginning of the article just as though it were specially written for the publication in the case of the pabs by the way the signature or byline is always at the end of the article not at the beginning in certainty and ability the byline is at the beginning of the article three methods of dissemination with the introduction of two new courses in the london operationthe weekend professional auditors course at hpa level and the dissemination course weekday evenings we are stressing the fact that there are methods of dissemination of scientology and gaining and holding practice and group which are certain and adequately productive of results in the dissemination course we are incidentally going to teach the indoctrination week first as contained in operational bulletin 13 appendix 1 and then we are going to review the repair and remedy of havingness and then we are going to lay on the line these three methods of dissemination how they are done and what to do with what they gain the three methods are 1 i will talk to anyone 2 illness researches 3 casualty contact these are the major proven methods of dissemination there are other methods such as street contact industrial contact and the old time psychoanalytic contact but they are not well proven in use auditors seem too shy to accost people on the street although industrialists show some interest they seldom show cash and although the psychoanalytic contact where one simply sits in an office with sign outside the door and waits for the flies to walk into the spider web is very definitely in use in scientology as it was in psychoanalysis it still is not successful it builds limited and constricted practice without any third dynamic appeal it does very little good for scientology the fourth and entirely possible if hopeful method the auditor might use is to sit and wait for the central organization to send him preclears several auditors are doing this and it is not method of dissemination and will never happen for the good reason that the central organizations in each case are depending on the individual auditor to beat up the brush for scientology thus we have case of mutual waiting the central organizations do play large role in the procurement of preclears but they do this by general dissemination and good will advertising as well as releasing popular publications which go from hand to hand and cause an alertness to the subject and the existence of auditors the central organization does not directly solicit preclears to be sent on to auditors it does very occasionally where any one auditor is concerned refer some correspondent in an area to an auditor it does this at what seems to it to be very high rate as it refers commonly ten or twenty preclears week or used to but this spread out across 1200 auditors is not very many preclears and so the auditor in the field has never believed that the central organization did anything for him the central organizations do very great deal for the individual auditor but they count upon him also to build his own practice and thus scientology it is very limited process where the central organization contactsbecome the only contacts which were made in the world on the subject of scientology if any auditor is trying to pursue the last two methods mentioned which is to say hanging up his sign and waiting for people to walk in the door or if he is simply waiting for the central organization to send him people he better stop waiting the methods we must count upon to build groups practices in scientology are the first three listed above 1 i will talk to anyone is in very broad and general usage in the united states it is not yet in general usage in great britain or on other continents even though it has been tested and found extremely successful in london the entire plan has been covered in one of my articles in an earlier ability which was written after an actual test i had made in washington had resulted in success the gist of this plan is to place in newspapers an ad which says personal counselling i will talk to anyone for you about anything phone rev soandso between hour and hour when the people call up which they doalthough the ad sometimes has to run for some days before the first call since people are waiting to first find out whether it is code and message or is actually an invitation to phonethey desire the minister to talk to someone for them actually in many cases their problems evaporate in the phone call itself if the minister simply asks them to repeat the problem several times or asks them what they could do about this if it is the purpose of the minister simply to solve the problem of the preclear thus phoning he can of course cancel out his clientele with the greatest of ease this however is not his purpose his purpose is to get this individual into weekly group processing unit this person he will find is not one of the lower strata of the society or one of its neurotics he is one of the few remaining citizens who still has conscience and who wants to get something done thus he will discover himself talking strange as it may seem to him at first to the better people although of course he will get his proportion of pranks and nuts he should actually undertake and importantly free of charge the actual commission of executing the communication he should not talk to the person in such way as to ease the problem this may be the last problem this person has and it would be disservice to simply solve it as easily as that one makes something of the problem not makes nothing of it if auditors have any fault it is one way flow in making nothing out of things instead of occasionally making something out of them the minister receiving the call should then credit the fact that this is pretty big problem and should undertake the commission of completing the communication he should be interested and alert he should require personal interview from the person calling if he cannot get the name and address of the person calling he can always get the name and address of the person the caller wishes him to communicate with he should get one or the other of these addresses on the first phone call the auditor should keep log of such calls and should write down all their particulars and any addresses that he may find in these otherwise he will become swamped also he will lose lot of potential preclears the fact that the caller is calling at all says that the caller believes things can be better this is in the minority in todays society it should be cherished and nourished thus at the interview the minister places in the hands of the person material relating to the work of the church group which the minister is actually conducting every sunday morning of course there are ways to derail this particular project the first i have already delineated in stating that one can asis the problem the moment the call is received using scientology techniques and the other chief one is for the auditor to get so busy completing peoples communications that he doesnt find time to run sunday group his purpose is collecting together sunday group thus he simply couldnt be busy enough to neglect this point he has literature to hand which does not insist that the caller who has now come in person attend but which holds out to him the fact that there are other people in his similar circumstances that he might care to meet and that there are actually methods which make it possible for individuals to solve their own problems and that these goals are achieved by attending sunday morning church which of course is represented to be quite different than what one ordinarily expects by reason of experience with old time congregations one does not talk about personal auditing unless the subject is forced onto one after the individual has beenpersuaded to come to the church group his communication in the meanwhile having been executed he will become aware of the fact that individual auditing is available he will understand what it is he will also understand that he can benefit from it there are many instances of course of people simply turning up learning about auditing and wanting some at once without going to group and these of course can be cared for but the main point is to execute the communication of the individual without charge fee or donation and to get that individual to come to the sunday morning church group there he will of course be given an opportunity to join the church at some small membership fee and will be made part of the group of course it stands to reason that any auditor who has fairly good sized group which is undergoing free processing will get from the group many candidates for 1 personal auditing and 2 basic course in scientology for which charge can be made it is actually mistake to charge for group intensives it is much better in the long run to do only free group processing individual auditing for fee and to teach basic courses in scientology usually on certain evenings in the week people who do not pay for auditing will pay for the course many of the people in the course will demand individual auditing this whole plan is working gradient scale in getting people into scientology when regarded otherwise it tends to break down people call up to get their problems solved drift away people get their communications through and then lacking auditing begin to burden the minister with additional communications which in the long run mean nothing to him or scientology the chief stumbling block auditors have encountered is the actual placing of the ad it is found that the ad places very poorly in huge city dailies as compared to small suburban papers thus even in large cities the ad should be put into the smaller papers people taking classified ads want to know if the ad has ever appeared before anywhere else naturally it has and copies of its placement are available from dr richard steves founding church of scientology of new york carnegie hall new york city and from the hasuk in london but much more germanely there is now in existence society of consulting ministers this was organized in washington dc by the founding church it has available membership at very low cost which gives to the ordained auditor card which declares his membership in the society this membership card is an adequate representation of the society and its antecedents and carries on it for the benefit of people on papers such as reporters or classified advertising managers the following legend any question about the activity integrity or ethics of the above minister or the wording or precedent of any ad he wishes to place should be referred to the society of consulting ministers the founding church of scientology 1812 19th street nw washington dc or its british correspondent the hasuk 1 brunswick house 83 palace gardens terrace london w8 organizational note dr youngbetter have these cards ready as i think you have the society arranged already for some time past the ad itself has attracted sufficient press to give an adequate background one does not bring the word scientology into press interviews one simply talks about the church its work and immediately it converses on actual cases which have already been handled one does not i repeat does not discuss scientology with the press he discusses this particular project if the press wants to know what scientology is the minister should shrug and say there are lots of textbooks about that and that he does not propose to teach course in an advanced science to the pages of the public press that it is the church and the churchs charitable activities which are behind this not scientology he should also say that today ministers are indoctrinated in many learnings and skills and scientology happens to be chiefest amongst these the tremendous workability of the i will talk to anyone ad is attested by the many congregations it has built for auditors and the numerous preclears which they have received from these the sphere of scientology is widening markedly because of this particular plan plan 2 is rather older and less known it is still within the confines of ministerial activities but it was originally practised outside those confines the original ad which was placed to execute the plan illness researches was placed in wichita by mary sue and myself at the end of 1951 it was tremendously successful and would have continued successful if anyone else had wanted any success in wichita the very first person who applied for this ad immediately after test audit enrolled in professional course the second person at oncepurchased 75 hour intensive and so it went if i merely wanted fortune out of scientology and did not desire the health of scientology itself and the good presence and skill of its auditors i would long since have abandoned research leaving things just as they were and would have continued to run this ad and run clinic and school to care for its resultant callers the exact wording of the ad was as follows polio victims research foundation investigating polio desires volunteers suffering from the after effects of that illness to call for examination at address when the people arrived usually with phone interview first they were immediately given about three hours of auditing the techniques in use at that time were effort processing and overt acts and motivators we alleviated the majority of preclears reporting using only those three hours we did this for polio victims arthritics and were about to do it for asthmatics when the surging success of the project frightened various individuals who had other plans for dianetics however there was protest whatever from the newspapers the public or the preclears the auditing was given free of charge it was given under the guise of investigation and was in actuality research project any auditor anywhere can constitute himself as minister or an auditor research worker in the field of any illness in that he is not offering to treat or cure the illness but is strictly investigating it the laws concerning medicine do not obtain to him anybody even ditchdigger can look over polio or arthritis or asthma or anything else it is best that minister representing himself as charitable organization which is what he is do the research so that the ad would then read polio victimsa charitable organization investigating polio desires to examine several victims of the after effects of this illness phone soandso the interesting hooker in this ad is that anyone suffering from lasting illness is suffering from it so as to attract attention and bring about an examination of it these people will go on being examined endlessly the technique which would be used today would be with the repair and remedy of havingness appertaining to the illness or injury itself invent problem that leg or arm or lungs or stomach could be to you one would use only this process as it is the only safe process to use against chronic somatic and successfully alleviates such one would never use what problem could lameness condition be to you always run the process of problems on the subject of terminals never on conditions of course one would repair the havingness of lame legs and eventually get the individual to throw bad leg away if the preclear could not at once invent one would have him lie about legs or stomach or arms or whatever is affecting him one would use up at the most about two hours of auditing time on each case he would not tell the person he was doing other than investigating the cause he would tell them he was not interested in curing their polio but that educationally he could of course improve their ability to walk or breathe or whatever as side comment one would omit arthritis as one of these quickies as it showed the lowest level of recovery one would then follow up the same principles of group he would compose group of such people and he would find that they would be very happy to gather together from this group he would tell them they could have free group processing and he would sell them individual auditing and would teach them basic scientology and basic course as in plan 1 above this plan has the advantage of not unduly exciting the press but if the press were to arrive one would simply tell them expanded the subject of the ad minister investigating polio would have many reasons to do so he would want to know how much of drain the illness really was on the society around him what charitable resources were necessary in order to care for it how much difficulty it was to people in the immediate family he would want to know whether or not it was major or minor factor in the society but basically he would want to get his hands on those preclears and alleviate their condition in other words improve their ability to walk or to breathe he would want to do this and he would carry the project along by having group and from this group getting basic courses remember today it is fantasy whatsoever that you can alleviate the majority of sufferers of various chronic illnesses it is very simple thing really we have been able to do it for four years and very good auditors have been doing it regularly for five we are not in the business of healing here we are in the business of educating people to walk to talk to breathe incidently although it has not been tried it may be possible to get people from various societies however the basic experience on this line is that societies for various illnesses aswell as other organizations do not exist by and large to assist the illness and are very hard to do business with as an example one auditor in the pacific northwest did not contact the public or individuals but contacted only various organizations in the city there has never been quite as great flop as the general practice of this auditor contacting the public via ads in the public presses is the reliable tested way to do this the other of course can be touched upon as it is not necessarily true that these societies will not furnish people method number 3 has the advantage of requiring little capital and being highly ambulatory plans 1 and 2 above require enough money to have decent consulting room even if its only ones living room and to place ads which can come to considerable amount plan 3 casualty contact is reverse vector every day in the daily papers one discovers people who have been victimized one way or the other by life it does not much matter whether that victimizing is in the manner of mental or physical injury it does matter that the newspapers have full parade of oddities in terms of accident illness and bereavement occurring at constant parade before the eyes the essence of casualty contact is good filing and good personal appearance one takes every daily paper he can get his hands on and cuts from it every story whereby he might have preclear he either has the address in the story itself or he gets the address as minister from the newspaper as speedily as possible he makes personal call on the bereaved or injured person it is probable that he will find on the first day that they are overly burdened with calls since they have been subject of the public press and he may find that in two or three days interest in the person has cooled off to point where his own appearance will admit of an actual interview he should represent himself to the person or the persons family as minister whose compassion was compelled by the newspaper story concerning the person he should then enter the presence of the person and give nominal assist leave his card which states exactly where church services are held every sunday and with the statement that much fuller recovery is possible by coming to these free services take his departure great many miracles will follow in his wake and he is liable to become subject of the press himself however in handling the press he should simply say that it is mission of the church to assist those who are in need of assistance he should avoid any lengthy discussions of scientology and should talk about the work of ministers and how all too few ministers these days get around to places where they are needed he should use the opportunity to castigate not to hold classes on scientology some small percentage of the persons visited or their families will turn up in his group thus he will build group and naturally from that group he will get great many individual preclears all three of the above plans have the frailty of going through their pioneering period and then dwindling off the auditor backlogs great many cases and individual appointments and stops his forward thrust into the society itself the thing for him to do if he is building practice too big for him to handle is to write the academy or the hasuk if he is in england and have some likely young scientologist newly graduated sent to him to assist him he should not cease to fire with his ad or with his calls and should not cease to build his group this is question of how much is havingness to an auditor auditors seem to get terribly well satisfied on three or four regular preclears now my idea of real congregation would be one which you had to hold in motion picture theatre on sunday morning at least 2000 people and my idea of good practice is one which has to be handled by about dozen auditors and which is complete with receptionist mailing clerks and deep rugs in the auditing rooms and in the halls this is purely consideration of havingness in doing any one of the three above plansand i am doing one of the above i right this momenti would consider my own mission the completing of the communications or the investigating of the polio victims and the continuous outward flow of interest of scientology and i would stack up the appointments and do them when i could i would not build up group and consider that was big enough stop putting the ad in the paper and then relax for about three months later i would find out that all interest had dwindled and ceased and that the word of mouth going through the preclears i had had was bringing in only trickle of new pcs i wouldnt go at it with fire and thunder for few weeks and then quit in other words i would set it up as regular routine activity and carry forwardone of the side plans to plan 2 was to have another person good at finance go around to all those who had been helped by the investigation and tell them that their investigation which helped them was paid for by another person and ask the present person whether or not he wouldnt like to pay for somebody elses recovery but this was never put into effect although it may be very workable out of these three plans above can come large and vital practices only remember this they must be carried out within the framework of the dissemination of materials otherwise the failure of indiscretion of one may bring about cancellation of the good efforts of others the thing to do is to take one of these plans and carry it forward they are all good they will all work they have all been tested they are listed in order of workability as above 1 2 and 3 i can tell you the wrong thing to do about practicedo nothing these will work and success is

pabs with this the 72nd pab we enter new format and step up its production to double that which it has been from now on you will be receiving your pabs weekly instead of every two weeks i have gained great deal of important data during recent weeks and i will be sending this out to you every seven days there will also be more organizational information in future pabs than there has been in the past and this will keep you informed of the activities of your associations the importance of havingness careful study of staff auditors reports reveals that the only advances worthy of the name of scientology occur when the auditor repairs or remedies havingness on the preclear without the repair and remedy of havingness real gains become apparent preclear will not progress when his havingness is impaired what are the symptoms of loss of havingness running any asising techniques the preclear may become anaten or he may become slightly nervous or agitated or want cigarette or seem to break out of the session in some fashion in either case he is down on havingness in other words he has burned up used up or asised too much of his physical body energy in the auditing itself in view of the fact that every subjective technique puts sort of hole in the middle of the electronic mass surrounding preclear parts of that mass then begin to cave in on the preclear thus running an asising technique on preclear beyond the ability of the preclear to sustain the consequent loss of havingness will bring on in the preclear many new engrams which he did not have before and technique which asises energy if used without repair or remedy of havingness will bring about worsening of the case of preclear now exactly what is happening is very simple preclear starts to go anaten and the auditor keeps on running the process he hasnt realized that he ought to interrupt process at any time if the preclear demonstrates loss of havingness anaten is such demonstration of loss of havingness all right another example the preclear becomes agitated or upset he reaches for cigarette he begins to twitch his foot begins to wobble he begins to talk excitedly he begins to cough while being audited all of these things demonstrate loss of havingness these same conditions by the way can result from the preclear believing that the auditor has broken the auditors code in some fashion or has overcome his power of choice both repair and remedy of havingness are immediately indicated on the observation of anaten or agitation on the part of the preclear and in addition the auditor should carefully go over the session itself to find out if anywhere the preclear believed his power of choice was being overcome or if the preclear believed the auditors code had been broken you understand that the auditor didnt necessarily have to overcome the preclears power of choice or break the auditors code in order that the preclear should believe that this has happened however this could be overlooked entirely if the auditor had been careful enough to repair or remedy the havingness of the preclearthe slightest drop of alertness on the part of the preclear or the slightest agitation or somatic on the part of the preclear should immediately indicate to the auditor that havingness has dropped and must be immediately repaired or remedied great deal of time can be spent on the subject of repair and remedy of havingness and it is very beneficial time spent it is better to waste time spent repairing and remedying havingness than to blunder on through now there is another thing i have noticed with regard to this auditors are running these days toward cognition very well if they expect preclear to cognite they should not expect him to pull in bank upon himself if an auditor runs very obvious process which should bring the preclear toward cognition and if he runs it several auditing commands and then stops and repairs and remedies the preclears havingness and then after that asks him the same auditing question two more times he will discover that he has blown cognition into view in other words you could remedy the havingness of preclear while his mind was on one particular subject and bring cognition into existence this becomes particularly important today since few months ago i discovered that you could remedy the havingness of anybody and i mean just that you can remedy anybodys havingness and you can turn on mockups on anybody the fact that the preclear who has black field can be caused to mock up blacknesses or invisibilities and shove them into his body brings us into an era of being able to make anybody turn on mockups getting the preclear to postulate that the mocked up blackness is bad for the body will cause that blackness to snap into the body by getting the preclear to postulate that the invisible mass he has mocked up is bad for the body it will snap into the body of course after this has been done few times the consideration of the preclear will change then perhaps the blackness or invisibility will only snap in when the preclear postulates that it is good for the body he may also have residue left it is very important to get rid of these repair and remedy of havingness residues by various postulates such as that the residue is threat to the body it is good for the body it is bad for the body the residue too will snap in lets differentiate at once here the difference between repair of havingness and remedy of havingness we used to call repair of havingness giving him some havingness it needs better technical term therefore let us call this repair of havingness it means having the preclear mock up anything he can mock up and in any way it can be done get him to shove never pull that mockup into the body and by similar means to get rid of the residue which went along with the mockup that is repair of havingness it is oneway flow it is an inflow now remedy of havingness is getting him to mock up and shove into the body enough masses to bring him to point where he can eventually throw one away in other words repair of havingness is simply having him mock up things and having him shove them into the body and remedy of havingness is having him mock up and shove in and throw away the same type of mockup remedy of havingness is always superior operation to repair of havingness repair of havingness is very crude stopgap but can be used any time however preclear who is working well and on whom havingness can be remedied should at all times have his havingness remedied not repaired in other words any type of mockup should be both shoved into the body and mocked up and thrown away and this should be done in considerable quantity until the preclear is quite relaxed about that particular type of mockup one does this remember every time the attention of the preclear drops or he becomes agitated there is one other little point connected with this which is quite important and that is auditors very often audit preclear into an area of time when the preclear exteriorized this on preclear who does not exteriorize easily brings on considerable grief and sadness the way to get rid of this is of course to remedy the preclears havingness or only repair it and to ask the preclear to recall times when he was not exteriorized this will bring up at once times when he did exteriorize and where fear of exteriorization was built up considerably i have noticed another special condition regarding this exteriorization phenomena which is quite important preclear will occasionally repair and remedy havingness up to pointwhere the body disappears for him he doesnt quite know where to put the mass he has mocked up since he cannot find the body this is particularly true of preclears who have very low threshold on havingness an auditor would be stupid indeed to simply plow along beyond that point where the preclear has already said that he couldnt find any body to push any havingness into the moment the preclear does that the auditor should suspect that the preclear has gotten into an exteriorization type incident it is not however necessary that he immediately flounder around and try to find this incident as recommended in the paragraphs just above he can also repair and remedy havingness in this fashion and it is very important to know this although it is disastrous for preclear to be asked what could your body have since he will simply strip the bank of various old facsimiles it is very very good repair of havingness to ask preclear what is there around this room area which your body could have and then have him pick out specific objects in the environment which he says the body could have if he does this he will come up the gradient scale of havingness and his havingness will be repaired immediately or directly on the sixth dynamic with preclear who cannot get mockups and where the auditor has either been too clumsy to get the preclears mockups turned on or it really was impossible more or less the preclears havingness can be repaired by having him do this process so this is very very important process and one that ought to go down in red letters this whole subject of repair and remedy of havingness and its effect upon auditing and the fact that it has not been stressed at all in training being up there at level six in the old basic processes brings us to slp issue 8 the entirety of level one in slp 8 will be devoted to the repair and remedy of havingness in slp issue 7 we have great many phenomena associated with the remedy of the bodys havingness the reason for their position is to bring about an adjustment of the condition of the body before one goes on to other and more complicated ways of processing now in issue 8 all of these various things will be retained but they will be paralleled with complete remedy of havingness and that particular level of slp will be gone over in actual experience it is better to remedy the havingness of preclear matter where he is on the tone scale and matter by what process than to run any significant process further if preclear cannot at least repair his havingness to run waterloo station is to invite disaster because in this particular process of level two he is liable to get himself into down havingness situation and of course will not be able to notknow anything he may be chewing up too much energy while trying to notknow thus we would have the failures which have occasionally occurred in waterloo station they were simply havingness failures not failure of waterloo station further there has been new command suggested for waterloo station what would you be willing to notknow about that person this seems to be better command at least for the british isles we also take care of the vacuums and separatenesses and everything else with repair or remedy of havingness and running it in with certain other things such as problems etc when we discover by twoway communication weak universe we could then ask the individual preclear invent problem that person weak universe could be to you then watching him very carefully and repairing his havingness on the subject of that persons possessions get very rapid separation of universes i have noticed that the weak universe first began when the person elected by the preclear to be weak universe first began to put mest anchor points around the preclear in other words valuable presents i am as pleased as can be to get finger on this point and i know doggone well that if east west north and south will begin to repair and remedy havingness and stop specializing in significances without repair or remedy of havingness we are going to start shooting people up to the top of these psychometric graphs we cant help it let call your attention specifically to the old phenomena of the emotional scale and the engram we found out that when one engram was keyed in it fixed the emotional tone of theindividual then we had him run this and as he converted the engram to usable havingness we found that his tone rose we discover on these psychometric charts that the unhappy section does not move if we dont change the mass of the preclear sacrifices the latest news from the research front has to do with the fact that the ge demands and requires and has to have evidently sacrifices the ge does not run on an overt actmotivator sequence which makes one suspect he is not thetan ge runs exclusively on being sacrificed to if you have the preclear mock up sacrifices to the ge you will find these become very readily assimilated on lower level the body accepts motivators as soon as it is through this motivator band it accepts sacrifices and finally comes up to point where it will accept live bodies when one considers that eating is entirely matter of absorbing death one sees this death hunger in processing by running sacrifices person who had bad legs should have sacrifice of legs run on him and so forth this is astonishing material it is almost unbelievable that the ge will not be sacrificed to anything but will only be sacrificed to and this phenomenon that the ge is thereby demanding death tells us at once that the atomic bomb will be used and that there are people in the world who will actually crave this sacrifice of cities and even nations aside from being fantastically workable process more of which anon this matter of sacrifices tells us at once great deal about the future there will be moral restraint where the atomic bomb is concerned for about the highest level in some areas of the world as to case is operating ge this tells us too why soldiers will go to war this explains great deal of conduct the ge evidently operates on the postulate that as long as anything else is alive it cant live however it is becoming more and more doubtful that there is any more life in the body than the thetan puts there and that the body is single machine operating on some implanted postulates contained in the energy masses which are activated by the thetan somewhat on the order of the old pole theta trap many of these considerations can be changed around rather easily nothing changes them quite so fast as these sacrifice processes in mocking up sacrifices the auditor should use all the skills of creative processing and ensure that the preclear is actually mocking up and is not dragging in old facsimiles from the bank and restimulating genetic line incidents this can be obviated by having the persons in the mockups dressed in modern clothing mocking up the incident as happening tomorrow altering the mockup in some manner such as turning the face green or something of this nature any reasonable way in which you can ensure that you are dealing with mockups and not past track facsimiles this gives auditors another tool with which to handle chronic somatics chronic somatics there is another process which has great deal of workability with chronic somatics i know that some months ago and earlier than that it seemed rather fatal to us to continue to fixate the preclears attention on the chronic somatic but that is not problem with us right now it ceased to be problem the moment i invented an auditing command exactly as follows invent problem that leg arm nose eye body could be to you running this command which is in itself sort of remedy of havingness and repairing and remedying the havingness of the preclear as we go we will discover that practically any and all phenomena associated with the service facsimile will come away and clear up and the limb nose or eye will get well this can be used as word of warning only on actual terminals never use this command and i mean never on actual conditions never askhim to invent problems lameness could be to him never ask him what problem blindness could be to him lameness and blindness are conditions we want to know what problems legs or eyes can be to him since legs and eyes are terminals in running this command we reduce havingness too rapidly whenever we are stressing conditions therefore we run it only on terminals in running it use only terminals handled in this way we do have the answer as of this moment to chronic somatics with these processes in slp and the adequate repair and remedy of havingness we can push our preclears right up through the top lets get to work l ron hubbardpab 74 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office brunswick house 83 palace gardens terrace london w8 _____________________________________________________________________ 6 march 1956 office in ireland well hello there how do you like your pabs coming to you once week what really happened was that i felt that i was getting out of communication with people and as i was getting out information under heading called operational bulletins it seemed to to be good idea to use these as pabs if you remember many years ago when the pabs started they were dedicated to setting up auditors and making them healthy and respected class of professionals and so with issue 72 we immediately and abruptly resume this intention through this particular medium in other words the pabs were dedicated to this in the first place and they go on now doing their best for the auditor when the queen asked to tip my cap and leave england as an insidious and communist influence intensely disrupting the very best plans of the home secretary i might have gone straight back to america however the founding church of scientology in washington dc has never been in better shape with his nibs as executive administrator the situation is under good control with ken barrett running the best academy classes that have been seen in the past year and julia lewis doing bangup job at the clinic with john sanborn teaching indoctrination and dick steves rolling an hca class in good shape and keeping the washington politicos at bay and with don breeding getting an intensive things could never be better i have habit of turning up where i am needed or turning up data when it is needed and as england is not yet in perfect shape there at notting hill gate and as enough british brass has interceded on my behalf to permit on occasion to pop into london it seemed to that i had better spend my time setting up an emergency station for scientology in country that wasnt likely to get atom bombed so here i am in dublin eire ten days and one completed office in operation deep the irish spring shows signs of being late and we were freezing lately with the rest of you even though we have pretty and snug home here in the outskirts of dublin in fashionable suburb susie and the three kiddies are well and happy and the kids after being cooped up in london apartment most of the winter are staggered and stunned at huge yard to play in and are exuberant and boisterous along with the irish wind downtown in the most fashionable square and professional address in dublin we now have two large suites of offices the address is 69 merrion square south just across from one suite and just next door to the other is the american embassy in ten days with the assistance of bernie green we took an old spacious set of offices and painted them laid in new linoleum bought the 101 small items necessary to running things and exactly seven days from my landing had going concern we have two pretty irish girls and smart irish office boy and that lovely canadian margarettousaw and the ubiquitous dr green during part of last week mike walker the english shipping department was over here helping out and what with american irish canadian english and texan we are quite international eleven days from my landing we have somewhere between fifty and hundred and fifty applicants for course practically none of the applicants having previously heard of scientology all this sounds too fast and exaggerated but it is factually and precisely true what i am trying to do is this i am trying to pilot project in an area not previously noted for scientology interests which can serve as model for an auditor in any area of the world just to see how it is done and to pick up pointers as ireland has only 3500000 people in the total nation you can see that i am working in relatively small population area which is at the same time noted for its poverty i am of course taking advantage of the peculiar features of the place such as the fact that the major export of ireland is people and am making all the shots count however we have hurricane of activity going here without previous preparation i am having to write all the little brochures enrollment cards descriptions and etceteras which are handed out and i am packaging all the course materials and slants of the subject and all this material is being shaped up so that it can be packaged not only for the public in ireland but for the use of auditors elsewhere accordingly as soon as i am satisfied with this material and have the envelopes printed i shall send one package of it one of each piece to every auditor in scientology if the weather is cold the irish heart is warm the country and the people could not be improved upon unlike communistinfiltrated england where russia has been active with antiamerican propaganda in order to rob the crown of its only powerful ally to ready later banquet for the russian bear ireland is enthusiastically pro american lacking things to fight the irishman has been shooting up communism quite enthusiastically and so we dont even find the medical profession here antipathetic to scientology its all good roads and good weather probably the greatest oddity of the irish adventure is that aside from one years office rent some transportation and shipping expenses and small loan from london the entirety of the operation will be supported by mary sues and my salary from the founding church in washington as these two salaries amount to slightly less than 200 week you can see that the irish operation is not big in terms of staff or offices however pay is very low in this area and rent is quite cheap we can then support this activity for some time but strangely enough without actually paying any of our bills yet aside from office rent and couple of other items we have income in sight adequate to take care of the activity it does the old heart good to see people swinging in toward scientology at this rate i could always get an operation started and get things wheeling but we have made so much progress in technology and knowhow in the past few years and since i last had to start anything from scratch that i had not realized the pulling power of scientology itself i could be very mean at this point and say that if we have within eleven days of my landing hundred and fifty people lined up for course who have never before heard of scientology that somebody somewhere in some group or another has been loafing like hell i might also say that the bulk of the calluses collected in the field must be on private portion of peoples anatomies not on their palms and thumbs for this operation has not in any way depended upon my own identity and reputation it is scientology itself and what it can do that is creating the stir ireland being somewhat out of the way has not heard my name furthermore public lecture has been given in order to attract people in and other mechanism or device has been used that would be peculiarly mine except perhaps the ability to know how to do things and to make words work effectively so i am sitting here at this moment wondering why there arent eight to ten thousand member groups under the charge and control of every auditor since there would certainly be fifty thousand member group directly under the dublin office within five months if i continue the experiment in earnest perhaps the main difference here is complete security on my own behalf as far as scientology information and capability is concerned and the fact i willfreely admit that our auditors all too often lack initial financing capital the dublin operation duplicated in any large city would cost about 80000 done up well the 800 including the living expenses of the auditor and his while he got going however 80000 is not very many preclears so it seems to that an auditor could have immediately gotten some preclears and done some auditinguntil he had 800 or 1000 and then could have launched into wider operation on this pattern or he might have talked his friends out of an investment in his venture this i say with perhaps superiority of knowhow and ideas would be the chief difference in starting up the dublin operation and somebody starting an operation say in chicago well i could say all these things and it would be very mean of so i wont say them i will simply go on shaping this mockup up until i have gained as much knowhow out of it as possible and will let you have blowbyblow account of how it happened what you should know first is that the irish adventure is your adventure being conducted on your behalf to help you square away scientology in your area and put you on easy street and what is more important to the rest of us to put mankind in position of selfdefense for the first time on planet confronted with atomic fission the atomic fizzle wouldnt it be very funny if the moguls and high muckymucks of the higher insane wards of government were to have their favorite threatatomic fissionturn into an atomic fizzle this would be the joke of this or any other century because were all professionals here well schooled in scientology let talk little bit about past track this is not the first time that planet has been threatened by the development of atomic technologies it is on the past track many places and times that planets have been scorched and made uninhabitable to all forms of life this tells us as we read our emeter that life is capable of abandoning planet and going to another planet setting up the painful process of making lichens and moss to make soil out of the stones and building gradient scale on up to moving beings atomic energy has always been tragedy atomic radiation burns savagely and furiously and life so burnt in this age and time then is incapable of procreating in other words an atomic burn hits mainly at the second dynamic the reason it does is the number of times planets have been wiped out in the past when atomic radiation came all procreation became pointless the genetic line was overended and done there was use making new cells or new babies there was future into which they could go thus the appearance of radioactivity tends to aberrate the second dynamic its actual use brings about total apathy on procreation radiation first and foremost when it burns is effective simply because the hemoglobin longer makes new cells and so person dies of acute anemia the blood cells are it is true the most cowardly of all the body cells blood cells lake into the center of the body in moment of fear or terror they give up quickest when struck by atomic radiation i have been conducting series of experiments one of them almost fatal to myself on the auditing of radiation burns i have found that we can make an enormous effect upon radiation burns and can cure them in milder form that means we are the only agency the only people on the face of earth who can cure the effect of atomic radiation i expect to make further progress in this direction and the whole answer is not yet gained for the whole answer would be to actually proof body against radiation itself it is rather foolish to believe that flash of light which actually goes through and is not stopped by ten feet of concrete can yet do things of hideous magnitude to body that is all that alpha and gamma and the rest area flash of light there must then be some cooperation on the part of the body to stop the flash which is not present in concrete true newspaper held before the body interposed between it and an atomic flash can keep the body from being severely burned but remember the actual destructive rays do actually go on through the newspaper and unless stopped by the body itself would go on through the body on suchreasoning i began to experiment to discover what the body was doing in connection with atomic radiation and discovered that it was actually stopping it i found out further the procreative aspect of atomic radiation came about because atomic radiation on the early track was used as punishment mechanism at first it appeared that atomic radiation was the basis of the second dynamic and its various wavelengths but this is not true they were so identified because radiation was used in second dynamic punishments and activities radiation is the only thing capable of reaching into the mockup strata of thetan and on this high wavelength knocking apart his bank there are many black fives around whose black screens are actually radiation hunger on the basis that the only havingness difficulty is under the heading of not enough i caused atomic radiation to be wasted until the thetan could accept it the difficulty was trying to operate with radiative mockups in the vicinity of bodies evidently the thetan has to change his mind very thoroughly before the body can be coaxed into letting radiation pass by the body is apparently anxious for radiation punishment since it then longer has to continue genetic line the problem on which i am working is the actual proofing of body against damage from bomb flash that is between us auditors to publication however it is actually factual that we are the only people who can do anything to alleviate or cure atomic fission serums or other mechanisms have proven effective the most effective means of cleaning up radiation or radioactive dust in an area is the common water hose that is the high tide of antiradiational research in scientology using standard procedures and including in them an address to radioactive masses we can cure by remedying havingness with it radiation burns indeed it requires very skilled piece of auditing with great deal of havingness remedy but we can do it now i want you and by that you i mean you not general editorial you to send at once any article in whatever publication or any book or pamphlet of whatever simple or complex nature you have know about and can get to here at the scientology emergency station address scientology 69 merrion square s dublin ireland please send as well any horror material you have i do not even have copy of john herseys book on hiroshima or any newspaper accounts on it you can help by taking upon yourself personally the responsibility of being the only person who is going to send any material here as ireland is well removed from any such threat the material extant at this point is very poor i need this material in order to draw upon it for book this book will be called atomic burns their danger cure and prevention and it will be we hope in all the major book stores of the world and will be i assure you translated into the various languages you see the most frightening aspect of atomic radiation is that it is the very most basic ingredient in insanity and people close to it handling it or restimulated by it can be better than totally insane you see the threat we are up against now it may well be that the us atomic energy commission outlawed psychiatrists from its ranks and precincts simply because these who do at least know insanity when they see it might have been urging institutionalization of every leading atomic scientist on grounds of paranoia megalomania and other psychotic symptoms my own experience with these people would confirm it the atomic scientist in the world today on grounds of security is removed from any skilled mental observation of any kind whatsoever nobody knows whether they are sane or not researches demonstrate that the stuff they are handling would bring about insanity in them in very short order light look at the subject demonstrates that they have craving for the destruction of all life they are totally careless and conscienceless when questioned on the subject of destruction of men women and children in cities they are equally conscienceless concerning the injury of their fellow workers symptom of this insanity visible to us every month or so from enid oklahoma is man who was for long while closely connected with atomic energy and who between attacks on scientology has horrible writhings concerning his own sanity and alternates attacksupon his auditor with grovelling begging to be relieved of the awfulness of his life nothing could be done for this man previously in scientology as research had been done on the peculiar aberration from which he was suffering overdoses of radiation received while an observer at eniwetok the screens which covered his vision were radiation hungry one auditing him connected his past experience with atomic energy and his case since it was not known that there was any relationship so we have had at least one case in our own midst demonstrating various types of insanity simply by reason of having been connected with atomic energy earlier in his career there may be others we know now that these surrender as cases if by auditing they are brought to create and destroy radiative masses in mockups it is however very dangerous piece of auditing and must be done very gently you may by the way have wondered why i never really attacked this particular vilifier in oklahoma it was only that i was aware of the fact that his case was unsolvable and that scientology had indeed failed him and because i felt sorry for him i am not the sort of fellow to kick dog when he is down and i knew what desperate shape that person was in i am rather relieved now to know exactly what was wrong in his case and sometime or other an auditor can be sent down there but if we have been caused lies and upsets in our own ranks by the side effects of atomic radiation then imagine what it would do when close up against government which is being advised on atomic matters by persons who have long since passed the sanity point therefore it looks like thee and have some work to do fortunately scientology is already well entrenched in many atomic energy areas and many atomic scientist connections know of it and the materials which are developed concerning radiation cure can of course be applied to this particular problem with considerable benefit well all entheta aside please get that material to fast immediate cash for auditors associate memberships are now available for sale by auditors to their groups the associate member is member without time limit of scientology an associate member does not receive publications but does receive pin and membership card an associate membership costs five shillings in the united kingdom and areas under the london office and one dollar in the united states the auditor can purchase from the organization the pin and application form already assembled in lots of 25 with brooch backs or button backs for two shillings and sixpence in the uk and its areas or fifty cents in the us the auditor sends in to the uk 326 to scientology 69 merrion square s dublin eire he will receive in return 13 buttonback and 12 broochback pins mounted on application cards an auditor in the us can send 1250 to scientology washington or for quicker delivery at this stage to in dublin eire and he will receive the same lot the auditor then sells these associate memberships to anyone but we hope to people who are taking or have taken basic course he keeps the totality of his receipts the person to whom he sells the pin and card fills in the application form addressed to the organization provided with the card and has returned to him at once his membership card the total clerical work on the part of the auditor is sending the order here receiving and directly selling the card the associate member newly made by the action is the one who sends in his application this makes for minimal bookkeeping the pin is the lovely little sanddoubletriangle pin designed by bob hollanbeck in phoenix arizona some of you have already seen them the design was taken originally from the dust wrapper of science of survivals earliest editionsarrangements will be made at later date for the sale of subscriptions to our improved publication line for general and special memberships all of which can assist the auditor in financing his activities in scientology the reason we want this membership to be widespread in existence is that the power of an organization is counted by the number of members it has we must have membership class which includes everybody and which permits people to be in doubt as to whether they are with us or not particular oddity of the associate membership card is that it is not renewable it has termination date and does not expire every year it might be good thing if some other classes of members also became associate memberships if they have any fear of lapsing since they would at least be an associate member at all times this however would not bring them publications or services you must be aware that at this price we are actually selling the card and pin at the actual cost of production as this is announced the manufacture of the pin and card is already arranged and in the works acts of god perils of the sea or strikes could delay the filling of your order for few days but this is only an eventuality and by the time your order gets here the pins should be ready to ship to you as point of incidental interest i just happen to have by accident in my jewel box where i keep the keepsakes of value that people often send from various parts of the world the original solid gold sdoubletriangle pin made by bob hollanbeck he sawed this out for personally as gift in phoenix last year if i owe him anything for copying it for everybodys benefit i wish he would let know since i dont have his address here in dublin there was another slightly smaller sanddoubletriangle pin made and issued from phoenix year ago but it was not from this handmade design of hollanbecks which he intended for my personal wear by the way bob hollanbeck will make you mexican tietie with the s and double triangle in solid silver and very beautiful for i think 15 when i have his address i will insert it in pab auditor income from basic courses all auditors everywhere in good standing with the academy or london are authorized to teach basic course in scientology in its program of assisting the auditor to finance himself and the advance of scientology the central organizations will do all possible to assist him in the teaching of this course the course should be minimum of twenty hours including some eight hours of group processing and some twelve hours of instruction the instruction should be precisely cycle of action the 8 dynamics arc and what each element means the tone scale something about havingness and its relation to the tone scale and how to do an assist the principal stock in course should be the most elementary and should be repeated often so that everyone in the course actually knows these principles other material such as past track past lives thetans clears or any other data should be introduced into the basic course the essence of teaching basic course is to make sure that everybody in the unit understands very well these basic elements i am at work at this moment on basic course manual however you need not wait for itat the end of your basic course you should give an examination to all persons who were in it covering just exactly these points above and their definitions and uses you should then ship with the address of this person that examination paper to london or washington depending whichever is your most immediate area the central organization in london or washington will immediately execute if the exam was passed basic course certificate and send it at once either to you to give to your student or to the student directly as you indicate warning these certificates will not be sent unless the examination paper and the students address are included the organizations make charge for this service it is expected that basic course would cost at least 3100 in the uk or 1000 in the us it is also expected that this charge will be made and collected by the auditor and that the auditor will keep for his own uses and the financing of scientology in his area the totality of basic course fees the only way you are going to accumulate group that will stick with you and forward scientology is by teaching that group basic course group processing without training doesnt work we are very shortly going to publish book as possessing the only effective cure for atomic radiation known to man you will hear more about this later the best and first thing to do is to create large group and to teach it basic course lets get this one out of the way fast people are talking scientology and demonstrating its adequacy in their own spheres one of the ways of gathering groups for basic course is to teach for the first week something you will call free course and which contains perhaps four hours of auditing and six hours of instruction and give this free course to everybody but dont let anybody take the same free course twice and then simply continuing the free course on up into another twenty hours or two weeks covering these essentials much more precisely teach course that you charge for remember the organization does not care how much money you charge for this basic course it would actually be surprised if you did not charge at least five guineas or 2500 there are plenty of ways of accumulating groups for such basic courses you will learn these as i tell you more about the irish adventure in later pabs training cost change after years of alteration it may come as bit of startlement to announce that it will shortly be generally announced and is effective immediately that training costs and charges are changed in the central organization for five years the cost of professional course in the united states has been 500 in london the same course has cost you formerly 125 it is rather interesting how these two figures were arrived at the 500 fee was set by parker morgan in elizabeth new jersey at the end of may in 1950 parker morgan beseiged by requests of people who wanted to take closer look at dianetics invented status whereby that person could hang around the office and watch what was going on in the foundation as an intimate observer for one month for 500 there were ten in the first professional course the only chair case there was ted ottison recruited up from st marys college after few days i took pity on these ten since although they were interested they were getting very little knowhow and began to give them daily lecture and so started the first professional course in dianetics and scientology the figure was set in london at 125 because that was the cost of maintaining an instructor and quarters for minimum class of two students over period of two months and the general onemonth hangover of training as i could not stand by london forever and had idea that it would have many students it was necessary that the school remain solvent it was also necessary that central organization continue to exist and that needed financeactually the 125 charge was not too far in error since the london office just barely did remain solvent during my long absence in the us commie critics which exist in vast profusion swept scientology into its group propaganda about american dollars and was long active in pummelling this 125 fee as demonstrating that scientology was getrichquick scheme the actuality is that in both cases the central organization has to be maintained or auditing itself would go all to pieces everywhere and there would be way of disseminating new processes and that it takes far longer than month or two months or three months to train professional auditor he has to be trained by experience as well as formal instruction and the central organization always has the responsibility for this as an example in australia where an inadequate financing was done the hasi office has been in continual difficulty trying to maintain itself and as it has failed to maintain itself adequately the professional auditor in the area of melbourne has had rather hard time of it part of that squirrel cage of course is the activity of squirrels in the area who always reduce the effectiveness of scientology and blunt its progress unable to understand evidently that not everybody shares their own enthusiasm for kicking the bucket of course few of these squirrels were on the side of the allies during the late war they evidently didnt get their fill of death like the most of us who are more intimately connected with the hostilities squirrel has used these fees as target rather continuously but this is not the reason they are being changed because we can train an auditor today in the eight weeks allowed without having to pay for great deal of continued training thanks to the invention of the indoctrination week and dummy auditingof which i am quietly proudwe can actually afford to train now for less in the united kingdom we are going to extend us training into later retraining period and we are going to do several additional things for the us auditor than we have done before so the training cost will remain the same for considerable additional service in washington in london the fee is dropped to 75 in view of the fact that we have the basic course planned for auditors in the field and the shortness of distance in the uk rights to train to the level of hca or hpa will be issued in the united kingdom this is actually kindness since the grind of training auditors is not remunerative to the individual auditor and actually inhibits his income which should be much greater by reason of basic courses than it ever would be from teaching professional courses by our experience this is heightened by the fact that there has only been one application to train made to us in england which denotes field enthusiasm for professional training on its own behalf anyway in the united states all those rights to train which have been granted to auditors who have not at this date returned in full their percentages and fees to the central organization can be considered cancelled the organization will certify persons in training to such persons after this date but only those persons who are at this instant in training actually further persons should be enrolled as soon as auditors with these rights to train engage upon the basic courses they will understand that the teaching of basic courses is far more remunerative we have had nothing but complaints from auditors with individual rights to train concerning their difficulties with finance students do not pay them central organizations can cope with this fact but the individual auditor cannot it is beyond his means to train on charity or on the receipt of third or half of the professional course fee the central organization can struggle along with this or collect the chief reason the us fee is not dropped is because the auditor being trained now is going to be sent into specific areas and is going to have placed in his hands any and all literature he will need to start things booming and will be assisted by special mailings to the area concerning him from washington all of which takes money and which had better come under the course fee however as this service will cost about 150 the washington fee is actually reduced to about 350 to be available for the actual training we feel it is better in washington to collect the total fee and use part of it to give the auditor big push in the area assigned whenhe leaves than to leave it to his initiative to scrape up enough money to get the literature and material and make the mailings books in progress i am writing or have scheduled the following books 1 the elements of scientologybasic course manual 2 atomic burnstheir danger cure and prevention this is the one we mainly need the bookstore list for 3 scientologythe modern science of ability rewrite of dianetics the modern science of mental health abilities by the halfton each one of them defining word in scientology or pertinent to life actually here i am actually and factually in dublin eire there is terminal here there are some mailboxes and desks to receive your communication my body just now is in rather indifferent shape thanks to an auditing experiment on radiation but it nevertheless will sit in chair and hold your communication in its hands and read it over very carefully when you stamp on the floor or the street of dublin there is solid earth there and the wind blows and the air circulates and there are live people around and in short this is really terminal and your communication will be acknowledged at once if you write i will see if there is anything else i can think of to reassure you as to the communication formula the truth of the matter is the swarms of people around here arent scientologists and i am bit lonesome and you dont look around very good when i tap you on the shoulder so write letter and let know your reaction to associate memberships and teaching basic course and in turn every week i will keep you posted on the material from various parts of the world and in particular on the irish adventure which may win or losesee next weeks installmentand upon the progress of several other mockups

_____________________________________________________________________ 3 april 1956 administration number of vital lessons were learned in setting up and running the college here in dublin but they were not all on the subject of the college itself some of them were on the subject of scientology organization for six years now we have been stumbling across one horrible thing administration it has come out here in dublin that the majority of our troubles have been administrational not technical we scientologists have lot to learn about administration i have coded the following as vital bits of data on the subject administration is form of communication adequate administration consists of keeping certain communication terminals in place and making sure that the proper particles go to and through the proper terminals smooth organization consists of having terminal for each type of activity in which the organization is engaged there can be four or five activities to one terminal so long as three things are obeyed 1 the terminal itself has to know it 2 nearby terminals have to know it 3 distant terminals have to know it supervision of an organization consists of keeping the terminals in place and keeping the correct traffic particles and messages flowing to the right terminals and planning to adjust the communication flow either from outside in or from inside out all particles having to do with the exact business of the organization must be handled speedily particles which are not particularly germane to the organization come in anyway and can be more or less neglected terminals must also originate not just reply or report command lines must exist in an organization so people know who is boss but communication lines are not command lines contrary to the army psychosis communications need not flow up to and down from any command post terminals can and should operate independent of the command lines but they must keep the command position informed terminals can do two things wrong they can follow command lines with their communications they can fail to keep command informed filing invoicing having the proper forms can be as independently capable of ruining an operation if they are neglected as the most flagrant neglect of duty by terminalif orders are filling if the invoices are right if the files are kept if the forms are correct and available and if everybody knows his job and will do it an operation will have hard time failing tight and proper scheduling of classes appointments replies and comm origins can forgive lot of other things these things are stabilities if you want an atmosphere of stability have an atmosphere of precise punctuality if you have system follow it hound and harass it into line and keep it there but if you dont follow it junk it and find out what system you are following and make that then be the administrational system and keep it tightly in hand let be terribly accusative and personal if you have group or small group if your income is low if you are having hard time it is probably due to lack of good administration in your affairs not due to your knowledge or lack of charm you could be poor auditor and good administrator in your auditing affairs and still win you could be wonderful auditor and poor administrator and flop completely if you are overworked you are probably being overworked by bad administration the fault in administrational work is most intimate to the terminals involved in an administration if these are each one sound and working well youve won one terrible fact stands out in administrational work if the operation is not well planned the tendency is to add help we see this at its worst in governments these have equal in adherence to this system when they see something isnt running properly they add some more help when they still fail to run properly they add even more help at last you have government the totality of its activity seems to consist of correcting mistakes by adding rules and terminals to an already unworkable system the right way to go about this is to plan in advance put that plan to work refine the plan put that refined plan to work always on the most basic level saying always before one begins to build or reform what exactly is this outfit here supposed to do answer that question and then plan to make it so and then administer to keep it so and always ask the man on the job what the hell you should do to help him out never sit in some ivory tower and dream up reforms for the organization always get your hands dirty good executive gets his own communication lines running smoothly and then spends his time going around not giving orders but smoothing out peoples jobs eighty percent of most organizations are involved in handling the boohoos and nonsense of bad administration person who is minor terminal in an organization should know this too and should put the pressure on the big whiz to make sure the comm lines keep running straight now as to the personalities of personnel it is very true that there are always certain people in an organization poorly managed that the organization would be better off without these people always do two things 1 they shovel entheta and emergency at their foreman and the boss 2 they are always out of department with their squawks they are obsessive change highcritical cases on the personality analysis they wouldnt know good news if they had it dropped on them encased in safe they can only deal in bad news if it doesnt exist they obsessively make it up in the matter of being out of department they are incapable of doing things close to home the entirety of their real activity is fouling up other terminals while their own department goes to the devil show mans personal department and i will show you if he is in or out of department if the typing battery is always crying about invoicing youll find darned little typing going on its bad over there is the theme song the other type of case an organization cant afford is the cant work youre working too hard case when somebody starts on this one shoot him from guns these peoplethe entheta monger the out ofdepartment weeper the youre working too hard cannot be afforded by any organization and thats it they actively damage things sometimes beyond repair they are never of benefit to an organization or group i speak from bitter experience i assure you fire them if you cant audit them 75 hoursin scientology organizations today regardless of the work people do we long since fired all the 1 2 3s above including the most prominent us squirrels we give them 75hour intensives as fast as we have auditors available we do this because we can tailormake executives today if they slide bit we audit them bit more until weve got them up there and swinging hard at the real enemies of man our concentration right now is on administrational smoothness only in that way will we get the groups and auditors we need to knock out the enemypab 79 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office brunswick house 83 palace gardens terrace london w8 _____________________________________________________________________ 10 april 1956 the open channel besides having couple of other things to do in the last eight years i have been in search of an open channel for dianetics and scientology which would not run into large obstacles and which would thereby make it possible for organizations and auditors to outflow what we know to maximum with minimum of difficulty when you have to qualify and explain what you are doing continually you have only in that an obstacle since there was immediate forebear to dianetics and scientology there was cut groove in the society thus we have had to keep company with subjects in the public mind as ragtag as anything can getie psychology psychiatry and of all the drooling idiots i would never choose for bedfellows believe the psychologist and psychiatrist would be below my lowest list why because theyre fakes they come from long line of hoodwinks including such nobles as the priests of ra cagliostro and wundt why because they would take the pennies off dead mans eyes why because there are limits where gentleman stops and the oldtime hocuspocus of the mind just then began naturally then we ourselves would get slap from the same dank brush one of the principal everybody knows is everybody knows psychology and psychiatry are phoney now it is an oddity that if you accuse man long enough of being fake or robber or bum he tends to believe he might be one young auditor once told that he couldnt get over feeling he was robbing people when he processed them he was just running the counter effort of his environment in its effort to shut him down on scientology he was classed by his environment as psychologist or psychiatrist he even wore the beard at last and he squirreled bit why because everybody told him that he was fake and he at length had to accept it he thought ninety percent of the few auditors who have quit have all suffered from this association with psychologists and psychiatrists to point where they themselves thought they were phoniesand that therefore the organization and all connected with it must then be phonies in other words they were counterefforted into believing they were guilty even though theyd committed crime the open channel for which i have searched has been found i went over to dublin poor crossridden town and started up pilot operation in the charge of the redoubtable bernie green that operation has even chance of outincoming both the american and british offices it is bernies and hes got every chance of really pulling very steep hill were the american college duplicated in london and washington it would start making history fast why because it exploits an open channel which runs like good roads and good weather of which everyone is in favor without oppositionbehold scientology is that branch of psychology which treats of human ability old time wundtian psychology said that people could not change now that we can change people we have to call what we are doing something else than psychology they know what psychology is familiar word they immediately grasp this get tiny agreement then they are told gradient scale that oldtime psychology couldnt change people which they can verify in psychology texts and that we can follow this with discussion of iq and personality tests and then brush aside any thought of neurosis or psychosis as part of the picture with well i think we can all agree that any of us have room for improvement and youre off into something the person you are talking to can use if you can sell one person painlessly on scientology you can sell groups if you can sell groups you can sell the world i am often amused when somebody shifts one of my mockups aroundfor they very often do it on the basis of removing the motor washington recently published the above definition of scientology with subtle change scientology is that branch of wisdom which treats of human ability they changed the one thing vital in the sentence the listener is going to classify you as psychologist hes read about psychology in the comic strips he uses the word constantly its an agreement point you avoid the word entirely as did washington and you have 1 missed the agreement point and 2 invited him to retain an association not asised which will condemn you so changing one of these mockups around may make them non workusdeadus you say to anybody im scientologist scientology it is that branch of psychology which treats of human ability oldtime psychology believed you couldnt change anyones intelligence or personality so when we could we had to call it something else well i think youll agree that anyone could stand some improvement its fascinating that even morons can be made smart you know an average intelligence is about 108 well with little work scientologist can shift that to 120 or 130 you know make it possible for the person to tackle jobs he couldnt have understood before all were interested in is increasing business efficiency has lot to do with income fellow with an iq of 108 makes lets say 35 week hed be paid more if he was worth it we raise his iq to 120 and his pay goes up to 75 you know we dont need new business ideas or gimmicks all we need is some people who can carry on existing business efficiently for change take government i dont think lot of people in government are smart enough to understand their business id sure like to get my hands on some of these officials thats all agreement chatter its material which keeps your listener coming he knows and you never infer it that he could use this stuff scientology personally hed resent being told he needed psychiatry or psychology for that would infer he was crazy but when you talk about iq and rising pay and how stupid people can get businesses in trouble youre right in there on the agreement level now if you avoid psychology entirely you leave it to the listener to infer it and thereafter youre psychologist to him i wrote the above not off the cuff but straight out of experiences other people and myself have had with it theres countereffort alls well what you say goes home so without altering this carefully built mockup try it out now unless this mockup got you some action and scientology some attendance it would still be good so it has to be backed up with an organization such as business study group or scientology school of human efficiency or chicago school of personnel efficiency here the form of the mockup is looser but not too much so for that which the study group or school does is not altered the actual composition of the group may differ it may be that the auditor runs one in his living room three times week for an advanced course and three other evenings free course it may be that the auditor can afford to really put up college type mockup so the receipt point for the income of bodies may differ the entering wedge and the final curriculum neither one differwell weve advertised in help wanted columns and weve got some kind of mockup to receive bodies then what do we do we give free course six evenings in length if youre doing it in living room youll need two weeks for it at three week for the other three evenings will have to hold your advanced course in this course we teach cycle of action 8 dynamics saying we go up to the first third of the seventh and leave the remainder of 7 and all of 8 to the church and so sidestep religious arguments arc two different evenings and havingness we teach this course with precision giving our students precise definitions not generalities or discussions we come right down on each one of these and define hell out of it for our free course people we dont shillyshally around and avoid the subject of the evening we bowl them over in this free course we give just little look around the room type group auditing at two hours an evening for six evenings we have twelve lecture hours in free course only two or three should be processing periods and then gently gently when youve given this free course of six evenings you will then sell at the price that will gain you the most people and yet support the endeavor nice calculation that an advanced course of what does this advanced course consist ah that is again very precise it is an additional twentyfour hours of instruction broken into two periods of twelve hours each we will call the free course course for the obvious reason that the texts soon to be printed will start with text we will call the next twelve hours of instruction course b the third twelve hours course c thus the texts will be lettered the advanced course is composed of bc the texts for b and c respectively are science of survival and dianetics 1955 these shortened and rewritten will be text b science of survival complete with tone scale chart text c dianetics 1955 thus for the next twelve evening hours of lecture after the free course one lays heavily into the exact text and chart of science of survival then for the remaining twelve hours one teaches with exact precision dianetics 1955 why this division because you dont want to enroll an advanced course every other period every time you finish free course you will want to sign them up and continue them with pause or break if you pause let them hang for week or two before you get them to enroll youll lose them therefore you will be able to enroll every free course at once the students will step into complete twelve hours of instruction on either text b or text c thus student starting from scratch goes from text to text b to text c or goes from text to text c to text b if you have two rooms one for the free course and one for the advanced course you will then enroll people into the free course and into the advanced course every week you will enroll people into the advanced course from the free course as fast as they finish the free course by teaching the basics as basics by teaching the tone scale and communication just as we learned them youll bring people right on upstairs without overwhelming them if you just process them you worry them because you overwhelm them past their understanding youll get bigger iq rises by teaching this curriculum than you will by processing them in groups the same number of hours and youll have scientologists not preclears now how about individual auditing if all these classes are evening classes then you have lot of free daylight well strictly on businessefficiency mockup you make them more able with individual auditing you make it known to your classes that individual auditing can be had you say what it is you touch on illness only by stressing its absenteeism quality and its function in keeping them from getting better jobs you stress mainlythe handling of people selfassurance ability to work you sell them small quantities of auditing you patch up just what they want with old creative processing and havingness you charge them hourly rates you also offer medical checkup if you like there is something else you can do you can arrange with loan company to lend the person enough to pay for medical checkup by an md with which youve made an arrangement for their course and for individual auditing the loan company pays you in cash the studentpc pays the loan company by the week from his paycheck this of course has to be carefully greased and made painless but as the sum is small and as the people who come to you get salaries you will find loan company will be very happy to play ball the end product we already know is working person with higher iq and with poise the like of which employers havent seen lately teaching getting the confusion out of them always can be counted upon to up their confidence and poise and youll have scientologists well what people should you approach weve got some chaps amongst us who have bigshot complexes these fellows cant see themselves talking to people less than executives and would scorn talking to mere stenos let these poor fellows pound their shoes thin trying to sell the big companies all sorts of ideas on improving their help you going to and dealing only with stenos laborers clerks and the good solid workaday world with your group will win the auditor who still hangs around general sputters trying to get mr swivelbottom to buy course for his help will be in the anteroom yet while you own two square blocks on the main thoroughfare and have long since trained mr swivelbottoms help without his consent knowingness or caringness the big executives these days are about as progressive as last springs snail and have as much love for their people as fagin for oliver approach the little guy with helpwantedcolumn ads as close as you come to companies will be business colleges and tech schools which you will let hire you to lecture free course level to their students in their premises from these you will also get advanced course students because you can hand out your literature play ball with such people let them sell their courses in your school and let them sell their courses to include yours be real there are certain golden rules which will make your operation break it if you neglect them deliver what you promise schedule precisely the student is customer use business as motive and stress point in all examples and lectures now there are additional services you can offer if you can deliver them you can test for iq and personality and write letter to their boss about their improvement at course end you will wind up with huge employment roster you can work with employment offices dont be an employment office work with all other employment offices be an employment wholesaler to employment agencies for fee never retailer as thats profession in itself sell everybody an associate membership who comes to your free course sell everybody all his texts if you can thats added income and you may need it heres an open channel in the society nobody is really doing it not even carnegie the closest reach did this nobody balks good roads good weather or better business efficiency today and you can let the psychologist and pseudopsychologist stew in their own rather rancid juices and gibber around their shock machines and mice in their government financed prisons and go straight to hell whither they are bound without our knowing or caring are you going to help reach on this open channel you know you are problems and other plans were good but they arent as good as this one try it outnew materials i caught trafalgar square sized lion by the tail lately with new material new data and new slant weve gone upstairs further and we understand more and it doesnt undo what we know so youll soon have slp issue 8 real changes in steps 23456 most of what you already know in step 1 but boy what an increase hang on to your pro membership were just starting this game what do i think of auditors pabs will be sent airmail for 10 year extra thats the commercial for this issue every now and again somebody tries to get to say what i think of auditors they want to become hypercritical i guess so as to match the askers tone well i better make public utterance after all this time i think of auditors in rather intense way as i know more auditors than anybody else and have better basis for judgment on this subject i can be for once an authority my opinion of auditors in general is fairly well known to several people i think of an auditor as person with enough guts to do something about it this quality is rare and this quality is courageous in the extreme it is my opinion and knowledge that auditors are amongst the upper tenth of the upper twentieth of intelligent human beings their will to do their motives their ability to grasp and to use are superior to that of any other profession i think of an auditor as having initiative he is able to grasp or make mockup and put it into action auditors survive better than other people if this world has any faintest chance of surviving it will be not because i write but because auditors can and will think and do i think our auditors came from beings lately arrived on earth who seeing where it was going decided to band together to send it elsewhere i consider all auditors my friends i consider them that even when they squirrel i believe they have right to express themselves and their own opinions i would not for moment hamper their right to think i think of auditors and scientologists as the free people just as they consider one another their people so i consider them my people i think their errors of the past when they existed came about because we are new and we are finding out and i dont think any of their errors were intentional any more than mine were i can understand their own reactions because i can understand the countereffort given them by society and thus i dont hold auditors guilty even when they fold up but simply assume wed better make better effort into the society to overcome or bypass the counter efforti dont expect auditors or scientologists to instantly agree with or seize upon whatever i say i would be offended if they did and would feel they werent free people since they are intelligent i expect them to think over whats said try it and if its good for them use it that old auditors sooner or later come back to and use what i have discovered isnt any testimony to our relationship at all its only testimony to my being right because i meant to be right in the first place i sorrow when i see somebody accomplishing less than he should because he thinks i wouldnt approve of it in organizations and out i count upon initiative and good judgment the most decent people i have ever known have been auditors the best hearted people i know are auditors they are so decent and good hearted i have to work and argue with them to make enough to keep mockups rolling well thing they are now beginning to do i am very proud of scientologists i think theyre bright shiny beautiful people and im glad every one of them decided to get born again this time i think were fine crew i know we can make it and i know that if its better world in the future it will be because scientologists are what they are not what i made them now in case there are any further inquiries or doubts on the matter i assure you i have spoken on the subject and that i have spoken from the bottom of very experienced heart scientologists are the best people on each of the five continents and thats all there is to it writing schedule ive got my nose in my typewriter trying to steer clear of organizational work trying to get to you the books you need for courses and programs its kind of rough working without secretary but

_____________________________________________________________________ 17 april 1956 scientologys most workable process it is fitting that we give out scientologys most workable process in issue 80 of the oldest continuous publication in our sciences of dianetics and scientology we have been going with dianetics and scientology for very long time now according to our time continuum actually we have been going only tiny fraction of mans scientific time continuum the progress which we have made in the past few years is apparently greater than any combined progress of the preceding ages this may be due to our ability to capitalize on what is known it may be due to having been educated in both the eastern and western philosophies it may be due to being born with lucky slide rule in the mouth it may be due to the brightness and interest of everyone connected it may be due to lot of things but to whatever it is due it is true from condition noscienceofmind to condition scienceof mind has been achieved if you have any doubts about our starting condition noscienceofmind go get wundtian pseudopsychology text read darwin read the horrible confusions of locke hume spencer james if you care to so research you will find that they were trifle mixed up reading them now knowing as you do dianetics and scientology you can make some small sense from them in some places but if you delete your understanding of dianetics and scientology and then study them youll come upor rather go downstaggering the test was this by their tenets could these people make anyone smarter more sociable better able the test was also this by their talk of god and devil did other men in other fields understand anything of the human soul the hereafter well thats the way things were in the dark ages of 1949 now we can make men smarter better more sociable and yes more controllable now we do know about the hereafter and all the rest of it so something did happen in 1950 and something has been happening ever since and despite all our detractorsfor man detracts that which he doesnt understandand for all our rocky road we have attained higher than man ever attained before and thats the way it is very well then what is there in this already high mountain of attainment which is the highest gain amongst all this gold where is the supergold i dont suppose ill surprise you very much if i tell you you havent had the supersuper gold yet in fact i didnt have it myself until very recently and having discovered it ive been waiting smugly to know it little better and so give it to you ever since empirically the supergold you have had is havingness since havingness wasnt supersupergold for i could see that it itself was an aberration i continued to look for higher levels of entrance into the problem and so bypassedhavingness and even forgot about it for whilewith resultant case chaos when havingness is neglected cases do not improve thats all there is to it well amongst all havingnesses what is the supergold process there is one it is not very fast it is terribly certain it does not fail in our experience and its gains are permanent it is process known as the terrible trio given that an auditor can put the question acknowledge originate take care of originated comm and in general perform well all the primary auditing procedures as different than techniques and given that an auditor isnt simply trying to overwhelm the preclear the terrible trio can then pull up any case if run long enough you understand of course that any technique depends upon the procedure of auditing auditors who have techniques fail on them often are at fault in how they audit and matter how many thousand techniques were given them theyd still fail procedures are learned by dummy auditing for scores of hours on end then techniques work see weve even cracked that major problem of building insight and skill into the auditor the biggest variable of oldtime practices my how weve come along the terrible trio stole its name from three people in scientology united states against whom famous infamous organization recently stacked its combined talents and lost with violence the first terrible trio were sanbornbarrettsteves when i gave the triple havingness process to the staff auditors working under julia lewis in the hgc somebody there sensing its effectiveness dubbed it the terrible trio now i know all that is very informal as is this whole article but scientific papers as collected by the ford foundation and the department of sewage of new york are always supposed to have historical section to tell where it all came from and im simply being formal you see the commands of the terrible trio are look around the room and tell what you could have look around the room and tell what you would let remain and look around the room and tell what you could dispense with run as look around the room and tell with what you could dispense in boston and devon these commands are run in ratio it is not how long the process is run it is how long it requires to finally flatten each command so that any of the three could be run indefinitely without upset to the preclear the first ratio to be safe should be 20 times on the first command five times on the second and one on the third this ratio should then be improved gradually ie 10 8 and 2 then 10 10 and 4 at all times the auditor should watch for anaten or agitation the two as of auditing and if these occur he has gone too fast or has made in the preclears opinion code break of some sort if it isnt the fault of the ratio used its code break and one should say what have i done wrong to the preclear the pc may fish about for several minutes and finally recall that five minutes ago he felt repressed by the auditor in some way by advancing the ratio too fast is meant running the second question too long or the third question too long too many times without returning to the first which is the most innocent question however one can run the first too long without advancing the ratio only when the preclear can run any of these without consequence for many many times can one then be sure that the process is flat only when it is entirely flat inside room should one attempt to run it outside room for the great space of the outdoors on this process is staggering to preclear with chronic somatic the terrible trio run too soon outside can make preclear very illhere we have the most tested and vital process in scientology there are more advanced processes but they are not yet tested the terrible trio has always given gain in the auditing room properly audited it was the terrible trio which saved the day when staff auditors were fighting back to security in handling havingness for there was short period in the us when with havingness abandoned real gains were had condition which i had to explore fight and whip fast it must be remembered that the procedure of the auditor must be good before the techniques used by the auditor work uniformly well thus the terrible trio must be run with exact attention to the rudiments pc out of session even though being audited wont improve oddly enough this process can be selfaudited according to reports making it about the only selfauditing process possible outside of self analysis which still works well there you are bottom rung of dianetics found it will be good news to old dyedintheengram dianeticists who are still convinced that i really had something in dianetics that i havent forgotten them or the subject dianetics suddenly revived on discovery i made lately in an area where one would have thought further discovery was possible the entire subject of games brought to life some new material the recent brief resume in operational bulletin 17 on games is as important to us as it is brief it tells us that there is central motif on any dynamic which indicates the difference between selfdeterminism and pan determinism one is master of any game which he can give nonpartisanship in other words to play both sides he is committed to any game selfdeterminism in which he can play but one side team play occurs in game when one is playing one side of it but total pan determinism would be the ability to play any side or as part of any team being capable of playing any and all levels of any dynamic but what is important here is that games are overwhelmings as person begins to be unwilling to overwhelm he of course begins to be unwilling to win and so loses pan determinism and sinks into selfdeterminism games are for our auditing purposes contests in overwhelmings the primary overwhelming is to take space even in sedentary chess the goal is to take space and the game ends with certain space identified incidentally by the occupying piece being overwhelmed but not entered this very wise game of chess of course really nails it since one can really overwhelm thing without space thetan chess ends with the space commanded the opposing king untaken only overwhelmed thus life can be said to be contest of overwhelmings the use of force space pieces problems strategy and tactics all resolve into the simple idea of overwhelmed war and business differ only in overwhelming by the use of force by the former and of advertising and products by the latter teammate is someone who assists in the overwhelming of the enemy aberration is mainly the overwhelming of teammates wrong target when one views life as complexity of attempts to overwhelm he begins to understand it rather well two people may be playing many games some between them some with others they are opponents in some things teammates in others they succeed in the ratio that they can define their games and overwhelm the proper enemy for each game marriages fail only because the games get confused between husband and wife all right seeing that lets now look at dianetics again the engram was overwhelming the preclear by auditing it with dianetic techniques we let the preclear overwhelm theengramproviding we as auditors werent simply using dianetics to overwhelm preclears read over the things that make auditing possible in 1947s original thesis the truth was there the underlying reasons why were not very well if we were trying to overwhelm engrams what were we trying to defeat the definition of an engram has been moment of pain and unconsciousness this should be more technically expressed as an energyspatial picture representing moment of pain and unconsciousness and containing perceptics well what is this new discovery it is an added bit that engrams contained more important than pain and unconsciousness that added bit can be briefly stated as the moment of shock the moment of shock is that period of realization by body and thetan that an overwhelming has occurred as i have said an overwhelming does not consist of space energy pieces et it is the idea that an overwhelming has occurred the winner is convinced sometimes wrongly as when world war i became world war ii that he has overwhelmed the opposing player the loser is convinced that he has been overwhelmed by the mechanics of the overt actmotivator sequence person doing lot of overwhelming sometimes regrets having done so sometimes the overwhelmed very commonly takes the winning valence becomes the person or object he has been overwhelmed by so if one wins he often regrets it the matched terminal phenomena is at work here and when he loses he sometimes becomes the winner in person here we have the proposition that one can win too often or lose too often in dianetics where does this fit it fits as the moment of idea of an overwhelming bloody and wreckaged some battlers yet do not get the idea they are whipped the engram received is then not effective against them almost untouched some believe they have been overwhelmed and thus tiny lock assumes the value of big engram some people playing against another assume too rapidly they have won they achieve the idea that they have done an overwhelming indeed it is an old tactic to make the enemy think he has won and then knock him flat not queensbury but effective when this last has occurred winner becomes suspicious of having overwhelmed and is liable to become too anxious indeed he can become so unsettled about overwhelming others that at length he has to prove it to himself with stiff corpses and nothing short will serve and winner can become more anxious than this as most people have now become he can suppose that evidence of having overwhelmed others is valid and so he shuns the idea of having overwhelmed to start to win anything sets up an anxiety which brings about counterpostulate in him restimulating locks and engrams of anxiety he becomes uncertain and indefinite shame blame regret occur at the very thought of win why he cannot get the idea of overwhelming another with any positiveness thus he may go through life winning on every hand and feel completely defeated failure evidence is valid to him that he has overwhelmed anything he has to get big try harder but the cancer stays with him and he finally concludes all is defeat the usual freedommonger the agitator in his unreasoning and damaging insistence on rules or barriers anywhere is able to achieve only nogame condition he got that way because he cannot feel win is possible at the same time he may be complicated by certainty that he himself is being defeated at every hand matter the evidence thus he has to assume more and more vicious and convincing roles until at last theres shooting in the streets thus the regicides of france could not be free even when they had murdered their king and had killed all their nobility they were so unconvinced that they had won that they promptly lost by setting up napoleon as an emperor dead the king and nobility had still won in the minds of the french radicals because the radicals could not get the idea of having overwhelmedin the field of engrams this becomes important it means that engrams vanish erase rapidly when the preclear regains the ability to have the idea that he has won and that he has lost this explains the mysterious efficacy of rising scale processing as developed in the very last days of dianetic research it also explains why many preclears could not run an engram it also explains why my earliest technique of giving small wins over locks turned on sonic and visio it also explains why some auditors were not successful they could not let pc overwhelm anything and they themselves had to overwhelm the pc and used engrams to do it the auditors did not know they were doing thisthey were the first to be heartbroken about case failures it was just that subtle factor was at work more powerful than the pain and unconsciousness of the engram well thats stripping it pretty bare but theres more to the subject and i will be covering it later on the research of dianetics and scientology still has its exciting moments at least were winning l ron hubbardpab 81 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office brunswick house 83 palace gardens terrace london w8 _____________________________________________________________________ 24 april 1956 purpose all communication lines should have purpose the purpose of this communication line is the advising and orienting of auditors and scientologists everywhere on the subject of scientology the formation and the direction of its organizations and the creation of space in which man can walk upright and free there is great deal of material packed in tight in these recent pabs there will be in the next few issues data of sufficient importance to clarify scientology even for those who have not succeeded well in life processing or finance i invite your closest attention as to what is happening here because data has appeared to to overcome the challenge of an apathetic resistive society in its regard to our efforts we are the only people and the only organizations on earth which have the technology and the ambition to attempt clarification of situations which in other hands are considered entirely out of control to wit the atomic bomb and the decay and confusion of central governments there are those who would tell us that our ambitions are too high that single group much less single man could bring about change in the dangerous career of earth but such people do not know their history single men and determined groups have been the only makers of space in which man could walk free left to the multitude each inverted with his own selfishness and greed the affairs of man do not prosper left to an anarchy of nations with international responsibility earth and mankind cannot prosper the angloamerican civilization was the first new civilization since the roman empire all civilizations between the last collapse of rome in the 4th century ad and the present moment were some fragment of the roman empire or its conquerors rome possessed certain technologies which conquered the world in company with these technologies there was philosophy and willingness to do when the philosophy had faded or had been changed for one far less workable when the technologies of rome had been scattered before the hordes of barbarians who now from moscow once more seek to spread confusion man was left to drift to interpret the word freedom as he would and in the main for his own purposes the disciplines that were rome faded away today the european countries are beginning to function once more various portions of civilization are alert for over century new technology has been making space that technology is angloamerican in its development leaders of the new industrial age in the united states and great britain have pressed upon the world knowhow and machinery and ways of living which have revolutionized almost every society on earth in berlin in paris in madrid and tangiers and cairo and indeed in moscow itself we see the evidences of this onslaught angloamerican mechanization has even driven the chinese from their background and into european pants and hats in india and burma and buenos aires we see the cinema the automobile the clock the booklets and the rifle created byor modelled upon angloamerican industrial might technologically the united states and great britain have conquered the world philosophically they have failed the original impetus of the angloamerican industrial push was carried along with protestant christianity somewhere on the way there is one spiritual message which packaged in with the clock and the cinema and the guns was lost unlike earlier jesuit successes with native peoples protestants successes have been few for some reason possibly because the jesuit incorporated the religion he found with the religion he brought and protestantism remained entirely itself the spiritual philosophy which should have prepared the way for the proper use of the technology did not succeed we are left then with world of confusion for the tools and the weapons have gone out and message has gone with them even to the united states and great britain themselves to use them properly we are confronted then with the picture of mans failure to keep pace with his humanities alongside the onslaught of his technology we have humanities in the dark ages and technologies in the next century we are therefore confronted within our own nations with strikes crimes upsets juvenile delinquency and problems beyond count we are confronted at the same time with rebellious indians burmese and sinhalese and chinese and arabs we are confronted then with united states and great britain which having delivered the weapons of slaughter into the hands of others seemingly have will to continue their regulation the white man within his own countries and within all the countries of earth has solved the problem technologically guns furniture linoleum weaving machines harvesters air conditioning medical advances have each and every one conquered their environments though the machine has penetrated such distance and though the machine has made each and every united states citizen and british citizen more independent and capable it has not been accompanied by philosophy of use adequate to its potential for harm thus we have chaotic world condition we have uncounted communication devices and have not had until scientology any formula for communication itself we have thousand tongues the phonograph the motion picture the radio the television to talk about affinity and we do not even know what it is we have numberless realities being created daily in huge antiseptic factories without any understanding of what reality might be and thus we have created beyond the ability of man to understand and unless the understanding of man can be brought to the level of his own creations man is doomed as the conquering animal of earth so desperate has man become that he will buy almost any ideology whether it is communism or druidism he will buy the garbage of marx and even write it unsuspectingly into the united states constitution under the heading of income tax he will seek solutions to his overpowering problems from indigestible sources such as russian psychiatry or wundtian german psychology neither one of which was intended to free man or to give him understanding and which were intended only to enslave and debase counterfeited ideologies and humanities are not good enough in this age of atomic fission and jet planes these two alone unless handled sentiently can bring about the wipeout of modern man if you have questioned where you were going with scientology if you did not know exactly what you intended to do with scientology if you had real understanding of what scientology was for read the above again you will readily recognize that the typist sitting in some office overwhelmed by routine is equipped immediately with the means of writing letters faster than any amanuensis of past ages but has understandings of why she should be there or what she should be doing beyond the fact that she has to have job what hope is there for this girl like the operator of drill press in factory like the pilot of jet plane or like the man himself who designs atomic missiles she does not know what she is doing or why she is doing it therefore she cannot hope to understand the motives of those around her nor can she understand any need for any teamwork in the execution of better civilization she is being overpowered and engulfed by the business machinery with which she is surrounded work and happiness or comfort or pride exist in such surroundings from the highest head of state to thelowest menial saving only scientologists in the united states great britain or the rest of the world there is exact understanding of life itself thus livingness itself has become as automatic as machinery machines do not bleed they do not suffer it is only because man conceives man to be an incomprehensible machine that makes man willing to destroy with such weapons as atomic fission only men without purpose without understanding men who cannot play the game would so attack their fellows what craven cowardice is it that requires weapon as great as an hbomb to command compliance with ones bad temper one can only gaze with contempt upon person who in relatively peaceful society will overarm himself and overthreaten his fellows if man cared more if man had better understanding of his own purpose man would make better effort to survive but lost in the confusions of ideologies which were intended to do nothing but confuse him what chance does he have the chance he has is scientology were giving him that chance and if you do not pass along to him what you know you yourselves are failing that man failing yourselves and failing us this is mans one chance you must give it to him otherwise he faces other planets other times other elsewheres but more here scientology is not so much mans first science of understanding as his last call to reason if you cannot see this as necessity this science and technology to fit in with mans mission of the machine then you cannot view mans further survival for it will not exist were we to straighten out on its lower and middle strata the thinkingness of man he would have chance to live you would give that chance to person dying in an automobile accident you would give that chance to dog you would give the chance to breathe again and look at the sun to your deadliest enemy then why not give it to man at large is it because you cannot see him as an entirety because you cannot see him as units made up in similar image to those of your immediate family and friends you must give man that chance given that chance he can live out his destiny if that chance is withheld from him he will be more where earth pursues her gentle way in her orbit about the sun today there will be black orb seared scorched and defaced with ruin its air polluted by radiation its surface gouged by pocks the skeletons of its cities standing black and ruined against sun which was allowed to set upon the angloamerican civilization perhaps there are other planets perhaps there will be other times but here we are right now our urgings and our strivings ought to carry forward the civilization which we have about us perhaps it would be better to start all over and make another one i do not happen to think so i think that we can and will continue to create this civilization and continue to bring man through despite his folly in creating industrially far beyond his ability to understand and then borrowing from those who hated him the technologies he hoped would permit him to survive we know how and we can do it is up to us it is up to you and only then we can say with honesty that it is up to man hca training rights if you read closely you discovered that only those hca training rights given to dscns which had not been used and only those which although used did not pay for certification to the central organization were cancelled those people training to the level of hca in the united states who have used their training right to train people to that level and who are in good order financially with the central organization are still in force next time dont jump to conclusions any and all professional auditors have the complete right to teach basic course and should be teaching the basic course regardless of the type of mockup they use to get peoplerunning through this basic course you understand that we can see real basic course one which trains minimum of twentyfive or thirty people week anything else we call peanuts so lets get busy on that one in the united states toward the end of the year there will be dscn course for those who wish to qualify and procure rights to train otherwise such rights will be issued l ron hubbardpab 82 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office

next few issues of the pab we are running preview of the translators edition of scientology it is presented not because you are in need of translation but because you do need at this time tight resume of the data of scientology as it should be presented to basic course people in basic course give them this data give people definitions repeat them many times dont talk about scientology in your lectures give them scientology later these materials will be basic course booklet here as well are some startling new principles you have not seen before for since my discovery of them there has been written release of the data this information is yours to use it is new shot in the arm for scientology these advances have been called incredible they are only mildly amazing l ron hubbard note the translators edition of scientology contains the most fundamental principles of the science in such form that any further reader in another tongue can understand fully what was intended the difficulties of translation are most apparent when one is asked to translate scientology who has not had years of experience with it translation not based on experience is then colored by the various misunderstandings of the translator and when the work passes translated into the hands of someone who is to use or study it in that tongue the person is deprived of much of the precision of scientology indeed it is possible for even fair translation to still exclude enough in precision of word usage to deprive the science of workability in tongue for which it was not written originally while it is criticism of the english of the translator it yet brings up the obvious point that not all translators are expert scientologists and might omit some of the exact meanings without knowing that they had done so to overcome this i have written here translators edition the entire text which follows and every word therein is scheduled for translation and must each word be literally translated into nonenglish text in order to secure exact meanings all words and some phrases which are of questionable status in translation have been given in synonym several times this translators text must then accompany and be included in all other non english texts of whatever language otherwise scientology might not be found in many respects workable and an entire language area would be without it since it would not be understandable to it the translator having erred somewhere in his translationi speak in this from experience having seen dianetics and scientology already in nonenglish tongues whose translators were not trained in the science in engineering bridges stand or they fall down that is because engineering is so precise that an error in the engineering science preceding the bridge could result in calamity similarly scientology works or it doesnt work it is not an art it is the first science of humanity to have this engineering precision thus literary skill does not count in translation smooth reading does not count exact meaning does count in translating anything in scientology translate this paper first translate also the note above _________________________ what is scientology scientology is that branch of psychology which treats of human ability it is an extension of dianetics which is in itself an extension of oldtime facultypsychology of 400 years ago more acceptable and normal psychology such as that begun by st thomas aquinas and extended by many later authors was in 1879 interrupted severely by one professor wundt marxist at leipzig university in germany this strange man in agreement with marx conceived that man was an animal without soul and based all of his work on the principle that there was psyche greek word meaning spirit psychology the study of the spirit or mind then came into the peculiar position of being study of the spirit which denied the spirit for the subsequent decades whipped on by marxist economists and dialectic materialists wundtian psychology was taught broadly through the world it taught that man was an animal it taught that man could not be bettered it taught that intelligence never changed this slave subject wundtian psychology became the standard mainly because of the indifference or lack of knowledge of people in charge of things scientology is actually new very basic psychology in the most exact meaning of the word it can and does change behavior and intelligence and it can and does assist people to study life unlike wundtian pseudopsychology it has political axe to grind scientology is not teaching dialectic materialism under the heading of psychology the term scientology is taken from scio knowing in the fullest meaning of the word and ology to study scientology used by the trained and relatively untrained person improves the intelligence ability behavior skill and appearance of people it is precise and exact science it is employed by an auditor scientology practitioner upon individuals or small or large groups of people in their presence the auditor makes these people at their choice do various exercises and these exercises processes bring about changes for the better in intelligence behavior and general competence how is scientology used scientology is employed by an auditor one who listens and computes as set of drills exercises processes upon the individual and small or large groups it is also employed as an educational teaching subject it has been found that persons can be processed drilled in scientology with scientology exercises and can be made well of many many illnesses and can become brighter more alert and more competent but if they are only processed they have tendency to be overwhelmed or startled and although they may be brighter and more competent they are still held down by an ignorance of life therefore it is far better to teach and process audit drill person than only to process him in other words the best use of scientology is through processing and education in scientology in this way there is imbalance it is interesting that people only need to study scientology to havesome small rise in their own intelligence behavior and competence the study itself is therapeutic good medicine by actual testing is scientology valid tens of thousands of case histories reports on patients individual records all sworn to attested before public officials are in the possession of the organizations of scientology other subject on earth except physics and chemistry has had such gruelling testing proofs exact findings scientology in the hands of an expert auditor can cure some 70 of mans illnesses sicknesses scientology is used by some of the largest companies business organizations on earth it is valid it has been tested where is there more information about scientology scientology has two main organizations one of these is the hubbard association of scientologists i brunswick house 83 palace gardens terrace london w8 united kingdom the other is the hubbard association of scientologists international post office box 242 silver spring maryland usa these organizations have offices on every continent of earth scientology practitioners are validated certified given diplomas by these two organizations diplomas are given only after very exact training person who is skilled in scientology has diploma from one of the above two organizations or from the founding church of scientology in washington dc usa these offices and these people can give you more information about scientology the above two organizations have many books in english on the subject of scientology and dianetics the company that is publishing the book you are reading may have more books in your language who invented scientology scientology was discovered found not invented created it was organized by l ron hubbard an american who has many degrees and is very skilled by reason of study sometimes wundtian psychologists defend themselves by saying hubbard is insane actually the chicago psychological institute wundtian organization gave hubbard many tests at his own request in january of 1951 and found him unusually bright and extremely sane hubbard was trained in nuclear physics at george washington university in washington dc before he started his studies about the mind this explains the mathematical precision of scientology doctor hubbard has been given many honors for his work in the field of the mind he has been assisted by one of the most numerous organizations in the field of the mind on earth today the organizations of dianetics and scientology scientology organizations contain more members than all other mental health organizations combined can person without much study use scientology scientology is practiced in daily life by enormous numbers of people who have formal training beyond study of textbooks scientology was developed to be used by such people as well as by the trained practitioner person studying by himself from textbooks can use scientology both to help and to heal his fellow human beings what special use does scientology have scientology does things for people where nothing has been done before it makes them well from illnesses which were once considered hopeless it increases their intelligence it changes their competence and betters their behavior in addition to these it brings them better understanding of life one outstanding thing which it does it alleviates burns received from atomic bombs scientology is the only specific cure for radiation atomic bomb burns scientology processing given to persons burned by radiation can alleviate the majority of the difficulty this is true even when the person so treating auditor is not completely trained basic principles like engineering scientology has certain basic principles these are necessary to full understanding of the subject it is not enough to know how to process drill people in scientology to be effective good one must also know the basic principles scientology isvery exact the humanities human studies of the past were full of opinions scientology is full of facts that work to study scientology one should scan skim quickly through the basics and find something with which one can agree having found one thing one fact with which he can agree he should then skim through again and find another fact he should continue to do this until he feels some friendliness to the subject when he has achieved this and only when he has achieved this he should then study all the basic principles there is effort here to be authoritarian opinionated one will try to make the subject difficult except yourself you may have been taught that the mind the spirit the brain is very difficult thing to know about this is the first principle of scientology it is possible to know about the mind the cycle of action the most fundamental idea in scientology is called the cycle of action cycle span of time with beginning and an end section of the totality of time with beginning and an end in beginningless and endless time one can set out periods which do have beginning and an end insofar as action is concerned action motion or movement an act consideration that motion has occurred in very ancient books it is written that from chaos came birth from birth there was growth when growth was achieved there was then gradual decay the decay then ended in death after death there was chaos scientology expresses this more briefly the cycle of action is an apparency as follows create then survive then destroy or creation survival destruction first there is creation then this is followed by survival then this is followed by destruction apparency appears to be as distinct from actually is this cycle is only an apparency it is what we see what we behold what we believe we consider think believe suppose postulate that it is so and we then see it so child is born he grows he reaches manhood he grows old he dies in scientology it can be seen that none of these steps are necessary one considers them so and so they are true man can grow old quickly or slowly he grows old to the degree that he believes he is growing old because everyone agrees that this is the way things are they go that way the cycle is not true it is only apparent it is apparent because we believe we see it it is apparent because we agree that it should be so the test of this principle is as follows by using the cycle of action can we make anyone well or more intelligent thousands of tests have proven that the use of and belief in the cycle of action has made none well or intelligent therefore matter if we see it there must be something wrong with it the woman growing old wishing to appear younger is protesting this cycle of action she feels there is something wrong with it there is we have to find out what the actual cycle is before we can make people better actual what is really true that which exists despite all apparencies that which underlies the way things seem to be the way things really are the actual cycle of action is as follows create createcreatecreate createcountercreate creation nothingness create make manufacture construct postulate bring into beingnesscreatecreatecreate create again continuously one moment after the next createcountercreate to create something against creation to create one thing and then create something else against it creation an absence of any creation creative activity an actual cycle of action then consists of various activities but each and every one of them is creative the cycle of action contains an apparency of survival but this is actually only continuous creation the apparent cycle of action contains destruction but the actual cycle of action tells us what destruction is destruction is one of two activities destruction is in terms of action creation of something against creation of something else for example wall is seen standing to be apparent it is necessary that the wall be constantly created the act of destruction is to exert against the wall another creativeness the action or activity of knocking the wall down both the wall standing there and the action of knocking it down are creative actions because we may object to argue against dislike wall being knocked down we vilify swear at scorn the creativeness involved in knocking it down with the word destructive actuality tells us that there is such thing as destruction there is only creation against creation there is another type of destruction and this is more creation by longer being party to member of the walls creation the wall in theory can cease to exist for one this is true in actual practice in scientology reality is the way things appear reality is apparency to do anything about reality one must search into and discover what underlies the apparency of what does reality consist what is reality composed of we see an apparency which has the cycle of action of createsurvivedestroy more basically fundamentally underlying experience this cycle of action contains nothing but creation if one stops making something it longer exists if one ceases to create there is nothingness when one creates something or beholds something which is created that thing is still being created even if one is creating something with his left hand and has forgotten about it with his right hand the thing still exists in other words one can create something without knowing it is still being created then he seeks to destroy it by countercreation creation against it the result is chaos created by two opposing creations let us be practical science is not science unless it is practical theory is good unless it works all the fancy and beautiful theory in the world is useless unless it has use or workability is this cycle of action theory useful it is so long as we believe that we have to destroy with force in order to destroy at all as long as we think in terms of destruction we have chaos there is creating and knowing one is creating there is creating and not knowing one is creating when one drives car or cart he does many things performs many acts which he is not aware of conscious of know about and these we call automatic actions one is doing something and is not aware that he is doing it he starts to create something then places this thought still active beyond his own reach and the creation continues to occur knowingly creating something is always the first condition one can then purposefully continue the creation unknowingly everything he is doing knowingly or unknowingly he is doing here and now in the present instant in present time he knowingly started the creation in some past moment but the creation is being done in the present moment to stop any creation it can be established that one once knew he was creating it and that thought found and made known again or one can simply create newly and consciously what he is already creating unconsciously unknowingly in either case the creation stops the wrong way is to start new creation to counter against the old creation when one does this he gets confusion and chaos for example man has bad leg he is trying to get well he seeks then to create good leg he goes to doctors and wants to be healed the treatment is difficult and usuallysomewhat unsuccessful in the case of very severely crippled leg something is creating bad leg against this he is creating good leg the result is confusion and bad leg but third creativeness is present first something was creating we hope good leg then countercreation such as an accident to his leg countercreated bad leg now he is trying to countercreate again good leg the result is to wipe out the original good leg since that is the creation he is taking over and exposing with his efforts to get well he wants good leg the trouble with him is the countercreation of bad leg the test is factual have him create by certain scientology process bad legs until the countercreation of bad legs is wiped out and the original creation of good leg will reappear this only fails when there is original creation of good leg when this is gone for example man has job he works at it that is to say he create createcreates job throughout the days weeks and years as long as he makes job the job exists one day he depends upon takes for granted this job he longer creates it it ceases to exist he has job the apparency is that he loafed became lazy and was discharged the actuality is that he longer created job and so didnt have one for example man depends upon woman to keep his house for him one day he longer has woman he cant keep house even though before he married the woman he could keep house for example man is sane he gets the idea creates the idea that it would be better to be insane he starts to go insane having created it and then does numberless things in order to stay sane here he was already creating the state of sanity he countercreated insanity he then countercreated sanity against insanity creation in this work may be thought to exclude god we are here considering only those things which man or man as spirit can make or manufacture or think the subject of who or what is doing the creation does not invalidate the cycle this is work on the subject of the mind not work on the subject of the supreme being there are many tests for these principles in scientology such tests come under the heading of processing l ron hubbardpab 83 professional auditors bulletin the oldest

_____________________________________________________________________ 8 may 1956 s c i n t l g translators edition by l ron hubbard phd ce continued from pab 82 the conditions of existence there are three conditions circumstances qualities of existence apparency reality livingness these three conditions comprise make up constitute life they are be do and have the condition of being is defined as the assumption choosing of category of identity it could be said to be the role in game and an example of beingness could be ones own name another example would be his profession another example would be his physical characteristics each or all of these things could be called his beingness beingness is assumed by oneself or given to oneself or is attained for example in the playing of game each player has his own beingness the second condition of existence is doing by doing we mean action function accomplishment the attainment of goals the fulfilling of purpose or any change of position in space the third condition is havingness by havingness we mean owning possessing being capable of commanding positioning taking charge of objects energies or spaces the essential definition of having is to be able to touch or permeate or to direct the disposition of the game of life demands that one assume beingness in order to accomplish doingness in the direction of havingness these three conditions are given in an order of seniority importance where life is concerned the ability to be is more important than the ability to do the ability to do is more important than the ability to have in most people all three conditions are sufficiently confused chaotic baffling that they are best understood in reverse orderwhen one has clarified brought order into the idea of possession or havingness one can then proceed to clarify doingness for general activity and when this is done one understands beingness or identity it is an essential to successful existence that each of these three conditions be clarified and understood the ability to assume or to grant give allow beingness is probably the highest of human virtues it is even more important to be able to permit allow other people to have beingness than to be able oneself to assume it the eight dynamics as one looks out across the confusion which is life or existence to most people one can discover eight main divisions to each one of which apply the conditions of existence each division contains cycle of action there could be said to be eight urges drives impulses in life these we call dynamics these are motives or motivations we call them the eight dynamics there is thought or statement here that any one of these eight dynamics is more important than the others while they are categories divisions of the broad game of life they are not necessarily equal to each other it will be found amongst individuals that each person stresses one of the dynamics more than the others or may stress combination of dynamics as more important than other combinations the purpose in setting forth this division is to increase an understanding of life by placing it in compartments having subdivided existence in this fashion each compartment can be inspected as itself and by itself in its relationship to the other compartments of life in working puzzle it is necessary to first take pieces of similar color or character and place them in groups in studying subject it is necessary to proceed in an orderly fashion to promote this orderliness it is necessary to assume for our purposes these eight arbitrary compartments of life the first dynamicis the urge toward existence as ones self here we have individuality expressed fully the second dynamicis the urge toward existence as sexual or bisexual activity this dynamic actually has two divisions second dynamic is the sexual act itself and the second dynamic b is the family unit including the rearing of children the third dynamicis the urge toward existence in groups of individuals any group or part of an entire class could be considered to be part of the third dynamic the school the society the town the nation are each part of the third dynamic and each one is third dynamic the fourth dynamicis the urge toward existence as mankind whereas the white race would be considered third dynamic all the races would be considered the fourth dynamic the fifth dynamicis the urge toward existence of the animal kingdom this includes all living things whether vegetable or animal the fish in the sea the beasts of the field or of the forest grass trees flowers or anything directly and intimately motivated by life the sixth dynamicis the urge toward existence as the physical universe the physical universe is composed of matter energy space and time in scientology we take the first letter of each of these words and coin word mestthe seventh dynamicis the urge toward existence as or of spirits anything spiritual with or without identity would come under the heading of the seventh dynamic the eighth dynamicis the urge toward existence as infinity this is also identified as the supreme being it is carefully observed here that the science of scientology does not intrude into the dynamic of the supreme being this is called the eighth dynamic because the symbol of infinity stood upright makes the numeral 8 the earlier science dianetics included dynamics one to four scientology embraces dynamics one through seven as known territory scientifically demonstrated and classified the difficulty of stating the exact definitions of the dynamics is entirely verbal originally the dynamics read the urge towards survival as as the science developed it became apparent that survival was only an apparency and only one facet of existence both the cycle of action and the three conditions of existence belong in each dynamic further manifestation of these dynamics is that they could best be represented as series of concentric circles wherein the first dynamic would be the center and each new dynamic would be successively circle outside it the idea of space adjoining enters into these dynamics the basic characteristic of the individual includes his ability to so expand into the other dynamics but when the seventh dynamic is reached in its entirety one will only then discover the true first dynamic as an example of use of these dynamics one discovers that baby at birth is not perceptive beyond the first dynamic but as the child grows and interests extend can be seen to embrace other dynamics as further example of use person who is incapable of operating on the third dynamic is incapable at once of being part of team and so might be said to be incapable of social existence as further comment upon the eight dynamics one of these dynamics from one to seven is more important than any other one of them in terms of orienting the individual while the dynamics are not of equal importance one to the next the ability of an individual to assume the beingness doingness and havingness of each dynamic is an index to his ability to live the eight dynamics are used in scientology communication and should be perfectly learned as part of the language of scientology the abilities and shortcomings of individuals can be understood by viewing their participation in the various dynamics the arc triangle there is triangle of considerable importance in scientology and understanding of it gives much greater understanding of life and an ability to use it the arc triangle is the keystone of living associations this triangle is the common denominator to all of lifes activities the first corner of the triangle is called affinity the basic definition of affinity is the consideration of distance whether good or bad the most basic function of complete affinity would be the ability to occupy the same space as something else the word affinity is here used to mean love liking or any other emotional attitude affinity is conceived in scientology to be something of many facets affinity is variable quality affinity is here used as word with the context degree of liking under affinity we have the various emotional tones ranged from the highest to the lowest and these are in part serenity the highest level enthusiasm as we proceed downward towards the baser affinities conservatism boredom antagonism anger covert hostility fear grief apathy below apathy affinity proceeds into solidities such as matter affinity is conceived to be comprised first of thought then of emotion which contains energy particles and then as solidthe second corner of the triangle is reality reality could be defined as that which appears to be reality is fundamentally agreement what we agree to be real is real the third corner of the triangle is communication in human relationships this is more important than the other two corners of the triangle in understanding the composition of human relations in this universe communication is the solvent for all things it dissolves all things the interrelationship of the triangle becomes apparent at once when one asks have you ever tried to talk to an angry man without high degree of liking and without some basis of agreement there is communication without communication and some basis of emotional response there can be reality without some basis for agreement and communication there can be affinity thus we call these three things triangle unless we have two corners of triangle there cannot be third corner desiring any corner of the triangle one must include the other two the triangle is conceived to be very spacious at the level of serenity and completely condensed at the level of matter thus to represent scale for use one would draw large triangle with high part of the scale and succeedingly small triangles down to dot at the bottom of the scale affinity reality and communication are the basis of the scientology tone scale which gives prediction of human behavior as contained in the book science of survival obtainable from the hasi as has already been noted the triangle is not an equilateral triangle affinity and reality are very much less important than communication it might be said that the triangle begins with communication which brings into existence affinity and reality the most primitive scientology definition of communication is causedistance effect the fundamental manual of communication is dianetics 1955 obtainable from the hasi if you would continue strong and able communication with someone there must be some basis for agreement there must be some liking for the person and then communication can exist we can see then that simple talking and writing randomly without knowledge of this would not necessarily be communication communication is essentially something which is sent and which is received the intention to send and the intention to receive must both be present in some degree before an actual communication can take place therefore one could have conditions which appear to be communications which were not original with scientology as are all these concepts the arc triangle understood is an extremely useful tool or weapon in human relationships for instance amongst the arc triangle laws communication to be received must approximate the affinity level of the person to whom it is directed as people descend the tone scale they become more and more difficult to communicate with and things with which they will agree become more and more solid thus we have friendly discourses high on the scale and war at the bottom where the affinity level is hate the agreement is solid matter and the communication bullets some important auditing donts it is important for all auditors to know few donts in conjunction with the dos recently discovered havingness has been isolated as the entering wedge for any and all cases it has been discovered that when havingness was concentrated upon in various processes intelligence quotient gained and personality bettered the terrible trio as described in recent pab is easily the best opening wedge in case at this time there are of course someadditional havingness processes under test but none of them have to date been thoroughly validated as has the terrible trio primary auditing donts whether for staff auditor or for the professional auditing room all concern themselves with conservation of havingness in the preclear in the early stages of auditing as well as the later ones some very astonishing things have been discovered this follows 1taking an inventory or prolonged twoway communication in opening case have been discovered to reduce havingness sufficiently to worsen an occasional case if immediately after the inventory twoway comm scientometric battery was given it would be found that the case had reduced in iq and personality qualities therefore we can assume that in some cases prolonged twoway comm and inventory at case beginning have dropped the case level and although the case was then run many hours on havingness processes all that happened was that the case regained the lost ground and so the final scientometric result showed change in case although the case had reduced and had come back therefore the rudiments should be established rapidly without too much talking delay and direct havingness process should be entered upon at once in the case of very pressing present time problem it is of course benefit to reduce the problem thoroughly by getting problems of comparable magnitude this in itself in way is havingness process 2the terrible trio run outside rather than in the auditing room has been found in five separate cases to produce collapse of case the introduction of so much space into havingness reduces havingness faster than it is built up therefore the terrible trio should be run in the auditing room notknowingness about people and separateness processes oddly enough seem to be runnable exteriorly without involving this factor 3lying processes such as tell lie about that wall are not always havingness processes it is left to accident which side of the countercreation is being run by the preclear so that at times the process gets gains and sometimes does not get gains running problem of comparable magnitude assures that one is running the creation which is countering the survival of the preclear this is in way dangerous but creative processes in general are not necessarily havingness processes unless they are run against the preclear which is to say unless they are run as countercreations to the creations of the preclear invent something to restrict you would be superior to tell lie about that wall 4the auditor should be particularly careful to inquire into how or what the preclear is doing the terrible trio has failed on occasion but when the case has been looked into by another auditor it has been discovered that the process was not understood by the preclear and was not the least by the auditor an example of this was case which was permitted to run the terrible trio for many hours without gain which on investigation demonstrated that the preclear was assuming that she could have objects similar to the objects she was looking at if she bought them and on this via she was continuing the process the auditor did not talk with the preclear enough to understand what the preclear was actually doing with the process one must not forget that golden maxim find out what the preclear is doing with the command cant have processes remembering the old dichotomies it becomes obvious that if havingness is so important in auditing negative havingness would also have its role somewhere in processes it could be said to be true that withheld communication is the single and sole reason for the accumulation of ridges and barriers however who withholds this communication for the principle for withheld communication to exist it must have been initiated originally by thepreclear himself if we run communications being withheld from preclear we hit reduction in havingness or draw blank if we run the preclear withholding communication from another we tend to profit it is not necessarily true that havingness will gain immediately and automatically by running out the communications the preclear has withheld for good deal depends on how the preclear is doing the process havingness could be said to be the result of withheld communication just as too much communication will asis any havingness so withholding communication will accumulate havingness this is sort of an automatic accumulation mechanism it is true that thetan can simply mock up massesthere is reason why there should be modus operandi accumulation of masses beyond the fact that there is one withheld communication when person has too little havingness he tends to conserve what havingness he has by withholding communication you will discover that only lowhavingness persons fail to acknowledge or engage in good communication should lowhavingness person acknowledge or originate too frequently his havingness would be reduced accordingly he is restrained from communicating then by the sensations consequent to reduction of his havingness well below the level of communication as such we have restrained havingness this is suborder of withheld communication an individual who refuses to let other individuals have things is himself apt to reduce his own havingness accordingly the mechanism whereby this takes place is very interesting one we recall the winning valence aspect of cases we find in book i that the individual losing is apt to assume the valence of the person who won the winning valence is synthetic valence it is not actually the personality of the person who won it is the individuals mockup of that person which is diminished or augmented by other peoples opinions and by ones own postulates let us conceive the following circumstance little baby with habitually angry father has many times on the approach of the father stated more or less to himself he cant have this body yet father in the final analysis wins the baby grows to assume at length the valence of father this is synthetic valence it is not fathers actual personality it is the personality the baby has observed the father to have this synthetic valence is salted with the babys cant have postulates in other words this winning valence of father is corrupted by many cant have postulates which were not fathers in view of the fact that these postulates consist of forbidding the father to have the baby the assumption of the winning valence of father results in the assumption of postulates that the person cannot have himself back he is trapped by cant haves of his own manufacture just as the baby was the cause of his own effect and just as he suffered from this so do all winning valences forbid the return to identity since somewhere in the anatomy of the winning valence is the individuals own postulate that the winning valence cannot have the individual thus we have the continuous struggle on the part of people to be themselves which trouble is of little avail on the basis of this rationale some tests have already been conducted but the matter is in wise completed this is then given as an advanced lookin on some forward research selecting categories which is the eight dynamics and selecting them as they seem to be put forward by the preclearintroducing as little arbitrary selection by the auditor as possible and leaving it up to the preclearone asks what these categories cant have one does not stress from you but he certainly doesnt stress what the individual himself cant have for to do so would be to make the individual postulate against himself let us suppose that the preclears man and that the category women has been chosen the auditing question would then be tell something that women cant have onthe male preclear of course tell something that men cant have would also be runnable since the truth of the matter is the preclear is not male but has male body on early tests it does not seem to be reductive of havingness to run this process if this were so i would guess that the process would have to be alternated with such process as the terrible trio but this has not yet been necessary if we are trying to return the preclear to himself it would seem that cant have would best assist the reassumption of ones own identity by the above rationale let know how you progress with this teaching the basic course all qualified auditors should now be running basic course in scientology it has been found on test that these courses through supplying stable data to student align many of his confusions and so give rise to an increase in iq intelligence quotient and an improvement in the personality traits this is the way to get better world and also would give rise to great deal of interest in your area in the subject if you have not started your basic course you should get moving on this right awaypab 84 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l

translators edition by l ron hubbard phd ce continued from pab 83 the reason why life can best be understood by likening it to game since we are exterior to great number of games we can regard them with detached eye if we were exterior to life instead of being involved and immersed in the living of it it would look to us much like games look to us from our present vantage point despite the amount of suffering pain misery sorrow and travail which can exist in life the reason for existence is the same reason as one has to play gameinterest contest activity and possession the truth of this assertion is established by an observation of the elements of games and then applying these elements to life itself when we do this we find nothing left wanting in the panorama of life by game we mean contest of person against person or team against team when we say games we mean such games as baseball polo chess or any other such pastime it may at one time have struck you as peculiar that men would risk bodily injury in the field of play just for the sake of amusement so it might strike you as peculiar that people would go on living or would enter into the game of life at the risk of all the sorrow travail and pain just to have something to do evidently there is greater curse than total idleness of course there is that condition where person continues to play game in which he is longer interested if you will but look about the room and check off items in which you are not interested you will discover something remarkable in short time you will find that there is nothing in the room in which you are not interested you are interested in everything however disinterest itself is one of the mechanisms of play in order to hide something it is only necessary to make everyone disinterested in the place where the item is hidden disinterest is not an immediate result of interest which has worn out disinterest is commodity in itself it is palpable it exists by studying the elements factors of games contests we find ourselves in possession of the elements of life life is game game consists of freedom barriers and purposes this is scientific fact not merely an observationfreedom exists amongst barriers totality of barriers and totality of freedom alike are nogame conditions each is similarly cruel each is similarly purposeless great revolutionary movements fail they promise unlimited freedom that is the road to failure only stupid visionaries chant of endless freedom only the afraid and ignorant speak of and insist upon unlimited barriers when the relation between freedom and barriers becomes too unbalanced an unhappiness results freedom from is alright only so long as there is place to be free to an endless freedom from is perfect trap fear of all things barriers are composed of inhibiting limiting ideas space energy masses and time freedom in its entirety would be total absence of these thingsbut it would also be freedom without thought or action an unhappy condition of total nothingness fixed on too many barriers man yearns to be free but launched into total freedom he is purposeless and miserable there is freedom amongst barriers if the barriers are known and the freedoms are known there can be life living happiness game the restrictions of government or job give an employee his freedom without known restrictions an employee is slave doomed to the fears of uncertainty in all his actions executives in business and government can fail in three ways and thus bring about chaos in their department they can 1 seem to give endless freedom 2 seem to give endless barriers 3 make neither freedom nor barriers certain executive confidence therefore consists of imposing and enforcing an adequate balance between their peoples freedom and the units barriers and in being precise and consistent about those freedoms and barriers such an executive adding only in himself initiative and purpose can have department with initiative and purpose an employee buying andor insisting upon freedom only will become slave knowing the above facts he must insist upon workable balance between freedom and barriers an examination of the dynamics above will demonstrate the possibility of combination of teams two third dynamics can engage one another as teams the first dynamic can ally itself with the fifth dynamic against let us say the sixth dynamic and so have game in other words the dynamics are an outline of possible teams and interplays as everyone is engaged in several games an examination of the dynamics will plot for him and clarify for him the various teams he is playing upon if an individual can discover that he is only playing on the first dynamic and that he belongs to other team it is certain that this individual will lose for he has before him seven remaining dynamics and the first dynamic is seldom capable of besting by itself all the remaining dynamics in scientology we call this condition the only one here is selfdeterminism in the guise of selfish determinism and here is an individual who will most certainly be overwhelmed to enjoy life one must be some part of life there is the principle in scientology called pandeterminism this could be loosely defined as determining the activities of two or more sides in game simultaneously for instance person playing chess is being selfdetermined and is playing chess against an opponent person who is pandetermined on the subject of chess could play both sides of the board one is pandetermined about any game to which he is senior he is selfdetermined only in any game to which he is junior for instance general of an army is pandetermined concerning anargument between two privates or even two companies of his command he is pandetermined in this case but when he confronts another army led by another general he becomes self determined the game in this wise could be said to be larger than himself the game becomes even larger than this when the general seeks to play the parts of all the political heads which should be above him this is the main reason why dictatorship doesnt work it is all but impossible for one man to be pandetermined about the entire system of games which comprise nation he starts taking sides and then to that degree becomes much less than the government which he is seeking to run it has been stylish in past ages to insist only upon freedom the french revolution furnishes an excellent example for this in the late part of the 18th century the nobles of france became so selfdetermined against the remainder of the country and were so incapable of taking the parts of the populace that the nobles were destroyed immediately the populace itself sought to take over the government and being trained and being intensely antipathetic to any and all restraints their war cry became freedom they had further restrictions or barriers the rules of government were thrown aside theft and brigandage took the place of economics the populace therefore found itself in deeper trap and discovered itself to be involved with dictatorship which was far more restrictive than anything they had experienced before the revolution although man continually uses freedom for his war cry he only succeeds in establishing further entrapment for himself the reason for this is very simple one game consists of freedom and barriers and purposes when man drops the idea of restrictions or barriers he loses at once control over barriers he becomes selfdetermined about barriers and not pan determined thus he cannot control the barriers the barriers left uncontrolled then and there trap him the dwindling spiral of the apparency createsurvivedestroy comes about directly that man shuns barriers if he considers all restrictions and barriers his enemies he is of course refusing to control them in any way and thus he starts his own dwindling spiral race which is educated to think in terms of freedom only is very easily entrapped one in the nation will take responsibility for restrictions therefore restrictions apparently become less and less as these restrictions lessen so lessens the freedom of the individual one cannot be free from wall unless there is wall lacking any restrictions life becomes purposeless random chaotic good manager must be capable of taking responsibility for restrictions in that freedom to exist must have barriers failure to take initiative on the subject of restrictions or barriers causes these things to arise all by themselves and exist without consent or direction there are various states of mind which bring about happiness that state of mind which insists only upon freedom can bring about nothing but unhappiness it would be better to develop thought pattern which looked for new ways to be entrapped and things to be trapped in than to suffer the eventual total entrapment of dwelling upon freedom only man who is willing to accept restrictions and barriers and is not afraid of them is free man who fights restrictions and barriers will always be trapped as it can be seen in any game purposes become counterposed there is the matter of purposecounterpurpose in almost any game played in field with two teams one team has the idea of reaching the goal of the other and the other has the idea of reaching the goal of the first their purposes are at war and this warring of purposes makes game the war of purposes gives us what we call problems problem has the anatomy of purposes problem consists of two or more purposes opposed it does not matter what problem you face or have faced the basic anatomy of that problem is purposecounterpurpose in actual testing in scientology it has been discovered that person begins to suffer from problems when he does not have enough of them there is the old saw maxim that if youwant thing done give it to busy man to do similarly if you want happy associate make sure that he is man who can have lots of problems from this we get the oddity of high incidence of neurosis in the families of the rich these people have very little to do and have very few problems the basic problems of food clothing and shelter are already solved for them we would suppose then if it were true that an individuals happiness depended only upon his freedom these people would be happy however they are not happy what brings about their unhappiness it is the lack of problems although successful processing in scientology would depend upon taking all three elements of games into considerationand indeed that is the secret of bettering people taking freedom barriers and purposes into consideration and balancing themit could be said that you could make man well simply by sitting down with him and asking him to invent problems one after the other the invention of synthetic problems would be found to free his mind and make him more able of course there is another factor involved in this in that it is he who is inventing the problems and therefore he is becoming pandetermined about problems rather than being in one place with all problems opposed to him an unhappy man is one who is considering continually how to become free one sees this in the clerk who is continually trying to avoid work although he has great deal of leisure time he is not enjoying any part of it he is trying to avoid contact with masses and energies and spaces he eventually becomes trapped in some sort of lethargy if this man could merely change his mind and start worrying about how he could get more work to do his happiness level would increase markedly one who is plotting continually how to get out of things will be miserable one who is plotting how to get into things has much better chance of becoming happy there is of course the matter of being forced to play games in which one has interesta war into which one is drafted is an excellent example of this one is not interested in the purposes of the war and yet one finds himself fighting it thus there must be an additional element and this element is the power of choice one could say then that life is game and that the ability to play game consists of tolerance for freedom and barriers and an insight into purposes with the power of choice over participation these four elementsfreedom barriers purposes and power of choiceare the guiding elements of life there are only two factors above these and both of them are related to these the first is the ability to create with of course its negative the ability to uncreate and the second is the ability to make postulate to consider to say thing and have it be true this then is the broad picture of life and in bringing life into focus and in making it less confusing these elements are used for the analysispab 85 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office brunswick house 83 palace gardens terrace london w8 _____________________________________________________________________ 22 may 1956 s c i n t l g translators edition by l ron hubbard phd ce continued from pab 84 the parts of man the individual man is divisible separable into three parts divisions the first of these is the spirit called in scientology the thetan the second of these parts is the mind the third of these parts is the body probably the greatest discovery of scientology and its most forceful contribution to the knowledge of mankind has been the isolation description and handling of the human spirit accomplished in 1951 in the month of july in phoenix arizona it was established along scientific rather than religious or humanitarian lines that that thing which is the person the personality is separable from the body and the mind at will and without causing bodily death or mental derangement in ages past there has been considerable controversy concerning the human spirit or soul and various attempts to control man have been effective in view of his almost complete ignorance of his own identity latterly spiritualists isolated from the person what they called the astral body and with this they were able to work for various purposes of their own in scientology the spirit itself was separated from what the spiritualists called the astral body and there should be confusion between these two things as you know that you are where you are at this moment so you would know if you spirit were detached from your mind and body man has not discovered this before because lacking the technologies of scientology he had very little reality upon his detachment from his mind and body therefore he conceived himself to be at least in part mind and body the entire cult of communism is based upon the fact that one lives only one life that there is hereafter and that the individual has religious significance man at large has been close to this state for at least the last century the state condition is of very low order excluding as it does all selfrecognition the thetan spirit is described in scientology as having mass wavelength energy and time or location in space except by consideration or postulate the spirit then is not thing it is the creator of thingsthe residence of the thetan is in the skull or near the body thetan can be in one of four conditions the first would be entirely separate from body or bodies or even from this universe the second would be near body and knowingly controlling the body the third would be in the body the skull and the fourth would be an inverted condition whereby he was compulsively away from the body and could not approach it there are degrees subdivisions of each one of these four states conditions the most optimum of these conditions from the standpoint of man is the second thetan is subject to deterioration this is at first difficult to understand since the entirety of his activity consists of considering or postulating he uses through his postulates various methods of controlling body that he does deteriorate is manifest but that he can at any moment return to an entirety of his ability is also factual in that he associates beingness with mass and action he does not consider himself as having an individual identity or name unless he is connected with one or more of the games of life the processes of scientology can establish this for the individual with greater or lesser rapidity and one of the many goals of processing in scientology is to exteriorize the individual and place him in the second condition above since it has been discovered that he is happier and more capable when so situated the mind is network of communications and pictures energies and masses which are brought into being by the activities of the thetan versus the physical universe or other thetans thetan establishes various systems of control so that he can continue to operate body and through the body operate things in the physical universe as well as other bodies the most obvious portion of the mind is recognizable by anyone not in serious condition this is the mental image picture in scientology we call this mental image picture facsimile when it is photograph of the physical universe sometime in the past we call this mental image picture mockup when it is created by the thetan or for the thetan and does not consist of photograph of the physical universe various phenomena connect themselves with this entity called the mind some people closing their eyes see only blackness some people see pictures some people see pictures made by body reactions some people see only black screens others see golden lines others see spaces but the keynote of the entirety of the system called the mind is postulate and perception the thetan receives by the communication system called the mind various impressions including direct views of the physical universe in addition to this he receives impressions from past activities and most important he himself being close to total knowingness conceives things about the past and future which are independent of immediately present stimuli the mind is not in its entirety stimulusresponse mechanism as old marxist psychology would have one believe the mind has three main divisions the first of these could be called the analytical mind the second the reactive mind and the third the somatic mind the analytical mind combines perceptions of the immediate environment of the past via pictures and estimations of the future into conclusions which are based upon the realities of situations the analytical mind combines the potential knowingness of the thetan with the conditions of his surroundings and brings him to independent conclusions this mind could be said to consist of visual pictures either of the past or of the physical universe monitored by and presided over by the knowingness of thetan the keynote of the analytical mind is awareness one knows what one is concluding and knows what he is doing the reactive mind is stimulusresponse mechanism ruggedly built and operable in trying circumstances the reactive mind never stops operating pictures of very low order are taken by this mind of the environment even in deep states of unconsciousness the reactive mind acts below the level of consciousness it is literal stimulusresponse mind given certain stimulus it gives certain responsewhile it is an order of thinkingness its ability to conclude rationally is so poor that we find in the reactive mind those various aberrated impulses which are gazed upon as oddities of personality eccentricities neuroses and psychoses it is this mind which stores up all the bad things that have happened to one and throws them back to him again in moments of emergency or danger so as to dictate his actions along lines which have been considered safe before as there is little thinkingness involved in this the courses of action dictated by the reactive mind are often not safe but highly dangerous the reactive mind is entirely literal in its interpretation of words as it takes pictures and receives impressions during moments of unconsciousness phrase uttered when blow is struck is likely to be literally interpreted by the reactive mind and become active upon the individual at later times the mildest stage of this would be arduous training wherein pattern is laid into the mind for later use under certain given stimuli harsh and less workable level is the hypnotic trance condition to which the mind is susceptible made impressionable by fixed attention words can be immediately implanted into the reactive mind which become operable without further reason at later times an even lower level in the reactive mind is that one associated with blows drugs illness pain and other conditions of unconsciousness phrases spoken over an anaesthetized person can have later effect upon that person it is not necessarily true that each and every portion of an operation is painstakingly photographed by the reactive mind of the unconscious patient but it is true that great many of these stimuli are registered complete silence in the vicinity of person under anaesthetic or person who is unconscious or in deep pain is mandatory if one would preserve the mental health of that person or patient afterwards probably the most therapeutic action which could occur to an individual would be under scientology processing the separation of the thetan from the mind so that the thetan under duress and with total knowingness could view himself and his mind and act accordingly however there is type of exteriorization which is the most aberrative of all traumatic mentally injurious actions this is the condition when an individual is brought through injury or surgery or shock very close to death so that he exteriorizes from body and mind this exteriorization under duress is sudden inexplicable and is in itself very shocking and when this has occurred to an individual it is certain that he will suffer mentally from the experience afterwards it could be said that when the reactive mind contains these sudden shocks of exteriorization under duress attempts to exteriorize the individual later by scientology are more difficult however modern processing has overcome this the phenomenon of exteriorization under duress is accompanied at times by energy explosions in the various facsimiles of the mind and these crossassociate in the reactive mind therefore people become afraid of exteriorization and at times people are made ill simply by discussing the phenomena due to the fact that they have exteriorized under duress during some operation or accident exteriorization under duress is the characteristic of death itself therefore exteriorization or the departure of the soul is generally associated with death in the minds of most people it is not necessarily true that one is dead because he exteriorizes and it is definitely not true that exteriorization not accompanied by shock pain or duress is at all painful indeed it is quite therapeutic the third portion of the mind is the somatic mind this is an even heavier type of mind than the reactive mind since it contains thinkingness and contains only actingness the impulses placed against the body by the thetan through various mental machinery arrive at the voluntary and involuntary and glandular levels these have set methods of analysis for any given situation and so respond directly to commands given unfortunately the somatic mind is subject to each of the minds higher in scale above it and to the thetan in other words the thetan can independently affect the somatic mind theanalytical mind can affect the somatic mind the reactive mind can affect the somatic mind thus we see that the neurons the glandular system the muscles and masses of the body are subject to various impulses each one of lower order than the next thus it is not odd to discover what we call psychosomatic illness condition exists here where the thetan does not have an awareness of burdening the somatic mind with various commands or derangements neither does the thetan have an awareness of his own participation in the analytical mind causing this action against the body in that the thetan is seldom aware of the reactive mind it is possible then for the reactive mind with its stimulusresponse content to impinge itself directly and without further recourse or advice upon the neurons muscles and glandular system of the body in that the reactive mind can hold fixed command in place causing derangement in the somatic mind it is possible then for illness to exist for bizarre pains to be felt for actual physical twists and aberrations to occur without any conscious knowledge on the part of the thetan this we call physical illness caused by the mind in brief such illness is caused by perceptions received in the reactive mind during moments of pain and unconsciousness whether the facsimile in the mind is received while the thetan is awake or unconscious the resulting mass of the energy picture is energy just as you see energy in an electric light bulb or from the flames of fire at one time it was considered that mental energy was different than physical energy in scientology it has been discovered that mental energy is simply finer higher level physical energy the test of this is conclusive in that thetan mocking up creating mental image pictures and thrusting them into the body can increase the body mass and by casting them away again can decrease the body mass this test has actually been made and an increase of as much as thirty pounds actually measured on scales has been added to and subtracted from body by creating mental energy energy is energy it has different wavelengths and different characteristics the mental image pictures are capable of reacting upon the physical environment and the physical environment is capable of reacting upon mental image pictures thus the mind actually consists of spaces energies and masses of the same order as the physical universe if lighter and different in size and wavelength for much more comprehensive picture of the mind one should read the original thesis by l ron hubbard and dianetics the modern science of mental health by the same author these were written before the discovery of the upper levels of beingness were made and are very complete picture of the mind itself its structure and what can be done to it and with it the third part of man is the physical body this can best be studied in such things as grays anatomy and other anatomical texts this is the province of the medical doctor the body is purely structural study and the actions and reactions amongst its various structures are complex and intensely interesting when scientology founded biophysics it did so because of the various discoveries which had accumulated concerning mental energy in its reaction against physical energy and the activities which took place in the body because of these interactions biophysics only became feasible when it was discovered in scientology that fixed electrical field existed surrounding body entirely independent of but influenceable by the human mind the body exists in its own space that space is created by anchor points points which are anchored in space different to the physical universe space around body the complexity of these anchor points can cause an independent series of electronic flows which can occasion much discomfort to the individual the balance structure of the body and even its joint action and physical characteristics can be changed by changing this electrical field which exists at distance from or within the body the electrical field is paramount and monitors the actual physical structure of the body thus the body is not only influenced by the three minds it is influenced as well by its own electrical field an expert scientologist can discover for the average person this field and can bring about its adjustment although this is very far from the primary purpose of the scientologistthe use of electrical shocks upon body for any purpose is therefore very dangerous and is not to be condoned by sensible men of course the use of electrical shock was never intended to be therapeutic but was intended only to bring about obedience by duress and as far as it can be discovered to make the entirety of insanity horror electrical shock deranges the electronic field in the vicinity of the body and is almost always succeeded by bad health or physical difficulties and never does otherwise than hasten the death of the person it has been stated by people using electric shock that if they were denied euthanasia the right to kill people who were considered to be burden on society they would at least use partial euthanasia in the form of electric shock brain surgery and drugs these treatments in some large percentage of cases however effect euthanasia knowledge of the mental and physical structure of the body would be absolutely necessary in order to treat the body and this knowledge has not existed prior to scientology the medical doctor achieved many results by working purely with structure and biochemical products and in the field of emergency surgery and obstetrics and orthopaedics he is indispensable in the society medicine however does not contain definition for mind and is not expected to invade the field which belongs properly to scientology these three parts of manthe thetan the mind and the bodyare each one different studies but they influence each other markedly and continually of the three the senior entity is the thetan for without the thetan there would be mind or animation in the body many speculations in the field of parascientology have been made parascientology includes all of the uncertainties and unknown territories of life which have not been completely explored and explained however as studies have gone forward it has become more and more apparent that the senior activity of life is that of the thetan and that in the absence of the spirit further life exists in the insect kingdom it is not established whether or not each insect is ordered by spirit or whether one spirit orders enormous numbers of insects it is not established how mutation and evolution occur if they do and the general authorship of the physical universe is only speculated upon since scientology does not invade the 8th dynamic some facts however are completely known the first of these is that the individual himself is spirit controlling body via mind the second of these is that the thetan is capable of making space energy mass and time the third of these is that the thetan is separable from the body without the phenomena of death and can handle and control body from well outside it the fourth of these is that the thetan does not care to remember the life which he has just lived after he has parted from the body and the mind the fifth of these is that person dying always exteriorizes the sixth of these is that person having exteriorized then returns to planet and procures usually another body of the same type of race as before in parascientology there is much discussion about between lives areas and other phenomena which might have passed at one time or another for heaven or hell but it is established completely that thetan is immortal and that he himself cannot actually experience death and counterfeits it by forgetting it is adequately manifest that thetan lives again and that he is very anxious to put something on the time track something for the future in order to have something to come back to thus we have the anxieties of sex there must be additional bodies for the next life it is obvious that what we create in our societies during this lifetime affects us during our next lifetime this is quite different than the belief or an idea that this occurs in scientology we have very little to do with forcing people to make conclusions an individual can experience these things for himself and unless he can do so one expects him to accept them the manifestation that our hereafter is our next life entirely alters the general concept of spiritual destiny there is argument whatever with the tenets of faith since it is not precisely stated uniformly by religions that one immediately goes to heaven or hell it is certain that an individual experiences the effect of the civilization which he has had part in creating in his next lifetime in other words the individual comes back he has responsibility for what goes on today since he will experience it tomorrowsex has been overweighted in importance in old psychotherapy practice more or less disgraced at this time sex is only one of numerous creative impulses an anxiety about sex however occurs when an individual begins to believe that there will not be body for him to have during the next lifetime the common denominator of all aberration mental derangement is cessation of creation as sex is only one kind of creation and rather low order of it it will be seen that unhappiness could stem from various cessations of creation death itself is cessation of creation one stops creating the identity john jones and the environment and things of john jones he stops because he believes he cannot himself continue this creation without the assistance of body having become dependent upon mind and body the first to do his thinking for him and the second to do his acting an individual becomes sufficiently morose on the ideas of creation that he can actually bring about the condition it will be seen that the three parts of man are intimately associated with control the anatomy of control is start change and stop the loss of control takes place with the loss of pandeterminism when one becomes too partisan embraces himself too solidly against the remainder of the environment he longer controls the environment to the degree that he might and so is unable to start change and stop the environment it is scientific definition in scientology that control consists of start change and stop these three manifestations can be graphed alongside of the apparent cycle of action create survive destroy any person is somewhere along this curve an individual who is bent mainly upon survival is intent usually upon changing things an individual who is close to being destroyed is bent mainly upon stopping things an individual who has free heart and mind about life is bent upon creating things there could be three things wrong with any person and these would be the inability to start the inability to change the inability to stop insanity for the most part is an inability to stop neurosis is habit which worsening flies entirely out of control one is stopped so often in life that he becomes an enemy of stopping and dislikes stopping so intensely that he himself will not stop things in the matter of the parts of man we discover that all things are initiated by the thetan so far as action activity and behavior are concerned after such an initiation he can be blunted or warped from course and acted upon in such way that he becomes too fixed along one line or another and begins to suffer from these three inabilities however each one of the parts of man is subject to the anatomy of control an individual begins first by being unable himself and without help to start to change to stop then the mind may become prone to these disabilities and is unable to start change or stop at will then the body itself can become subject to these three disabilities and is unable to start to change to stop the oddity is that an environment can so work upon an individual however that thetans body becomes disabled through choice of his own similarly the reactive mind can become disabled through choice of either the body or the thetan but the thetan himself beyond observing the effect of various causes and having initiated the first thought to be there in the first place can only become disabled by becoming too partisan by becoming too little pandetermined and so bringing himself into difficulties these difficulties however are entirely the difficulties of consideration as the thetan considers so he is in the final analysis the thetan has problems of his own the problems are always other peoples problems and must exist in the mind or the body or in other people or his surroundings for him to have problems thus his difficulties are in the main difficulties of staying in the game and keeping the game going if thetan can suffer from anything it is being outcreated created against too thoroughly the manifestations of being outcreated would be the destruction of his own creations and the overpowering presence of other creations thus thetan can be brought to believe that he is trapped if he is outcreatedin past dissertations on the subject of the mind and philosophies of life there was great deal of speculation and very little actual proof therefore these philosophies were creations and one philosopher was at work outcreating another philosopher in scientology we have this single difference we are dealing with discoveries the only thing created about scientology is the actual books and works in which scientology is presented the phenomena of scientology are discovered and are held in common by all men and all life forms there is effort in scientology to outcreate each and every thetan that comes along it is of course possible to conceive scientology as creation and to conceive that it is overwhelming it should be viewed otherwise for it is intended as an assistance to life at large to enable life to make better civilization and better game there are tenets in scientology which cannot be demonstrated with entirely scientific procedurespab 86 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous

_____________________________________________________________________ 29 may 1956 s c i n t l g translators edition by l ron hubbard phd ce continued from pab 85 causation and knowledge scientology as science is composed of many axioms selfevident truths as in geometry there are some fiftysix of these axioms in addition to the two hundred more axioms of dianetics which preceded the scientology axioms the first axiom in scientology is life is basically static definition static has mass motion wavelength location in space or in time it has the ability to postulate and to perceive definition in scientology the word postulate means to cause thinkingness or consideration it is specially applied word and is defined as causative thinkingness axiom 2 the static is capable of considerations postulates and opinions axiom 3 space energy objects form and time are the result of considerations made andor agreed upon or not by the static and are perceived solely because the static considers that it can perceive them axiom 4 space is viewpoint of dimension space is caused by looking out from point the only actuality of space is the agreed upon consideration that one perceives through something and this we call space axiom 5 energy consists of postulated particles in space one considers that energy exists and that he can perceive energy he also considers that energy behaves according to certain agreed upon laws these assumptions or considerations are the totality of energy axiom 6 objects consist of grouped particles axiom 7 time is basically postulate that space and particles will persist the rate of their persistence is what we measure with clocks and the motion of heavenly bodies axiom 8 the apparency of time is the change of position of particles in spaceaxiom 9 change is the primary manifestation of time axiom 10 the highest purpose in the universe is the creation of an effect these first ten axioms of scientology are the most fundamental truths by which we mean commonly held considerations here we have thought and life and the physical universe in their relation one to the other regardless of further considerations ideas assumptions and conditions there lie beneath them these first ten truths it is as though one had entered into an honorable bargain with fellow beings to hold these things in common once this is done or once such contract or agreement exists one has the fundamentals of universe specialized considerations based on the above make one or another kind of universe the physical universe which we see around us and in which we live was created on these fundamentals without regard to who created it its creation was agreed upon in order to perceive it one must agree that it exists there are three classes of universes there is first foremost and most evident the physical universe of spaces stars suns land sea air and living forms then there is the other fellows universe which may or may not be agreed upon by his associates this he holds to himself the phenomenon of this universe is included in the field of the mind as described earlier then listed last here but first perceived is ones own universe the phenomenon of universes is an interesting one since ones own universe can be overwhelmed by the universes of others these in scientology we call valences extra personalities cells apparent beingnesses valences and universes are the same thing essentially for example one while living in the physical universe can be overpowered by the universe of let us say father while one still retains his own valence or identity one is yet acting or thinking or suffering or feeling somewhat like father even though one is by oneself there is this additional apparent beingness although father is absent his commands are still present thus we get such things as duty obedience training and even education each one of these is caused by some part of another universe to greater or lesser degree regardless of how one reacts to universes he still remains in some degree himself it is the effort of many to struggle to mind themselves the totality of this impulse is the effort to separate ones own self as thetan from the various universes with which he feels himself too intimately associated one is only oppressed by the universe when he feels he can have nothing of that universe one is only victimized by fathers universe when he is in protest against father one protests against the physical universe only when he feels that he can have part of it or does not belong in it or as in religion is not looked upon kindly by what he conceives to be the creator of the physical universe universes as considered in games earlier could be considered the playing fields of life one plays willingly or one plays unwillingly when one begins to play unwillingly he is apt to discover himself victimized and interiorized into the universe of some game it is against this phenomenon that person protests consider the matter of jail on the surface of it as voltaire discovered jail provides food and shelter and leisure time this would seem to be the ambition of many people but the jail provides as well restriction without ones consent the only difference between being in jail and being the king in castle so far as liberty is concerned is ones own desires in the matter and ones own ability to command ones environment as king in castle one would be causative his will statement thinkingness would have an effect upon others being in jail one is an effect in that the thinkingness of others finds him its target here we have in terms of universes the most rudimentary example of cause and effectwe must however assume because it is so evident that an individual only gets into traps and circumstances he intends to get into certain it is that having gotten into such position he may be unwilling to remain in it but trap is always preceded by ones own choice of entrance we must assume very wide freedom of choice on the part of thetan since it is almost impossible to conceive how thetan could get himself trapped even though he consented to it by actual demonstration thetan goes through walls barriers vanishes space appears anywhere at will and does other remarkable things it must be then that an individual can be trapped only when he considers that he is trapped and in view of the fact that the totality of existence is based upon his own considerations we find that the limitations he has must have been invited to himself otherwise they could not be eradicated by the individual under processing since the only one that is present with the preclear is the auditor the preclear by processing can resolve all of his difficulties without going and finding other persons or consulting other universes thus the totality of entrapment aberrationeven injury torture insanity and other distasteful itemsis basically considerations thetan is making and holding right now in present time this must be the case since time itself is postulate or consideration on his own part the greatest philosophical clamor or quarrel has been waged around the subject of knowledge and there is nothing preposterous on the subject of knowledge that cannot be found in philosophical text the superiority and ascendancy of scientology depends upon the fact that it has transcended this philosophical quarrel on the subject of knowingness and scientology contains in itself the basics of knowledge by knowledge we mean assured belief that which is known information instruction enlightenment learning practical skill by knowledge we mean data factors and whatever can be thought about or perceived the reason why knowledge has been misunderstood in philosophy is that it is only half the answer there is allness to knowledge by definition knowledge is that which is perceived or learned or taken from another source this patently then means that when one learns he is being an effect we see in axiom 10 that the highest purpose in the universe is the creation of an effect this is in direct contradiction to knowledge although one of course can know how to create an effect opposed to knowledge we have the neglected half of existence which is the creation of knowledge the creation of data the creation of thought the causative consideration self evolved ideas as opposed to ideas otherwise evolved the reason scientology is such fascinating study is that it takes apart the other fellows ideas and permits one to create some of his own scientology gives us the common denominators of objects energies spaces universes livingness and thought itself there is cause and effect cause could be defined as emanation it could be defined also for purposes of communication as sourcepoint if you consider river flowing to the sea the place where it began would be the sourcepoint or cause and the place where it went into the sea would be the effectpoint and the sea would be the effect of the river the man firing the gun is cause the man receiving the bullet is effect the one making statement is causing communication the one receiving the statement is the effect of the communication almost all anxieties and upsets in human relations come about through an imbalance of cause and effect one must be willing at once to cause new data statements assumptions considerations and to receive ideas assumptions considerations so great is the anxiety of thetan to be an effect that he closely approaches those things which can cause an effect upon him thus thetan becomes trapped on the face of it so fewthetans make causative data and so many receive data that it would seem in view of the fact that thetan can be touched only by his own consideration that thetans are more anxious for effects than to be cause it is learned under close experiment that there is nothing thetan actually disdains on an effect level he pretends not to like or enjoy certain effects and protests against them but he knows very well that the mechanism of protest causes the effect to approach more closely as general rule the prevailing anxiety then is to be an effect not to be cause the entire subject of responsibility is study of cause and effect in that person who wants responsibility is anxious to be an effect only and person who can assume responsibility must also be willing to be causative thetan can be swung into state of consideration by observing that it is commonly held by others this keeps him in the universe and this keeps him being effect study investigation receiving education and similar activity are all effect activities and result in the assumption of less responsibility thus while it is true that thetan cannot actually get into trouble he can by agreeing with the current agreed upon thought in the universe where he finds himself take pattern of thinkingness which makes him less effective because he wishes to be an effect if he feels he must gather all of his data from elsewhere he is then the effect of knowledge the effect of universes and postulates and he tends to reduce his own ability to form or make knowledge in scientology we can communicate in full these circumstances since we are only calling to attention the pattern which an individual already himself holds thus we are not actually teaching him anything we are only pointing out things he has already agreed with or himself caused it is not true that an individual is responsible for everything that happens to him when an individual wishing many interesting effects chooses to go into many universes or traps he can become confused about what he is doing where he is or what it is all about scientology points out what can be seen or changed from persons own viewpoint to bring about change in his own condition as an example thetan has come to believe that the right way to get along in life is to do just as father did this is an invitation to being in fathers universe later on he changes his mind about this but he finds himself still in fathers universe and doesnt like it he would be more effective more capable if he were not now in fathers universe customarily in these unenlightened times he waits for death to separate himself from the environment in which he finds himself and puts up with it until then it is not necessary to do this now that we have scientology he can at any moment given the proper steerage vacate any trap in which he finds himself and begin again on new series of considerations we cannot then talk about knowledge as totality it is single datum the thirst for knowledge would be the thirst for other thetans postulates and would lead one to forget that he himself has been party to the making of these postulates and that he himself had to follow certain course in order to put himself in reach of other thetans postulates translators note lacking proper english word for causative thinking the word postulate has been used in slight difference to its english definition if there is word in your language which means selfimpulsion or creation of thought use that instead of postulate because one is the effect of knowledge causing data considerations or facts to come into being separates one in distance from being an effect if one is very anxious to be an effect and if this is his basic consideration he will not take well to causing information to come into existence but in order to get him out of the traps in which he finds himself it is necessary to some degree that he do socausing few barriers or traps the individual then loses control over barriers or traps wishing to be an effect of course he must lose control of barriers and traps otherwise he cannot be entrapped by them the thing to do to free him from trap is to find what parts of the trap he himself is willing to own or have or possess this places the barriers which can be spaces energy movements or obstacles under his control and his postulating that he can have or possess this or that causes him to be willing to be or occupy the trap and the moment this occurs he is longer in the trap or even if he is still in it to some degree he does not object to it and can leave it when he wishes the way to paralyze nation entirely and to make it completely ungovernable would be to forbid education of any kind within its borders and to inculcate into every person within it the feeling that he must not receive any information from anybody about anything to make nation governable it is necessary to hold kindly view of education and to honor educative persons and measures to conquer land it is not necessarily efficient to overwhelm them with guns once this is done it is necessary to apply educative measures in order to bring about some sort of agreement amongst the people themselves as well as between the conqueror and the subdued only in this way could one have society civilization or as we say in scientology smoothly running game in other words two extremes could be reached neither one of which is desirable by the individual the first extreme could be reached by emphasis only upon self created data or information this would bring about not only lack of interpersonal relations but would also bring about an anxiety to have an effect which would as it does in barbaric peoples result in social cruelty unimaginable in civilized nation the other extreme would be to forbid in its entirety any selfcreated information and to condone only data or considerations generated by others than self here we would create an individual with responsibility so easily handled that he would be only puppet selfcreated data is then not bad thing neither is education but one without the other to hold it in some balance will bring about nogame condition or nocivilization just as individuals can be seen by observing nations so we see the african tribesman with his complete contempt for truth and his emphasis on brutality and savagery for others but not himself is nocivilization and we see at the other extreme china slavishly dedicated to ancient scholars incapable of generating within herself sufficient rulers to continue without bloodshed nation we have noted the individual who must be the only one who can make postulate or command whose authority is dearer to him than the comfort or state of millions and have suffered from such men napoleon hitler kaiser wilhelm frederick of prussia genghis khan attila we have known too the scholar who has studied himself blind and is the worlds greatest authority on government or some such thing who yet cannot himself manage his bank account or dog with any certainty here we have in either case total imbalance the worldshaker is himself unwilling to be any effect of any kind and all the men named here were arrant personal cowards and we have the opposite man who would not know what you were talking about if you told him to get an idea of his own we see another example of this in the fundamental laws of warfare body of troops to be effective must be able to attack and to defend its implements must be divided 50 for attack and 50 for defense in other words even in crude activity such as warfare we find that successful outcome is possible unless the troops can devote half of their energies to attack and half of them to defense in the much broader view of life we discover on any dynamic that success depends or game depends or activity depends or life itself depends upon being willing to be cause equally in ratio to being willing to be an effect he who would give must be willing to receive he who would receive must be willing to give when these tenets are violated the most fundamental principle of human relationships is violated and the result is nogame condition such as aberration insanity antisocialness criminality inactivity laziness tiredness maniafanaticism and all the other things against which men protest but imbalances between cause and effect also enter randomities into the game of life and cannot be neglected in their potential for creating game any information is valuable to the degree that you can use it in other words any information is valuable to the degree that you can make it yours scientology of all the sciences does not teach you it only reminds you for the information was yours in the first place it is not only the science of life but it is an account of what you were doing before you forgot what you were doing know and notknow it is the basic mechanism of thinkingness whether one is postulating or receiving information that one retain ones ability to know it is equally important that one retain ones ability to notknow you will discover that most people are trying not to remember in other words they are trying to notknow education can only become burdensome when one is unable to notknow it it is necessary that one be able to create to receive to know and to notknow information data and thoughts lacking any one of these skills for they are skills matter how native they are to the individual one is apt to get into chaos of thinkingness or creatingness or livingness you can look at any eccentric or aberrated person and discover rapidly by an inspection of him which one of these four factors he is violating he either is unable to know or not know his own created thoughts or he is unable to know or notknow the thoughts of others somewhere for some reason best known to him in his anxiety to be part of the game he has shelved lost one of these abilities time is process of knowing in the present and notknowing in the future or the past remembering is the process of knowing the past predicting of knowing the future forgetting is the process of notknowing the past and being without goals is the process of notknowing the future exercises in these various items rehabilitate not only the sanity or ability of the individual but his general capability in living and playing the game the goal of scientology the end object of scientology is not the making into nothing of all of existence or the freeing of the individual of any and all traps everywhere the goal of scientology is making the individual capable of living better life in his own estimation and with his fellows and the playing of better gamepab 87 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics

1956 s c i n t l g translators edition by l ron hubbard phd ce continued from pab 86 scientology processing scientology is applied in many ways to many fields one particular and specialized method of application of scientology is its use on individuals and groups of people in the eradication of physical illnesses deriving from mental states and the improvement of their abilities and intelligence by processing is meant the verbal exercising of patient preclear in exact scientology processes there is great deal of terminology and precision in these processes and their use and they are not combinable with older mental activities such as psychiatry psychology psychoanalysis yoga massage etc however these processes are capable of addressing or treating the same ills of the mind as are delineated by older methodology with the addition that scientology is alone in its ability to successfully eradicate those psychosomatic ills to which it is addressed and is the only science or study known which is capable of uniformly producing marked and significant increases in intelligence and general ability scientology processing amongst other things can increase the intelligence quotient of an individual his ability or desire to communicate his social attitudes his capability and domestic harmony his fertility his artistic creativity his reaction time and his health an additional sphere of activity allied to processing is preventive scientology in this branch of processing an individual is inhibited or restrained from assuming states lower than he has already suffered from in other words the progress of tendencies neuroses habits and deteriorating activities can be halted by scientology or their occurrence can be prevented this is done by processing the individual on standard scientology processes without particular attention to the disability involved scientology processing is called auditing by which the auditor practitioner listens and commands the auditor and the preclear patient are together outofdoors or in quiet place where they will not be disturbed or where they are not being subjected to interrupting influences the purpose of the auditor is to give the preclear certain and exact commands which the preclear can follow and perform the purpose of the auditor is to increase the ability of the preclear the auditors code is the governing set of rules for the general activity of auditing the code follows the auditors code1 do not evaluate for the preclear 2 do not invalidate or correct the preclears data 3 use the processes which improve the preclears case 4 keep all appointments once made 5 do not process preclear after 10 pm 6 do not process preclear who is improperly fed 7 do not permit frequent change of auditors 8 do not sympathize with the preclear 9 never permit the preclear to end the session on his own independent decision 10 never walk off from preclear during session 11 never get angry with preclear 12always reduce every communication lag encountered by continued use of the same question or process 13 always continue process as long as it produces change and longer 14 be willing to grant beingness to the preclear 15 never mix the processes of scientology with those of various other practices 16always remain in good twoway communication with the preclear during sessions the auditors code governs the activity of the auditor during sessions the activity of the scientologist in general is governed by another broader code the code of scientologist as scientologist i pledge myself to the code of scientology for the good of all 1 to hear or speak word of disparagement to the press public or preclears concerning any of my fellow scientologists our professional organization or those whose names are closely connected to this science 2 to use the best i know of scientology to the best of my ability to better my preclears groups and the world 3 to refuse to accept for processing and to refuse to accept money from any preclear or group i feel i cannot honestly help 4 to punish to the fullest extent of my power anyone misusing or degrading scientology to harmful ends 5 to prevent the use of scientology in advertisements of other products 6 to discourage the abuse of scientology in the press 7 to employ scientology to the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics 8 to render good processing sound training and good discipline to those students or peoples entrusted to my care 9 to refuse to impart the personal secrets of my preclears 10 to engage in unseemly disputes with the uninformed on the subject of my profession as it can be seen both of these codes are designed to protect the preclear as well as scientology and the auditor in general as these codes evolve from many years of observation and experience by great number of people it can be said that they are intensely important and are probably complete failure to observe them has resulted in failure of scientology scientology can do what it can do only when it is used within the limits of these two codes thus it can be seen that the interjection of peculiarities or practices by the auditor intoscientology processing can actually nullify and eradicate the benefits of that processing any hope or promise in scientology is conditional upon its good use by the individual and its use in particular within the limits of these two codes the conditions of auditing certain definite conditions must prevail and certain methodology must be followed in order that processing may be beneficial to its fullest extent probably the first condition is good grasp of scientology as science and its mission in the world the second condition would be relaxed state of mind on the part of the auditor and the confidence that his use of scientology upon the preclear will not produce harmful result the third requisite should be finding preclear by this it is literally meant that one should discover somebody willing to be processed and having discovered one so willing should then make sure that he is aware that he is there being processed the fourth requisite would be quiet place in which to audit with every precaution taken that the preclear will not be interrupted or burst in upon or unduly startled during processing all requisites for auditing from here on are entirely concerned with procedures and processes by auditing procedure is meant the general model of how one goes about addressing preclear this includes an ability to place one question worded exactly the same way over and over again to the preclear matter how many times the preclear has answered the question it should include the ability to acknowledge with good and all right every time preclear executes or completes the execution of command it should include the ability to accept communication from the preclear when the preclear has something to say the auditor should acknowledge the fact that he has received the preclears communication and should pay some attention to the communication procedure also includes the ability to sense when the preclear is being overstrained by processing or is being unduly annoyed and to handle such crises in the session to prevent the preclear from leaving an auditor should also have the ability of handling startling remarks or occurrences by the preclear an auditor should also have the knack of preventing the preclear from talking obsessively since prolonged conversation markedly reduces the havingness of the preclear and the sooner long dissertations by the preclear are cut off the better for the session in general processes as distinct from procedures consist of utilizing the principle of the gradient scale to the end of placing the preclear in better control of himself his mind the people and the universe around him by gradient scale is meant proceeding from simplicity toward greater difficulty giving the preclear always more than he can do but giving him as much as he can do until he can handle great deal the idea here is to give the preclear nothing but wins and to refrain from giving the preclear loses in the game of processing thus it can be seen that processing is team activity and is not itself game whereby the auditor opposes and seeks to defeat the preclear and the preclear seeks to defeat the auditor for when this condition exists there are little results in processing the earliest stage of auditing consists in taking over control of the preclear so as to restore to the preclear more control of himself than he has had the most fundamental step is then location whereby the preclear is made to be aware of the fact that he is in an auditing room that an auditor is present and that the preclear is being preclear those conditions will become quite apparent if one realizes that it would be very difficult for to process father father is not likely to recognize anything else than the boy he raised in his auditor therefore the father would have to be made aware of the fact that the was competent practitioner before the father could be placed under control in processing one of the most elementary commands in scientology is look at who am i after preclear has been asked to do this many times until he can do so quickly and accurately and without protest it can be said that the preclear will have found the auditorthe preclear is asked by the auditor to control which is to say start change and stop the anatomy of control anything he is capable of controlling in very bad case this might be very small object being pushed around on table being started and changed and stopped each time specifically and only at the auditors command until the preclear himself realizes that he himself can start change and stop the object sometimes four or five hours spent in this exercise are very well spent on very difficult preclear the preclear is then asked to start change and stop his own body under the auditors specific and precise direction in all of his commands the auditor must be careful never to give second command before the first one has been fully obeyed preclear in this procedure is walked around the room and is made to start change the direction of and stop his body one of these at time in emphasis until he realizes that he can do so with ease only now could it be said that session is well in progress or that preclear is securely under the auditors command it should be noted especially that the goal of scientology is better selfdeterminism for the preclear this rules out at once hypnotism drugs alcohol or other control mechanisms used by other and older therapies it will be found that such things are not only not necessary but they are in direct opposition to the goals of greater ability for the preclear the principal points of concentration for the auditor now become the ability of the preclear to have the ability of the preclear to notknow and the ability of the preclear to play game an additional factor is the ability of the preclear to be himself and not number of other people such as his father his mother his marital partner or his children the ability of the preclear is increased by addressing to him the process known as the trio these are three questions or rather commands 1 look around here and tell what you could have 2 look around here and tell what you would permit to remain in place 3 now look around and tell with what you could dispense 1 above is used usually about ten times then 2 is used five times and 3 is used once this ratio of ten five and one would be an ordinary or routine approach to havingness the end in view is to bring the preclear into condition whereby he can possess or own or have whatever he sees without further conditions ramifications or restrictions this is the most therapeutic of all processes as elementary as it might seem it is done without too much twoway communication or discussion with the preclear and it is done until the preclear can answer question one two and three equally well it should be noted at once that twenty five hours of use of this process by an auditor upon preclear brings about very high rise in tone by saying twentyfive hours it is intended to give the idea of the length of time the process should be used as it is strain on the usual person to repeat the same question over and over it will be seen that an auditor should be well disciplined or very well trained before he audits in the case of preclear who is very unable cant have is substituted for have in each of the above questions for few hours until the preclear is ready for the trio in its have form this cancant is the plus and minus aspect of all thought and in scientology is called by specialized word dichotomy the rehabilitation of the ability of the preclear to notknow is also rehabilitation of the preclear in the time stream since the process of time consists of knowing the moment and not knowing the past and notknowing the future simultaneously this process like all other scientology processes is repetitive the process is run ordinarily only after the preclear is in very good condition and is generally run in an exterior wellinhabited place here the auditor without exciting public comment indicates person and asks the preclear can you not know something about that person the auditor does not permit the preclear to not know things which the preclear already doesnt know the preclear notknows only thosethings which are visible and apparent about the person this is also run on other objects in the environment such as walls floors chairs and other things the auditor should not be startled when for the preclear large chunks of the environment start to disappear this is ordinary routine and in effect the preclear should make the entirety of the environment disappear at his own command the environment does not disappear for the auditor the end goal of this not know process is the disappearance of the entire universe under the preclears control but only for the preclear it will be discovered while running this that the preclears havingness may deteriorate if this happens he was not run enough on the trio before he was run on this process it is only necessary in such case to intersperse look around here now and tell what you could have with the not know command to keep the preclear in good condition drop of havingness is manifested by nervous agitation obsessive talk or semi unconsciousness or dopiness on the part of the preclear these manifestations indicate only reduction of havingness the reverse of the question here is tell something that you would be willing to have that person indicated by the auditor notknow about you both sides of the question have to be run audited this process can be continued for twenty five hours or even fifty or seventyfive hours of auditing with considerable benefit so long as it does not react too violently upon the preclear in terms of loss of havingness it should be noted that in running either havingness or notknow on preclear the preclear may exteriorize in other words it may become apparent either by his observation or because the preclear informs him that the auditor has exteriorized preclear under the parts of man section there is an explanation of this phenomenon in modern auditing the auditor does not do anything odd about this beyond receive and be interested in the preclears statement of the fact the preclear should not be permitted to become alarmed since it is usual manifestation preclear is in better condition and will audit better exteriorized than in his head understanding that an actual ability to notknow is an ability to erase by self command the past without suppressing it with energy or going into any other method is necessary to help the preclear it is the primary rehabilitation in terms of knowingness forgetting is lower manifestation than notknowingnesspab 88 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office brunswick house 83 palace gardens terrace london w8 _____________________________________________________________________ 12 june 1956 scientology translators edition by l ron hubbard phd ce continued from pab 87 the conditions of auditing concluded the third ability to be addressed by the auditor is the ability of the preclear to play game first and foremost in the requisites to play game is the ability to control one must be able to control something in order to participate in game therefore the general rehabilitation of control by starting changing and stopping things is rehabilitation in the ability to play game when preclear refuses to recover it is because the preclear is using his state as game and does not believe that there is any better game for him to play than the state he is in he may protest if this is called game nevertheless any condition will surrender if the auditor has the preclear invent similar conditions or even tell lies about the existing condition inventing games or inventing conditions or inventing problems alike rehabilitate the ability to play game chief amongst these various rehabilitation factors are control start change and stop problems and the willingness to overwhelm or be overwhelmed one ceases to be able to have games when one loses control over various things when one becomes short of problems and when one is unwilling to be overwhelmed in other words to lose or to overwhelm to win it will be found while running havingness as in the trio above that one may run down the ability to play game since havingness is the reward of game in part in the matter of problems it will be seen that these are completely necessary to the playing of game the anatomy of problem is intention versus intention this is of course in essence the purpose of all games to have two sides each one with an opposed intention technically problem is two or more purposes in conflict it is very simple to detect whether or not the preclear is suffering from scarcity of games the preclear who needs more games clutches to himself various present time problems if an auditor is confronted with preclear who is being obsessed by problem in present time he knows two things i that the preclears ability to play game is low and 2 that he must run an exact process at once to rehabilitate the preclear in session it often happens at the beginning of an auditing session that the preclear has encountered heavy present time problem between sessions the preclear must always be consulted before the session is actually in progress as to whether or not he has anything worrying him to preclear who is worried about some present time situation or problem other process has any greater effectiveness than the following one the auditor with very brief discussion of theproblem asks the preclear to invent problem of comparable magnitude he may have to reword this request to make the preclear understand it completely but the auditor wants in essence the preclear to invent or create problem he considers similar to the problem he has if the preclear is unable to do this it is necessary then to have him lie about the problem which he has lying is the lowest order of creativeness after he has lied about the problem for short time it will be found that he will be able to invent problems he should be made to invent problem after problem until he is longer concerned with his present time problem the auditor should understand that preclear who is now willing to do something about the problem has not been run long enough on the invention of problems of comparable magnitude as long as the preclear is attempting to do something about the problem the problem is still of obsessive importance to him session can be continued successfully until such present time problem is entirely flat and it has been the experience that when present time problem was not completely eradicated by this process that the remainder of the session or indeed the entire course of auditing may be interrupted when preclear does not seem to be advancing under auditing thing which he does markedly and observedly it must then be supposed that the preclear has present time problem which has not been eradicated and which must be handled in auditing although the auditor gives the preclear to understand that he too believes this present time problem is extremely important the auditor should not believe that this process will not handle any present time problem since it will this process should be done on some preclears in company with the trio if the preclear is asked to lie about or invent problem of comparable magnitude and while doing so becomes agitated or unconscious or begins to talk wildly or obsessively it must be assumed that he will have to have some havingness run on him until the agitation or manifestation ceases so that the problem of comparable magnitude process can be resumed another aspect of the ability to play game is the willingness to win and the willingness to lose an individual has to be willing to be cause or willing to be an effect as far as games are concerned this is reduced to willingness to win and willingness to lose people become afraid of defeat and afraid of failure the entire anatomy of failure is only that ones postulates or intentions are reversed in action for instance one intends to strike wall and strikes it that is win one intends not to strike wall and doesnt strike it that is again win one intends not to strike wall and strikes it that is lose one intends to strike wall and cant strike it this is again lose it will be seen in this as well as other things that the most significant therapy there is is changing the mind all things are as one considers they are and in other way if it is sufficiently simple to give the definition of winning and losing so it is simple to process the matter this condition is best expressed it appears in processing by process known as overwhelming an elementary way of running this is to take the preclear outside where there are numbers of people to observe and indicating person to ask the preclear what could overwhelm that person when the preclear answers this he is asked about the same person what could that person overwhelm he is then asked as the third question look around here and tell what you could have these three questions are run one after the other then another person is chosen and then the three questions are asked again this process can be varied in its wording but the central idea must remain as above the preclear can be asked what would you permit to overwhelm that person and what would you permit that person to overwhelm and of course look around here and tell what you could have this is only one of number of possible processes on the subject of overwhelming but it should be noted that asking the preclear to think of things which would overwhelm him could be fatal to the case where overwhelming is handled the preclear should be given detached view counterposition to havingness processes but one which is less therapeutic is separateness one asks the preclear to look round and discover things which are separatefrom things this is repeated over and over it is however destructive of havingness even though it will occasionally prove beneficial it will be seen that havingness barriers notknowingness being in present time and not in the past or the future purposes problems antagonists or intentioncounterintention and separateness freedom will cover the anatomy of games it is not to be thought however that havingness addresses itself only to games many other factors enter into it in amongst all of these it is of the greatest single importance one addresses in these days of scientology the subjective self the mind as little as possible one keeps the preclear alert to the broad environment around him an address to the various energy patterns of the mind is less beneficial than exercises which directly approach other people or the physical universe therefore asking preclear to sit still and answer the question what could you have when it is answered by the preclear from his experience or on the score of things which are not present is found to be nontherapeutic and is found instead to decrease the ability and intelligence of the preclear this is what is known as subjective inside the mind only process these are the principal processes which produce marked gains there are other processes and there are combinations of processes but these given here are the most important scientologist knowing the mind completely can of course do many tricks with the conditions of people to improve them one of these is the ability to address psychosomatic illness such as crippled leg which having nothing physically wrong with it yet is not usable the auditor could ask the preclear tell lie about your leg with possible relief of the pain or symptom asking the preclear repeatedly look around here and tell something your leg could have would undoubtedly release the somatic asking the preclear with the bad leg what problem could your leg be to you or desiring him to invent problem of comparable magnitude to your leg would produce distinct change in the condition of the leg this would apply to any other body part or organ it would also apply strangely enough to the preclears possessions if preclear had vehicle or cart which was out of repair or troublesome to him one could ask him what problem could cart be to you and thus requesting him to invent many such problems one would discover that he had solved his problems with the cart there is the phenomenon in existence that the preclear already has many set games when one asks him to give the auditor problems he already has the manifestations of asising or erasing taking place thought erases therefore the number of problems or games the preclear would have would be reduced by asking him to recount those which he already has asking the preclear to describe his symptoms is far less than therapeutic and may result in worsening of those symptoms contrary to what some schools of thought have believed in the past but which accounts for their failures there are specific things which one must avoid in auditing these follow 1 significances the easiest thing thetan does is change his mind the most difficult thing he does is handle the environment in which he finds himself situated therefore asking thetan to run out various ideas is fallacy it is mistake asking the preclear to think over something can also be an error asking preclear to do exercises which concern his mind alone can be entirely fatal preclear is processed between himself and his environment if he is processed between himself and his mind he is processed up too short view and his condition will worsen 2 twoway communication there can be far too much twoway communication or far too much communication in an auditing session communication involves the reduction of havingness letting preclear talk on and on or obsessively is to let preclear reduce his havingness the preclear who is permitted to go on talking will talk himself down the tone scale and into bad condition it is better for the auditor simply and discourteously to tell preclear to shut up than to have the preclear run himself out of the bottom on havingness you can observe this for yourself if you permit person who is not too able to talk about his troubles he will begin to talk more and more hecticly he is reducing his havingnesshe will eventually talk himself down the tone scale into apathy at which time he will be willing to tell you as you insist upon it that he feels better when as matter of fact he is actually worse asking preclear how do you feel now can reduce his havingness since he looks over his present time condition and asises some mass 3 too many processes it is possible to run preclear on too many processes in too short time with reduction of the preclears recovery this is handled by observing the communication lag of the preclear it will be discovered that the preclear will space his answers to repeated question differently with each answer when long period ensues between the question and his answer to the question second time he is said to have communication lag the communication lag is the length of time between the placing of the question by the auditor and the answering of that exact question by the preclear it is not the length of time between the placing of the question by the auditor and some statement by the preclear it will be found that the communication lag lengthens and shortens on repeated question the question on the tenth time it has been asked may detect significant lag this is the time to stop asking that question since it now has appreciable communication lag one can leave any process when the communication lag for three successive questions is the same in order to get from one process to another one employs communication bridge which to marked degree reduces the liability of too many processes communication bridge is always used before question is asked the preclear should have the question discussed with him and the wording of the question agreed upon as though he were making contract with the auditor the auditor says that he is going to have the preclear do certain things and finds out if its all right with the preclear if the auditor asks him to do these things this is the first part of communication bridge it precedes all questions but when one is changing from one process to another the bridge becomes bridge indeed one levels out the old process by asking the preclear whether or not he doesnt think it is safe to leave that process now one discusses the possible benefit received from the process and then tells the preclear that he is longer going to use that process now he tells the preclear he is going to use new process describes the process and gets an agreement on it when the agreement is achieved then he uses this process the communication bridge is used at all times the last half of it the agreement on new process is used always before any process is begun 4 failure to handle the present time problem probably more cases are stalled or found unable to benefit in processing because of the neglect of the present time problem as covered above than any other single item 5 unconsciousness dopiness or agitation on the part of the preclear is not mark of good condition it is loss of havingness the preclear must never be processed into unconsciousness or dopiness he should always be kept alert the basic phenomenon of unconsciousness is flow which has flowed too long in one direction if one talks too long at somebody he will render him unconscious in order to wake up the target of all that talk it is necessary to get the unconscious person to do some talking it is simply necessary to reverse any flow to make unconsciousness disappear but this is normally cared for in modern scientology by running the trio above books on auditing are available from the hubbard association of scientologists international brunswick house 83 palace gardens

19 june 1956 s c i n t l g revision of translators edition well we have finally come to the end of the translators edition of scientology this book running for so many pabs undoubtedly brought to you many new aspects of scientology the reason for this lies in the fact that there has not been new book for some time and the research material has been piling up here undergoing recodification and so was included all in rush in the translators edition now for begins the job of rewriting the translators edition for book form since i believe you have noticed as i did many typographical errors the translators edition must also include on its rewrite considerable additional information on processing although i think you will agree with that it was real triumph to get the entirety of processing crammed into two pabs 87 and 88 but of course as always happens even those two pabs could stand some recodification and two or three very important processes and tips must be included in them it should be apparent to all of us that as this translators edition will go and is going into very many languages it may just happen that scientology will be represented entirely textbook wise by the translators edition and it may occur that in several of these rarer languages further text will be available this is very probably the case with one translation that is now in progress which is going to country of several hundred million people who of course could afford the few pence necessary for the booklet but who will probably be left without any further information of any kind as tip to translators here and there who are undertaking these translations the refurbished edition which is coming out in booklet form in english in few weeks should be consulted before your translation leaves your hand and goes to printer in your language one reason for this is the fact that the therapy section is not entirely complete and another reason for it is that some of the typographical errors unavoidable in getting out something quickly in the pabs will be entirely eradicated in the booklet thus if you are translating this you should begin at once from the pabs to hand and order immediately from the hasi l brunswick house 83 palace gardens terrace london w8 copy of the translators edition at the special pab price of 5d as the shilling is worth 14 american cents this is price of 70 cents however it will take forever to get to you unless you include twoandahalf shillings or an additional 35 cents for airmail postage so thus fast copy of the translators edition will come to you for 76d airmail or i dollar and 5 cents american wherever you are throughout the world do not for moment bother your translators with the matter of royalties all that i ask of you is that the translators edition text made up here in full without any cutting or editing has my byline on it and that it includes the addresses of the hasi in london and the unitedstates so you translators there is difficulty here of royalties i am not asking for any if you can get royalties for translating it they are yours furthermore translators i would not worry about somebody else translating it into the same language as you are translating it into that two editions might appear in the same language is of interest only to authors who are attempting to acquire royalties as you have herein the authors permission and need other special permission there is then possibility of legal conflict because you are publishing book somebody else is publishing in your language i suggest that the published title in your language is something like the fundamentals of thinking or scientology the fundamentals of thinking or if it translates better in your language the fundamentals of life or the fundamentals of mental science the word scientology should appear on the cover as it is already becoming known very broadly throughout the world the reason i make my byline condition is so that there can be royalty conflicts of any kind whatsoever if the book were published without byline or with some other authorship there could be royalty claims thus such release would be outside the grant made herein and so could be contested if such wildcat edition appeared i realize that the book is necessity to any person whose study of scientology is hampered by current life childhood spent with another language therefore the translators edition should be of considerable help do not for moment suppose that the hasi or myself have any grip on editors or publishers in other languages than english we cannot assist you on getting the book printed in for instance greece but with the manuscript translated and with your information that the textbooks on scientology are the most advanced material on the mind in the united states of america you should have difficulty in getting this book published it is up to you to place it therefore i call upon the initiative of anyone who has contacts in any country matter how small or in any language to translate the book and display all necessary initiative in getting into print in that country to give you some sort of an idea what these exact materials can do there is one small country right now which has had scientology addressed to it on the working mans level there is every obstacle in this country against the dissemination of material on thought or the mind all this country seems to have absorbed in the past was revolutionary materials any material offered to it that was constructive and told it to support its own government and told it to get civilized has hitherto been ignored by that country scientology in the form contained in the translators edition was disseminated into the teeth of an economic revolution in few short months thousands of people of the working class have not only absorbed scientology but are using scientology in their everyday work several members of their government have studied scientology in this cursory fashion and coincidentally or not new stability has come to that country which is amazing even to itself scientology has power to display that power it must be disseminated we have certain mission of civilizing the peoples of earth the first step to take in getting shoes on them is to translate the translators edition and release it in very cheap booklet form and make sure that it becomes disseminated in that area the translators edition does not of course contain all there is to know in scientology but it contains the essentials there is even material considerably in advance of that contained in the translators edition which the auditor the most practiced auditor will be happy to get his hands on so ending the translators edition did not end the trail of research and did not end

histories of dianetics and scientology organizations is apt to go in for organizational names organizational places numbers of members the general legal upsets attendant to any new type of organization on earth and other matters which are not even important the history of organizations in dianetics and scientology is history of people it is the history of number of people finding their feet finding their initiative and finding their way of life it could be said that the history of these organizations parallels the history of case levels the more we know the better we get the better we get the better we organize in 1950 i said that the subject would go as well as it worked i have reason to alter that view i have concentrated therefore on the skills and methods of training better auditors rather than upon stacks of legal papers many people in the field would have us believe that the legal papers were important they would have us believe that the levels of service offered by the organizations were important even more important than the progress of the science itself these people may have their opinion however my belief uttered in 1950 is the one which has won for today i am announcing to you that we have won organizationally the organizational structure of dianetics and scientology today is simple one there are three main central organizations these are the founding church at 1812 19th street nw of washington dc the hasi in the united states and in london at brunswick house 83 palace gardens terrace london w8 and the hdrf which can be contacted through box 242 in silver spring maryland usa to all intents and purposes these break down to be the hasi in london and the founding church in washington dc these train auditors audit preclears and sell books as well as do research and control the worldwide network of dianetics and scientology autonomous but dependent upon these organizations there are several hasi offices throughout the world and there are several churches of scientology directly connected to the founding church then there are large number of organizations autonomous in operation but dependent upon the central organizations for their authority such as the churches in california run by john mccormick san diego and others all of them grouped under the church of scientology of california operated by dr farber in angeles this church in turn is chartered and franchised by the church in washington there are operations and organizations autonomous but dependent upon the central organization on every continent of earth offices such as that maintained by margaret scholtz in south africa are halfway between an independent organization and hasi office it would not be possible here to list all the organizations such as mccormicks for it would require considerable amount of spaceanother type of organization is the group official groups of the hasi and official congregations of the various churches exist in very large numbers in the united states and great britain and elsewhere through the world to charter group one only needs to write the hasi exactly how many groups there are and exactly how many people are contained in these groups is not at this time matter of complete record but the number of groups and people is enormous there were people scattered around the world of whom the organization would never have heard had it not invented and released the associate membership we are hard put at this moment to get manufactured enough sanddoubletriangle badges to supply the avalanche of requests for them evidently many of the people in these groups while sharing the expenses of the group had never before communicated with the central organization it is doubtful if there was any restraint in their doing so but they conceived that their communication line through their local auditor and group secretary and president was completely adequate and so it very probably has been there are now more auditors in active practice throughout the world than there are psychoanalysts dying breed these auditors have more preclears than the psychoanalysts have patients but the comparison is not entirely possible since psychoanalytic patients are normally in need of mental therapy and are patients in fact whereas the clientele of auditors is for the most part composed of people interested in becoming more intelligent and more able now you may believe that all has been told about organizations when the existing state and numerousness of them has been reviewed nothing could be further from the fact for the survival of the subject itself it is vitally necessary to carry forward and maintain central organizations not only in washington and london but wherever auditors are trained to be auditors we have proven this over and over and over again the further the subjects dianetics and scientology go from source the less workable they become in the libraries and files of the central organizations of washington dc and london are thousands of reels of tape tens of thousands of case records millions of words of careful notes all of the books on the subject and all the results of 25 years of work more important than these in washington dc and london there are people who have been in continuous contact with these organizations so that point of their evolution is overlooked or missed and nothing learned about training or practice has been forgotten single auditor practicing somewhere away from this vast library and this enormous collection of records could hope to keep an equivalent technology yet that technology is available to him and must continue to be available from the central organizations now let give you some sort of an idea what these organizations do and why they exist in developing dianetics and scientology over the last 25 years great deal of the basic work was lost because there was central depository for its materials there is one whole textbook written in 1938 entirely missing now there are several hundred case records of the earliest work done that are missing because we have organization this longer occurs more important than this the central organizations are testing ground and repository of collected opinions of auditors for example in december i noticed that the clinical gains in the hubbard guidance centers in london and in washington all of which are carefully recorded and tabulated so carefully recorded and tabulated that the activity would be the envy of any vast university psychology department any place in the world showed lessening improvement in preclears for the same number of hours of auditing it took from december until late february to reach at and discover what we had suddenly dropped with the assistance of dr julia lewis in washington and her staff auditors and dr ann walker in london and her staff auditors i was able at length to isolate from the continuingly submitted records the one factor which had been omitted and which made lessening of case gains occur this factor was havingness once located we immediately applied ourselves to every possible means of handling havingness i at length isolated mest universe havingness as being the single advancing factor in these cases and this was borne out by these staffs now i have gone further than that but that is story of research not of organizationit has been discovered that we are developing technologies of training and codifying material at continuingly rapid rate but we can now completely guarantee to any student or old auditor coming in to either of the central organizations that 1 his case failures will thereafter cease to occur and that 2 his own case will come under his control every time we take an auditor in from the field and put him on staff we have to work him over matter how good he was in the first place within the central organizations at this time scientology is subject so workable and so well understood by staff that manner of confidence exists never before known now it is the job of the central organizations to push this knowhow out into the field and extend it as far as the last auditor and preclear that we contact through this chain the history of organizations the early history of organizations may be of interest at first to keep an organization running starting with the first organization the hubbard dianetic research foundation in new jersey one lrh had to work himself half to death at the rate of about twenty hours day even buying desks and hiring typists that was not because one lrh was the senior member of the board of directors he was not which added to his burdens not in actual control of the organization putting out nearly all of the energy to keep them running i discovered that we didnt have an organization we had some chaps signed up under legal directive from the government specifying who was supposed to occupy certain positions and carry forward certain responsibilities we even had general manager the best that we could procure from the business world later on we even had all the talent of kansas oil we had hot and cold running secretaries accountants so confused as to be in great demand by internal revenue and the very finest of printers and editors that money could buy but we didnt have an organization why because the entire concentration on advance was unfortunately heavy in my own hands i have had these people say that we ought to forget any new materials of any kind that we should not advance at all we should simply as millionaire once involved in these organizations once put it make the money these people did not compose an organization they did not have truth or sincerity in them they were man issue 1950 thing which by and large wasnt so hot as mechanical contraption on the staffs of these organizations there were some sincere and very worthwhile people these people tried hard these people worked hard these people tried to carry out the goals of dianetics and later scientology we owe these people very great deal they were operating in the main as individuals trying to wear halfadozen hats each and trying to help get show on the road and gradually i stopped working twenty hours day and only worked sixteen hours day and great deal of my activity passed into the hands of these very worthwhile people on staff but we were not yet an organization we were group with common goal and there are great differences between organizations and groups with common goals because we had legal name which could be bandied harassed and raised the devil with in courts everyone believed that we had an organization we didnt we had working hard and few guys god bless them working like mad and we had lot of business people riding the gravy train and banking needed funds to their own names in florida we were swamped to give you some idea of the enormity of the task we confronted we had for the first time in the history of man sailed out and along completely new line of approach in the field of life and religion without any background and with darned little support we were learning as we went other organization on the face of the earth has the shape which the organizations of dianetics and scientology were to attain eventually therefore we had to learn the know how of organization before we could have one naturally it was very easy to upset such an organization by simply upsetting the man whose name was on everything therefore all sorts of crazy things happened i was sued for divorce by women i wasnt married to my sanity was pronounced upon by people who had never seen or read my works some people in the organization the business peoplewere very loud on the subject of but those who were loudest will have been found to have been most interested in their own personal remunerations we didnt have an organization organizationally we had chaos why because we had to invent an organization before we could have one we actually had to create people before we had people who could run organizations and this i believe is one of the most difficult feats ever attempted in any field but we did it the first person to give any really active help in the field of research was girl trained in science at the university and that was mary sue hubbard we covered and reviewed the entirety of whole track phenomena and exteriorization phenomena between 1952 and 1954 in the fall of 1952 more actual assistance in england was given from there on it became more obvious that we had more and more able people on every hand my own work hours were lessening there were more people pitching in and actually doing the job they were supposed to do we were beginning to have something that looked like an organization now you understand that it doesnt matter what is written in the legal records of city state or country an organization is not something settled by sheaf of papers organizations are composed of people even governments forget this one and so drift down into chaos an organization is something which has its own spirit it is composed of people or living beings who are governed by certain rules and purposes and who know how to do their jobs that is an organization and when any of those factors are neglected it becomes thing even though it still has name and legal standing thus the years wore on the evolution was simple one i knew what i was doing and where i was going but i was just one guy then one by one others stepped up and put their shoulders against the wheel and began to shove effectively at first their efforts were scattered and sometimes even opposing but the efforts were sincere these few were then joined by others and these others gradually worked themselves out of their enturbulence and ceased to oppose and began to give effective assistance and all the while what we today call our organization was learning its own rules codes and knowhows it was gathering under itself group spirit at first it began to appear that any time person left his post the post was unfillable but little by little the organization itself began to recover the ability to create people who could fill its posts thus freeing key personnel for higher jobs then there was another aspect to organization this was the aspect of finance first only my own encouragement and letters and writings brought any real finance into what we were calling organization and even up to 1955 this state continued to be solvent organizations had to stage various stunts and special offers there was never moment when one could relax on the financial state of dianetics and scientology much had to be done there was very little with which to do it and very early in the game there were those who took its funds for themselves but this condition would not continue forever now i will tell you about another organization socalled and call it directly by name the ford foundation this group was founded and formed in the same year that the first book dianetics was issued 1950 in the six years following this group having had at its disposal in any single year more funds than have been available to all the people in dianetics and scientology combined from any source whatsoever has yet not advanced any real distance in realization of its goals this organization was supposed to study and found scientific understanding of man its goal was almost identical with the goal of the first foundation in dianetics six years later we find that this organization has spent hundreds of times as much money as the central organizations of dianetics and scientology and has yet to discover any single slightest advance in mans knowledge of man evidently collection of desks involved in shuffling research papers which didnt mean anything in the first place the ford foundation apparently has squandered the money needed so desperately by those of us who were actually sincere about where we were going and what we were doing the ford foundation after six years of shuffling has only one valuable paper in its entire files of which i have any knowledge that paper is report given by one of its own menwho officially attended an has hubbard certified auditor course in phoenix arizona and who said on paper and officially to the ford foundation that in scientology now existed all that they ever hoped to accomplish in the ford foundation yet here are these millions of dollars avalanching out in the expenditures from the ford foundation without any hope or promise of any kind for betterment of man this is not really criticism of the ford foundationit is only statement of how such foundations operate wonderfully financed beautifully sponsored perfectly connected with all the powers that be yet they are not organizations probably the type of organization which is handsomely endowed to study certain things is robbed at the outset of its purposes since the man who wanted the thing done was the man who gave some money to some others these others wanted the money is that enough comment in other words one of these tenets of organizational cohesion was violated before ink was dried upon the endowment for example there is an organization in california where else which was endowed by some millionaire who wanted all possible evidence corroborating spiritual phenomena the man to whom these funds were entrusted has used them from that day forward to actively disprove the activities and findings of rhine and has attacked all investigators as charlatans and has not added one single thing to the knowledge of spiritual phenomena but has balked all those who would so maybe we were fortunate in not being superlatively wellendowed group we have had to fight our way and that fightingness has given us the independence which we now discover in our midst we owe man anything farflung members of our organization often ask themselves if they think about it at all what they are buying with their book purchases or their courses or their processing for one thing they are buying the least costly and most important job of research which has ever been done on this planet the real reason that central organizations process people for fee and train people for fee is to disseminate the capabilities and abilities of scientology but the secondary reason which becomes primary in the central organizations is to buy organization itself and to advance the science the reason that we object to squirrels people like the communist association of dianetic auditors in california is because they do not pay their way we find their papers full of the materials which were hard won by myself and the central organizations and yet we have nothing but debits on our records to show that they passed our way these people have as their major fault cognizance of effort these people also have given us ample experience of financial irresponsibility people such as our best known squirrels are perfectly willing to snatch our hard won materials and misuse them but they are not willing to support the effort which brought these materials into being in other words their existence is parasitic completely aside from the perversion of materials this is what we have against them fortunately they number one in thousands their lies stupidities vilifications are all statement that they are unwilling to pay for what they use they are cheap the rest of us paid our way and we have won what have your dollars bought what have your pounds bought in washington dc in london in australia in new zealand and in south africa and in south america they have bought the knowhow of organization and the knowhow of the mind they have bought knowledge which man never before possessed and which man therefore considers priceless there is way one could put financial value on the information which we hold in our hands today yet that information has been purchased for less money than is spent on secretarial help in any given year by the ford foundation by all calculations this information should have cost billions of dollars it has not cost that because some of us were willing to work as hard as we worked in order to achieve it and are selfless enough to give it not at its market value but only at the desire of men to know and to be helped organizationally we have won what have we won we have won independence and initiative as organizations let tell you what has just happened this is important in scientology it is more important than few of us getting clearer than we are for six months the hasi in london andthe founding church in washington dc have existed on their own efforts have accumulated their own finance without any especial help or stunt for the heads of the 1956 organizations are assisted and helped by many but they are longer helped on an individual basis they are helped on an organizational basis this is very important thing for six months the hasi in london and the founding church in washington dc have been selfsupporting with little or assistance from stunts they are doing this because they themselves are giving service they are training better auditors than anyone before thought possible they are getting more results in their intensives than anyone could have found real two or three years ago what these two organizations are doing if done in department of major university in the united kingdom or the united states would cause headlines you would find people streaming from every other university of the world to find out just exactly how they were doing this incredible thing of raising intelligence and changing and increasing the abilities of man but this could never have happened in university since it required independent thought and action with compromise with vested interest these organizations are then today organizations they are organizations because they are giving service they are giving service to the people they are giving service to their membership they are giving service to themselves and they are financially responsible as themselves without any special stunts or actions rather than routine activities i hope you realize that this is the news that it is so this is the history of the organizations of dianetics and scientology it is history of bunch of people working like the devil with the work of one man and then increasing that knowledge and information and then finally beginning to pull together as team and at last existing as organizations powerful strong and calm i am proud of them and their peoplepab 91 professional

_____________________________________________________________________ 3 july 1956 the anatomy of failure two things are of paramount importance in scientology they are win and lose occupying the original chart of attitudes composed by myself in the autumn of 1951 win and lose have occupied ever since predominant place in processing preclear can be stuck in either wins or loses this might come as surprise that preclear could be stuck in win but the facts of case are that preclear is stuck in any reversal between intention or expectance one knows of the man who lives forever after his having won the race and one knows as well the man who lives forever after the failure of his business primarily the person who is living forever after in some sort of incident is living the survival of something which overwhelmed him rather than his own survival the anatomy of winning or losing either one is the anatomy of postulate and reverse postulate one intends to do something by making postulate that it will take place yet something else takes place this is reversal of postulate now let us consider exactly what failure is it is only failure of postulate it is the failure of an intention the intention is one thing the result of the intention is reverse this is failure one would say offhand that person who ran car into stone wall would have failure however this is simply social belief that one should not run cars into the wall there are four conditions which could be involved with running car into the wall running car into the wall is not failure without the addition of postulates one does not intend to run the car into the wall and yet runs it into the wall this is failure one intends to run the car into the wall and runs the car into the wall this is win one intends not to run the car into the wall and doesnt run it into the wall this is win one intends to run the car into the wall and doesnt run car into wall this is failure thus we can see that running the car into the wall or not running the car into the wall do not themselves establish except by public agreement as to the conditions of failure an actual failure the failure derives from failing to do what one intended to do when one does what one intends to do one has win when one intends to do one thing and accomplishes something else one has lose person is stuck in wins only when he intended to lose and won runner never expected to win he was simply part of the field most of his career and then spectacularly andalmost by accident he won it is certain that he will be stuck in that win therefore the only wins that person gets stuck in are those which were not intentional regret itself is entirely the study of the reversed postulate one intended to do something good and one did something bad similarly it could also happen that one intends to do something bad and accidentally did something good either incident would be regretted examples of the first condition are easy to conceive in the second category i once knew man who intended to get the best of woman of somewhat herculean proportions somewhere in this contest the woman fell ill and he healed her and did it to such an excellent degree that the woman to whom mercy was unknown thereafter promptly overwhelmed him entirely here we have the public belief that to heal is good but in this particular case it was regretted by the individual and would have been regretted even though he did not experience later loss it is an interesting commentary upon the mental anatomy of man that he seldom intends to do something good without actually accomplishing something good one can always go upstairs into doing well failures are the most marked when one intends to do something bad and doesnt accomplish it for instance gunman misses his enemy he generally lives to regret it because his intention basically was not for the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamicsthe definition of good it must be understood by the auditor that the preclear is not stuck in failures or wins the preclear is stuck in reversed postulates he intended to do one thing and another thing happened this is only aberrative when the other thing that happened was direct reverse there are several methods of running this particular phenomenon and it is very important one in the repertoire of the auditor the first and oldest method was rising scale processing in this process an individual was asked to get one of the lower postulates on the chart of attitudes and then carry it upward until he could get the higher idea in this particular case one would ask the preclear to get the idea of losing and would then ask him to change that as nearly as he could to the idea of winning this process might be improved by asking the preclear to get the idea of losing and then get the idea of being engaged in game and have him do this over and over until he could hold the idea of being engaged in game one would then have him get the idea of winning and would thereafter have him get the idea of being engaged in game you see both winning and losing are nogame conditions one can be as afraid of winning as of losing because one always loses when one wins or loses the difference being that one loses the game more modern idea of running this would be to get the preclear to make one postulate and then conceive that its reverse occurred then to have him say that defeats an example of this would be the classical example of telling the preclear command that wall to fall down now observe that it did not now decide to do it yourself this will demonstrate to him primarily the mechanism of how he comes to do everything himself because he knows that if he tells something else to do something it will disobey him and he will get lose an even more advanced method of running this would be to get the preclear to hold two ideas at the same time and have him place out in front of him person with the idea of living and person opposite him with the idea of dying when he can do this have him make the first person say to the second person die and have the second person live as result use various types of postulates until the person takes much less personally the idea of postulate becoming reversed in other words this and other mechanisms can be used to habituate the person to the idea that postulates can turn around and do something else as soon as he relaxes on this subject he will become much easier and less apprehensive about losing failure consists exactly of something else happening rather than the intentionan example of this we are taught that all men are nice to everyone that there is murder or insanity or upset anywhere in life and so gradually we intend that smooth uneventful and fruitful life will result then we discover that people do bad things to people that people nag us so that they impede us that our goals ambitions and accomplishments are not worthwhile in other peoples opinions and so we have failure here the failure is actually the failure of having right intention toward life what is the right intention toward life to be very very safe it is the intention to have what happens what will happen if one knows that life is going to be tricky cruel arduous and vicious at times then one is not surprised by it one does not hope so sanguinely or one does not intend so ferociously that all will be sweetness and light and one is not so dismayed when sweetness and light does not occur romantic novels teach us that the hero always wins and that good always triumphs now it so happens that the hero doesnt always win and that good does not always triumph on shorter view we can see villainy triumphing all about us the truth of the matter is that the villainy is sooner or later going to lose in an entirely different way than the villain expects one cannot go through life victimizing ones fellow beings and wind up in anything but trapthe victim himself however one doesnt observe this in the common course of life one sees the villains succeeding everywhere evidently amassing money cutting their brothers throat receiving the fruits of the courts and coming to rule over men without looking at the final consequence of this which is there just as certainly as the sun rises and sets one begins to believe that evil triumphs whereas one has been taught that only good triumphs this causes the person himself to have failure and actually causes his downfall the safe way to intend life to go on happening is the way life goes on happening much healthier attitude is to change life where one can change it and not be heartbroken because one has not changed it further in other words one can intend to change life for the better and can succeed with dianetics and scientology particularly he can accomplish this before dianetics and scientology he probably couldnt so it would not have been safe or healthy to expect to change life in any way but now he can at least change life in the sphere where he exists and thus that things can become better becomes an actuality it would be certain way to produce failed attitude of mind in person to indoctrinate him in one direction and have him experience the reverse in dianetics and scientology the auditor has maintained an optimistic attitude towards what is going to happen to his cases by and large this is justified but occasionally he intends to make somebody well and the person even though he became bit better continues to complain about his bad state of health this was much commoner four years ago than it is today when we understand more but unfortunately has resulted in series of failures for some auditors if an auditor who has experienced this will get the idea that he is going to make the patient well and then have the patient in mockup collapse and then get the idea that he is going to make the patient well and get the patient to collapse again and carry this out by old creative processing all of his past auditing failures will drop away as having importance the first and foremost lesson taught by failure is that ones postulate didnt stick there are several methods and processes of running postulates to practice their sticking but the foremost of these would be to run out the idea that one should be dismayed simply because something else happens actually if everything happened which you intended to happen there would be randomity or interest in life whatsoever people shudder back from the idea that their postulates and orders will always be obeyed they will not always be obeyed and that is what makes the game of life game otherwise it would be one long continuous win which is nogame conditionpab 92 professional auditors bulletin the oldest

_____________________________________________________________________ 10 july 1956 critique of psychoanalysis definition psychoanalysis is system of mental therapy developed by sigmund freud in austria in 1894 and which depends upon the following practices for its effects the patient is made to discourse free associate on and recall his childhood for years while the practitioner effects transfer of the patients personality to his own and searches for hidden sexual incidents believed by freud to be the only cause of aberration the practitioner reads sexual significance into all discourse and evaluates it for the patient along sexual lines the entirety of the cases of psychoanalysis have never been tabulated and little or testing has been done to establish the validity of the system markham the way of the mind page 32 it is the unkind fate of subjects which fail to be overhauled and criticized by later understandings such perhaps cheerfully may be the fate of dianetics and scientologyand i say cheerfullyif their improvement in later centuries leads to an even greater freedom and understanding for mankind but now and then it becomes necessary to eradicate from new subject things which it has inherited from an old and only because this has become necessary am i persuaded to tread upon the toes of the grandfather to dianetics and scientology it is necessary to understand first that we are actually indebted to psychoanalysis and its originator the debarred doctor sigmund freud my basic if unappreciated education in the field of the mind came from commander thompson of the medical corps of the us navy who was freuds personal student better than others then some sixtytwo years after freuds original declarations i could be considered qualified to criticize the failure of not only the basic work of freud but the later offshoots which while following his original tenets yet sought to expand information on psychoanalysis very few living analysts today have as direct connection with the subject as i do and there are few who can boast of the successes with the subject which i can for i have used psychoanalysis as practitioner and have achieved some certain successes with it were one to call success the sporadic eradication of the severe neurosis in known mental patient further there is my own enfranchisement by the freudians when they were all but obliterated in europe by russia having established then my possible qualifications to criticize and having compounded such right by having bettered the results of freud i feel it is necessary to overhaul rapidly the points of failure of psychoanalysis as we understand the mind today in the earliest beginnings of dianetics it is possible to trace considerable psychoanalytic influence there was the matter of ransacking the past the matter of believing with freud that if one could talk over his difficulties they would alleviate and there was the matter of concentrating on early childhood our first improvements on psychoanalysis itself consisted of the abandonment of talk alone and the direct address to the incident in its own area of time as mental image picture susceptible to erasure but many of the things which freud thought might exist such as life in the womb birth trauma we in dianetics and scientology confirmed and for them provided an adequate alleviation the discovery of the engram is entirely theproperty of dianetics methods of its erasure are also owned entirely by dianetics but both of these were pointed to by early freudian analysis and hypnotism it was in scientology and the anatomy of life that one departed entirely from the tenets and teachings and fundamentals of psychoanalysis and sprang forward into the actual causes of things for scientology unlike dianetics is not psychotherapy it is therefore from the dominance of scientology rather than from the viewpoint of dianetics that one can understand the failings of psychoanalysis its dangers and the reasons why it did not produce what it should have produced this is not to enter scientology as mental therapy but scientology is broad understanding of life and is certainly capable of looking at mental therapy and delineating its errors lack of general advance the first solid criticism of psychoanalysis is inherent in its failure to advance sciences are living things when they are based upon truths they advance and evolve psychoanalysis did not advance or did not evolve there is little if any difference between the writings of freud in 1894 and the declarations of analysts today unless it is deteriorated difference the writings of freud in the late nineteenth century were clearer and more precise than those which are published today the earlier writings of freud had in them the saving ingredient of humanity which is woefully lacking in later workers in the field of psychoanalysis the failure of psychoanalysis to expand to improve and to embrace other fields of livingness despite its ambitions is the clearest observation that can be made detrimental to psychoanalysis successful things expand disseminate and invade psychoanalysis has not and today is almost lost subject there are fewer analysts in the world today than there were fifteen years ago despite the enormous wages which could have been earned by them the complete structure of modern psychoanalysis is the same today as in 1894 in the face of successful subject one seldom finds newer and more brutal subjects arising and flourishing that psychoanalysis could be discarded in favor of russian psychiatry as practiced today in europe and the united states is terrible condemnation of psychoanalysis itself it must have failed to have made men this desperate the treatment of the insane today is far worse than it was two centuries ago and the brutality practiced under the name of mental healing cannot be regarded with equanimity by any civilized man we discover psychoanalysis to have been superseded by tyrannous sadism practiced by unprincipled men themselves evidently in the last stages of dementia this then is the end of the trail for psychoanalysisa world of failure and brutality today men who call themselves analysts are merrily sawing out patients brains shocking them with murderous drugs striking them with high voltages burying them underneath mounds of ice placing them in restraints sterilizing them sexually and generally conducting themselves much as their patients would were they given the chance it is up to us to realize then that psychoanalysis in its pure practice is dead the moment the spirit of humanity in which freud developed the work is betrayed by the handing over of patient to the merciless misconduct which passes today for treatment but completely aside from this general lack of advance there were certain definite flaws in psychoanalysis which we dianeticists and scientologists must inspect lest we fall into these errors and go the way of the analyst we have learned certain things in dianetics and scientology and we have learned several notdos which psychoanalysis considered must dos this article then is list and description of these overcommunicationcommunication has the power of eradicating spaces and masses communication can create spaces as well as eradicate space but it cannot create mass if any mass is created it is created by the command that it be created and is not created by the communication itself we have learned that possession of or contact with mass and the ability to tolerate mass are the bases of good therapy to use indiscriminately something which erases and vanquishes any and all masses is in direct argument with the very well measured results we are obtaining today using mass acquisition techniques if you wish to make this test you have only to take person who is somewhat disturbed and make him talk about his disturbance while there is point when he seems less agitated concerning the disturbance itself there is point when he as whole person is bettered beyond his initial state if this person is permitted or forced to talk he will bring himself lower and lower in tone all one needs to do is watch the emotional content of his communication to realize that he is going down in tone practical application is that person in disturbed state permitted to talk will not cease to be disturbed told to be quiet and given matter how remedy of his mass it will be discovered that he rapidly regains his equilibrium in practice it is far better to tell patient who is compulsively recounting his difficulties to shut up than to permit him to go on speaking in psychoanalysis it was pretended that patient only needed to talk about his difficulties to have them disappear naturally so long as his mass was not entirely unbalanced person not in bad condition would be able to talk away some minor difficulty without suffering badly from the result of the drop in mass freud has said that great many people were not to be saved or healed by psychoanalysis it is interesting that this entire category of people is included in the statement that they are very low on havingness or masses in other words when person was so low on masses that he could not afford to eradicate mass he could not then be healed by psychoanalysis but the strange part of it is that people who were fairly well off in mass at the end of two or fiveyear psychoanalytic sprint had been found to be so deficient in mass as to be almost impossible to deal with free association and all other communication means detailed by freud are only superficially therapeutic remedy of the tolerance of mass is therapeutic on all levels of case you may or may not be aware that psychoanalytic patient is supposed to talk hour in and hour out for years to his analyst before any recovery is experienced that recovery is thereafter experienced in most cases is very plain case to the scientologist of induced mass starvation twoway communication must be used sparingly and must be accompanied by replacement of those masses eradicated in the process otherwise communication is not therapeutic recalling second tenet of psychoanalysis was that all one had to do was to recall hidden incidents to have them disappear an analyst expected his patient to go on recalling endlessly and expected sooner or later that the patient would turn up some interesting bricabrac which was the basic difficulty in his case had the analyst known the character of the entire genetic line had he known of the countless billions of incidents which were hidden from his patient over and above minor secrets of presentlife childhood he would have abandoned this idea that the exposure of few hidden incidents would bring about recovery of the patient actually it is true that patient can be made little happier by recovering some lost moment he has forgotten but the condition is not stable and does not continue the analyst used to excess the idea of remembering we in scientology know the principle of knowingness and notknowingness and know that it is as important to be able tonotknow things as to know them the fixation on endless remembering as found in psychoanalysis would be very destructive to the patient and indeed in practice proved so even under the eyes of the more critical analyst it would have been far better had the analyst asked the person time and time again tell something you wouldnt mind forgetting however test of this on patient who is already deficient in havingness demonstrated the same phenomenon observed in over communication the patient under the impact of this command went down in tone but did satisfactorily remove several overt acts it can be considered with our experience in testing an impossibility to eradicate the difficulties of the past in an individual by making him endlessly recall his past we have the case histories and the tests and the careful observation necessary to establish this point beyond any contest transference we find another error in psychoanalysis under the heading of transference the actual definition of transference in psychoanalysis is sufficiently unstable to bring about considerable argument as to what is meant by transference in fact in dianetics we had to re establish an entirely different condition which we called valences to denote the shift from ones own personality into that of another transference in psychoanalysis was used to denote the transference of the patient into the valence of the practitioner this was the way which commander thompson described the phenomenon to and nothing has been learnt from later analysts to disprove this basic definition of freuds we know in dianetics and scientology that the acquisition of additional valences means more and less than scarcity of identities one wonders little at practitioner who would be so certain of his own high quality that he would demand that every patient assume the analysts identity this presents us with very amusing picture of an entire world full of analysts however there were other connotations to this thing called transference but their significance was never plumbed or solved in the field of psychoanalysis valence the assumption of the identity of another can be quite destructive to the personality of any person but such an action means only scarcity of identities requiring person to invent identities brings about drop in the number of personalities obsessively held or dramatized by that person however transference accidentally was not totally bad step but step actually in the right direction the analyst made the person aware of the fact that he could assume at least one more identity and this we suppose was the basis of all therapeutic results obtained by the use of transference but the loss of ones own personality to the extent of assuming yet another identitythat of the analystcould not have proved other than destructive to the personality of the patient and thus we must assume that the entire sphere of transference was an error as we increase this list you may find it questionable that psychoanalysis ever intended at any time to improve anyone if they used only those methods and mechanisms calculated to depress and enslave the patient however there was the saving grace of giving to the patients difficulties the attention of the analyst and this mixed with the ingredient of humanity mercy and kindness must have produced what results were produced by psychoanalysis concentration on sexthose in dianetics and scientology are aware of the existence of eight separate spheres of beingnessthe eight dynamicsand know that the second dynamic is only one of these eight they are also aware of the fact that concentration on one dynamic to the exclusion of the others cuts back the ability to live to just that degree that the concentration takes place in other words one who is concentrated on only one dynamic could be said to be only oneeighth alive as freud worked in very sexually inhibited era it is natural that he would pick upon something which was intensely aberrative to the people in his immediate vicinity furthermore he had racial fixation on sex fixation sufficiently pronounced to cause it to infect contagiously all modern european stock however to one who has adventured amongst barbarian peoples and who has inspected aberration in its many guises the concentration on sex as the sole offender as pretended in the libido theory of sigmund freud becomes unreal races which have sexual inhibitions of any kind are yet aberrated in fact i know of several savage races which find so little meaning in sex that they do not even bother to trace ancestry seriously and when they do wish to connect themselves with family connect themselves on the mothers side as one can be fairly certain what woman bore him when one is uncertain as to who influenced the birth from the masculine side yet these races free as the wind on the second dynamic are yet intensely aberrated in other quarters some are aberrated on the eighth dynamic of god some on the first of self the american indian for instance is enormously aberrated in the field of animals but not much inhibited in the field of sex it must have required considerable mental gymnasticism to have combed everything down to sex and when freud did so he did more therapeutically than to give stable datum to the confusion of the mind which other people living in sexually inhibited time could accept therefore the advancement of sex just as the advancement of lanterns or the advancement of chewing tobacco as the single source of human aberration could have brought tiny amount of stability to the confusions surrounding the problems of the mind but the concentration on sex is not true one and has led the psychoanalyst down many blind alley and has inhibited him from observing rationally and truthfully what is going on in his patients which is pity since if he had done this observation properly he would have discovered great deal more than he has discovered in the sixtytwo years of his existence later analysts sought to expand the second dynamic ideas of sigmund freud into social activities in other words they tried to go up to the third dynamic of groups but their search forward was not successful you see there is considerable amount of attention concentrated on sex but to say that everything stems from sex is to invalidate the ability of people to create themselves sex is simply low order massive level of creation true it is powerful one but people in the grip of the inspiration of work group activities religion very often experience far greater emotional or ecstatic impact than from sex which all things said is fun but not entire sex could have been tossed aside with ovids works and yet have left full mental science significances the reading of sexual significances into each and every action of person could not but continue to expand the grip sex already had upon the person thus it could be said that the freudian concentration on significances themselves was extremely detrimental to patients in general the more such significances added to case the less chance the case has to recover there is process in scientology known as assigning the reason why it is rather old process and is not particularly useful since it considerably reduces the mass tolerance of the individual one has the air about one give various reasons why the result of this is to add up an adequate number of significances to the individual and to desensitize his fixation on havingto know the reasons back of certain motions combinations and beingnesses today one could assign reasons why to the walls with considerable recovery as the total significance to existence is the significance that the being puts there the adding of significance to his life without adding as well games spirit havingness and other things could be considerable detriment to his happiness and has proven so in psychoanalysis to be concluded center staffron 14 july 1956 five types of valences rule has showed up never process

technical bulletin of 22 july 1956 i feel the urge to communicate to you the best news since 1950 i have whipped the problems of the whole track and memory of the past and can resolve the worst cases we have ever had that is huge statement but i have solved and can untangle in an intensive the problems of the vacuum and havingness plus memory and health and have just done so hence the exuberance also other auditors can solve these in case as well nibs has just cracked two sixyear standing black fives using some of this material and herbie parkhouse has had considerable luck with solids we are now capable of solving book one style cases to the extreme level of clear wild burst of enthusiasm is here intended i have to put the finishing touches on lot of things and the process is still slow25 to 75 hours but ive now done it and seen it done to worse cases than any youve had and thats fact okay its not simple it requires minute understanding of book one it would take 50 pages to explain all ive lately found about vacuums you havent seen the last of or of study but you will have seen the last of unsuccessful cases providing only that we have time and environment in which to audit them we can make homo novis and give grin to those who kept standing around bleating where are the clears we know more about life now than life doesfor fact since it was reaching we can communicate about the reactions the process is concerned with making it solid combined with effects it isnt easy it is wonderfully complex and delicate but it has been done and it is being done our cases gained but sometimes slumped why because an electronic vacuum restimulated on the track after sessions and robbed the cases havingness vacuum isnt hole its collapsed bank every lifetime bank is collapsed into vacuum the formula is 1 run pc on startchange and stop for hours until he is under auditors control in session and often exteriorized2 then run him with commands what are you looking at good make it solid he will eventually hit vacuum hed hit it faster on recall cant have but its too fast heres the tangle the vacuum is supercold mass or an electric shock this drank up bank electronically brainwashed him the energy drunk turned black hence black cases does not apply only to black cases however 3 run interspersed with solids and objective cant have on the room tell an effect object that drank bank could not have on you and tell an effect you could have on object object may be electrodes or supercold plate or even supercold glass caution handle one vacuum at time these vacuums go back for 76 trillion years they were the original brainwash thetans did to one another then psychiatrists on the whole track did expertly modern psychiatrists are punks modern shock too feeble to do more than restimulate old vacuums take the vacuum that comes up running solids or even recall cant have whatever it is and solve it as above this is delicate auditing if you restimulate vacuum too hard the whole track groups on it read book one add vacuums instead of word groupers use above and youll probably get through to success nibs did and i had given him less than you have here of course hes one

any auditor knows that the selfdeterminism of the preclear is reduced markedly and alarmingly by evaluating for the preclear on the subject of his own case in fact one can make test of this with the end product near insanity one has person tell him what the person is worried about in life and then one informs that person the reason why this is so and informs him with sufficient force and logic to bring about an utter conviction on the part of that person that this is the case what happens here is that one adds confusion to the case rather than otherwise all practitioner can hope to do is steer the person in certain directions where that person will then make certain discoveries and where that person will be able to reconsider and cognite to the end of having more proper view of things the real thing wrong with evaluation is that data or significances have tendency to eradicate masses when they are intimately applied it is quite one thing to say what all life is about and to give an individual the basis for better and wider look at life as we do in dianetics and scientology and it is quite another thing to find that the person is in his mothers valence and then begin to evaluate for him concerning his mother the most harmful example of this is to find someone upset for instance about his father and then to explain to him as the analyst does that his father is probably very good man and meant all for the best to do this is to throw the patient into an apathy as apathy is at least quiet it has in later years been considered desirable state for people who might have some socially destructive impulses apathy became then the end goal of later analysts and is of course the only goal of the psychiatrist that is why these people evaluate for their patients in the manner given when patient in an asylum has told her doctor that she was recalling incidents from the mothers womb the doctor is prone to tell her that is all nonsense she has to face reality and so forth which evaluates for her the real crime of evaluation is to tell the patient he is wrong evaluation itself as broad subject is not particularly harmful so long as it does not completely invalidate the person to whom the remarks are addressed thus you could give person general framework of life so long as you are not crowding it against an entirely different framework of life as an example scientologist tells some religionist whose life is entirely oriented on religious principles of some archaic and antiquated creed that his beliefs are all wrong and that the truth lies otherwise as the scientologist is going straight up against life entirely oriented by these ancient creeds he is apt to produce in his action considerable apathy on the part of the religionist he is notapt to get in truth convert to scientology he is apt to get candidate for mental hospital instead person can be led out of any serious fixed beliefs by getting him to agree that there are wider beliefs to assume but this must be done in full observance of arc and is not done by direct evaluation this is by the way why we sometimes fail to convert people in older healing methods to dianetics and scientology we simply fly into the teeth of their stable data and leave them all confused we knowing life are far too convincing they cannot but partially agree evaluation for person could be defined as the action of shaking his stable data without giving him further stable data with which he can agree or in which he can believe the analyst from freuds time onward has been supremely guilty of this that it must be called guilt is observable in the fact that evaluationreversal of the patients beliefs and data directly to the patienthas placed many psychoanalytic patients in hospitals invalidation the subjects of significances evaluation and invalidation have become interdependent in scientology in invalidation we have more fully than in evaluation capital crime with significances we are simply discussing reasons why with evaluation we are only giving new stable data but with invalidation we are overtly and consciously knocking whatever props the patient may have out from under him the greatest invalidation of course is to be struck when one does not expect to be struck to be criticized when one does not think he merits criticism essentially it is the act of telling person that although he thinks he should be there he is really not supposed to be there and the use of thoughts or force in order to accomplish his notthereness reversely it is also making person sorry for his absence in essence it is saying that person has validity therefore that persons thoughts and postulates have validity the commonest conduct by analysts in hospitals is to invalidate actually the entire activity of psychiatry with its drugs and shocks and restraints is invalidation in actuality evaluation belongs more properly to the field of psychoanalysis than does invalidation invalidation belongs to the modern psychiatrist since it can have considerable brutality connected with it failure to observe another reason why psychoanalysis has failed lies in its failure to observe it would be thought that if many thousands of men financed by many many millions of dollars were to look for long period of time at insane people they would sooner or later codify certain definite theories of observations which when added up would bring about certain conclusions in fact one could not expect less than this from the most mechanical computer arranged analysis must have been based upon erroneous premises it must have been because it led to additional observation dianeticist or scientologist setting out to observe phenomena will cover the track of dianetics and scientology this is fairly certain because it has been done now for many years by many many people the observations of dianetics and scientology have been productive of considerable number of new observations this is notthe case with psychoanalysis only those few examples which seemed to validate the basic principles of psychoanalysis were observed by the analyst and where data fell outside this sphere it was not observed and codified true and proper scientific method as given in book one dianetics the modern science of mental health is as follows 1 make series of careful observations these observations must be repeated and are acceptable as observations only if many people following the prescribed techniques can duplicate the results b variations of the prescribed techniques must be tried to eliminate the possibility that the observed results might be due to factor other than that intended as gross example suppose it is reported that magnet will attract objects demonstration shows it does attract and lift iron balls that is step above now variations of the experiment show that the magnet attracts iron but not copper silver etc the observed effectattractionis real variation of the original experiment is needed to show the actual limits of the effect 2combining all relevant data from all relevant experiments formulate hypothesis the hypothesis must explain all observed data b it must not demand as consequence of its logical development the existence of phenomena that do not in fact exist c but it should indicate the existence of real hitherto unobserved facts 3 using the hypothesis predict new facts logical structure broad enough to explain all observed relevant phenomena will necessarily imply further phenomena that have not yet been observed use this mechanism to predict the existence of something which under previous theories would not exist 4 perform an experiment and make observations on these predictions 5 as result of the experiment discard the hypothesis or advance it now to the status of theory 6 make further predictions further experiments and collect more observational evidence until contradictory relevant fact is found 7 discard the old theory take the new total of observational data and form new hypothesis 8 see step three it is as though the psychoanalyst from freud forward was looking for confirmation of his own beliefs the most serious defect which researcher can have is fondness for his own beliefs so great that he looks only for confirmation of these researcher must possess the ability to discard and reassume theories at will he must not nurse to his bosom one theory and then try to align all data to that theory he must align data to theory it is true but when that data does not add up to that theory that theory must be discarded and new one must be assumed only in this way is progress made that the basic tenets of psychoanalysis were never abandoned orreformed shows certain fondness for them which was not borne out in actual practice or observation the dramatization of the mental image picture the engram the demonstration of overt actmotivator sequences and hundred thousand other dianetic and scientology phenomena went entirely unobserved by psychoanalysts they even looked at them and saw them not in that healing consists of getting at what is wrong and making it right the approach of the dianeticist was intensely successful in that what was wrong with the patient was not psychoanalytic theory was enough to cause the analyst to invalidate the patient and remain secure in his theoretical assumptions the analyst actually did not make people well and this is the primary reason why he failed utterly to observe the data of the patients hypnotism probably the most fundamental error of psychoanalysis was its early dependence upon hypnotism breuer as freuds coworker actually exhumed the original data on which freud based his libido theory in 1894 breuer used hypnotism the use of hypnotism denotes an anxiety to produce an effect beyond the power of the individual to produce an effect by normal knowledge and means it is the belief that the patient must be in comatose state before something can be done to him the medical doctor and the analyst and psychiatrist alike have held this tenet basically good therapy would wake people up make them more alert make them more able happier more competent hypnotism is the exact reverse to this we have here another failure to observe anyone observing hypnotic patients would see that after they have been hypnotized they are less able narcosynthesis and other nonsense has had to be run out of more dianetic preclears than i would care to count before their cases could advance the continual use of hypnotism and an inexpert use it was to one versed in eastern hypnotism and the use of hypnotic drugs to diagnose or plumb the depths of some patient is confession that one does not know the general rules of life if one does not know these general rules of course he is apt to look almost anywhere even into the wastebasket for an answer hypnotic command or hypnotic diagnosis does not lead to well patients it leads to slaves and if you will observe any people who have been continually hypnotized you will find that it has been detrimental to them this does not even require very much close observation there is nothing essentially wrong with hypnotism so long as one can undo hypnotism we can undo hypnotism therefore it is not very important whether we hypnotize people or not but the analyst could not unhypnotize people he did not even know what the mechanism of hypnotism was and as result he was not thereby entitled to use it only that person who is able to produce both the kill and the cure should be permitted to kill if you could bring dead man to life at once without any bodily harm to him it would be all right for you then to kill menproviding you brought them back to life it is perfectly all right for you to hypnotize people so long as you can unhypnotize them psychoanalysts and psychiatrists cannot do this therefore this particular phenomena in the mind should be well beyond their reach abandonment of cases we think very poorly of the auditor who abandons cases without doing much for them it must be harshly said on ample evidence that the analyst does very little else but abandon casesthe first hours in analysis are usually spent according to survey made back in dianetic days finding how much the patient can pay after that the patient is persuaded to believe that it will require about year of four separate sessions of one hour each per week to establish whether or not analysis can do anything for him at the end of year of course he is so habituated to coming to the analyst and handing over almost the entirety of his pay check that he does not stop doing so and forgets that the analyst has ever said that it would require year just to find out nothing is being done for the patient but he does not notice this when the patient runs out of money he is abandoned this is our unfortunate finding in the case of psychoanalysis it is quite one thing to leave case when one has bettered it of its current worries and it is quite another to leave it when one has worsened it the dianeticist does the former quite often the patient expects to be dianetic clear and does not reach that goalonly recovers from couple of psychosomatic illnesses and two or three deep neuroses and yet wants more auditing the auditor is then entitled to tell him but in the case of the person who is worsened by the therapist the abandonment of that case becomes inevitable if the therapist ever could have done anything for the case in the first place naturally we are walking on rather thin ground here since there are many people around who believe that dianetics did not do all for them that it should and i am the first to agree with this since we had too few skilled practitioners and we ourselves were too pressed for time which was being consumed by long and arduous processes to pay attention to every complaint which came our way but our intention in dianetics was never otherwise than to do all we possibly humanly could for the preclear i am afraid that the analytic approach does not fall within this category the analyst must have known when he first enlisted the patient that the patient would worsen since the analyst rarely experienced anything else in his practice therefore we have basic intention which is entirely at variance with our ideas of the way the world ought to run it is interesting to note that our attempt to survey psychoanalytical suicide met with many savage rebuffs yet we were able to discover that some 35 of the people in psychoanalysis committed suicide either during an analysis or within three months after the analysis in our efforts to discover the why of this we received only one answer common to all of the analysts interviewed and that was he came to too late it can be seen that this is rather shallow way to look at things for any of us today in scientology could say well the human race came to us too late and we could then throw up our hands and not do anything about it whereas as matter of fact the remark is almost correct yet we are still doing something about it and in dianetics and scientology we have gotten great number of suicides as matter of fact i know of but one actual suicide in all the hundreds of thousands of cases which we have had our hands on and that one was political not therapy failure to validate by testing it might be asked in this modern age why psychoanalysis never permitted itself to be before and after tested this is probably the greatest condemnation of the entire subject of psychoanalysis one looks in vain for actual authentic records of improvement of cases because of psychoanalytic sessions while the psychoanalyst is very anxious to have us in dianetics validate our science he himself has never validated his had he done so we would have to hand an accurate record of cases tested before analysis and after analysis the whole idea of testing does not belong to either the psychoanalyst or the psychologist testing goes clear back to the dimmest days of greece man has always been testing man to discover his existing state or changes in itthe oldest precursor of testing known to us is probably graphology but on the other hand it may be phrenology the ancient witch was in essence doing psychometric test on her visitor tests of guilt and innocence by responses was subject for medieval courts so at time could the psychoanalyst have said that he was not familiar with the whole project and idea of testing in modern times testing erroneously within the framework of psychology has been excessively available to the analyst and yet he has never produced to my knowledge any booklet or pamphlet concerning the various differences of patients before and after an analysis and has certainly never codified his subject why has he not done this is it because he could not i am afraid that is the reason why i am afraid that psychoanalysts have tested their patients before and afterwards and have found them worse afterwards and so have never released the results it would be nearly impossible for practitioner not to attempt this sometime during his career therefore we find all the results of psychoanalysis based upon the opinion of the analysts themselves if one has ever sat in coffee house talking to auditors about the wonders which have been produced in cases which one knows are still spinning one will see that it is human error to assume greater result than has been achieved now however in fairness to these auditors most of their results are factual and they have every right to brag about them but in the case of the analyst one never hears about recoveries one hears only about symptoms if one has ever had the painful experience of spending an evening with analysts one would realize that the dramatization of the patients symptoms was the entirety of the conversational fare if one can talk only about symptoms and never about the release of symptoms one then assumes that the release of symptoms has not been accomplished summary well how does all this affect us are we in any way affected by the fate and failures of psychoanalysis yes in two ways in the first way we are able to sort out of psychoanalysis various donts and as these crept into early dianetics from psychoanalysis it is necessary for us at this time to reassess and evaluate what we are doing one can summarize these rather rapidly one does not force person to communicate who is low on havingness one does not specialize entirely in recalls one does not occasion or force transference into another personality one does not concentrate on the second dynamic one does not specialize in significances one does not evaluate for or invalidate the patient one observes what he is doing from the patient and not from the textbook making sure that one is actually observing the patient one does not use hypnotism one does not abandon cases when they have been worsened one does not fail to validate by testing and one sees security in the general expansion and advance of subject itself we can learn these donts because we see corpse lying there very dead because they did not know these donts so we should not repeat them is there any other way we are affected by the psychoanalyst yes the psychoanalyst and various mental practitioners have not conducted themselves ethically in this society the psychoanalyst the psychologist and the psychiatrist have been guilty of not delivering whatever may be said about dianetics and scientology whatever may be said about or my enthusiasm i can assure you that we and i have delivered we mean what we say when we write down in summary of case histories that we cured so many cases of soandso and we alleviated so many cases of suchandsuch we are not guilty of anything but what we actually did we are guilty occasionally in misinterpreting exactly how we achieved these alleviations case in point is in 1947 when i was using recall method which rehabilitated the confidence of the person to face his pictures this brought about cessation of his stimulusresponse mechanisms in their entirety and so created clear even by the time book one had comealong some of this technology because it wasnt properly understood had been forgotten or overlooked but later on it was rehabilitated and brought to the fore and it is in full use at this time we have said we would deliver soandso and we are delivering soandso and those things which we have intended to deliver and have not yet delivered we still intend to deliver and will continue to strive down to the last thought wave to accomplish our efforts and activities are sincere there has never been more sincere group on the face of earth than those who are in the ranks of dianetics and scientology these people can be trusted you can go to almost any person practicing dianetics and scientology and receive some part of the benefit inherent in these subjects he will try he will try decently and he will make the best changes he can accomplish take place in your case this is more true than ever today with our new programs of indoctrination and training and i would say that in relatively short time the totality of result to be obtained from dianetics and scientology will be obtainable from each and every properly certified practitioner throughout the world we have here an intensely sincere group we have fine ethical background we are trying we are honest we are decent how does this make psychoanalysis in any way affect us well i am very sorry to have to say this but the psychoanalyst has not been honest he has victimized the public psychoanalysis costs better than 9000 3219 and yet does not attain as much result as one opening of session by one auditor 2 in fact this 9000 cure is apt to deteriorate the case entirely the psychoanalyst has made specious and large statements concerning his abilities to act and has never even tried to press forward and bring those conditions into existence he has joined hand and glove with the psychiatrist and is murdering and butchering his patients it is the least safe thing that one could do to place himself in the hands of an oldtime practitioner today the public is entirely and intensely aware of this the public is aware of the fact that the last person you want to see is psychoanalyst or psychologist or psychiatrist the public is forced to go to these people by the law and the only reason they go near them is because they were at one time the faint hope that existed but their faint hope longer has to have recourse to them these practitioners have had to enforce their position by law lacking results psychoanalysis psychology and psychiatry have influenced the christian ministry today to place even members of congregations into their hands based on an actual poll of 1700 ministers the psychiatrist the psychoanalyst and the psychologist may have fight one with another amongst themselves but they hold this in common they have given into the public the rightful opinion that the mental practitioners prior to the year 1950 were entirely valueless and were not earning their salt they have given rise to public atmosphere of disdain and contempt for anyone practicing in the field of the mind therefore they do to some slight degree affect us therefore we should make very very clear to the entire public that we are not psychologists psychoanalysts or psychiatrists and any of us who fall from grace and attempt to use these old cloaks to further our own pocketbook should be despised by their fellow auditors the one chain of logic we must break is that people who work in the field of the mind are all crazy they can do nothing for us therefore we must not go to them my own attitude whether i am known to be or not when i am confronted with the idea that i am connected with oldtime mental healing is to become enormously amused and to make it completely clear that scientology and dianetics had to come about and had to be called by different names because they did something that the oldtime fields of mental activity never did do you are to some slight degree affected by the repute of the psychoanalyst and he has not helped us out he has attacked his patients sexually under drugs he has lied about his cases he has worked himself up in legal position before the courts so that he is listened to by the judges and yet only opinion is used by him to declare people insane and sanethis is an empire which we are today inheriting it is an empire we must clean up it is an empire which has not been clean therefore it is up to us to do the very best we can to make this new empire of the mind good solid ethical thing in which people can believe and to make that empire something which serves man rather than victimizes him finishubbard communications office 217a kensington high street london w8 august 13 1956 to hgc washington dc and london scientology process chart the following

of traps what is is not necessarily what should be the way thetan lives is not and never will be the way thetans should live the basic reason for this is the desire for randomity summed up in the desire of the thetan for game infinite wellness is undesirable if it means that the thetan is to be in state of total knowingness total serenity nameless without arc or contact with any environment evidently thetan would rather be intelligent in relation to his environment identified and identifiable capable of emotion and experience and in arc of whatever kind with whatever type of playing field he may fancy in other words thetan believes that he should be involved in game the deepest and most basic rationale is understood by the fact that thetan must be part of the game if he is not he is unhappy matter how purely and beautifully knowing and serene he may become however there is difference in games which is marked and obvious there is the matter of playing game and knowing one is playing game and not knowing one is playing game between these two things is world of difference thetan who is engaged in games he does not know he is playing is unhappy since he does not believe he is playing game and finds himself nevertheless in motion this is what the preclear objects to when he comes to the auditor to be audited the preclear suspects that he is playing game and does not know what game he is playing he simply wants to find out he does not want to stop playing all games if the auditor proceeds in the direction of making him stop all of his games if the auditor erases all of the preclears games why the preclear is resultantly unhappy the preclear wants to know what game he is playing and that is all there is to it in the matter of traps we have in essence similar condition to the state of mind regarding games traps are part of games that is all they are to believe that thetan could not get out of any trap he has gotten into is folly since it is very difficult for thetan to maintain and not go through every barrier which presents itself here we have the difference between the ideal and the actual the thetan who is in trap could get out of one with ease if it did not violate his condition of games were games not fact and rationale of life traps would be nonexistent if games were object whatever getting out of trap would be simplicity itself one is trapped by those things to which he will not grant havingness game condition demands that one denies havingness therefore games trap to maintain games condition in preclear it is best to run cant have on objects valences and people for example tell something in this room your mothercant have is highly effective process particularly if one has first run what effect could you have on mother the cant have on mother is games condition and runs out the games one has played with mother therefore the process is workable the process runs out exactly what one has done in order to be trapped in the mothers valence one has in playing games with mother said that mother could not have this and could not have that since to permit mother to have something is to violate games condition let us be very sharply clear here permitting things to have things is to make allies or teammates of those things and when these do not prove by their conduct to be teammates one is then guilty of permitting an opponent to have something which is nogame condition the rule is whatever one has denied havingness to has to some degree become trap when one runs cant have on the object he runs out the original denial of havingness to the object here is where processing meets its biggest obstacle running havingness such as look around the room and tell what your mother could have conflicts with the fact that one has already postulated numerously on the track that mother cannot have things running the permission of mother to have things untraps the thetan from mother only so long as it does not cause him to fail in his games condition with mother in practice one has to settle the whole question of mother as an opponent before one can have mother invent an opponent of comparable magnitude to mother mock up mother in violent motion look around the room and tell something mother cant have settles this opponentmother condition one does not run can have on mother only on self that one audits out game condition to obtain higher tone is major discovery in auditing and is all that is used today it is an easy thing to say one is trapped by those things to which he has denied havingness but the truth of the matter is that if he did not and had not denied havingness he would not have had game it is necessary then to settle the games condition on each and every object from which you would untrap thetan before you then run the havingness process necessary to permit him to grant havingness to the trap in the first place he and the trap are actually playing game and it may be that he has not enough games in order to surrender the game of the trap if he had enough games in order to surrender the game of the trap he would theoretically come out of it and he would certainly come out of it if he was put into condition whereby he could actually grant havingness to the trap jails theta traps pole traps bodies each and every thing large or small including the mest universe which could operate as trap follow this same rule the basic havingness of course that the thetan is denying the trap is denying the trap thetanand this properly worded works quite well in processing but unless thetan denied things himself he would be in nogame conditiona thing which he cannot and does not tolerate l ron hubbardthe goal of auditors to penetrate case at its level of certainty of motionlessness and by processes run by good procedure to improve that certainty and the level and to improve certainty on each level the preclear always at cause until the preclear through objective and creative processes is brought to an ability theoretical to mock up in its entirety body and universe visible to all we introduce games condition by having preclear at cause even though the common denominator is motionlessness game condition l ron hubbardhubbard communications office 217a kensington high street london w8 hco bulletin of 20 august 1956 after study of processing in general and much testing by hgcs london and washington and in particular by my own and hco auditing the following scale of processes can be considered optimum at this time in the light of what we know until further extensive testing is available we can consider the following to be the most productive processes and these should be used by staff on outside pcs and taught in classes hgc procedure of aug 20 1 make pc at ease in session build some arc without too much 2way comm get pcs viewpoint make him feel auditor regards goals seriously run comp mag on pt problem 2 run scs on objects stressing each of them more or less equally running each until fairly flat this could take from halfhour to 25 hours depending on pc away and to pc on stop is highly effective 3 8c part on body if pc in poor shape get it flat if so at least until he has somatics 4 scs on body 5 locational processing as extroversion process for scs on 4 run with 4 as an alternating process if needed 6 scs on body specializing on stop 7 connection processes look around and find something you wouldnt mind connecting with you 8 before and after solids select an engram from mid life which pc has mentioned or an age and have him find picture before it if picture isnt an engram have him make it solid then one after the selected time keep him out of engrams and painful incidents by having him get earlier or later ones that arent painful before you let him make it more solid dont change your engram target or selected age matter what other incident comes up quit only when pc has been getting them close to pt close by telling him come to present time an operation which requires few seconds or minute before and after solids brings up the case computation the service facsimile and vacuums and discharges them 9 run look around here and find something you wouldnt mind making solid as the objective version of 8 havingness processes optional as indicated run problems trio on self what you can have in room cant have on others or body creative process havingness and putting things into walls ceiling and floor and not know plus trio on people outsideand mock up confusions for stable data name etc also axiom 10 processes by creative processing pc can be required to mock up motionless object and hold it still if it can be made still for an instant have him let it go and mock up another use general heavy objects at first then selected objects to run out inabilities of pc such as typewriters palettes books etc fight the wall can be used but only with great care have pc run motionlessness by having him find an object tell it to be still is it there are great many ways to strip obsessive motion from pc any workable one can be run remember that emphasis on all control processes is on stop run stillness not motion observe the following havingness drops when compulsive game cond comes in repair havingness rather than run out agitation pcs i discover go from minus tone scale up to being able to have problems or tone or solids any case has some point that goes from noeffect or unreal or dont care up to apathy cases go north to apathy there are notone cases these are compulsive gc thinkingness processes reduce havingness matter what button they hit solids effort emotion perceive are all above think the pcs cognitions are valuable but dont run thought out faster than havingness and solids in general run in never shoot for phrases ignore them before and after solids calmly run bring up vast numbers of computations dont knock out havingness with too much 2way dont go out of arc with pc with too little 2way how much 2way or think is answered by how can we get solids into this case always run on game condition basis enemy can have is deadly on pc cant have on enemy okay effect on pc is fatal pcs effect on others okay what pc could change is fine what could change pc terrible the path to truth lies through solids effort emotion perception and not know it is not to be found amongst thinking on control it is the first step toward solids pc wont start until he is sure he can stop to have pc insist on light is to bring him to tolerate and handle the dark profiles and iq gain when pc regains ability in solids in bank and universe and can plank emotion into walls wholesale intolerance of solids made him think failure to control solids made him intolerant of them thus havingness is the first goal havingness is reduced by bad arc inaccurate or clumsy auditing running thinking processes and ignoring real pt problems reality begins with good arc with auditor and becomes tolerable with regained control of mest and gets real with solids thats the best track for high gains in the light of what we know now lrhrerd l ron hubbardissue 34 1956 ca late august the magazine of dianetics and scientology from washington dc havingness l ron hubbard prepared from lecture to the london auditors meeting 31 january 1956 entitled basic lecture on havingness we have talked and written great deal on the subject of havingness ever since the days of the research in 1952 and 1953 which led up to the codification of scientology 88008 which was the anatomy of universes it would seem that this point could be overstressed perhaps we could say more than needs to be said about havingness yet matter how many reams we have written and how many hours we have talked about this thing we probably havent even scratched not even scratched the subject of havingness everything that has ever been said about creative processing and about problems and solutions and about perception and spacation and about the black five has been on this subject first and foremost havingness is the postulate that one must communicate versus the postulate that one must communicate to something you can see at once that this poses crosspostulate these two musts are not the same must they are crosspurposes if one has nothing to communicate to all he can do is communicate through he would have the condition of endless space with nothing stopping the communication all the way now i want to call your attention to little sport that is carried on in one part of the world it used to be greek sport then was transferred to spain and mexico they got bull who was crazy enough to pick up mockup in that general neighborhood and they get him in there and have him run at cape he runs at the cape he goes through the cape and he runs at the cape and he goes through the cape and you just watch this bulls morale deteriorate then they take some old horse that is padded with blankets the padding is never thick enoughspanish thirst for blood and they let the bull finally charge and push at the horse usually the bull gets the horse and the picador over between the fence and himself the fence is nice and solid the bull starts to really go to town you can see his morale go up up up up up upin fact he would practically be well bull if he could find that horse and that fence solid enough well as gory as the spectacle may or may not be the point of the matter is that while the bull is working on this the picador leans on him very heavily into the hump with big fork and discourages him from finding something solid and from pushing that hard and by the time they get him out there again charging at this cape never manhe never hits man he never hits horsehe just hits this red cape and he finds again nothing there hes done without being really hurt hes just sore and hes lost small amount of blood he just loses his nerve he finally stands there in terror and then he sinks into apathy and he gets to such point that the matador can walk over and fixate him good matador once in blue moon you see good matador will simply fix the bull into any position he could probably stand him up in the air if he wanted to because the bull is in state of shock he is hypnotized he believes that there is nothing solid anywhere and that matter how hard he charges he will hit nothing hes gone if they simply kept him pushing at the red cape little longer he would probably fall over dead anyhow they wouldnt have to use sword now the physical aspect of bullfight and the aspect of thetan in the physical universe are not too wide apart not too different since the trick in both is to get them to charge at nothing to get bull to charge at cape where he thinks there is something and to have him find out that there is nothing behind the red of the cape to get thetan living being to move toward or put out communication toward something and to then convince him that there is nothing there after all and then the trick is to convince them that there is nothing they can charge until at last they do not believe that they can touch or lean on anything thetan then has feeling that if he did utter communication he would only spend what mass he had because the communication would just go on out there forever and endlessly longer to be able to touch anything longer anything real now these two counterpostulates if an individual supposes that he should communicate and if his joy and game and desire is communication and it has to have that game postulate and if at the same time there is nothing with which he can communicateno terminalhe has the vista of endless space his communication itself is making the space and then there is nothing to stop his communication so there is end to it and it makes him feel very weak indeed he just shoots the roll you might say any time he says anything because it never arrives anywhere termination and terminal so he eventually does this interesting thinghe says something into mass which he himself puts there in order to have something to say something to nowhowever we want to classify thiswhatever conditions or significances we wish to place upon this actionit nevertheless follows that this aspect of man fighting himself is man merely trying to reassure himself that there will be something there to hit with his communication whenever you could say to someone that the only trouble he is having with himself is his fighting himself and putting up barriers to himself you can also understand that this is what he is doing and why he is doing it you dont have to classify any further an individual goes along putting up barriers and masses and pictures so that in case there is nothing there to receive his communication he can reassure himself that there is something there after all because he put it there and then found it he runs into his own barriers his own terminalsa thetan doesnt like the idea and this not liking is again only consideration of speaking into vast and endless nothingness so what he does is to accumulate his own terminals and so we get the phenomenon here of an individual constructing universe perforce because he cannot have the universe in which he finds himselfthe physical universe now thetan is capable of constructing totally universe himself the cycle is something like this he builds universe of one kind or another himself then he by agreement finds himself involved in larger universe to marked degree he simply invests the universe which he has himself created into this larger universe sometimes he doesnt like it sometimes he does but he then finds himself cojoining and existing with and in the physical universe and now the physical universe does not offer him sufficient number of terminals terminals sufficient in number and magnitude to the potential volume of communication of which he is capable he then begins to manufacture his private universe all over again now it is very important for you to understand that the universes that people are packing around with them when they come in to you as preclear are usually secondary universes they have come into being because the individual has found an insufficiency of universe in the physical universe it is quite interesting that anybody could find an insufficiency of universe in universe that is so capable of solidity as the physical universe that is one of the madder things that do happen it is done by disenfranchising the individual he is told and persuaded that he cannot address cannot touch cannot reach and we interpret it as cannot have terminal reach touch address have whatever you want to call it the terminal cannot exist for him thats all it means and so he stops talking to it because it doesnt exist an interesting opinion that someone could get intothat the wall doesnt existbecause it happens to be the truth of the matter its very easy then for him to fall into that one because the wall is considerated the wall exists and is there only because someone considered it was there when one longer considers wall to be there it is not there thus if one is forced into having wall or disenfranchised of the wall he can nevertheless have the opinion that there is wall and it will be true we find him forced into truth ive said before that the probable summary of aberration all up and down the track is that an individual is forced into truth and away from game as long as one can ably create even as low level as lie or slightly less low level problem he can still have game but when hes longer able to create longer able to put anything there there isnt anything there he comes upon the truth of the matter there are at least several routes for coming upon the truth of something and of these routes the least practicable for the individual is through subjection by force to truth nevertheless the truth of something even when arrived at by the route of subjection and force will asis the something and cause its vanishment and thus it is longer had this is called by auditors the depletion of havingness one is made to admit that what he conceives to be there is what is there and it vanishes for him this is not such great oddity since the individual neverintended himself to be the receipt point for what he has caused and when his intention is overthrown in this matter and he does become receipt point or termination point for this the thing is terminated and so of course it vanishes and so you get destruction of the terminals which you normally would have or utilize or destruction of the spaces which you would utilize mothers work on this rather hardfathers schoolteachers and so forth you must tell the truth and then they wonder whether there is anything anywhere around that will explain the fact that child ceases to be creative and imaginative after hes been around for while they must conceive that there is something dreadfully dreadfully destructive in this childs lying person who would conceive the imaginative impulses of child to be lies and therefore bad is in an interesting condition himself he is in the interesting state of conviction that there isnt anything there anyhow and there had better not be anything there anyway let call to your attention again the manifestation of child who goes to his parent and asks for nickel he goes through the various levels of the tone scale and he slides on down and finally tells his pa when he hits bottom even if his pa holds out the nickel to him that he doesnt want the nickel and he just wanders off in apathy that child could get into the position where he has to make nothing of every nickel that he comes across take rich father denying child pennies its an interesting and wellknown fact that the rich mans is usually more aberrated on the subject of havingness than the other kids he is continually told that he can have everything and all kinds of things are actually forced on him in some fashion but his power of choice especially where money is concerned is overthrown and overridden and he finally comes into the conviction that there isnt any money anyway and the old mans fortune falls finally into his hands and swish its gone you take just about any rich mans and audit him and you will normally discover that he cannot have money money is something that if it came into his vision hed have to make nothing of it at once the various enforcements that have been put upon him because of the importance of the amount of money in his family have at last turned him around into an inhibition of having money this is fascinating thing now let us leave such relatively interesting subject as money for the relatively uninteresting subject of wall and we find that the same thing applies to wall wall or an object or anything that is solid child says i just shot giraffe out in the yard mama his mother is in pretty good condition and she says you did well now you make sure you bury it or mamas not in so very good shape and is pretty well done in on the subject of havingness and she knows theres giraffe in the backyard of course not johnny she says you really didnt see giraffe in the backyard now did you now tell you realize you break my heart with these lies this is standard happenstance to mockups in children i have had as writer some of the damedest things told to about purely imaginative sequences in stories of mine i have had people turn around to and tell from time to time about something in story that didnt really happen you know well of course it didnt there wasnt word of truth in the whole sequence they get very upset about it they cannot differentiate quickly and accurately enough between the creative and the truth of the matter and so they are on such an interestingly unbalanced pivot with regards to walls etc that if you started to create new wall you see with lie or something of the sort they would know not only that this wall doesnt really exist it would be pretty thin thing to them but they know also that your wall had better not exist and youre trying to give them walli wrote story one time called beyond the black nebula well i dont know whether theres anything on the other side of the black nebulai never lookedbut wow people got upset about that story i posed the fact that there is in orion tremendous barriera black barrier across this particular galaxy and i made people look at this fact and then dreamed up some causations behind it and so forth probably this barrier as they read the story was threatening to get actual and thick and they were saying well maybe there is this barrier you shouldnt do this to us ron that kind of reaction well here is point the person who could have wall didnt care how many black barriers were manufactured the person who could have something accepted new manufactured wall in the spirit in which it was given the spirit of game but when person could longer have he could longer accept anything offered to him very interesting thing i imagine there are great many girls who if you walked up to them and handed them pearl necklace would have to assure themselves that it was phoney or something of the sort or that it was worthless for some reason theyd probably take it down at once to have it assayed just to be sure and if they were told that it was real pearl necklace theyd be quite upset about it you could probably spin them in and ruin their whole lives by giving them pearl necklace one of the ways people make nothing of things is to misintend them so that you could come back the next week perhaps and find that shes using the necklace to decorate cake you find this among savage tribes particularly on hightoned basis people would be doing this to make something persist on lowtoned basis they would be simply trying to get rid of it by saying it doesnt exist or isnt the way it is so you get one manifestation meaning two different things relative to where the person is situated as to havingness can have and cant have this whole subject of havingness while it embraces all of existence and all of experience boils down to two things communication and terminals and there is great oddity about the whole thing any time you as an auditor had difficulty with the problem of havingness with preclear or had any difficulty with the problem of the preclear thats because you departed from this rather strange maxim there cant be enough havingness you see you never get superabundance of terminals the other day i saw helen of troy the movie you hear the greeks outside the walls now youd say they would be resenting those walls badly in other words they were trying to not have those walls so that they could have the spoils of troy fine theres certain greed there they want the spoils inside the walls they cant have those the walls say they cant have the spoils the funny part of the whole thing is that the reason they couldnt have them is they couldnt have the walls you can develop almost any situation in life and resolve it on that basis if youre trying to get over barrier to gain something else then its cinch you cant have the barrier if you can come into possession of the barrier you come into possession also of what it is barrier tothe only reason person can get trapped is that he cant have traps and the only reason he goes out and gets himself trapped is because he cannot be trapped its really quite interesting now if you really have all the walls and barriers of the physical universe they pose problem to you here is the situation in which we get the total vanishment of thingsyou start owning something properly addressing the truth of the ownership and it doesnt exist any more there is difference here between the two kinds of operations you can undertake about having and owning you find that have is maybe misownership so here are two systems own and have or own and misown in order to have problem in order to have game we have to select out some of the walls and barriers as unhavable and then you can have problem in connection with some other havingness methods if you do not have methods of acquisition there is really acquisition possible there would be total acquisition if you had total acquisition you would own everything there is the way to own everything there is is simply to own everything there is without any system of owning everything there is the trouble with owning everything without using any system for owning everything is that it is much too true and being true does not make persistence so that by owning everything there is you end up having nothing the two postulates which when counterposed bring about havingness are communicate and communicate to something this brings about some problems which are very odd i must communicate and there must be barrier to communicate to but of course barrier is antipathetic to communication barrier is necessary to communication barrier is antipathetic to communication barrier is necessary to communication because communication must stop somewhere well therefore life well played would be game of commenting in the proper direction toward the right barriers and not trying to go through the wrong ones but you could get into some interesting problems if you tried to leave this room through that wall and take your body with you that would be an interesting problem that would throw someone into apathy but the funny part of it is that it wouldnt throw him into apathy anywhere as fast as simply being able to go through that wall and take his body with him that would upset him i guarantee you that would upset him barriers nothing stops anything anywhere stops now let us have look at the remedy of havingness in the light of stops in dianetics we have the command phrase command phrases come down to just three things start change or stop but the whole subject of the engram is the subject of cant have moment of pain or unconsciousness is moment of cant have if at certain moment an individual couldnt have the environment couldnt have the circumstances he was undergoing violently couldnt have these things then it is certainty that hell pile up an engram right at that spot in time thats what hell havean engramlets see how that would be he resists the environment to such degree and considers it so foreign so solid and so dangerous that he makes something very much like plaster cast of that moment kind of energy plaster cast of the environment thus facsimile this thing is far more durable than any cast of stone or plaster this tells us something very important the visible engrams were those of loss those things in the environment that the individual couldnt have he resisted there is very peculiar thing about these facsimiles these canthave pictures theyre backwards they are usually black backed the energy pushed upon these things is black energy its just as if one had lot of pictures turned face to the wall thats the blackness of lots of cases and the reason why blackness succeeds lot of pictures handling the environment with energy and then with heavy energy goes down certain road there is thing called tensor beam thetan can do something that physicist has not yet learned to do with energy he can make beam grab something thats tractor beam have you been talked to lately by someone who didnt really have anything to say but kept on talking it seems sometimes as though he had tensor beam around your neck and hes holding you there and you cant leave the electronic structure of pretty girl whos just walked down the street is very interesting thing to behold every guy shes passed has put tensor beam over her head well thats mustnt let that terminal go any further away thats the motto of that beam so the individual can have and then he can lose he decides he can lose and if he feels he is going to lose any part of his environment he will hook beam over it and hell hold it there in front of him if you take facsimile apart very carefully aside from simply mockedup or copied facsimiles youll see that it is crosssectionalized as tractor beam hes trying to hold something from leaving him he is unable to retain to him the actual object he makes picture of the object that he can look at straight hell say oh i dont like these pictures they bother take few away from etc below that level he goes into blackness which is simply pressing on things to push them away hes in that frame of mind about things anyones got some blackness it isnt true that some cases are black and some are not when it turns up on preclear you are auditing on remedy of havingness you can have him mock up some blackness and shove it in so we get engrams of resistance and the engrams of resistance are black and we get engrams of mustnt go away and theyre pictures and an individual who cant have the physical universe cant have anything leaving him because he cant have anything else you see he at least retains picture and there is how he builds up his secondary universe it isnt really his universe its pictures of the physical universe which he retains in lieu of now an individual only gets into frantic frame of mind about things leaving him if he cant have anything else hes talking to his friend and they have been very good friends for long time and his friend says im going to galway now and ill be up there for couple of years and hefeels terrible about it he tries to persuade him not to go he cant tolerate all that distance between himself and his friend friends are scarce another fellow has lots of friends one of them says im going to galway he says ok fine ill be up to see you sometime pretty soon that says he can tolerate that distance and this galway business doesnt much reduce his havingness hed be in good shapeeasy to get along with its not so easy to get along with someone that you are the only one to all right now as we look over the general situation in regard to havingness we find that the scale declines from having ones own universe exclusively to cooperating with universe which is the physical universe and then we run out of havingness of the physical universe and we get into point of little anxiety we might lose parts of it and from that we pass into were liable to acquire some of it we get flip from must have to resist parts of the physical universe and from there we go on to total not have that is disenfranchisement of the individual the story of processing in scientology is the story of the reversal of that disenfranchisement if all the people in the world were suddenly to have use for any pay goods or commodities there would not be the game they would not be regulatable in any way if they decided that everything was theirs anyway and that they didnt need anything there would not be this game that would be too high level of game for game to be in progress now nobody pretends that anybody is going to get up to that level of game the funny part of it is however that as they get up toward that level of game they go back toward not action on the game only they play the game now efficiently and they play it as game not as deadserious horror that they have to face somehow thats the difference all right nowyou ask this questionare you enjoying life in other wordsis life game to you you would ask at the same time by any chance are you in the band of havingness below owning everything there is and above having to make nothing of everything there is are you by any chance in that band or are you enjoying life these are the same questions difference except that one fellow wouldnt be in the universe he wouldnt be there so hypothetically to ask but the guy who cant have anything is there to get he is certainly there hes stuck stuck now lets look at this thing called stuck the old engram we used to have holders groupers denyers etc these are embryonic barriers these are barriers aborning you might say the statement or postulate to stop and the individual who gets an anxiety about havingness begins to accumulate out of his manufactured bank all of the stops and begins to hold them near him so that he will have barriers that can receive something and he wont get into the condition of the bull almost unknowingly he does this so that there will be something there with which game can be played and thereby and therefore he forms false wall in secondary universe the primary universe is the physical universe as far as hes concerned in the state he is in there is an earlier universe which is his own universe and which has walls and barriers too but for our processing purposes were talking about this primary universe the physical universe were talking of the reactive mind the facsimiles engrams energy pictures as secondary universe which is formed by reason of not being able to have the physical universe and thats how the reactive mind gets born and where it comes fromauditing the havingness scale very often you have to get the preclear over the hump on the subject of havingness on his reactive mind these secondary universes could just as well be called reactive universes with creative processes mockup processes we can handle this reactive bank havingness you understand that this is not the preclears own universe these extend at once to higher echelonthe physical universe so then you remedy his havingness totally on the physical universe and get him to have everything in the physical universeno longer with mockups you just have him look around at things and find out what he can have when you have him totally remedy this subject he is then in position to create home universea universe of his own there you have the graduated scaleit goes from reactive to physical to home universe how far can you go with havingness you could separate somebody out of this universe simply on havingness alone first hed have to be able to have his reactive bank then hed have to be able to have the physical universe then hed have to know that he could create something else this game of havingness is absolutely necessary to auditing apparently to many people havingness means barriers and barriers mean lack of freedom but to you an auditor barriers should mean game and you should know that an absence of barriers is the trouble with preclear when preclear is having trouble he just doesnt have enough barriers now when preclears got cold that doesnt mean that you are going to tell him he hasnt got enough colds it somehow wouldnt communicate but there it isthe preclear hasnt got enough colds preclear has migraine headacheshasnt got enough migraine headaches whatever it is whatever the condition is something has gotten scarce and the next step after getting scarce is for it to get valuable the mechanism of something getting valuableit first must get scarce after becoming scarce thing becomes very very valuable and then it becomes so valuable its rare how many women have you seen with kohinoor diamonds walking down the street in the last few minutes none well you might even wonder if kohinoor diamond even existed now im sure theres many girl who is very goodlooking who has reached this point about kohinoor diamonds shed kind of doubt if they exist theyre probably all cut glass i dont see whats so good about themeven if they do exist shes in apathy on the subject and thats very dangerous if women got that way about diamonds fur coats rolls royces bank accountsdo you know what would happen the whole game with the society would just be gone auditing havingness as an auditor looking over this material on havingness you may also be looking at the points where processing hasnt measured up for you on yourself so lets not in trying to do something with the preclear ourselves fall across this one youve got the situation well in hand if you have this that barriers are not necessarily bad that barriers are to the contrary necessary and that what has happened to the preclear is that he has run out of barriers and thus has run out of games and has come to the place of detesting barriers therefore we will simply figure out some way of giving the preclear some barriersthere are two interesting little processes that come up on these lines one process for the auditor who has gotten into flinching position regarding preclearscant have preclearsis little game that you can play do you ever find yourself flinching from preclear just flinching little bit and backing away from the session if you were to take look at your own immediate vicinity you would discover that your own space was collapsed to about there at the end of your nose the preclears got all the rest of the space of the room but youre being uncomfortable what happens you cant have the preclear so you put barrier up there that you can have and talk to anyhow this is completely standard practice with people but for an auditor it is not standard and not practical at all to degree you have gone out of communication with the preclear heres little stunt you just find something about the preclear that you can have what has happened is that you have run out of havingness of the preclear thats all that has happened and then you go out of session as an auditor the beginning of it is when you at some time had too few preclears you have too few preclears and then you begin to believe that there arent any and you dont reach for anybody or process anybody because they dont exist well thats the beginning of it one preclears rattling on at gruelling rate of horror horrible fates and so forth and you start backing up little bit you know its all for the preclear and your space finally collapses to about the tip of your nose and youve run out of havingness of one preclear youre liable to lose another one then another one and then it gets to be habit then well i havent audited anybody for weeks there isnt anybody to audit very hard to find preclears but the same law applies if there is anything wrong on the subject of havingness or the subject of terminals it is that there are not enough there cannot be superabundance of terminals this street could not be stacked full enough of preclears really to satisfy your idea of few preclears if you were really rolling it would be well ive got 8000 preclears to audit between now and next month thats the frame of mind youd be in if you could really have them all audit one on the phone one in front of and the couple of preclears in the waiting roomput them in the antechamber and have them coaudit ive done that by the way somehow dont like to have people wait if you find yourself backing off from the preclear you can build your havingness of the preclear back up again as youre auditing him you can quietly and privately pick it up youd think i was joking if i told you the things you can do with preclear when you are really able to have preclear but there is this little stunt you just quietly look the situation over and start adding up something you can have about the preclear just one thing after another add them up and repair your havingness of preclears walls now here is another little process that you can use on the other side of this thing you are faced with great many preclears in this world who cant have wall or anything else and you want to have some way of giving them some barriersjust have the preclear start mocking up walls flat against his nose it doesnt matter what kind of walls its one of these processes that can just go on and on with continuing cognition hell get better and better walls hell start protesting at once about these walls hell say up against my nose isnt that awfully close for wall so we just get walls walls walls and more walls dont do anything with them let them evaporate or stay there or do anything else just keep mocking up walls in doing this you are capitalizing on some information that the preclear might not have but that you do have wall actually is very specialized kind of barrier he often wont recognize person as communication terminal or something which will act as backstop he cant see that but he knows more or less that if he did run against wall and hit his head on it there would be an impact he knows this so you have him mock up walls and you capitalize on this amount of information there are some fancier things you could do with this but having the preclear mock up walls flat against his nose is what you want at this point to get him up to the game of having session scarce now if you will just check over this datum that there cant be enough terminals and that when the preclear complains of having something its something he doesnt have and cant have and cant get enough of then you will be in very good position regarding the auditing of preclear suppose its the very tough preclear hes in real bad shape hes going to come in to you and he knows exactly what hes doinghes going to make nothing out of everything nothing out of this nothing out of that nothing out of something else and nothing out of that and nothing out of you and he goes away and makes nothing out of your bill and if you let him get away with this hes going to stay in processing forever but whats the point so the preclears got ridge conclusion he hasnt got enough ridges preclears got cold he hasnt got enough colds preclears got bum leg not enough bum legs bad lungs not enough bad lungs when we were studying havingness three years ago i rather supposed it was an interchange of energy which discharged the bad and left the good i always stated that little cautiously to myself it just didnt seem quite right it wasnt quite workable we can see now that the mystery of this thing had to do with these counterpostulates that comprise havingness we find that we didnt have him mock up enough colds and bad enough colds not enough when we do this the preclear discovers that there are more colds in the world than just this one there is not this great scarcity of colds and hell let go of it it becomes less valuable now there is one other point here since the condition is only condition as for instance cold is cold or headache is headache and is not terminal your rule in auditing is to address the terminal involved rather than the condition thus you would run process what problem could that arm be to you and not what problem could that burn be to you the terminal is the arm not the burn actually you would be bringing up the preclears reality on his arm to the point where it could be terminal to him without the burnobjective now as we look over this general situation we discover that we must bring our preclear into possession of great deal more of the physical universe than he has regardless of the subjective remedies weve got to get him into physical universe remedy too and the way we do that is this we ask him to look around here what could you have you dont let him do this subjectively you make him open his eyes wide open look around here what will you have and you if youre retreating from him look at the preclear and find out what you could have about him this is in essence auditingwhere she is going and how she is done i hope these principles about havingness can assist you great deal there are too many preclears around still making nothing out of everything its easy to get them over this just boot them up to where they can have something if theyre making nothing out of everything they cant have anything those two statements go together if theyve got something and are holding on to it they havent got enough of it if they havent got anything at all they havent got enough of that either abundance of terminal is the answerwashington dc via hco london briefing bulletin staff and seminar leaders games congress shoreham hotel 31 august3 september 1956 theory the most adequate answer to lifes puzzle is games the ordinary concept of games or play is comprehensible to anyone games have many factors some work well in processing some dont all explain life the basic game of thetan is evidently nothing versus something as in the process make it solid he can never really be something thus can never really duplicate in himself solid yet he makes solids across spaces out of game impulse practice always process toward games condition never process toward nogame condition always process games conditions never process nogame conditions this is more complicated than you think all games are aberrative all games are continuing by definition since an unstarted game isnt game and finished game isnt game in the following list we have most processable games conditions and the most to be avoided nogameconditions each item on both lists could be

workable processes under games conditions we find all limited and unworkable processes under nogameconditions we then avoid nogameconditions in processing we process the pc playing as game in all phases it is true that the game condition list contains regimen unworkable in life it isnt supposed to be its aberrative and we process it the only certain processes which can be run on nogameconditions are consequences the penalty resulting from and mock up confusion to which nogamecond could be stable datum now behold that the list of nogameconditions is summary of the native state

_____________________________________________________________________ 1 september 1956 valences amongst the several types of valences the least suspected and most interesting in terms of processing is the synthetic valence by synthetic valence we mean those valences which have never actually confronted the preclear in the flesh the first valence is of course the preclears own valence which is his own concept of himself the next is the valence additive to him by the characteristics of his body the next is the direct valence by which he has transferred identity with someone who has directly confronted him and following this there is the attention valence the valence one has assumed because it got attention from another valence and at the end of this list there is the synthetic valence and of all of them it is the most baffling the greatest historical example of this is probably charles xii of sweden who read the romance of alexander by pseudocallisthenes and became so much an alexander that he spent the remainder of his days attacking russia in an effort to emulate his hero charles xii had never confronted alexanderhe had only been told about alexanderbut he had nevertheless assumed the valence of alexander in most of his activities the little boy who looks at television and sees the cowboy in the white hat triumphing over all or who sees superman in the comic books and then assumes these identities is actually doing more or less direct transfer where he is simply told about these and has never been confronted with any form of any kind to corroborate the telling he would have case of synthetic valence he has been read to about tom sawyer and becomes tom sawyer without ever seeing tom sawyer or looking at tom sawyer this would be case of synthetic valence we get the synthetic valence in many amusing and nonaberrative games conditions and here it does us little problem making but the synthetic valence can become an evil genius in case when it has been carefully and expressly tailored as an alteration from the direct valence which might have occurred as an example of this we have the case of the father who in the mothers absence or even when she is sporadically present tells the children consistently and continually what bad mother they have father continually describes mother as certain type of character and the children are then adjured not to transfer into this type of character naturally resisting it they do not actually transfer into mothers valence but transfer into synthetic valence of mother in the case where mother let us say ran away or was lost to the family early in the childs life he may have real recollection of mother but may have synthetic valence of mother this becomes very difficult to run because it is run mainly on sonic level as another example one is told consistently and continually that all men of force or all conquerors are bad and one is warned never to become conqueror this is of course an excellent way to make nothing out of an individual but here we have false valenceapersonality which never existedand we discover in the lives of the conquerors that they actually were not totally possessed of bad characteristics in order to dominate his fellow beings to the marked extent necessary in conqueror one could not possess totally bad characteristics and the actual character of most conquerors is quite different than the assigned character given them by the societya fact which does not make conqueror any less liable for the crimes he commits but which gives us an insight into the tailormaking of characters who never lived the keynote of all synthetic valences is that character has been developed or created more or less out of whole cloth possibly with some small foundation but certainly with exaggeration which puts into existence being who never breathed or coughed or spat the police and newspapers are continually doing this you actually dont know whether the criminals who have been arrested by the police and tried in the newspapers were the people who were arrested or not since they are assigned synthetic valence and are condemned as very bad people indeed of course some of these criminals were or are bad but the chances are that amongst this legion of people arrested and tried in the newspapers there were some who were quite deserving men and whose actual character and behavior did not even vaguely compare with the represented character we have flagrant case of synthetic valences when newspapers and other public media and even word of mouth gossip begin to take to pieces anyones character and put in its place some synthetic understanding which was never real person in this way we begin to believe there are many more bad people in the world than there are in my own experience with bad menand i have met several of various nationalitiesi have seen some men who could put up rather ferocious front but i have never found one of them totally lacking in human warmth yet were i to read the newspapers and popular books on such people i would begin to believe it would be possible for complete demon to exist who would never respond to any decent impulse yet i have argued bandits into more amenable state of mind and have even taken gun away from federal marshal and showed him how to use it and told him not to be nervous and put it back in his holster when he was bound and determined to take into custody in other words you can actually create an effect on almost anybody the synthetic valence is an effort to tell you and people that beings can exist who are so bad that effect can be produced on them of course this makes everybody subservient to them the greatest historical example of this was the invention of the devil by the persian priests who were called together to synthesize new religion for persia the devil they invented there was borrowed later on by the christians and was set up as something so evil that nothing could affect it the devil of course is the championship synthetic valence of all time there are devils upon whom one cannot produce an effect the way to run out any synthetic valence of course is to run out the valence of the person or book which told one about the synthetic valence l ron hubbardpab 96 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology

quality of mercy is not strainedit droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven may be poetic but it is not definitive it does however demonstrate that even in shakespeares time men were adrift on the subject of justice injustice severity and mercy people speak of an action as unjust or an action as just what do they mean ii et unless we can understand exactly what is meant by these terms we certainly cannot undertake to evaluate the actions of individuals communities and nations for the lack of an ability to so evaluate misunderstandings come about which have in the past led to combative personal relationships and on the international scene to war an individual or nation fails or refuses to understand the measures taken by another or fails to fall within the agreement of the pattern to which others are accustomed and chaos results in scientology the following definitions now exist justicethe impartial administration of the laws of the land in accordance with the extant level of the severitymercy ratio of the people lawsthe codified agreements of the people crystallizing their customs and representing their believedin necessities of conduct mercya lessening away from the publics acceptance of discipline necessary to guarantee their mutual security severityan increase in that discipline believed necessary by the people to guarantee their security injusticefailure to administer existing law equityany civil procedure holding citizens responsible to citizens which delivers decision to persons in accordance with the general expectancy in such cases rightsthe franchises of citizenship according to existing codes when laws are not derived from custom or when new law contravenes an uncancelled old law exact law becomes confused and injustice is then inevitable basic justice can occur only when codified law or majorityheld custom existsobserving these definitions jurisprudence only then becomes possible law courts legislatures and legislation become confused as nothing is possible in the absence of an understanding of such principles laws which do not derive from agreement amongst the society which we call custom are unenforceable unless there is then widespread agreement that this is customary in the society matter how many police are hired matter the purity of prose with which the legislation is written matter the signatures occurring on the enforcing document the public will not obey that law similarly when government acts to ignore certain basic customs amongst the people and refuses to enforce them that government then finds itself in state of civil turmoil with its people on that subject we can look at any publicgovernment battle and discover that it stems exactly from violation of these principles an understanding on the part of nation of the difficulties of another is necessary to continued peace when one nation begins to misunderstand the motives and justices conceived necessary by another nation stress sets up which eventually leads to war all too often for example there is an existing upset in the world whereby the people of the united states and great britain are highly critical of the government of the union of south africa for their treatment of native peoples it is considered in england and the united states that the government of south africa is altogether too harsh with its native peoples it is sadly humorous to notice that the native in south africa however holds an exactly reverse opinion and the fault he finds with the south african government is that it is far too lenient in its administration of laws throughout the native populace as an example an african guilty of cattle theft according to tribal law would probably be beaten over considerable period in time and then buried in an anthill the south african government gives such crime punishment of short period in jail which is not at all adequate to guarantee the security of the remaining natives who own cattle the most flagrant example is the white nurse quilan who was torn to pieces and eaten by three men and woman during recent riots in south africa the african tribal punishment would have decreed that these people themselves be killed and eaten the south african government incurred great deal of censure from its native population by giving these people only six months in jail in other words what is severe to an african and what is severe to an englishman or an american are entirely different matters what is merciful to an african what is merciful to an angloamerican is quite different thus what is justice to an african is quite different than what is justice to an angloamerican whenever there is an excessive commotion amongst people against its government the government is then invited to act as an opponent to the people if government is acting towards its people as though it were an opponent of the people and not member of the team it becomes obvious that many of these points which violate the customs of the people must exist in the law codes of the country wherever such point exists turbulence results and that is justice l ron hubbardhubbard communications office 20 buckingham street london wc2 hco processing sheet of 20 september 1956 the following are useful and advantageous processes comment in running motionlessness on preclear it will be discovered that the preclear must have an intention to have the thing still and must have some cognition that it got still and must have been able to have put the idea that it be still in the object unless the auditor is sufficiently inquisitive to have this occur youre not going to get any upgrading results on your profile the old saw find out what the preclear is doing and how he is doing it never worked more advantageously than when running holding things keeping them still or letting them be totally uncontrolled comment selfdeterminism in the field of motion consists of by own power of choice permitting thing to be still or not to be still permitting thing to be changed or not to be changed permitting thing to be started or not to be started must be rehabilitated in the preclear in other words selfdeterminism consists here of returning his power of choice over controlling or not controlling at will the preclear who is obsessively controlling will sooner or later fail to control and then will be controlled by something the obsession to control to start to change to stop will be found to enter into the arc triangle and is what depresses the preclear down scale on the tone scale comment the entirety of games processing from an auditing standpoint summates into the necessity that all auditing be done with the preclear at cause that is to say the preclear must do it to something else do not run things which are done to the preclear in other words have the preclear do things to the walls do things to people do things to his own body and do not run his own body people or the walls doing things to the preclear that works out in the general activity havingness the trio run look around the room and find something you wouldnt mind having or look around the room and find something you could have could permit to remain or dispense with is completely legitimate as process and will be found to be as advantageous as ever and should be run whenever the preclear becomes unduly agitated games processes demand that all cant haves be run on something else than the preclear in any situation where another terminal than the preclear is involved cant have is run on that terminal have is not ever run on any terminal other than the preclear have is only run on the preclear himself cant have is run on all other subjects objects valences and activities in addition to this be very certain that you use terminals not conditions in other words to run cant have on your asthma is extremely foolish and will reduce the preclears havingness asthma is condition of the respiratory organsthe proper auditing command is look around the room and find something that your respiratory organs cannot have or look around the room and find something you would not permit your respiratory organs to have solids it will be discovered that holding things still keeping things there and making things solid are all gradient scale and if the auditing command is run on book look at that book keep it there or look at that book keep it from going away that stillness and solids will follow as condition the fundamental command then is keep it there from which stills or stillness or motionlessness and then solids ensue however running motionlessness directly or solids directly is permissible observation of objects objective processes can be run by having the preclear locate objects and keep it from going away followed by the alternate command permit it to be totally uncontrolledalternate commands the idea of alternate commands has not been properly understood by auditors we have and b commands one is look at it two is b look away from it the way an alternate command is run is to run look at it look away from it look at it look away from it look at it look away from it not to run look at it fifty times and then look away from it fifty times this is an alternate command basis the change unchange commands are extremely valuable when run on an alternate basis one does not however flatten change and then turn around and flatten unchange one runs change unchange change unchange one command for each this has become important in our methods of running stillness stop processes stop processes can be run either of two ways one can simply run stop as itself and continue to run stop on various things such as the body or he can run stop totally uncontrol stop totally uncontrol stop totally uncontrol or stop in total motion stop in total motion on an alternate basis it has not been tested or ascertained which of these methods flattening stop itself or running stop and then totally uncontrolled produces the highest gain however it is known that stop processes produce gain particularly on lowtoned preclears connectedness have the preclear look around and find what he could be connected with this is run in this fashion what in this room would you connect with yourself it is not run in this fashion what could you connect with in this room since the latter is games condition stopcs after preclear has been run on startcs one would simply and calmly flatten to some degree each one of the points of control start change and stop in order to get session going there is process known as stopcs this is distinctly different process once one has plain scs in operation then one has the commands of stopcs these are the same but one specialises in stopping the body one has the preclear stop the body over and over and as the preclear becomes more accustomed to doing this one then changes the process on him to this extentthe auditor asks the preclear in running stopcs to stop the body absolutely still this imposes new discipline on the preclear and makes the process extremely difficult for him it is only done when scs and ordinary stopcs have been to some slight degree flattened following up this stop the body absolutely still one can introduce change into the process for few commands in order to unflatten the stopcs that has flattened in other words when the stop of stopcs on an object or the body seems to be flat one can run few change the body or change the object and unflatten the stop once more with resultant alteration in the preclears ability to perform when stopcs seems flat then it should be unflattened at first by running changess with emphasis on change and then when change longer upsets his ability to stop it starting it should be run as an alternate to stop cs in order to unflatten it again it will be noted that higher toned preclears do not make very rapid gains on stopcs s cs and hold it still or keep it there or keep it from going away it will be found that on preclears that have profiles already above the makebreak line middle line of profile sheet that it is usually necessary to run subjective processes so as to separate valences to run over and under on the bank and in general to sort things out faster than on the more blunt processes in other words we have found the processes now which operate on relatively low scale cases and in order to improve case above the level of solids when he has things fairly well under control it is necessary to do other things this does not however excuse the running of figurefigure processes on preclears who cant do anything with them if you think that stopcs and associated processes are flat then you should run subjective processes on valences or solids on the bank in order to recover the entirety of life span for the preclear in other words we go about the business of digging up unknowns we flatten his reactions to such things as light sound and other material we separate out valences by having him mock them up and keep them there by making them still by making them solid we go in for the higher level of changeswhen preclear seems to be all the way up to the top on all these processes it is then only necessary to run him on the reestablishment of abilities one reestablishes his ability to speak arabic for instance by having him mock up mosque and keep it there gradient scale from largest down to more significant objects in terms of the arab world and other things until these can be admitted by him to be totally solid one then has him stop an arab from speaking arabic by having him mock up an arab and keep him from speaking arabic and then eventually run change and start on this arab one also must run arabs of different ages and run groups of arabs and arabs of different professions whose ability to speak arabic is being controlled by the preclear any other skill can be sorted out and rehabilitated in the preclear from his back track in this fashion remember that the keynote of all processing is to recover unknowns therefore not know processes should be run on higher level preclears so as to get them into command of the idea of notknow in order to establish exactly where your preclear is you only need to ascertain his reaction to various solids and speeds of impact once you have done this you have established exactly where the preclear is on the tone scale this reaction to solids is far more reliable than profile tests from the auditors standpoint preclears who cannot tolerate solids will have to be worked for very very long time on keeping things from going away and holding them still and finally making things solid matter where the preclear registered on the profile sheets we have apparently undercut cases now to the point where we are getting fairly rapid gains on very low scale cases it is time for us now to think of what we are going to do with cases who are upstairs but you must always be sure that your case isnt one of these cases that is simply dubbing in high tone this is very easy to establish the skill with which person can run stopcs in its most arduous forms his ability to handle light by keeping it there and motion in general is the establishing factor on where case sits on the tone scale as far as an auditor is concerned there are other tests which are better than this so an auditor had better not take either the profile or the preclears sayso concerning the state of case the auditor has far better test himself in either of these in order to rehabilitate preclear it is necessary then to restore his ability to start to change and to stop his body objects subjective mockups engrams the solid environment around him and to increase in the main his ability to control solids this then goes up to his ability to control black objects and blackness his ability to control invisible particles his ability to control space working in this fashion it is then possible to raise the preclear consistently up the tone scale it will be noted that solids are reality whereas reality is basically agreement on thought level it actually happens that preclear can mock up things which are solid preclear who is very very far down scale is unable to do this and is unable to tolerate solids so if you want to raise preclears reality youd better raise his ability to tolerate solids this is done first by keeping things from going away next by holding things still and finally by making it solid in solids we have located the r of the arc triangle and communication as ises solids but solids must be creatable by the preclear thus we have an upward advance of rc monitored by his ability to tolerate solids the current program of scientology is to place its organizational staff personnel and auditors in such condition that they are capable of reaching handling and controlling people and groups if we do this we will shortly be the most advanced organization on the face of earth whether we have propaganda good word of mouth or anything else this is the road which were taking in advancing scientology and its organizations thus you see the necessity of establishing objective and subjective start change and stop on individuals you are reminded that scs also runs on communication and runs as well on affinity such as conceive the wall to be embarrassed stop it from being embarrassed more is being learned about these processes as i work with preclears and the science itself but the first thing that i have learned is that an auditor in order to run stopcs has to be himself capable of tolerating easily all up and down the band otherwise he fails to understandthe process and fails to make it work it is as therapeutic today for an auditor to audit preclear on scs and stopcs on the body for the auditor as it is for the preclearif not more so lrhrerd dictd sept 13 l ron hubbard typed sept 20 1956scientology the fundamentals of thought by l ron hubbardtable

knowledge 25 know and notknow 30 the goal of scientology 31 scientology processing 32 exact processes 34chapter one the vital statistics of scientology what is scientology scientology is that branch of psychology which treats of embraces human ability it is an extension of dianetics which is in itself an extension of oldtime facultypsychology of 400 years ago more acceptable and normal psychology such as that begun by st thomas aquinas and extended by many later authors was in 1879 interrupted severely by one professor wundt marxist at leipzig university in germany this man conceived that man was an animal without soul and based all of his work on the principle that there was psyche greek word meaning spirit psychology the study of the spirit or mind then came into the peculiar position of being study of the spirit which denied the spirit for the subsequent decades wundtian psychology was taught broadly throughout the world it taught that man was an animal it taught that man could not be bettered it taught that intelligence never changed this subject wundtian psychology became standard mainly because of the indifference or lack of knowledge of people in charge of universities scientology is actually new but very basic psychology in the most exact meaning of the word it can and does change behavior and intelligence and it can and does assist people to study life unlike wundtianpseudopsychology it has political aspiration scientology is not teaching dialectical materialism under the heading of psychology the term scientology is taken from the latin word scio knowing in the fullest meaning of the word and the greekword logos study scientology used by the trained and untrained person improves the health intelligence ability behavior skill and appearance of people it is precise and exact science designed for an age of exact sciences it is employed by an auditor scientology practitioner upon individuals or small or large groups of people in their presence the auditor makes these people at their choice do various exercises and these exercises processes bring about changes for the better in intelligence behavior and general competence it is employed as well by persons in business and government to solve problems and to establish better organization it is also employed by the average person to bring better order into life how is scientology used scientology is employed by an auditor one who listens and commands as set of drills exercises processes upon the individual and small or large groups it is also employed as an educational teaching subject it has been found that persons can be processed drilled in scientology with scientology exercises and can be freed from their major anxieties and can become brighter more alert and more competent but if they are only processed they have tendency to be overwhelmed or startled and although they may be brighter and more competent they are still held down by an ignorance of life therefore it is far better to teach and process audit drill person than only to process him in other words the best use of scientology is through processing and education in scientology in this way there is imbalance it is interesting that people only need to study scientology to have some small rise in their own intelligence behavior and competence the study itself is therapeutic goodmedicine by actual testing 1it is also used by business and government leaders to establish or improve organization it is used as well by the individual at home or at his work to make better life is scientology valid tens of thousands of case histories reports on persons who have been processed individual records all sworn to attested before public officials are in the possession of the organizations of scientology other subject on earth except physics and chemistry has had such gruelling testing proofs exact findings scientology in the hands of an expert auditor can restore mans ability to handle any and all of his problems scientology is used by some of the largest companies business organizations on earth it is valid it has been tested it is the only thoroughly tested system of improving human relations intelligence and character and is the only one which does where is there more information about scientology the world headquarters for scientology is the hubbard college of scientology saint hill manor east grinstead sussex england in addition there are major scientology organizations on practically every continent on earth scientology practitioners are validated certified given diplomas by these organizations diplomas are given only after very exact training person who is skilled in scientology procedures has diploma from one of these organizations list of these organizations is provided at the back of this book these offices and these people can give you more information about scientology there have also been many books published in english as well as other languages on the subject of dianetics and scientology the publisher of the book you are reading may have more books in your language can person without much study use scientology scientology is practiced in daily life by enormous numbers of people who have formal training in the humanities beyond study of textbooks scientology was developed to be used by such people as well as by the trained practitioner person studying by himself from textbooks can use scientology to help his fellow human beings what special use does scientology have scientology does things for people where nothing has been done before it restores peoples ability to handle conditions which were once considered hopeless it increases their intelligence it changes their competence and betters their behavior in addition to these it brings them better understanding of life who invented scientology scientology was discovered found not invented created it was organized by l ron hubbard an american who has many degrees and is very skilled by reason of study hubbard was trained in nuclear physics at george washington university in washington d c before he started his studies about the mind this explains the mathematical precision of scientology l ron hubbard has been given many honors for his work in the field of the mind he has been assisted by one of the largest organizations numerically speaking in the field of the mind on earth today the organizations of dianetics and scientology editors note 2chapter two basic principles like engineering scientology has certain basic principles these are necessary to full understanding of the subject it is not enough to know how to process drill people in scientology to be effective good one must also know the basic principles scientology is very exact the humanities human studies of the past were full of opinions scientology is full of facts that work to study scientology one should scan skim quickly through the basics and find something with which one can agree having found one thing one fact with which he can agree one should then skim through again and find another fact one should continue to do this until he feels some friendliness to the subject when one has achieved this and only when one has achieved this he should then study all the basic principles there is effort here to be authoritarian opinionated one will try to make the subject difficult you may have been taught that the mind thought the brain is very difficult thing to know about this is the first principle of scientology it is possible to know about the mind the spirit and life the cycle of action the most fundamental idea in scientology is called the cycle of action cycle span of time with beginning and an end section of the totality of time with beginning and an end in beginningless and endless time one can set out periods which do have beginning and an end insofar as action is concerned action motion or movement an act consideration that motion has occurred in very ancient books it is written that from chaos came birth from birth there was growth when growth was achieved there was then gradual decay the decay then ended in death after death there was chaos scientology expresses this more briefly the cycle of action is an apparency as follows create then survive then destroy or creation survival destruction first there is creation then this is followed by survival then this is followed by destruction apparency appears to be as distinct from what actually is this cycle is only an apparency it is what we see what we behold what we believe we consider think believe suppose postulate that it is so and then we see it so child is born he grows he reaches manhood he grows old he dies in scientology it can be seen that none of these steps are necessary one considers them so and so they are true man can grow old quickly or slowly he grows old to the degree that he believes he is growing old because everyone agrees that this is the way things are they go that way the cycle is not true it is only apparent it is apparent because we believe we see it it is apparent because we agree that it should be so the test of this principle is as follows by using the cycle of action can we make anyone well or more intelligent thousands of tests have proven that the use of and belief in the cycle of action has made none well or intelligent therefore matter if we see it there must be something wrong with it the woman growing old wishing to appear younger is protesting this cycle of action she feels there is something wrong with it there is we have to find out what the actual cycle is before we can make people better 3actual what is really true that which exists despite all apparencies that whichunderlies the way things seem to be the way things really are the actual cycle of action is as follows create createcreatecreate createcountercreate creation nothingness create make manufacture construct postulate bring into beingness create createcreatecreate create again continuously one moment after the next survival createcountercreate to create something against creation to create one thing and then create some thing else against it destroy creation an absence of any creation creative activity an actual cycle of action then consists of various activities but each and every one of them is creative the cycle of action contains an apparency of survival but this is actually only continuous creation the apparent cycle of action contains destruction but the actual cycle of action tells us what destruction is destruction is one of two activities destruction is in terms of action creation of something against creation of something else for example wall is seen standing to be apparent it is necessary that the wall be constantly created the act of destruction is to exert against the wall another creativeness that of the action or activity of knocking the wall down both the wall standing there and the action of knocking it down are creative actions because we may object to argue against dislike wall being knocked down we vilify swear at scorn the creativeness involved in knocking it down with the word destructive actuality tells us that there is such thing as destruction there is only creation against creation there is another type of destruction and this is more creation by longer being party to member of the walls creation the wall in theory can cease to exist for one this is true in actual practice in scientology reality is the way things appear reality is apparency to do anything about reality one must search into and discover what underlies the apparency of what does reality consist what is reality composed of we see an apparency which has the cycle of action of createsurvivedestroy more basically fundamentally this cycle of action contains nothing but creation if one stops making something completely and ceases to be party to its manufacture it longer exists for one if one ceases to create there is nothingness when one creates something or beholds something which is created that thing is still being created even if one is creating something with his left hand and has forgotten about it with his right hand the thing still exists in other words one can create something without knowing it is still being created then one seeks to destroy it by countercreation creation against it the result is chaos created by two opposing creations let us be practical science is not science unless it is practical theory is good unless it works all the fancy and beautiful theory in the world is useless unless it has use or workability is this cycle of action theory useful it is so long as we believe that we have to destroy with force in order to destroy at all as long as we think in terms of destruction we have chaos there is creating and knowing one is creating there is creating and not knowing one is creating when one drives car or cart he does many things performs many acts which he is not aware of conscious of knows about and these we call automatic actions one is doing something and is not aware that he is doing it one starts to create something then places this thought still active beyond his own reach and the creation continues to occur 4knowingly creating something is always the first condition one can then purposefully continue the creation unknowingly everything one is doing knowingly or unknowingly one is doing here and now in the present instant in present time one knowingly started any creation in some past moment but the creation is being done in the present moment to stop any creation it can be established that one once knew one was creating it finding that thought and making it known againor one can simply create newly and consciously what one is already creating unconsciously knowingly in either case the creation stops the wrong way is to start new creation to counter against the old creation when one does this he gets confusion and chaos for example man has bad leg he is trying to get well he seeks then to create good leg he goes to doctors and wants to be healed the treatment is difficult and usually somewhat unsuccessful in the case of very severely crippled leg something is creating bad leg against this he is creating good leg the result is confusion and bad leg but third creativeness is present first something was creating we hope good leg then countercreation such as an accident to his leg countercreated bad leg now he is trying to countercreate again good leg the result is to wipe out the original good leg since that is the creation he is taking over and exposing with his efforts to get well he wants good leg the trouble with him is the countercreation of bad leg the test is factual have him create by certain scientology process bad legs until the countercreation of bad legs is wiped out and the original creation of good leg will reappear this only fails when there is original creation of good leg when the original creation of good leg is gone for example man has job he works at it that is to say he createcreatecreates job throughout the days weeks and years as long as he makes job the job exists one day he depends upon takes for granted this job he longer creates it it ceases to exist he has job the apparency is that he loafed became lazy and was discharged the actuality is that he longer created job and so didnt have one for example man depends upon woman to keep his house for him one day he longer has woman he cant keep house even though before he married the woman he could keep house for example man is sane he gets the idea creates the idea that it would be better to be insane he starts to go insane having created it and then does numberless things in order to stay sane here he was already creating the state of sanity he countercreated insanity he then countercreated sanity against insanity creation in this work may be thought to exclude god we are here considering only those things which man or man as spirit can make or manufacture or think the subject of who or what is doing the creation does not invalidate the cycle this is work on the subject of the mind not work on the subject of the supreme being lying is the lowest order of creativity there are many tests for these principles in scientology such tests come under the heading of processing 5chapter three the conditions of existence there are three conditions circumstances qualities of existence apparency reality livingness these three conditions comprise make up constitute life they are be do and have the condition of being is defined as the assumption choosing of category of identity it could be said to be the role in game and an example of beingness could be ones own name another example would be ones profession another example would be ones physical characteristics each or all of these things could be called ones beingness beingness is assumed by oneself or given to ones self or is attained for example in the playing of game each player has his own beingness the second condition of existence is doing by doing we mean action function accomplishment the attainment of goals the fulfilling of purpose or any change of position in space the third condition is havingness by havingness we mean owning possessing being capable of commanding positioning taking charge of objects energies or spaces the essential definition of having is to be able to touch or permeate or to direct the disposition of the game of life demands that one assume beingness in order to accomplish doingness in the direction of havingness these three conditions are given in an order of seniority importance where life is concerned the ability to be is more important than the ability to do the ability to do is more important than the ability to have in most people all three conditions are sufficiently confused chaotic baffling that they are best understood in reverse order when one has clarified brought order into the idea of possession or havingness one can then proceed to clarify doingness for general activity and when this is done one understands beingness or identity it is an essential to successful existence that each of these three conditions be clarified and understood the ability to assume or to grant give allow beingness is probably the highest of human virtues it is even more important to be able to permit allow other people to have beingness than to be able oneself to assume it beingness identity if you ask an auditor how these work in processing he will tell you that there is specialized form of each of these conditions the auditing form of beingness is identity to achieve betterment of beingness and the granting of beingness the auditor remedies with processing the scarcity of identities of the preclear the preclear is often found in valences other identities his fathers or mothers or marital partners or any or all of thousands of possible people he is unable to achieve or obtain he thinks enough identity or an identity of his own he decries or criticizes the identities of others fails to grant beingness to them 6he himself cannot obtain enough identity to feel he has an identity identity is so scarce that its too valuable nobody must have one to be with such person is therefore an uncomfortable experience since he does not credit our identitydoes not grant us beingness the cure for this is elementary let us say he is obviously in fathers valence identity he got into fathers valence when he found he could get attention from mother observing that father got some of her attention he took fathers identity however let us say he didnt like father the auditor finds him hating himself himself is really father clever auditor see section under processing would see that while he was in fathers valence it was really mothers attention that was sought the auditor does not inform his preclear of such finding he asks the preclear to lie about lowest form of creativity identities which would attract mothers attention then when the preclear can do this the auditor would have him invent identities which would attract mothers attention suddenly the preclear would be longer in fathers valence however he would have been not only in fathers but also in mothers valence so the same process would have to be done on father lie about the auditor would say identities which would attract fathers attention then invent one until the preclear had many and would longer be in mothers valence solving father and mother valences is fundamental since most people are somewhat in them or revolted from them but people can be stuck in all sorts of identities even bedposts when humans are too valuable to be used the rule is that the more aperson is stuck in avalence or identity the fewer he conceives to exist and the harder he thinks it is to get attention thus he can become exhibitionistic displaying himself too thoroughly being too much there at all times or he can become dispersed hiding himself being vague not there most of the time people err in identity in being too apparent or too little apparent the remedy of either is the remedy of their scarcity of identity identity and attention one needs an identity to play the game as covered later but mainly to get attention being looks at things to balance the flow of his attention he feels he must also be looked at thus he becomes attentionhungry unlike yellow and brown people the white does not usually believe he can get attention from matter or objects the yellow and brown believe for the most part and it is all matter of consideration that rocks trees walls etc can give them attention the white man seldom believes this and so is likely to become anxious about people thus the white saves people prevents famine flood disease and revolution forpeople as the only purveyors of attention are scarce the white goes further he often believes he can get attention only from whites and that yellow and brown peoples attention is worthless thus the yellow and brown races are not very progressive but by and large saner and the white race is progressive but more frantic the yellow and brown races do not understand white concern for bad conditions since what are few million dead men there are plenty of identities and there is plenty of attention they think the white cant understand them nor can they understand the white attention and identity form group of two attention makes space identity closes space 7attention is method of knowing inattention is method of notknowing identity is method of making known lack of identity is method of making unknown valences the whole study of valences is fascinating one valence is defined as false identity assumed unwittingly an identity is modified by valences people who can be nobody may try to be everybody people who are seeking way out of scarcity of identity may become fixed in false valences nations can become fixed in valences of countries they have conquered in war etc etc rule is that person assumes the identity of that which gets attention another rule is that the person assumes the identity of that which makes him fail for he gave it his attention didnt he there is basic personality persons own identity he colors or drowns this with valences as he loses or wins in life he can be dug up do effect doing can be defined as the action of creating an effect an effect in creation is action an auditor processing preclear would always use effect processes to increase doingness what effect could you create on father would be typical auditor question if preclear is fixated by books machine tool or person the auditor asks him to lie about then invent effects he could create upon it at first the preclear may be able to think of none then as the process is continued he may become wildly imaginative or even cruel further running will bring the preclear into more comfortable frame of mind criminals or maniacs are people who are frantically attempting to create an effect long after they know they cannot they cannot then create decent effects only violent effects neither can they work do despair of creating an effect brings about aberration and irrational conduct it also brings about laziness and carelessness command of attention is necessary to creating an effect therefore when one conceives he cannot easily get attention he seeks to create stronger effects he creates effects to get attention he gets attention to create effects as in axiom 10 given later the creation of an effect is the highest purpose in this universe thus when one cannot create effects he has purpose and thus it works out in life it may be all right to be stern and unrelenting superior or parent but such create laziness and criminals if one cannot have an effect created upon one and one is known to another very definitely harmful results will ensue as one believes he creates the least effect upon unconscious or dead people these as in hospitals or china become the subject of much aberrated activity what effect could you create on an unconscious person or dead person asked over and over by an auditor obtains some astonishing results an artist stops his work when he believes he can longer create an effect 8a person actually dies for lack of being able to create an effect but security often depends on being able to create effect the whole subject of survival is bound up in noeffect obviously those things on which noeffect can be made survive if one is anxious about survival foolish thing for he cant do anything else he becomes anxious to have about him things which resist all effects but as his only anxiety is about the survival of valence or identity remedy of the scarcity of these can resolve the matter another cycle of action containing also the classes of effects is startchangeandstop this is the definition of control havingness as there must be playing field see chapter twelve for game to be held so there must be havingness one must be able to possess there are millions of methods of possession in life the obvious one becomes overlooked if one can see thing he can have itif he thinks he can the degree to which one can live is the degree to which one can own to own is not to label or cart away to own is to be able to see or touch or occupy one loses to the degree he is forbidden to have but to play game one must be able to believe he cant have effect and have effect and have form pair like attention and identity an effect should be on or against something thus havingness if ones attention never meets anything he doesnt always like it thus he wants objects effect makes distance have shortens distance problems man or any life form in this universe seems to love problems problem is more important than freedom problems keep up interest when man has problem very thoroughly and cant solve it he really has too few problems he needs more the insanity among the idle is matter of problem scarcity problem is defined as two or more purposes in opposition or intention versus intention out of the conditions of existence above can come many complex problems if man had all the attention in the world he would be unhappy if he had all the identities possible he would still be unhappy if he could blow up earth or create any other huge effect he wanted without limit he would be miserable or insane if he could own everything everywhere he would be dulled to apathy or so it seems for these conditions of 9existence are all subordinate to the need of problems by current scientology reasoning and results thus to have person lie about problems or invent problems of the same size as the ones he has or the valences he is in or to invent data of the same or different size as the one he is fixed upon is to make well man probably the problem is the antidote to unconsciousness it is certainly the antidote for boredom but in making up the problems of life he consults the conditions of existence be do have and their necessary partner in every case attention 10chapter four the eight dynamics as one looks out across the confusion which is life or existence to most people one can discover eight main divisions to each of which apply the conditions of existence each division contains cycle of action there could be said to be eight urges drives impulses in life these we call dynamics these are motives or motivations we call them the eight dynamics there is thought or statement here that any one of these eight dynamics is more important than the others while they are categories divisions of the broad game of life they are not necessarily equal to each other it will be found amongst individuals that each person stresses one of the dynamics more than the others or may stress combination of dynamics as more importantthan other combinations the purpose in setting forth this division is to increase an understanding of life by placing it in compartments having subdivided existence in this fashion each compartment can be inspected as itself and by itself in its relationship to the other compartments of life in working puzzle it is necessary to first take pieces of similar color or character and place them in groups in studying subject it is necessary to proceed in an orderly fashion to promote this orderliness it is necessary to assume for our purposes these eight arbitrary compartments of life the first dynamicis the urge toward existence as ones self here we have individuality expressed fully this can be called the self dynamic the second dynamicis the urge toward existence as sexual or bisexual activity this dynamic actually has two divisions second dynamic is the sexual act itself and the second dynamic b is the family unit including the rearing of children this can be called the sex dynamic the third dynamicis the urge toward existence in groups of individuals any group or part of an entire class could be considered to be part of the third dynamic the school the society the town the nation are each part of the third dynamic and each one is third dynamic this can be called the group dynamic the fourth dynamicis the urge toward existence as mankind whereas the white race would be considered third dynamic all the races would be considered the fourth dynamic this can be called the mankind dynamic the fifth dynamicis the urge toward existence of the animal kingdom this includes all living things whether vegetable or animal the fish in the sea the beasts of the field or of the forest grass trees flowers or anything directly and intimately motivated by life this can be called the animal dynamic the sixth dynamicis the urge toward existence as the physical universe the physical universe is composed of matter energy space and time in scientology we take the first letter of each of these words and coin word mess this can be called the universe dynamic the seventh dynamicis the urge toward existence as or of spirits anything spiritual with or without identity would come under the heading of the seventh dynamic this can be called the spiritual dynamic 11the eighth dynamicis the urge toward existence as infinity this is also identified as the supreme being it is carefully observed here that the science of scientology does not intrude into the dynamic of the supreme being this is called the eighth dynamic because the symbol of infinity stood upright makes the numeral 8 this can be called the infinity or god dynamic scientologists usually call these by number the earlier science dianetics included dynamics one to four scientology embraces dynamics one through seven as known territory scientifically demonstrated and classified the difficulty of stating the exact definitions of the dynamics is entirely verbal originally the dynamics read the urge toward survival as as the science developed it became apparent that survival was only an apparency and only one facet of existence both the cycle of action and the three conditions of existence belong in each dynamic further manifestation of these dynamics is that they could best be represented as series of concentric circles wherein the first dynamic would be the center and each new dynamic would be successively circle outside it the idea of space adjoining enters into these dynamics the basic characteristic of the individual includes his ability to so expand into the other dynamics but when the seventh dynamic is reached in its entirety one will only then discover the true first dynamic as an example of use of these dynamics one discovers that baby at birth is not perceptive beyond the first dynamic but as the child grows and interests extend can be seen to embrace other dynamics as further example of use person who is incapable of operating on the third dynamic is incapable at once of being part of team and so might be said to be incapable of social existence as further comment upon the eight dynamics one of these dynamics from one to seven is more important than any other one of them in terms of orienting the individual while the dynamics are not of equal importance one to the next the ability of an individual to assume the beingness doingness and havingness of each dynamic is an index of his ability to live the eight dynamics are used in scientology communication and should be perfectly learned as part of the language of scientology the abilities and shortcomings of individuals can be understood by viewing their participation in the various dynamics 12chapter five the arc triangle there is triangle of considerable importance in scientology and understanding of it gives much greater understanding of life and an ability to use it the arc triangle is the keystone of living associations this triangle is the common denominator of all of lifes activities the first corner of the triangle is called affinity the basic definition of affinity is the consideration of distance whether good or bad the most basic function of complete affinity would be the ability to occupy the same space as something else the word affinity is here used to mean love liking or any other emotional attitude affinity is conceived in scientology to be something of many facets affinity is variable quality affinity is here used as word with the context degree of liking under affinity we have the various emotional tones ranged from the highest to the lowest and these are in part serenity the highest level enthusiasm as we proceed downward toward the baser affinities conservatism boredom antagonism anger covert hostility fear grief apathy this in scientology is called the tone scale below apathy affinity proceeds into solidities such as matter affinity is conceived to be comprised first of thought then of emotion which contains energy particles and then as solid the second corner of the triangle is reality reality could be defined as that which appears to be reality is fundamentally agreement what we agree to be real is real the third corner of the triangle is communication in human relationships this is more important than the other two corners of the triangle in understanding the composition of human relations in this universe communication is the solvent for all things it dissolves all things the interrelationship of the triangle becomes apparent at once when one asks have you ever tried to talk to an angry man without high degree of liking and without some basis of agreement there is communication without communication and some basis of emotional response there can be reality without some basis for agreement and communication there can be affinity thus we call these three things triangle unless we have two corners of triangle there cannot be third corner desiring any corner of the triangle one must include the other two the triangle is conceived to be very spacious at the level of serenity and completely condensed at the level of matter thus to represent scale for use one would draw large triangle with high part of the scale and succeedingly small triangles down to dot at the bottom of the scale affinity reality and communication are the basis of the scientology tone scale which gives prediction of human behavior as contained in science of survival as has already been noted the triangle is not an equilateral triangle affinity and reality are very much less important than communication it might be said that the triangle begins with communication which brings into existence affinity and reality the most primitive scientology definition of communication is causedistanceeffect the fundamental manual of communication is the book dianetics 55 arc are understanding if you would continue strong and able communication with someone there must be some basis for agreement there must be some liking for the person and then communication 13can exist we can see then that simple talking and writing randomly without knowledge of this would not necessarily be communication communication is essentially something which is sent and which is received the intention to send and the intention to receive must both be present in some degree before an actual communication can take place therefore one could have conditions which appeared to be communications which were not original with scientology as are all these concepts the arc triangle understood is an extremely useful tool or weapon in human relationships for instance among the arc triangle laws communication to be received must approximate the affinity level of the person to whom it is directed as people descend the tone scale they become more and more difficult to communicate with and things with which they will agree become more and more solid thus we have friendly discourse high on the scale and war at the bottom where the affinity level is hate the agreement is solid matter and the communications bullets 14chapter six the reason why life can best be understood by likening it to game since we are exterior to great number of games we can regard them with detached eye if we were exterior to life instead of being involved and immersed in the living of it it would look to us much like games look to us from our present vantage point despite the amount of suffering pain misery sorrow and travail which can exist in life the reason for existence is the same reason as one has to play gameinterest contest activity and possession the truth of this assertion is established by an observation of the elements of games and then applying these elements to life itself when we do this we find nothing left wanting in the panorama of life by game we mean contest of person against person or team against team when we say games we mean such games as baseball polo chess or any other such pastime it may at one time have struck you as peculiar that men would risk bodily injury in the field of play just for the sake of amusement so it might strike you as peculiar that people would go on living or would enter into the game of life at the risk of all the sorrow travail and pain just to have something to do evidently there is greater curse than total idleness of course there is that condition where person continues to play game in which he is longer interested if you will but look about the room and check off items in which you are not interested you will discover something remarkable in short time you will find that there is nothing in the room in which you are not interested you are interested in everything however disinterest itself is one of the mechanisms of play in order to hide something it is only necessary to make everyone disinterested in the place where the item is hidden disinterest is not an immediate result of interest which has worn out disinterest is commodity in itself it is palpable it exists by studying the elements factors of games contests we find ourselves in possession of the elements of life life is game game consists of freedom barriers and purposes this is scientific fact not merely an observation freedom exists amongst barriers totality of barriers and totality of freedom alike are nogame conditions each is similarly cruel each is similarly purposeless great revolutionary movements fail they promise unlimited freedom that is the road to failure only stupid visionaries chant of endless freedom only the afraid and the ignorant speak of and insist upon unlimited barriers when the relation between freedom and barriers becomes too unbalanced an unhappiness results freedom from is all right only so long as there is place to be free to an endless desire for freedom from is perfect trap fear of all things barriers are composed of inhibiting limiting ideas space energy masses and time freedom in its entirety would be total absence of these thingsbut it would also be freedom without thought or action an unhappy condition of total nothingness fixed on too many barriers man yearns to be free but launched into total freedom he is purposeless and miserable 15there is freedom amongst barriers if the barriers are known and the freedoms are known there can be life living happiness game the restrictions of government or job give an employee his freedom without known restrictions an employee is slave doomed to the fears of uncertainty in all his actions executives in business and government can fail in three ways and thus bring about chaos in their department they can 1 seem to give endless freedom 2seem to give endless barriers 3 make neither freedom nor barriers certain executive competence therefore consists of imposing and enforcing an adequate balance between their peoples freedom and the units barriers and in being precise and consistent about those freedoms and barriers such an executive adding only in himself initiative and purpose can have department with initiative and purpose an employee buying andor insisting upon freedom only will become slave knowing the above facts he must insist upon workable balance between freedom and barriers an examination of the dynamics above will demonstrate the possibility of combination of teams two group dynamics can engage one another as teams the self dynamic can ally itself with the animal dynamic against let us say the universe dynamic and so have game in other words the dynamics are an outline of possible teams and interplays as everyone is engaged in several games an examination of the dynamics will plot and clarify for him the various teams he is playing on and those he is playing against if an individual can discover that he is only playing on the self dynamic and that he belongs to other team it is certain that this individual will lose for he has before him seven remaining dynamics and the self dynamic is seldom capable of besting by itself all the remaining dynamics in scientology we call this condition the only one here is selfish determinism in the guise of selfdeterminism and here is an individual who will most certainly be overwhelmed to enjoy life one must be willing to be some part of life there is the principle in scientology called pandeterminism this could be loosely defined as determining the activities of two or more sides in game simultaneously for instance person playing chess is being selfdetermined and is playing chess against an opponent person who is pandetermined on the subject of chess could play both sides of the board being is pandetermined about any game to which he is senior he is selfdetermined only in game to which he is junior for instance general of an army is pandetermined concerning an argument between two privates or even two companies of his command he is pandetermined in this case but when he confronts another army led by another general he becomes selfdetermined the game in this wise could be said to be larger than himself the game becomes even larger than this when the general seeks to play the parts of all the political heads which should be above him this is the main reason why dictatorship doesnt work it is all but impossible for one man to be pandetermined about the entire system of games which comprise nation he starts taking sides and then to that degree becomes much less than the government which he is seeking to run it has been stylish in past ages to insist upon only freedom the french revolution furnishes an excellent example for this in the late part of the 18th century the nobles of france became so selfdetermined against the remainder of the country and were so incapable of taking the parts of the populace that the nobles were destroyed immediately the populace itself sought to take over the government and being trained and being intensely antipathetic to any and all restraints their war cry became freedom they had further restrictions of barriers the 16rules of government were thrown aside theft and brigandage took the place of economics the populace therefore found itself in deeper trap and discovered itself to be involved with dictatorship which was far more restrictive than anything it had experienced before the revolution although man continually uses freedom for his war cry he only succeeds in establishing further entrapment for himself the reason for this is very simple one game consists of freedom and barriers and purposes when man drops the idea of restrictions or barriers he loses at once control over barriers he becomes selfdetermined about barriers and not pandetermined thus he cannot control the barriers the barriers left uncontrolled trap him then and there the dwindling spiral of the apparency createsurvivedestroy comes about directly when man shuns barriers if he considers all restrictions and barriers his enemies he is of course refusing to control them in any way and thus he starts his own dwindling spiral race which is educated to think in terms of freedom only is very easily entrapped one in the nation will take responsibility for restrictions therefore restrictions apparently become less and less actually they become more and more as these restrictions lessen so lessens the freedom of the individual one cannot be free from wall unless there is wall lacking any restrictions life becomes purposeless random chaotic good manager must be capable of taking responsibility for restrictions in that freedom to exist must have barriers failure to take initiative on the subject of restrictions or barriers causes them to arise all by themselves and exist without consent or direction there are various states of mind which bring about happiness that state of mind which insists only upon freedom can bring about nothing but unhappiness it would be better to develop thought pattern which looked for new ways to be entrapped and things to be trapped in than to suffer the eventual total entrapment of dwelling upon freedom only man who is willing to accept restrictions and barriers and is not afraid of them is free man who does nothing but fight restrictions and barriers will usually be trapped the way to have endless war is abandon all war as it can be seen in any game purposes become counterposed there is matter of purposecounterpurpose in almost any game played in field with two teams one team has the idea of reaching the goal of the other and the other has the idea of reaching the goal of the first their purposes are at war and this warring of purposes makes game the war of purposes gives us what we call problems problem consists of two or more purposes opposed it does not matter what problem you face or have faced the basic anatomy of that problem is purposecounterpurpose in actual testing in scientology it has been discovered that person begins to suffer from problems when he does not have enough of them there is the old saw maxim that if you want thing done give it to busy man to do similarly if you want happy associate make sure that he is man who can have lots of problems from this we get the oddity of high incidence of neurosis in the families of the rich these people have very little to do and have very few problems the basic problems of food clothing and shelter are already solved for them we would suppose then if it were true that an individuals happiness depended only upon his freedom that these people would be happy however they are not happy what brings about their unhappiness it is the lack of problems selfdeterminism is condition of determining the actions of self it is first self dynamic action and leaves the remaining seven undetermined or in actuality in opposition to the self thus if one wants to take on the rest of life in freeforall fight one 17could be entirely insistent upon total selfdeterminism as the remainder of the dynamics must have say in ones self to function they fight at once any attempt at total selfdeterminism pandeterminism means determining the action of self and others it means wider determinism than self in an aberrated fashion we see this in an effort to control all others to aggrandize make important self pandeterminism is across determinism or determinism of two sides if one controls monitors both sides of chess game one is above the game one is selfdetermined then in any situation in which he is fighting he is pandetermined in any situation which he is controlling to become pandetermined rather than only selfdetermined it is necessary to view both sides problem is an intentioncounterintention it is then something that has two opposing sides by creating problems one tends to view both sides in opposition and so becomes pandetermined thus problem only appears to be necessary to man the problem is the closest reality man has to pandeterminism in processing the invention of problems then shows wider view and so exteriorizes one from difficulty although successful processing in scientology would depend upon taking all three elements of games into considerationand indeed that is the secret of bettering people taking freedom barriers and purposes into consideration and balancing themit is true that you could make man well simply by sitting down with him and asking him to invent problems one after the other the invention of synthetic problems would be found to free his mind and make him more able of course there is another factor involved in this in that it is he who is inventing the problems and therefore he is becoming pandetermined about problems rather than being in one place with all problems opposed to him an unhappy man is one who is considering continually how to become free one sees this in the clerk who is continually trying to avoid work although he has great deal of leisure time he is not enjoying any part of it he is trying to avoid contact with people objects energies and spaces he eventually becomes trapped in sort of lethargy if this man could merely change his mind and start worrying about how he could get more work to do his happiness level would increase markedly one who is plotting continually how to get out of things will be miserable one who is plotting how to get into things has much better chance of becoming happy there is of course the matter of being forced to play games in which one has interesta war into which one is drafted is an excellent example of this one is not interested in the purposes of the war and yet one finds himself fighting it thus there must be an additional element and this element is the power of choice one could say then that life is game and that the ability to play game consists of tolerance for freedom and barriers and an insight into purposes with the power of choice over participation these four elements freedom barriers purposes and power of choice are the guiding elements of life there are only two factors above these and both of them are related to these the first is the ability to create with of course its negative the ability to uncreate and the second is the ability to make postulate to consider to say thing and have it be true this then is the broad picture of life and these elements are used in its understanding in bringing life into focus and in making it less confusing 18chapter seven the parts of man the individual man is divisible separable into three parts divisions the first of these is the spirit called in scientology the thetan the second of these parts is the mind the third of these parts is the body probably the greatest discovery of scientology and its most forceful contribution to the knowledge of mankind has been the isolation description and handling of the human spirit accomplished in july 1951 in phoenix arizona i established along scientific rather than religious or humanitarian lines that that thing which is the person the personality is separable from the body and the mind at will and without causing bodily death or mental derangement in ages past there has been considerable controversy concerning the human spirit or soul and various attempts to control man have been effective in view of his almost complete ignorance of his own identity latterly spiritualists isolated from the person what they called the astral body and with this they were able to work for various purposes of their own in scientology the spirit itself was separated from what the spiritualists called the astral body and there should be confusion between these two things as you know that you are where you are at this moment so you would know if you spirit were detached from your mind and body man had not discovered this before because lacking the technologies of scientology he had very little reality upon his detachment from his mind and body and therefore conceived himself to be at least in part mind and body the entire cult of communism is based upon the fact that one lives only one life that there is hereafter and that the individual has religious significance man at large has been close to this state for at least the last century the state condition is of avery low order excluding as it does all selfrecognition the spirit the thetan spirit is described in scientology as having mass wavelength energy and time or location in space except by consideration or postulate the spirit then is not thing it is the creator of things the usual residence of the thetan is in the skull or near the body thetan can be in one of four conditions the first would be entirely separate from body or bodies or even from this universe the second would be near body and knowingly controlling the body the third would be in the body the skull and the fourth would be an inverted condition whereby he was compulsively away from the body and could not approach it there are degrees subdivisions of each one of these four states conditions the most optimum of these conditions from the standpoint of man is the second thetan is subject to deterioration this is at first difficult to understand since the entirety of his activity consists of considering or postulating he uses through his postulates various methods of controlling body that he does deteriorate is manifest but that he can at any moment return to an entirety of his ability is also factual in that he associates beingness with mass and action he does not consider himself as having an individual identity or name unless he is connected with one or more of the games of life the processes of scientology can establish this for the individual with greater or lesser rapidity and one of the many goals of processing in scientology is to exteriorize the individual and place him in the second condition above since it has been discovered that he is happier and more capable when so situated 19the mind the mind is communication and control system between the thetan and his environment the mind is network of communications and pictures energies and masses which are brought into being by the activities of the thetan versus the physical universe or other thetans thetan establishes various systems of control so that he can continue to operate body and through the body operate things in the physical universe as well as other bodies the most obvious portion of the mind is recognizable by anyone not in serious condition this is the mental image picture in scientology we call this mental image picture facsimile when it is photograph of the physical universe sometime in the past we call this mental image picture mockup when it is created by the thetan or for the thetan and does not consist of photograph of the physical universe we call mental image picture hallucination or more properly an automaticity something uncontrolled when it is created by another and seen by self various phenomena connect themselves with this entity called the mind some people closing their eyes see only blackness some people see pictures some people see pictures made by body reactions some people see only black screens others see golden lines others see spaces but the keynote of the entirety of the system called the mind is postulate and perception easily ten thousand new separate mental phenomena not hitherto seen by earlier observers have been classified in scientology and dianetics the thetan receives by the communication system called the mind various impressions including direct views of the physical universe in addition to this he receives impressions from past activities and most important he himself being close to total knowingness conceives things about the past and future which are independent of immediately present stimuli the mind is not in its entirety stimulusresponse mechanism as old marxist psychology as once taught in universities would have one believe the mind has three main divisions the first of these could be called the analytical mind the second the reactive mind and the third the somatic mind the analytical mind the analytical mind combines perceptions of the immediate environment of the past via pictures and estimations of the future into conclusions which are based upon the realities of situations the analytical mind combines the potential knowingness of the thetan with the conditions of his surroundings and brings him to independent conclusions this mind could be said to consist of visual pictures either of the past or of the physical universe monitored by and presided over by the knowingness of thetan the keynote of the analytical mind is awareness one knows what one is concluding and knows what one is doing the reactive mind the reactive mind is stimulusresponse mechanism ruggedly built and operable in trying circumstances the reactive mind never stops operating pictures of the environment of very low order are taken by this mind even in deep states of unconsciousness the reactive mind acts below the level of consciousness it is the literal stimulusresponse mind given certain stimulus it gives certain response dianetics concerned itself mainly with this one mind while it is an order of thinkingness the ability of the reactive mind to conclude rationally is so poor that we find in the reactive mind those various aberrated impulses which are gazed upon as oddities of personality eccentricities neuroses and psychoses it is this mind which stores up all the bad things that have happened to one and throws them back to him again in moments of emergency or danger so as to dictate his actions along lines which have 20been considered safe before as there is little thinkingness involved in this the courses of action dictated by the reactive mind are often not safe but highly dangerous the reactive mind is entirely literal in its interpretation of words and actions as it takes pictures and receives impressions during moments of unconsciousness phrase uttered when blow is struck is likely to be literally interpreted by the reactive mind and becomes active upon the body and analytical mind at later times the mildest stage of this would be arduous training wherein pattern is laid into the mind for later use under certain given stimuli harsh and less workable level is the hypnotic trance condition to which the mind is susceptible made impressionable by fixed attention words can be immediately implanted into the reactive mind which become operable under restimulation at later times an even lower level in the reactive mind is that one associated with blows drugs illness pain and other conditions of unconsciousness phrases spoken over an anaesthetized person can have later effect upon that person it is not necessarily true that each and every portion of an operation is painstakingly photographed by the reactive mind of the unconscious patient but it is true that great many of these stimuli are registered complete silence in the vicinity of person under anaesthetic or person who is unconscious or in deep pain is mandatory if one would preserve the mental health of that person or patient afterwards probably the most therapeutic action which could occur to an individual would be under scientology processing the separation of the thetan from the mind so that the thetan under duress and with total knowingness could view himself and his mind and act accordingly however there is type of exteriorization which is the most aberrative of all traumatic mentally injurious actions this is the condition when an individual is brought through injury or surgery or shock very close to death so that he exteriorizes from body and mind this exteriorization under duress is sudden and to the patient inexplicable and is in itself very shocking when this has occurred to an individual it is certain that he will suffer mentally from the experience afterwards it could be said that when the reactive mind contains these sudden shocks of exteriorization under duress attempts to exteriorize the individual later by scientology are more difficult however modern processing has overcome this the phenomenon of exteriorization under duress is accompanied at times by energy explosions in the various facsimiles of the mind and these crossassociate in the reactive mind therefore people become afraid of exteriorization and at times people are made ill simply by discussing the phenomenon due to the fact that they have exteriorized under duress during some operation or during some accident exteriorization under duress is the characteristic of death itself therefore exteriorization or the departure of the soul is generally associated with death in the minds of most people it is not necessarily true that one is dead because he exteriorizes and it is definitely not true that exteriorization not accompanied by shock pain or duress is at all painful indeed it is quite therapeutic the somatic mind the third portion of the mind is the somatic mind this is an even heavier type of mind than the reactive mind since it contains thinkingness and contains only actingness the impulses placed against the body by the thetan through various mental machinery arrive at the voluntary involuntary and glandular levels these have set methods of analysis for any given situation and so respond directly to commands given unfortunately the somatic mind is subject to each of the minds higher in scale above it and to the thetan in other words the thetan can independently affect the somatic mind the analytical mind can affect the somatic mind the reactive mind can affect the somatic mind 21thus we see that the neurons the glandular system the muscles and masses of the body are subject to various impulses each one of lower order than the next thus it is not odd to discover what we call psychosomatic illness condition exists here where the thetan does not have an awareness of burdening the somatic mind with various commands or derangements neither does the thetan have an awareness of his own participation in the analytical mind causing this action against the body in that the thetan is seldom aware of the reactive mind it is possible then for the reactive mind with its stimulusresponse content to impinge itself directly and without further recourse or advice upon the neurons muscles and glandular system of the body in that the reactive mind can hold fixed command in place causing derangement in the somatic mind it is possible then for illness to exist for bizarre pains to be felt for actual physical twists and aberrations to occur without any conscious knowledge on the part of the thetan this we call physical illness caused by the mind in brief such illness is caused by perceptions received in the reactive mind during moments of pain and unconsciousness whether the facsimile in the mind is received while the thetan is awake or unconscious the resulting mass of the energy picture is energy just as you see energy in an electric light bulb or from the flames of fire at one time it was considered that mental energy was different from physical energy in scientology it has been discovered that mental energy is simply finer higher level physical energy the test of this is conclusive in that thetan mocking up creating mental image pictures and thrusting them into the body can increase the body mass and by casting them away again can decrease the body mass this test has actually been made and an increase of as much as 30 pounds actually measured on scales has been added to and subtracted from body by creating mental energy energy is energy it has different wavelengths and different characteristics the mental image pictures are capable of reacting upon the physical environment and the physical environment is capable of reacting on mental image pictures thus the mind actually consists of spaces energies and masses of the same order as the physical universe if lighter and different in size and wavelength for much more comprehensive picture of the mind one should read dianetics the original thesis and dianetics the modern science of mental health these were written before the discoveries of the upper levels of beingness were made and are very complete picture of the mind itself its structure and what can be done to it and with it the body the third part of man is the physical body this can best be studied in such books as greys anatomy and other anatomical texts this is the province of the medical doctor and usually the oldtime psychiatrist or psychologist who were involved in the main in body worship the body is purely structural study and the actions and reactions amongst its various structures are complex and intensely interesting when scientology established biophysics it did so because of the various discoveries which had accumulated concerning mental energy in its reaction against physical energy and the activities which took place in the body because of these interactions biophysics only became feasible when it was discovered in scientology that fixed electrical field existed surrounding body entirely independent of but influenceable by the human mind the body exists in its own space that space is created by anchor points points which are anchored in space different to the physical universe space around body the complexity of these anchor points can cause an independent series of electronic flows which can occasion much discomfort to the individual the balance structure of the body and even its joint action and physical characteristics can be changed by changing this electrical field which exists at distance from or within the body the electrical field is paramount and monitors the actual physical structure of the body thus the body is not only influenced by the three minds it is influenced as well by its own electrical field an expert scientologist can discover for the average person this field and can 22bring about its adjustment although this is very far from the primary purpose of the scientologist the use of electrical shocks upon body for any purpose is therefore very dangerous and is not condoned by sensible men of course the use of electrical shock was never intended to be therapeutic but was intended only to bring about obedience by duress and as far as it can be discovered to make the entirety of insanity horror electrical shock deranges the electronic field in the vicinity of the body and is always succeeded by bad health or physical difficulties and never does otherwise than hasten the death of the person it has been stated by people using electric shock that if they were denied euthanasia the right to kill people who were considered to be burden on society they would at least use partial euthanasia in the form of electric shock brain surgery and drugs these treatments in some large percentage of cases however effected euthanasia as they were expected to do knowledge of both the mental and physical structure of the body would be necessary in order to treat the body and this knowledge has not existed prior to scientology the medical doctor has achieved many results by working purely with structure and biochemical products and in the field of emergency surgery and obstetrics and orthopaedics he is indispensable in the society medicine however has not previously even contained definition for mind and is not expected to invade the field which belongs properly to scientology these three parts of man the thetan the mind and the body are each one different studies but they influence each other markedly and continually of the three the senior entity is the thetan for without the thetan there would be mind or animation in the body while without body or mind there is still animation and life in the thetan the thetan is the person you are you in body many speculations in the field of parascientology have been made parascientology includes all of the uncertainties and unknown territories of life which have not been completely explored and explained however as studies have gone forward it has become more and more apparent that the senior activity of life is that of the thetan and that in the absence of the spirit further life exists in the insect kingdom it is not established whether or not each insect is ordered by spirit or whether one spirit orders enormous numbers of insects it is not established how mutation and evolution occur if they do and the general authorship of the physical universe is only speculated upon since scientology does not invade the eighth dynamic some facts however are completely known the first of these is that the individual himself is spirit controlling body via mind the second of these is that the thetan is capable of making space energy mass and time the third of these is that the thetan is separable from the body without the phenomenon of death and can handle and control body from well outside it the fourth of these is that the thetan does not care to remember the life which he has just lived after he has parted from the body and the mind the fifth of these is that person dying always exteriorizes the sixth of these is that the person having exteriorized usually returns to planet and procures usually another body of the same type of race as before in parascientology there is much discussion about between lives areas and other phenomena which might have passed at one time or another for heaven or hell but it is established completely that thetan is immortal and that he himself cannot actually experience death and counterfeits it by forgetting it is adequately manifest that thetan lives again and that he is very anxious to put something on the time track something for the future in order to have something to come back to thus we have the anxieties of sex there must be additional bodies for the next life it is obvious that what we create in our societies during this lifetime affects us during our next lifetime this is quite different from the belief or the idea that this occurs in scientology we have very little to do with forcing people to make conclusions an individual 23can experience these things for himself and unless he can do so one expects him to accept them the manifestation that our hereafter is our next life entirely alters the general concept of spiritual destiny there is argument whatsoever with the tenets of faith since it is not precisely stated uniformly by religions that one immediately goes to heaven or hell it is certain that an individual experiences the effect of the civilization which he has had part in creating in his next lifetime in other words the individual comes back he has responsibility for what goes on today since he will experience it tomorrow sex has been overweighted in importance in old psychotherapy an importance more or less disgraced at this time sex is only one of numerous creative impulses an anxiety about sex however occurs when an individual begins to believe that there will not be body for him to have during the next lifetime the common denominator of all aberration mental derangement is cessation of creation as sex is only one kind of creation and rather low order of it it will be seen that unhappiness could stem from various cessations of creation death itself is cessation of creation one stops creating the identity john jones and the environment and things of john jones he stops because he believes he cannot himself continue this creation without the assistance of body having become dependent upon mind and body the first to do his thinking for him and the second to do his acting an individual becoming sufficiently morose on the ideas of creation can actually bring about the condition of an inability to create control it will be seen that the three parts of man are intimately associated with control the anatomy of control is start change and stop the loss of control takes place with the loss of pandeterminism when one becomes too partisan braces himself too solidly against the remainder of the environment he longer controls the environment to the degree that he might and so is unable to start change and stop the environment it is scientific definition in scientology that control consists of start change and stop these three manifestations can be graphed alongside the apparent cycle of action create survive destroy any person is somewhere along this curve an individual who is bent mainly upon survival is intent usually upon changing things an individual who is close to being destroyed is bent mainly upon stopping things an individual who has free heart and mind about life is bent upon creating things there could be three things wrong with any person and these would be the inability to start the inability to change the inability to stop insanity for the most part is an inability to stop neurosis is habit which worsening flies entirely out of control one is stopped so often in life that he becomes an enemy of stopping and dislikes stopping so intensely that he himself will not stop things neurosis and psychosis of all classes are entirely inabilities to start to change or to stop in the matter of the parts of man we discover that all things are initiated by the thetan so far as action activity and behavior are concerned after such an initiation he can be blunted or warped from course and acted upon in such way that his attention becomes too fixed along one line or another and begins to suffer from these three inabilities however each one of the parts of man is subject to the anatomy of control an individual begins first by being unable himself without help to start to change and to stop then the mind may become prone to these disabilities and is unable to start change or to stop at will then the body itself can become subject to these three disabilities and is unable to start to change and to stop the oddity is however that an environment can so work upon thetan that his body becomes disabled through choice of his own similarly the reactive 24mind can become disabled through choice of either the body or the thetan but the thetan himself beyond observing the effect of various causes and having initiated the thought to be there can only become disabled by becoming too partisan by becoming too little pan determined and so bringing himself into difficulties these difficulties however are entirely the difficulties of consideration as the thetan considers so he is in the final analysis the thetan has problems of his own the problems are always other peoples problems and must exist in the mind or the body or in other people or his surroundings for him to have problems thus his difficulties are in the main difficulties of staying in the game and keeping the game going if thetan can suffer from anything it is being outcreated created against too thoroughly the manifestations of being outcreated would be the destruction of his own creations and the overpowering presence of other creations thus thetan can be brought to believe that he is trapped if he is outcreated in past dissertations on the subject of the mind and philosophies of life there was great deal of speculation and very little actual proof therefore these philosophies were creations and one philosopher was at work outcreating another philosopher in scientology we have this single difference we are dealing with discoveries the only things created about scientology are the actual books and works in which scientology is presented the phenomena of scientology are discovered and are held in common by all men and all life forms there is effort in scientology to outcreate each and every thetan that comes along it is of course possible to conceive scientology as creation and to conceive that it is overwhelming it should be viewed otherwise for it is intended as an assistance to life at large to enable life to make better civilization and better game there are tenets in scientology which cannot be demonstrated with entirely scientific procedures 25chapter eight causation of knowledge scientology as science is composed of many axioms selfevident truths as in geometry there are some fiftyeight of these axioms in addition to the two hundred more axioms of dianetics which preceded the scientology axioms the first axioms in scientology are axiom 1 life is basically static definition life static has mass motion wavelength location in space or in time it has the ability to postulate and to perceive definition in scientology the word postulate means to cause thinkingness or consideration it is specially applied word and is defined as causative thinkingness axiom 2 the static is capable of considerations postulates and opinions axiom 3 space energy objects form and time are the result of considerations made andor agreed upon or not by the static and are perceived solely because the static considers that it can perceive them axiom 4 space is viewpoint of dimension space is caused by looking out from point the only actuality of space is the agreedupon consideration that one perceives through something and this we call space axiom 5 energy consists of postulated particles in space one considers that energy exists and that he can perceive energy one also considers that energy behaves according to certain agreedupon laws these assumptions or considerations are the totality of energy axiom 6 objects consist of grouped particles and solids axiom 7 time is basically postulate that space and particles will persist the rate of their persistence is what we measure with clocks and the motion of heavenly bodies axiom 8 the apparency of time is the change of position of particles in space axiom 9 change is the primary manifestation of time axiom 10 the highest purpose in the universe is the creation of an effect these first ten axioms of scientology are the most fundamental truths by which we mean commonly held considerations here we have thought and life and the physical universe in their relation one to the other regardless of further considerations ideas assumptions and conditions there lies beneath them these first ten truths it is as though one had entered into an honorable bargain with fellow beings to hold these things in common once this is done or once such contract or agreement exists one has the fundamentals of universe specialized considerations based on the above make one or another kind of universe the physical universe which we see around us and in which we live was created on these fundamentals without regard to who created it its creation was agreed upon in order to perceive it one must agree that it exists there are three classes of universes there is first foremost and most evident the physical universe of spaces stars suns land sea air and living forms then there is the other fellows universe which may or may not be agreed upon by his associates this he holds to 26himself the phenomenon of this universe is included in the field of the mind as described earlier then listed last here but first perceived is ones own universe the phenomenon of universes is an interesting one since ones own universe can be overwhelmed by the universes of others these in scientology we call valences extra personalities cells apparent beingnesses valences and universes are the same thing essentially for example one while living in the physical universe can be overpowered by the universe of let us say father while one still retains his own valence or identity one is yet acting or thinking or suffering or feeling somewhat like father even though one is by oneself there is this additional apparent beingness although father is absent his commands are still present thus we get such things as duty obedience training and eveneducation each one of these is caused by some part of another universe to greater or lesser degree regardless of how one reacts to universes he still remains in some degree himself it is the effort of many to struggle against universes or valences in fact this is game and the essence of games the totality of the impulse of aberrated people is the effort to separate ones own self as thetan from the various universes with which he feels himself too intimately associated one is only oppressed by universe when he feels he can have nothing of that universe one is only victimized by fathers universe when one is in protest against father one protests against the physical universe only when he feels that he can have part of it or does not belong in it or as in religion is not looked upon kindly by what he conceives to be the creator of the physical universe there is basic law about universes the postulates of the creator of any universe are the postulates which work in that universe thus one may feel uncomfortable in the universe of another universes as considered in games earlier could be considered the playing fields of life one plays willingly or one plays unwillingly when one begins to play unwillingly he is apt to discover himself victimized by and interiorized into the universe of some game it is against this phenomenon that person protests consider the matter of jail on the surface of it as voltaire discovered jail provides food and shelter and leisure time this would seem to be the ambition of many people but the jail provides as well restriction without ones consent the only difference between being in jail and being the king in castle so far as liberty is concerned is ones own desires in the matter and ones own ability to command ones environment as king in castle one would be causative his will statement thinkingness would have an effect upon others being in jail one is an effect in that the thinkingness of others finds him its target here we have in terms of universes the most rudimentary example of cause and effect we must however assume because it is so evident that an individual only gets into traps and circumstances he intends to get into certain it is that having gotten into such position he may be unwilling to remain in it but trap is always preceded by ones own choice of entrance we must assume very wide freedom of choice on the part of thetan since it is almost impossible to conceive how thetan could get himself trapped even though he consented to it by actual demonstration thetan goes through walls barriers vanishes space appears anywhere at will and does other remarkable things it must be then that an individual can be trapped only when he considers that he is trapped in view of the fact that the totality of existence is based upon his own considerations we find that the limitations he has must have been invited by himself otherwise they could not be eradicated by the individual under processing since the only one who is present with the preclear is the auditor and past associates of the preclear while not present do desensitize under auditing in the preclears mind therefore it must have been the preclear who kept them there the preclear by processing can resolve all of his difficulties without going and finding other persons or consulting other universes thus the totality of entrapment aberration even injury torture insanity and other distasteful items are basically considerations thetan is making and holding right now in present time this must be the case since time itself is postulate or consideration on his own part 27the greatest philosophical clamor or quarrel has been waged around the subject of knowledge and there is nothing preposterous on the subject of knowledge that cannot be found in the philosophical texts the superiority and ascendancy of scientology depends upon the fact that it has transcended this philosophical quarrel on the subject of knowingness and scientology contains in itself the basics of knowledge by knowledge we mean assured belief that which is known information instruction enlightenment learning practical skill by knowledge we mean data factors and whatever can be thought about or perceived the reason why knowledge has been misunderstood in philosophy is that it is only half the answer there is allness to knowledge by definition knowledge is that which is perceived or learned or taken from another source this patently then means that when one learns he is being an effect we see in axiom 10 that the highest purpose in the universe is the creation of an effect this is in direct contradiction to knowledge although one of course can know how to create an effect opposed to knowledge we have the neglected half of existence which is the creation of knowledge the creation of data the creation of thought the causative consideration selfevolved ideas as opposed to ideas otherwise evolved the reason scientology is such fascinating study is that it takes apart the other fellows ideas and permits one to create some of his own scientology gives us the common denominators of objects energies spaces uni verses livingness and thought itself there is cause and effect cause could be defined as emanation it could be defined also for purposes of communication as sourcepoint if you consider river flowing to the sea the place where it began would be the sourcepoint or cause and the place where it went into the sea would be the effectpoint and the sea would be the effect of the river the man firing the gun is cause the man receiving the bullet is effect the one making statement is causing communication the one receiving the statement is the effect of the communication basic definition of communication is causedistanceeffect almost all anxieties and upsets in human relations come about through an imbalance of cause and effect one must be willing at once to cause new data statements assumptions considerations and to receive ideas assumptions considerations so great is the anxiety of thetan to be an effect that he closely approaches those things which can cause an effect upon him thus thetan becomes trapped on the face of it so few thetans make causative data and so many receive data that it would seem in view of the fact that thetan can be touched only by his own consideration that thetans are more anxious for effects than to be cause it is learned under close experiments that there is nothing thetan actually disdains on an effect level he pretends not to like or enjoy certain effects and protests against them but he knows very well that the mechanism of protest causes the effect to approach more closely as general rule this came about by his repeated failure to cause an effect and to receive noeffect in games insisting on noeffect for himself he lost then he had to say he liked the effect the prevailing anxiety then is to be an effect not to be cause the entire subject of responsibility is study of cause and effect in that person who wants responsibility is anxious to be an effect only and person who can assume responsibility must also be willing to be causative 28a thetan can be swung into state of consideration by observing that it is commonly held by others this keeps him in the universe and this keeps him being effect study investigation receiving education and similar activity are all effect activities and result in the assumption of less responsibility thus while it is true that thetan cannot actually get into trouble he can by agreeing with the current agreedupon thought in the universe where he finds himself take pattern of thinkingness which makes him less effective because he wishes to be an effect if he feels he must gather all of his data from elsewhere he is then the effect of knowledge the effect of universes and postulates and he tends to reduce his own ability to form or make knowledge thirst for other thetans postulates and would lead one to forget that he himself has been party to the making of these postulates and that he himself had to follow certain course in order to put himself in reach of other thetans postulates note to translators lacking proper english word for causative thinking the word postulate has been used in slight difference to its english definition if there is word in your language which means selfimpulsion or creation of thought use that instead of postu late because one is the effect of knowledge causing data considerations or facts to come into being separates one in distance from being an effect if one is very anxious to be an effect and if this is his basic consideration he will not take well to causing information to come into existence but in order to get him out of the traps in which he finds himself it is necessary to some degree that he do so causing few barriers or traps the individual then loses control over barriers or traps wishing to be an effect of course he must lose control of barriers and traps otherwise he cannot be entrapped by them the thing to do to free him from trap is to have him find what parts of the trap he himself is willing to create own have or possess this places the barriers which can be spaces energy movements or obstacles under his control and his postulating that he can have or possess this or that causes him to be willing to be or occupy the trap the moment this occurs he is longer in the trap or even if he is still in it to some degree he does not object to it and can leave it when he wishes civilization and savagery the way to paralyze nation entirely and to make it completely ungovernable would be to forbid education of any kind within its borders and to inculcate into every person within it the feeling that he must not receive any information from anybody about anything to make nation governable it is necessary to hold kindly view of education and to honor educative persons and measures to conquer land it is not necessarily efficient to overwhelm it with guns once this is done it is necessary to apply educative measures in order to bring about some sort of agreement amongst the people themselves as well as between the conqueror and the subdued only in this way could one have society civilization or as we say in scientology smoothly running game in other words two extremes could be reached neither one of which is desirable for the individual the first extreme could be reached by emphasis only upon selfcreated data or information this would bring about not only lack of interpersonal relations but also an anxiety to have an effect which would as it does in barbaric peoples result in social cruelty unimaginable in civilized nation the other extreme would be to forbid in its entirety any selfcreated information and to condone only data or considerations generated by others than self here we would create an individual with responsibility so easily handled that he would be only puppet selfcreated data is then not bad thing neither is education but one without the other to hold it in some balance will bring about nogame condition or nocivilization just as individuals can be seen by observing nations so we see the african tribesman with his 29complete contempt for truth and his emphasis on brutality and savagery for others but not himself is nocivilization and we see at the other extreme china slavishly dedicated to ancient scholars incapable of generating within herself sufficient rulers to continue without bloodshed nation we have noted the individual who must be the only one who can make postulate or command whose authority is dearer to him than the comfort or state of millions and we have suffered from such men napoleon hitler kaiser wilhelm frederick of prussia genghis khan attila we have known too the scholar who has studied himself into blindness and is the worlds greatest authority on government or some such thing who yet cannot himself manage his bank account or dog with any certainty here we have in either case total imbalance the world shaker is himself unwilling to be any effect of any kind and all the men named here were arrant personal cowards and we have the opposite man who would not know what you were talking about if you told him to get an idea of his own we see another example of this in the fundamental laws of warfare body of troops to be effective must be able to attack and to defend its implements must be divided 50 for attack and 50 for defense in other words even in crude activity such as warfare we find that successful outcome is possible unless the troops can devote half of their energies to attack and half of them to defense in the much broader view of life we discover on any dynamic that success or game or activity or life itself depends upon being willing to be cause as well as willing to be an effect he who would give must be willing to receive he who would receive must be willing to give when these tenets are violated the most fundamental principle of human relationships is violated and the result is nogame condition such as aberration insanity antisocialness criminality inactivity laziness tiredness mania fanaticism and all the other things against which men protest but imbalances between cause and effect also enter randomities unpredicted motions into the game of life and cannot be neglected in their potential for creating game any information is valuable to the degree that you can use it in other words any information is valuable to the degree that you can make it yours scientology of all the sciences does not teach youit only reminds you for the information was yours in the first place it is not only the science of life but it is an account of what you were doing before you forgot what you were doing 30chapter nine know and notknow it is mechanism of thinkingness whether one is postulating or receiving information that one retain ones ability to know it is equally important that one retain ones ability to notknow thought consists entirely of knowing and notknowing and the shades of gray between you will discover that most people are trying not to remember in other words they are trying to notknow education can only become burdensome when one is unable to notknow it it is necessary that one be able to create to receive to know and to notknow information data and thoughts lacking any one of these skills for they are skills matter how native they are to the individual one is apt to get into chaos of thinkingness or creatingness or livingness you can look at any eccentric or aberrated person and discover rapidly by an inspection of him which one of these four factors he is violating he either is unable to know or notknow his own created thoughts or he is unable to know or notknow the thoughts of others somewhere for some reason best known to him in his anxiety to be part of the game he has shelved or lost one of these abilities time is process of knowing in the present and notknowing in the future or the past remembering is the process of knowing the past prediction is the process of knowing the future forgetting is the process of notknowing the past and living only for today is the process of notknowing the future exercises in these various items rehabilitate not only the sanity or ability of the individual but his general capability in living and playing the game 31chapter ten the goal of scientology the end object of scientology is not the making into nothing of all of existence or the freeing of the individual of any and all traps everywhere the goal of scientology is the making of the individual capable of living better life in his own estimation and with his fellows and the playing of better game 32chapter eleven scientology processing scientology is applied in many ways to many fields one particular and specialized method of application of scientology is its use on individuals and groups of people in the eradication of physical problems deriving from mental states and the improvement of their abilities and intelligence by processing is meant the verbal exercising of an individual preclear in exact scientology processes there is great deal of terminology and precision in these processes and their use and they are not combinable with older mental activities such as psychiatry psychology psychoanalysis yoga massage etc however these processes are capable of addressing or treating the same ills of the mind as are delineated by older methodology with the addition that scientology is alone in its ability to successfully eradicate those psychosomatic problems to which it is addressed it is the only science or study known which is capable of uniformly producing marked and significant increases in intelligence and general ability scientology processing amongst other things can improve the intelligence quotient of an individual his ability or desire to communicate his social attitudes his capability and domestic harmony his fertility his artistic creativity his reaction time and his health an additional sphere of activity allied to processing is preventive scientology in this branch of processing an individual is freed from assuming states lower than those he has already suffered from in other words the progress of tendencies neuroses habits and deteriorating activities can be halted by scientology or their occurrence can be prevented this is done by processing the individual on standard scientology processes without particular atten tion to the aberration involved scientology processing is called auditing by which the auditor practitioner listens computes and commands the auditor and preclear person receiving auditing are together outofdoors or in quiet place where they will not be disturbed or where they are not being subjected to interrupting influences the purpose of the auditor is to give the preclear certain and exact commands which the preclear can follow and perform the purpose of the auditor is to increase the ability of the preclear the auditors code is the governing set of rules for the general activity of auditing the code follows the auditors code 1 do not evaluate for the preclear 2 do not invalidate or correct the preclears data 3 use the processes which improve the preclears case 4 keep all appointments once made 5 donotprocessapreclearafter 10pm 6 do not process preclear who is improperly fed or who has not received enough rest 7 do not permit frequent change of auditors 8 do not sympathize with the preclear 9 never permit the preclear to end the session on his own independent decision 10 never walk off from preclear during session 11 never get angry with preclear 12 always reduce every communication lag encountered by continued use of the same question or process 13 always continue process as long as it produces change and longer 14 be willing to grant beingness to the preclear 15 never mix the processes of scientology with those of various other practices 16 maintain twoway communication with the preclear 3317 never use scientology to obtain personal and unusual favors or unusual compliance from the preclear for the auditors own personal profit 18 estimate the current case of your preclear with reality and do not audit another imagined case 19 do not explain justify or make excuses for any auditor mistakes whether real or imagined the auditors code governs the activity of the auditor during sessions the activity of the scientologist in general is governed by another broader code the code of scientologist as scientologist i pledge myself to the code of scientology for the good of all 1 to hear or speak word of disparagement to the press public or preclears concerning any of my fellow scientologists our professional organization or those whose names are closely connected to this science nor to place in danger any such person 2 to use the best i know of scientology to the best of my ability to better my preclears groups and the world 3 to refuse to accept for processing and to refuse to accept money from any preclear or group i feel i cannot honestly help 4 to deter to the fullest extent of my power anyone misusing or degrading scientology to harmful ends 5 to prevent the use of scientology in advertisements of other products 6 to discourage the abuse of scientology in the press 7 to employ scientology to the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics 8 to render good processing sound training and good discipline to those students or peoples entrusted to my care 9 to refuse to impart the personal secrets of my preclears 10 to engage in unseemly disputes with the uninformed on the subject of my profession 11 to completely refrain from discussing the case of another auditors preclear with that preclear or within his hearing as it can be seen both of these codes are designed to protect the preclear as well as scientology and the auditor in general as these codes evolve from many years of observation and experience by great number of people it can be said that they are intensely important and are probably complete failure to observe them has resulted in failure of scientology scientology can do what it can do only when it is used within the limits of these two codes thus it can be seen that the interjection of peculiarities or practices by the auditor into scientology processing can actually nullify and eradicate the benefits of that processing any hope or promise in scientology is conditional upon its good use by the individual and its use in particular within the limits of these two codes the conditions of auditing certain definite conditions must prevail and certain methodology must be followed in order that processing may be beneficial to its fullest extent probably the first condition is good grasp of scientology as science and its mission in the world the second condition would be relaxed state of mind on the part of the auditor and the confidence that his use of scientology upon the preclear will not produce harmful result the third requisite should be finding preclear by this it is literally meant that one should discover somebody willing to be processed and having discovered one so willing should then make sure that he is aware that he is there being processed the fourth requisite would be quiet place in which to audit with every precaution taken that the preclear will not be interrupted or burst in upon or unduly startled during processing 34chapter twelve exact processes auditing game and nogame conditions in scientology the most important single elements to the auditor are game conditions and nogame conditions reasonall games are aberrative all processing is directed toward game conditions little or processing is directed toward nogame conditions therefore it is of the utmost importance to know exactly what these are for one could be superficial about it and lose ruleall games are aberrative some are fun the elements of games to auditors are game consists of freedoms barriers and purposes in game ones own team or self must receive noeffect and must deliver an effect upon the other team or opponent game should have space and preferably playing field game is played in the same time continuum for both sides all players game must have something which one does not have in order for it to be won some part of the dynamics must be excluded for game condition to exist the amount of the dynamics excluded represents the tone of the game games occur only when there is intention opposing intention purpose opposing purpose scarcity of games forces the preclear to accept less desirable games participation in any game whether it be the game of sickman jealouswife or polio is preferable to being in nogame condition the type of game entered by person is determined by his consideration as to how much and what kind of an effect he may receive while trying to deliver an effect games are the basic mechanism for continuing attention to play game one must be able to notknow his past and future and notknow his opponents complete intentions game conditions are attention identity effect on opponents noeffect on self cant have on opponents and goals and their areas have on tools of play own goals and field purpose problems of play 35selfdeterminism opponents the possibility of loss the possibility of winning communication nonarrival nogame conditions are knowing all notknowing everything serenity namelessness noeffect on opponent effect on self or team have everything cant have nothing solutions pandeterminism friendship with all understanding total communication communication win lose universe playing field arrival death process only with those conditions listed as game conditions do not process directly toward those conditions listed as nogame conditions so doing the auditor will run out erase the aberrative effect of games and restore an ability to play game identitiesvalences there are four identities or valences when one is in his own valence he is said to be himself as he departs from his own identity he comes in to the following exchanged valence one has directly superimposed the identity of another on his own exampledaughter becomes own mother to some degree remedyone directly runs out mother attention valence one has become the valence b because one wants attention from c exampleone becomes mother because mother received attention from father while self did not remedyrun out father even though preclear appears in valence of mother synthetic valence one takes valence about which he has been told example mother tells child false things about father accuses child of being like father with result that child is forced into fathers valence remedyrun out mother even though preclear does not seem to be near mothers valence all requisites for auditing from here on are entirely concerned with procedures and processes by auditing procedure is meant the general model of how one goes about addressing preclear this includes an ability to place one question worded exactly the same way over and 36over again to the preclear matter how many times the preclear has answered the question it should include the ability to acknowledge with good and all right every time preclear executes or completes the execution of command it should include the ability to accept communication from the preclear when the preclear has something to say the auditor should acknowledge the fact that he has received the preclears communication and should pay some attention to the communication procedure also includes the ability to sense when the preclear is being overstrained by processing or is being unduly annoyed and to handle such crises in the session to prevent the preclear from leaving an auditor should also have the ability of handling startling remarks or occurrences by the preclear an auditor should also have the knack of preventing the preclear from talking obsessively since prolonged conversation markedly reduces the havingness of the preclear and the sooner long dissertations by the preclear are cut off the better for the session in general processes as distinct from procedures consist of utilizing the principle of the gradient scale to the end of placing the preclear in better control of himself his mind the people and the universe around him by gradient scale is meant proceeding from simplicity toward greater difficulty giving the preclear always more than he can do but giving him as much as he can do until he can handle great deal the idea here is to give the preclear nothing but wins and to refrain from giving the preclear losses in the game of processing thus it can be seen that processing is team activity and is not itself game whereby the auditor opposes and seeks to defeat the preclear and the preclear seeks to defeat the auditor for when this condition exists little results in processing the earliest stage of auditing consists in taking over control of the preclear so as to restore to the preclear more control of himself than he has had the most fundamental step is then location whereby the preclear is made to be aware of the fact that he is in an auditing room that an auditor is present and that the preclear is being preclear those conditions will become quite apparent if one realizes that it would be very difficult for to process father father is not likely to recognize anything else than the boy he raised in his auditor therefore the father would have to be made aware of the fact that the was competent practitioner before the father could be placed under control in processing one of the most elementary commands in scientology is look at who am i after preclear has been asked to do this many times until he can do so quickly and accurately and without protest it can be said that the preclear will have found the auditor the preclear is asked by the auditor to control which is to say start change and stop the anatomy of control anything he is capable of controlling in very bad case this might be very small object being pushed around on table being started and changed and stopped each time specifically and only at the auditors command until the preclear himself realizes that he himself can start change and stop the object sometimes four or five hours spent in this exercise are very well spent on very difficult preclear the preclear is then asked to start change and stop his own body under the auditors specific and precise direction in all of his commands the auditor must be careful never to give second command before the first one has been fully obeyed preclear in this procedure is walked around the room and is made to start change the direction of and stop his body emphasizing one of these at time until he realizes that he can do so with ease only now could it be said that session is well in progress or that preclear is securely under the auditors command it should be noted especially that the goal of scientology is better selfdeterminism for the preclear this rules out at once hypnotism drugs alcohol or other control mechanisms 37used by other and older therapies it will be found that such things are not only not necessary but they are in direct opposition to the goals of greater ability for the preclear the principal points of concentration for the auditor now become the ability of the preclear to have the ability of the preclear to notknow and the ability of the preclear to play game an additional factor is the ability of the preclear to be himself and not number of other people such as his father his mother his marital partner or his children the ability of the preclear is increased by addressing to him the process known as the trio these are three questions or rather commands 1 look around here and tell what you could have 2 look around here and tell what you would permit to remain in place 3 look around here and tell with what you could dispense 1 above is used usually about ten times then 2 is used five times and 3 is used once this ratio of ten five and one would be an ordinary or routine approach to havingness the end in view is to bring the preclear into condition whereby he can possess or own or have whatever he sees without further conditions ramifications or restrictions this is the most therapeutic of all processes elementary as it might seem it is done without too much twoway communication or discussion with the preclear and it is done until the preclear can answer questions one two and three equally well it should be noted at once that twentyfive hours of use of this process by an auditor upon preclear brings about very high rise in tone by saying twentyfive hours it is intended to give the idea of the length of time the process should be used as it is strain on the usual person to repeat the same question over and over it will be seen that an auditor should be well disciplined or very well trained before he audits in the case of preclear who is very unable cant have is substituted for have etc in each of the above questions for few hours until the preclear is ready for the trio in its have form this cancant is the plus and minus aspect of all thought and in scientology is called by specialized word dichotomy the rehabilitation of the ability of the preclear to notknow is also rehabilitation of the preclear in the time stream since the process of time consists of knowing the moment and notknowing the past and notknowing the future simultaneously this process like all other scientology processes is repetitive the process is run ordinarily only after the preclear is in very good condition and is generally run in an exterior well inhabited place here the auditor without exciting public comment indicates person and asks the preclear can you notknow something about that person the auditor does not permit the preclear to notknow things which the preclear already doesnt know the preclear notknows only those things which are visible and apparent about the person this is also run on objects in the environment such as walls floors chairs and other things the auditor should not be startled when for the preclear large chunks of the environment start to disappear this is ordinary routine and in effect the preclear should make the entirety of the environment disappear at his own command the environment does not disappear for the auditor the end goal of this notknow process is the disappearance of the entire universe under the preclears control but only for the preclear it will be discovered while running this that the preclears havingness may deteriorate if this happens he was not run enough on the trio before he was run on this process it is only necessary in such case to intersperse look around here and tell what you could have with the notknow command to keep the preclear in good condition drop of havingness is manifested by nervous agitation obsessive talk or semiunconsciousness or dopiness on the part of the preclear these mani festations indicate only reduction of havingness 38the reverse of the question here is tell something that you would be willing to have that person indicated by the auditor notknow about you both sides of the question have to be run audited this process can be continued for twentyfive hours or even fifty or seventyfive hours of auditing with considerable benefit so long as it does not react too violently upon the preclear in terms of loss of havingness it should be noted that in running either havingness or notknow on preclear the preclear may exteriorize in other words it may become apparent either by his observation or because the preclear informs him that the auditor has exteriorized preclear under the parts of man section there is an explanation of this phenomenon in modern auditing the auditor does not do anything odd about this beyond receive and be interested in the preclears statement of the fact the preclear should not be permitted to become alarmed since it is usual manifestation preclear is in better condition and will audit better exteriorized than in his head understanding that an actual ability to notknow is an ability to erase the past by selfcommand without suppressing it with energy or going into any other method is necessary to help the preclear it is the primary rehabilitation in terms of knowingness forgetting is lower manifestation than notknowingness the third ability to be addressed by the auditor is the ability of the preclear to play game first and foremost in the requisites to playing game is the ability to control one must be able to control something in order to participate in game therefore the general rehabilitation of control by starting changing and stopping things is rehabilitation of the ability to play game when preclear refuses to recover it is because the preclear is using his state as game and does not believe that there is any better game for him to play than the state he is in he may protest if this is called game nevertheless any condition will surrender if the auditor has the preclear invent similar conditions or even tell lies about the existing condition inventing games or inventing conditions or inventing problems alike rehabilitates the ability to play game chief amongst these various rehabilitation factors are control start change and stop problems and the willingness to overwhelm or be overwhelmed one ceases to be able to have games when one loses control over various things when one becomes short of problems and when one is unwilling to be overwhelmed in other words to lose or to overwhelm to win it will be found while running havingness as in the trio above that one may run down the ability to play game since havingness is the reward of game in part in the matter of problems it will be seen that these are completely necessary to the playing of game the anatomy of problem is intention versus intention this is of course in essence the purpose of all games to have two sides each one with an opposed intention technically problem is two or more purposes in conflict it is very simple to detect whether or not the preclear is suffering from scarcity of games the preclear who needs more games clutches to himself various presenttime problems if an auditor is confronted with preclear who is being obsessed by problem in presenttime he knows two things 1 that the preclears ability to play agame islow and 2 that he must run an exact process at once to rehabilitate the preclear in session it often happens at the beginning of an auditing session that the preclear has encountered heavy presenttime problem between sessions the preclear must always be consulted before the session is actually in progress as to whether or not he has anything worrying him to preclear who is worried about some presenttime situation or problem other process has any greater effectiveness than the following one the auditor after very brief discussion of the problem asks the preclear to invent problem of comparable magnitude he may have to reword this request to make the preclear understand it completely but the auditor wants in essence the preclear to invent or create problem he considers similar to the problem he has if the preclear is unable to do this it is necessary then to have him lie about the problem which he has lying is the lowest order of creativeness after he has lied about the problem for short time it will be found that he will be able to invent problems he should be made to invent problem after problem until he is longer concerned with his presenttime problem 39the auditor should understand that preclear who is now willing to do something about the problem has not been run long enough on the invention of problems of comparable magnitude as long as the preclear is attempting to do something about the problem the problem is still of obsessive importance to him session can be continued successfully until such presenttime problem is entirely flat and it has been the experience when presenttime problem was not completely eradicated by this process that the remainder of the session or indeed the entire course of auditing may be interrupted when preclear does not seem to be advancing under auditing thing which he does markedly and observedly it must then be supposed that the preclear has presenttime problem which has not been eradicated and which must be handled in auditing although the auditor gives the preclear to understand that he too believes this presenttime problem is extremely important the auditor should not believe that this process will not handle any presenttime problem since it will this process should be done on some preclears in company with the trio if the preclear is asked to lie about or invent problem of comparable magnitude and while doing so becomes agitated or unconscious or begins to talk wildly or obsessively it must be assumed that he will have to have some havingness run on him until the agitation or manifestation ceases so that the problem of comparable magnitude process can be resumed another aspect of the ability to play game is the willingness to win and the willingness to lose an individual has to be willing to be cause or willing to be an effect as far as games are concerned this is reduced to willingness to win and willingness to lose people become afraid of defeat and afraid of failure the entire anatomy of failure is only that ones postulates or intentions are reversed in action for instance one intends to strike wall and strikes it that is win one intends not to strike wall and doesnt strike it that is again win one intends not to strike wall and strikes it that is lose one intends to strike wall and cant strike it this is again lose it will be seen in this as well as other things that the most significant therapy there is is changing ones mind all things are as one considers they are and other way if it is sufficiently simple to give the definition of winning and losing so it is simple to process the matter this condition is best expressed it appears in processing by process known as overwhelming an elementary way of running this is to take the preclear outside where there are numbers of people to observe and indicating person to ask the preclear what could overwhelm that person when the preclear answers this he is asked about the same person what could that person overwhelm he is then asked as the third question look around here and tell what you could have these three questions are run one after the other then another person is chosen and then the three questions are asked again this process can be varied in its wording but the central idea must remain as above the preclear can be asked what would you permit to overwhelm that person and what would you permit that person to overwhelm and of course look around here and tell what you could have this is only one of number of possible processes on the subject of overwhelming but it should be noted that asking the preclear to think of things which would overwhelm him could be fatal to the case where overwhelming is handled the preclear should be given detached view counterposition to havingness processes but one which is less therapeutic is separateness one asks the preclear to look around and discover things which are separate from things this is repeated over and over it is however destructive of havingness even though it will occasionally prove beneficial it will be seen that havingness barriers notknowingness being in present time and not in the past or the future purposes problems antagonists or intentioncounterintention and separateness freedom will cover the anatomy of games it is not to be thought however 40that havingness addresses itself only to games many other factors enter into it in amongst all of these it is of the greatest single importance one addresses in these days of scientology the subjective self the mind as little as possible one keeps the preclear alert to the broad environment around him an address to the various energy patterns of the mind is less beneficial than exercises which directly approach other people or the physical universe therefore asking preclear to sit still and answer the question what could you have when it is answered by the preclear from his experience or on the score of things which are not present is found to be nontherapeutic and is found instead to decrease the ability and intelligence of the preclear this is what is known as subjective inside the mind only process these are the principal processes which produce marked gains there are other processes and there are combinations of processes but these given here are the most important scientologist knowing the mind completely can of course do many tricks with the conditions of people to improve them one of these is the ability to address psychosomatic illness such as crippled leg which having nothing physically wrong with it yet is not usable the auditor could ask the preclear tell lie about your leg with possible relief of the pain or symptoms asking the preclear repeatedly look around here and tell something your leg could have would undoubtedly release the somatic asking the preclear with the bad leg what problem could your leg be to you or desiring him to invent problem of comparable magnitude to your leg would produce distinct change in the condition of the leg this would apply to any other body part or organ it would also apply strangely enough to the preclears possessions if preclear had avehicle or cart which was out of repair or troublesome to him one could ask him what problem could cart be to you and thus requesting him to invent many such problems one would discover that he had solved his problems with the cart there is phenomenon in existence that the preclear already has many set games and when the auditor asks him to give some problems he already has the mani festations of asising or erasing taking place thought erases therefore the number of problems or games the preclear would have would be reduced by asking him to recount those which he already has asking the preclear to describe his symptoms is far less therapeutic and may result in worsening of those symptoms contrary to what some schools of thought have believed in the past but which accounts for their failures there are specific things which one must avoid in auditing these follow 1 significances the easiest thing thetan does is change his mind the most difficult thing he does is handle the environment in which he finds himself situated therefore asking thetan to run out various ideas is fallacy it is mistake asking the preclear to think over something can also be an error asking preclear to do exercises which concern his mind alone can be entirely fatal preclear is processed between himself and his environment if he is processed between himself and his mind he is processed up too short view and his condition will worsen 2 twoway communication there can be far too much twoway communication or far too much communication in an auditing session communication involves the reduction of havingness letting preclear talk on and on or obsessively is to let preclear reduce his havingness the preclear who is permitted to go on talking will talk himself down the tone scale and into bad condition it is better for the auditor simply and discourteously to tell preclear to shut up than to have the preclear run himself out of the bottom on havingness you can observe this for yourself if you permit person who is not too able to talk about his troubles to keep on talking he will begin to talk more and more hectically he is reducing his havingness he will eventually talk himself down the tone scale into apathy at which time he will be willing to tell you as you insist upon it that he feels better when as matter of fact he is actually worse asking preclear how do you feel now4 can reduce his havingness since he looks over his presenttime condition and asises some mass 413 too many processes it is possible to run preclear on too many processes in too short time with reduction of the preclears recovery this is handled by observing the communication lag of the preclear it will be discovered that the preclear will space his answers to repeated question differently with each answer when long period ensues between the question and his answer to the question second time he is said to have communication lag the communication lag is the length of time between the placing of the question by the auditor and the answering of that exact question by the preclear it is not the length of time between the placing of the question by the auditor and some statement by the preclear it will be found that the communication lag lengthens and shortens on repeated question the question on the tenth time it has been asked may detect significant lag this is the time to stop asking that question since it now has appreciable communication lag one can leave any process when the communication lag for three successive questions is the same in order to get from one process to another one employs communication bridge which to marked degree reduces the liability of too many processes communication bridge is always used before question is asked the preclear should have the question discussed with him and the wording of the question agreed upon as though he were making contract with the auditor the auditor says that he is going to have the preclear do certain things and finds out if its all right with the preclear if the auditor asks him to do these things this is the first part of communication bridge it precedes all questions but when one is changing from one process to another the bridge becomes bridge indeed one levels out the old process by asking the preclear whether or not he doesnt think it is safe to leave that process now one discusses with the preclear the possible benefit received from the process and then tells the preclear that he is longer going to use that process now he tells the preclear he is going to use new process describes the process and gets an agreement on it when the agreement is achieved then he uses this process the communication bridge is used at all times the last half of it the agreement on new process is used always before any process is begun 4 failure to handle the presenttime problem probably more cases are stalled or found unable to benefit in processing because of the neglect of the presenttime problem as covered above than any other single item 5 unconsciousness dopiness or agitation on the part of the preclear is not mark of good condition it is loss of havingness the preclear must never be processed into unconsciousness or dopiness he should always be kept alert the basic phenomenon of unconsciousness is flow which has flowed too long in one direction if one talks too long at somebody he will render him unconscious in order to wake up the target of all that talk it is necessary to get the person to do some talking it is simply necessary to reverse any flow to make unconsciousness disappear but this is normally cared for in modern scientology by running the trio above the future of scientology with man now equipped with weapons sufficient to destroy all mankind on earth the emergence of new science capable of handling man is vital scientology is such science it was born in the same crucible as the atomic bomb the basic intelligence of scientology came from nuclear physics higher mathematics and the understanding of the ancients in the east scientology can and does do exactly what it says it can do in washington d there is an enormous file cabinet filled with thousands of case histories fully validated and sworn to which attest the scientific thoroughness of scientology with scientology man can prevent insanity criminality and war it is for man to use it is for the betterment of man the primary race of earth is not between one nation and another today the only race that matters at this moment is the one being run between scientology and the atomic bomb the history of man as has been said by wellknown authorities may well depend upon which one wins 42pab 97 professional auditors

_____________________________________________________________________ 1 october 1956 start change stop edited from l ron hubbards august 1956 hpahpc tape lectures this is the entrance to rough cases nowadays the lowest entrance to case which we have today is the same for low case as it is for high case this process does not criticize the preclears case it is below the establishing of the rudiments but should still be audited in the modern manner of communication bridges acknowledgments etc only one procedure that would be lower than this process would be highly specialized procedure having to do with an individual who has lost the use of his voice sight hearing or his capability of moving his hands it becomes necessary for the auditor to become inventive in order to establish communication but he should stick as nearly as possible to these procedures the lowest processes which would be addressed to any case would simply be the first process of slp 8 which is not as we were saying before find the auditor find the preclear etc but the process which leads up to that this is an interesting process since it is in itself capable of producing full result and is an extremely simple one start change and stop is the anatomy of control this is cycle of action there is continue persist on the middle of the curve and other cycles within cycles of action but the important factors are start change and stop these three parts of control are run flat individually then pick up the other part of the cycle and run that flat in this order we run change flat and then run start very flat and then we run stop flat it would be mistake at this point to say this process is finished for the excellent reason that if you ran change again you would find further considerations shifting in the preclear and then if you ran start you would find it unflattened so you would run it again and then run and flatten stop it would not be possible to say how long you would have to run the process altogether on somebody who was total machinery and who never had been in session this would be rough process on case that is in good condition this would run easier the preclear would consider it interesting and would exteriorize much betterthe end result of this process is exteriorization for someone who is compulsively exteriorized this would be excellent as he would slide into his head and eventually come out of it again but not on compulsive level this time one meets with three conditions in auditing the preclear who is compulsively interiorized the preclear who is compulsively exteriorized and the preclear who is buttered all over the universe this case run on scs would greatly accumulate the ability to collect himselfthis might not occur until you have run him for five or more hours on it if this process is continued long enough the preclear will be moving his body by postulateie from the outsidenot by beams stimulusresponse etc this process does not go all the way up because of the preclears attention span most preclears cant stay on process for more than few moments so you would vary the process little to keep him interested his actual response however is not important as long as he does it there is such thing as bad control only nonpositive control good control is positive control and positive control is not bad control we get lower level there than moving the body this is scs on objects it is always safest to run this on someone you are trying out somebody to whom body is not real should be run using an object instead of his body to run this process the auditor and preclear should both stand up this gives reality and the auditor duplicating mimicry the preclear will bring about greater arc the session always fails when the auditor sits down while running scs it runs this way the auditor points out spot on the floor to the preclear and says do you see that spot good well well call that spot now you stand there okay the auditor now indicates another spot and says now do you see that other spot good well call that spot b all right now when i tell you to change the bodys position i want you to move it from spot to spot b all right good change the bodys position fine then you say do you see that spot well well call that spot c we use three spots so that we dont run duplication process on him now when i tell you to change the bodys position i want you to move the body from spot b to spot c do you understand that all right change the bodys position you can ask him did you change the bodys position if his case isnt too low but its not advisable on low case at first then go back to spot it does not have to be the same spot each time as it makes the process too much like duplication brings the preclear to predict the process too easily and do it machinewise each time you make contract with the preclear you dont depend on any former understanding with this process each moment in time is new we make each move in time new move he doesnt have to depend on his memory so you repeat again each time as abovethe whole wording as given on start we emphasize start you say do you see that wall over there good now when i give you this command i want you to move the body in that direction when i say start i want you to start the body all right start fine he may protest that he had to stop the body and change it as wellwhat is happening is that the word control is starting to ungroup and as you get start change and stop apart and distinct from each other the individuals ability to control the body increases and he gains more confidence in being able to control it from greater and greater distancethe next command would be all right when i tell you to start the body you start the body okay start the body the third command is for stop i am going to ask you to get the body moving over there toward that wall and somewhere along the line i am going to tell you to stop and i want you to stop the body is that all right he agrees and you say get the body moving you dont say start he does and you say stop and did you stop the body stop is the most important part of scs the preclear has been told all along the line to stop he was made effect all the time now you bring him to do just this under his own control and selfdeterminism and he takes over the automaticity eventually the preclear will flatten each one of these in turn you may have to do stop one more time than the others you should walk around with him so that he can feel the mimicry context of this if you sit down he will soon go out of arc and leave the session l ron hubbardhubbard communications office hco bulletin of 4 october 1956 high school indoctrination the conduct of high school indoctrination is of necessity an extremely precise activity high school indoctrination is given to staff auditors and very advanced students after these have long since satisfactorily passed routine indoctrination high school indoctrination at the moment consists only of teaching an auditor not to let preclear stop him the failure of most sessions is the action of the preclear in going out of session the preclear goes out of session at any moment when the preclear starts to control the session when the preclear controls the session he is out of session therefore it is necessary for the preclear not to stop or alter the course of action of an auditor the moment that preclear can satisfactorily to himself stop the auditor that preclear is out of session and the probability of doing him much good while he is out of session is very remote in high school indoctrination the technique 8c simply having fellow walk over to the wall and touch it and let go is followed the person being indoctrinated or the auditor starts to use this 8c upon his preclear who is actually the one doing the high school indoctrination the preclear does everything in his power to stop divert change or alter the intention of the auditor it will be found that such simple things as just moment my shoe is untied are the best in effecting this stopping the auditor can be thrown aside into running some other process by announcing to him that facsimile has just appeared or that one should really use his left hand since one is lefthanded the auditor in high school indoctrination loses at any moment when he is made to pause if he is made to pause or interrupt his session in any way then the session has to be started over again he has lost because high school indoctrination is rather hard on the instructor it is run for only 45 minutes and an exact moment of stopping the session in actuality is agreed upon we are going to stop this session now at five oclock exactly it now being fourfifteen then the session is entered and is run for these 45 minutes to run one longer is sometimes almost fatal on the high school indoctrinator then for the ensuing hour the high school indoctrinator runs the person being indoctrinated with stopcs this is to reverse the positions which have been occupied therefore to use high school indoctrination it is necessary that two hour period be free and that the first 45 minutes of it be devoted to high school indoctrination short break be taken and then auditing of the person being indoctrinated who was in the first 45 minutes acting as the auditor to be given stopcs by the former preclear high school indoctrination depends for its effectiveness mainly upon the cleverness of the person doing the indoctrination he has to be very smooth very often his most casual efforts are the greatest and will be found to be the most effective the final goal of high school indoctrination is to have staff auditor or advanced auditor who is not capable of being halted by preclear under any circumstances because the person doing the high school indoctrination always has higher altitude being higher on staff or in scientology it will be found that the person being indoctrinated is much more likely to become confused during the indoctrination than he would be in the average session howeverit has been learned that those people who become confused in any way during high school indoctrination have in the course of their auditing career blown several preclears it will also be found that they have not achieved very high results in auditing they were too willing to be stopped too easily rattled too easily thrown aside and did not know their subject well enough some of the effects which can be made on people undergoing high school indoctrination are quite startling they can be made to swear or even cry after being stopped as arduously and viciously as they can be stopped by person doing the indoctrination there is reason to list the number of commands or dodges or attempted stops which the person doing the indoctrination can use it is only necessary to synthesise these if only out of ones own experience with very difficult preclears who would rather have done anything than be audited it is better to think these up on the spur of the moment than otherwise planned dodges can be used where one goes very smoothly through the thing for eight or nine commands without offering the least difficulty or resistance and then suddenly hauls back on the next one and says i wont this occasionally completely stops person being indoctrinated high school indoctrination must be given to every staff auditor regardless of any former training and it must be given by person with considerable altitude over that auditor such as the director of processing or the technical director of an operation

lectures you will find in auditing preclear that certain of his mockups still exist on his time track so when preclear makes facsimile or dubin it is still in certain timespace spot some facsimiles are so signally failure that they float they go skidding along the track that is survival noeffect they werent nailed down one could say that he is stuck in that moment of time you could do this to person and say when i snap my fingers an age will flash and snap your fingers and he may say six what does that mean it means that the preclear is stuck in that age man of 55 years with the face of body of 5 years has certain speech sexual and other mannerisms which have floated up with him to the age of 55 in other words he is in reaction pattern of the age of 5 the age of facsimile will flash with an emeter you will see where he is stuck where there is charge motion the needle is in motion and where he is stuck the needle will freeze right down to motionlessness when you are on the moment of stuckness person is hit on his head with sledgehammer at the age of 5 and at 55 he is still there he still has that facsimile floating about it isnt perception that bounces sticks groups one on the track perceptions such as sight sound etc in facsimile are discovered to be simple keyin of motions and solids person is stuck when he wishes to escape motion an individual in high games condition is in motion the game gets too high and he drops out so he goes into nogames condition you can call this rest point on the track he was in high motion didnt like it after while found stop point and he stopped for example man is playing the game of fighting the wars of indiaafter while he gets tired of it and one day in battle when everything is in violent motion he considers that this isnt worth it any more and somebody spears him through the chest this is stop point on the game whenever he is reminded of the high motion he remembers that there was stop point on the track ie lifetimes later he walks in london and sees an indian being run over by car and suddenly all this unexpected motion reminds him of the old game of the indian wars and he remembers the stop point on the track how he got out of the game this preclear comes to you complaining of his chesthes either got tb chest trouble or something and this blows when you audit solids there is an exact stop point in the middle of the facsimile where game has ended and your preclear wants to get into this stop point to escape highmotion games condition because that stop point was the solution to all that danger and motion the solution to danger and motion reactively is stop point an engram is moment of pain andor unconsciousness in an exact moment of time or mental image picture containing moments of pain andor unconsciousness so person who is in the middle of some painful incident which happened centuries ago is in this rest point escaping from imagined danger and motion this is an exact mechanism which you must know and with which you must work you may ask how somebody gets out of stuck point from which he cannot escape he is on the stuck point because there was too much motion on either side of it so if he comes out of it he runs into the rest of the motion which he desired to escape so the stuck point as far as he is concerned is okay in order to run this you make him the preclear take over the automaticity of the motion that happened before and after the incident have him mock up the motion that happened before the incident dont have him run the facsimiles because he will eat them all up and be very mad with you afterwards have him put new motion into the incident by mockups dont run the old motion out by throwing new motion in you are showing him that he can get the motion under control do the same for after the incident occurred and he will shake loose from that point you dont erase the stuck point you improve his tolerance of motion dont run the stuck point it runs for 165 hours without release it is serious and contains vacuum in the middle of it you handle vacuums and stop games conditions by handling the motion fellow with stuck points is the agitation case spastics and any condition which is obsessed with high compulsive obsessed motion high obsessed motion is lower on the scale than somebody who sleeps all the while this gives us caution if somebody runs out of stop points he is in trouble so handle all motion in period that turns up otherwise we leave him stuck in the middle of the incident move him right out of the incident handle all the motion by putting in new motionan individual can be audited too briefly on any type of given motion so move him right out for he will rather have the stop point than be stuck in the middle of an incident vacuum confuses all this vacuum is supercold object that attracts electronically into it the whole track just preceding vacuum is the most violent motion of facsimiles you have ever observed because it may have million years of facsimiles places faces stop points etc in it so where are the stuck points it is in the vacuum among all the scramble of facsimiles this is common in space opera an object out in space which is 273 degrees has infinite capacitance and zero resistance and it is hungry it picks up that electrical energy at fantastic rate it pulls persons whole track in when out in space he touches it thats all there is to brainwashing handle this by having facsimiles fly around in mockups do this on gradient scales gradient scale is scale of conditions ranging from zero to infinity next thing he has avalanches that he can start stop and change mock up etc and he doesnt care about vacuums any longer after this have him invent some games and individualities to get the game sorted game doesnt only consist of motion but of enemies and individualities to fight those enemies with so all these factors must be taken into account or else you will be processing your preclear towards succumb l ron hubbardissue 36 1956 ca mid october the magazine of dianetics and scientology from washington dc randomity and automaticity l ron hubbard prepared from lecture to the 4th london acc 2 november 1955 entitled randomity and automaticities the vocabularies of science in all scientific systems you have number of code words which operate as communication carriers and when person does not know these words well hes having difficulty with the science itself ive seen senior in science falling down in his comprehension of later part of the science because he had never gotten the nomenclature of the science straight to begin with he did not know exactly what british thermal unit was or something like thattherefore later on when hes solving some vast and involved problem theres datum rambling around in his head and its not stable at allits getting confused its mixed up with all other data and that is only because he didnt understand what the term was in the first place so just as you learn semaphore signals just as you learn morse code just as you learn baby talk so when you become conversant with any particular specialized subject you must become conversant with its terminology your understanding of it then increases otherwise understanding is impeded by these words rattling around and not joining themselves to anything if you know vaguely that such and such word exists and yet have definite understanding of what it means it does not align thus misunderstanding of word can cause misalignment of subject and this really is the basis of the primary confusion in mans understanding of the mind there have been so many words assigned to various parts of the mind that one would be staggered if he merely catalogued all of these things take for instance the tremendous background and technology of psychoanalysis overpoweringly complicated material most of it merely descriptive some of it action terminology such as the censor the id the ego the alterego and what not most of these things lined up each one meaning specific thing but the practitioners who began to study this science did not have good founding in the exact sciencesin other words they didnt have model of the exact sciences and in the humanities they could be as careless as they liked with their words because the humanities were not expected to be precise or exactnot criticism of themit just means that you could have looser command of the language when they got into the study of freud they got into this interesting thingto one person an id was one thing and to another person it was something else and alterego was this and it was that the confusion of terms there practically all by itself became the totality of confusion of psychoanalysisactually psychoanalysis is as easy to understand certainly as japanese japanese is baby talkvery very hard to read very very easy to talk if you can imagine language which tells you which is the subject which is the verb which is the object every time it speaks you can imagine this babytalk kind of language one that doesnt have various classes or conjugations of verbs very faint kind of language nevertheless it merely consists in order to communicate with japanese of knowing the meanings of certain words and if you know the meanings of those words precisely then when japanese comes up to you and says do you want cup of tea you dont immediately get up because you thought he said wet paint you have communication possibility well similarly with the language of psychoanalysis the great difficulties inherent in understanding such thing as psychoanalysis became much less difficult when one viewed psychoanalysis as code system to relay certain meanings it did not then become problem of whether or not these phenomena existed or didnt exist it simply became problem of words meaning certain precise thing and if they meant that thing to everybody then everybody was talking psychoanalysis and if it didnt mean this thing to everybody then people werent talking psychoanalysis who knows what they were talking the next thing you know they were talking jungianismthe next thing you know they were talking adlerianismand the amount of difference between these various items is minute to say the least but the language difficulties then made many practitioners in that field at odds with the theory which they did not at any rate understand you find out in scientology that rather arduous background in mathematics and in what is at least laughingly called the exact sciences nevertheless made for very arduously firm choice of word definition there are certain phenomena named and these phenomena are specific they are not random they are very very precise for instance an engram is an engram it is mental picture of moment of pain and unconsciousness that is an engram and if you know that you can find an engram but we have had in the case of the word engram something of crossup since there was an early use of the word in biology although it seemed to have gone out of usage so that biologist will come along now and then and look at the word engram and say yes i know what an engram is well they know what they mean by the word engram but they have never seen one the engrams we are talking about in dianetics and scientology we can see but they wouldnt ever quite know what we were talking about if they thought it was an energy trace on cell this was not discoverable with microscopes or anything of the sort so i considered it lost word and quite accidentally crossed up this word with the earlier biological use i remember one time learning igoroti in single night i sat up by kerosene lantern and took list of words that had been made by an old missionary in the hills in luzonthe igorot had very simple language this missionary had phoneticized their language and he had made list of their main words and their usage and grammar and i remember sitting up under mosquito net with the mosquitos hungrily chomping their beaks just outside the net and learning this languagethree hundred words just memorizing these words and what they meant and the next day i started to get them in line and align them with people and was speaking igoroti in very short time the point here is that it is not difficult to learn language if you understand that you are learning language the first way to learn the language of scientology is to understand clearly that you are learning language and that it has in it perhaps fifty sixty or seventy words and that each of these words has precise definition as far as nomenclature is concerned in scientology what we usually did was to take verb and make noun of it so that there wouldnt be any crossup of definition its an interesting system that has been employed we try to minimize the number of words introduced that might sound strange but we have tried to minimize it in giving specialterminology we have only named those things which were really important to the auditor phenomena which an auditor really had to understand therefore knowledge of the exact definition of word brought exact understanding of the phenomenon its that simple knowledge of scientology first and foremost then is vocabulary knowledge there are probably not more than sixty words in scientology of special meaning we have not named to any extent invisible phenomena an engram is very viewable phenomenon if youve ever run one on preclear you know how visible it is to the preclear and to you the first word we have however in the entire language of scientology is unfortunately nonviewable thingthe static it is nonviewable but it is experienceable so it isnt completely removed into the nevernever land but from there on we do have almost all of our terminology in viewable form its examinable it can be measured fellow by the name of wundt in 1879 in leipzig germany invented thing called psychology which was mainlyhis main interest seems to have beenthe study of mental behavior through physiology the subject which has come down to us from there called psychology has not been defined much differently since wundt and that is the way the mind has been studiedthrough physiology well the mans hunch wasnt too far wrong in that practically everything in the mind is viewable and does have some mass and does exist in space and is something that you could put your hands on very easily and say that is that we dont know whether wundt knew this or not the psychologists dont know it even vaguely today and they think that what they are dealing with is totally abstract theoretical nevernever land subject and thats why they choose it but if you dont know this then youre apt to go adrift on the terminology of scientology and on scientology itself youre apt to go very badly adrift and believe that were dealing with abstracts and intangibles this may be an overlooked supposition on your part psychology studies abstracts and intangibles were not studying however psychology were studying hearable measurable weighable meterable phenomenaright below the level of static from the static you go immediately into experienceable viewable phenomena and even the static is experienceable so were not outside the realm of experience anywhere in scientology everything we deal with is something that can have concrete form or example this is an interesting thing ive given you this fast summary on terminology itself so that you could see that if this word randomity and if the word automaticity cannot be clearly understood it must be being viewed then as some abstract thing and its not an abstract thing randomity we find the earliest introduction of the subject randomity in the dianetic axioms in the fall of 1951 the word randomity was needed as further expression of motion ive been talking to you recently of things that were too motionlesstolerance of things which were too motionless and tolerance of things which had too much motion we find that we have to increase peoples tolerance of these it shows us that if people had difficulties with the tolerance of things that were too motionless and too motionful we had with this word randomity rather upset circumstance people didnt like to grasp this word well we have further explanation of it today and as result of that further explanation we have better chance of gripping this and using itrandomity means in essence comparable motion comparable to what comparable to the consideration of motion so we have plus randomity and we have minus randomity in other words we can have from the individuals consideration too much or too little motion or enough motion whats enough motion measured by the consideration of the individual take for example man eating meal in the presence of two friends he thought he was eating about right the fellow next to him thought he was eating too fast and the fellow across from him thought he was eating too slow so its consideration of motion traffic cop views the field of automobile traffic with consideration of minus randomity compared to the motorists idea of motion of cars the motorists consideration of optimum randomity is plus randomity compared to the cops consideration if youve ever driven down deserted highway you may remember having little vague suspicion that there was something not quite right about going down that road all by yourself other traffic to view this tells you at once that it may or may not be road you know that you consider it roadbut do other people an eightlane highway could give you this idea that the road was closed under repair or that it wasnt considered by everyone else to be road at all if there were traffic in sight for very many miles there is certain amount of traffic randomity that motorist is used to and is comfortable about new york cabbie if you put him in cab out in the middle of arizona would be outside his area of optimum randomity hed want at least hundred and fifty cars stacked up at the next intersection and here he has to drive hundred miles to get any intersection at all its his consideration of motion well he has certain tolerance for the random particles which in the case of traffic follow certain channels but which nevertheless are pretty random on those channels so he has the idea of randomity in traffic randomity also contains the aspect of unexpectedness unexpectedness is inherent to the idea of randomness in other words you have to have enough unexpectedness you have your idea of how much unexpectedness there should be in life well so does the new york taxi driver have his idea of how much unexpectedness there should be in traffic and if he were to drive in totally orderly community where the unexpectedness was zero this man would probably go to sleep or go unconscious or do somethinghe would eventually run off the road but maybe after he was at it for many many weeks he would get used to it so then this word randomity contains the idea of conditioning it is the only place where we find the subject of conditioning in dianetics and scientology the reason im talking about randomity here is that it is one of the wider concepts and little harder perhaps to grasp than any other yet you can set it up and view it very easily we could set up something like this table that person could sit in front of which would have all kinds of holes and runways in it for marbles we could have these marbles popping up through the holes and taking different paths and bumping around at different levels and rates of speed and abundance in other words we could have table set up that would present person with certain level of randomity and we could include controlled unexpectedness factor we could find out from this actually what the persons idea of optimum motion was we could find out what amount of unexpectedness and rapidness of motion he would be comfortable aboutafter while the person starts to get nervous if you pop too many marbles out of those holes theyre coming out of the holes and there are lots of them and theyre disappearing and appearing completely unexpectedly smashing and cracking together and so forth and hes likely to sit there and say theres just too damned many marbles he doesnt like it just below that level of motion hell say thats interesting and just below that level he sits there and says marbles one pops up and runs across the table another one pops up the first disappears another one pops up and runs across the table etc and he says hohum marbles that is minus randomity when he was interested that was his randomity that was optimum randomity where you had too many marbles moving too fast you had plus randomity with relationship to what though with relationship to this person this thinkingness this mind his idea of randomity was what it was you see that it has to be this way when you test youngster who likes action on something like this his reaction to the test would be that you would have to have the marbles popping up and shooting across there with such suddenness and such blur and such whirr and such snap that you yourself would probably stand there and watch and feel slightly uncomfortable and this kid says my how interesting but you drop it down to the number of marbles that was optimum for this other fellow and the kid will say oh lets go out and play ball now we have to have this thing called randomity its an unfortunate thing if it is incomprehensible at times we have to have these thingsplus randomity minus randomity and optimum randomity what is his idea of unexpected motion necessary to the living of life how much randomity does he have to have to live which at the same time would saystay interested in life how much would he have to have guy in space opera wow well you have to have fight between fleets at least once week you didnt have good liberty at all unless five men were killed that time was fun at allafter they shot all the women there was just nothing left to do idea of the amount of motion unexpectedness sudden event the twist and turn to life is very very high there therefore you have space opera engrams very easily in suspense on the track they look like confusion fellow has been in space opera and now he looks at the engram and he says nosir thats confusion now the only reason were resurrecting this word and dusting it off and using it more frequently is that it is better statement of confusion than the word confusion the word confusion means at once plus randomity and its therefore specialized kind of randomity it means motion unexpected above the tolerance level of the person viewing it and that is the definition of the word confusion so if stable datum is necessary to the alignment of data and if stable datum can be pulled out of an area of aligned data with the result of confusion we have to have better understanding of what we mean by confusion if were going to process it we certainly had better understand it it better be nice clear thing to us because we are likely to look at preclear and consider that he is under confusion when as matter of fact he might be in minus randomity good statement of minus randomity would be things are too slow things are certainly slow around here life is dull there is nothing happeninga consideration of how much motion and unexpectedness of motion there is in the environmenthow much unexpected happenstance how much pattern of actionand this would be minus when there was too little for the tolerance of the individual so we need to have word to match confusion it looks like there is hole in the english language thus once more we have this word randomity its describing something which has been viewed which is not adequately described in english and that we are viewing it and describing it and naming it somewhere within the bounds of comprehensibility is quite remarkable minus randomity is the opposite of confusion things are too stable do you know that little benny has not fallen out of the window for three days do you realize i have not burned myself all morning do you realize there hasnt been single accident out there on the highway all afternoon how dulleverything is travelling only at rocket speed that could be one fellows idea of minus randomity or opposite of confusion things are not sufficiently confusing random unexpected in motion so hes saying how dull this other chap looks at one horse walking down one street and says to himself horse things are going too fast around here for unless you understand that there can be difference of consideration about this you would have hard time trying to grasp the preclears idea of how much stable data he needs now how much stable data do you think this fellow needs one horse going down one street he needs one stable datum per particle therefore he needs an enormous amount of information to keep the world from falling in on him and turning upside down and spilling in his lap he just needs tremendous quantity he needs dictionaries full he needs encyclopedias full he needs libraries full he needs scribes working on every side continually to catalogue catalogue catalogue catalogue and each word to him is not only stable datum its sacred datum if we moved just one word out of line in cataloguing of hundred million words this fellow would become extremely uncomfortable we have whole sciences which are cataloguing sciences if francis bacon hadnt wanted to give an example of what science was we would probably never even today have had science of botany but bacon used once as an illustration of what science would be science of botany he used the classification of flowers as his illustration and instantly it became science and from there on it is catalogued for fellow to be willing to study botany he has to be willing to tolerate tremendous lack of motion from most of our viewpoints but from his own viewpoint his ability to tolerate motion or motion never comes in question hes perfectly happy going along with onestabledatumperitem to most of us this would be unthinkably arduous so you can see that we have an intolerance for that little randomity the bottom line of this gradient scale would appear to be onestabledatumper particle that should be the bottom of the randomity scalebut it isnt the bottom would be particle space and we would be back to static and out of this you at once recognize why static wants havingness and particles you have game below minus randomity is randomity of any kind people do not usually like this at all starting up scale we geta few particles one could be at this point for two reasons because he is shuddering away from confusion and therefore is getting stabledatumper particle or he could be at that point because he has tremendous tolerance for confusion and for motionlessness now if he is cataloguing one stable datum per particle at the minus randomity end of the scale then he is doing this interesting thing this fellow is shuddering away from all confusion and particles because hes trying to use up all existing particles and stable data hes trying to match these two things so hes trying to use up all possible confusionif this same fellow had high tolerance of confusion in the first place and had used up all these particles in this fashion matching particle for stable datum with everything catalogued everything in order he would run out of confusions and he would have scarcity of confusion so taking another look at this randomity scale we could have scarcity of confusion or scarcity of motionlessness scarcity at either end we could have either condition or both conditions and not depending upon which end we were viewing it from then we ask this what is plus randomity and what is minus randomity from the viewpoint of the individual something which has in it too much motion or unexpectedness for his tolerance is plus randomity and that thing which has too little motion in it for his tolerance is minus randomity now how he gets into these states is the entire subject of scarcity for example the fellow who falls into plus randomity with great speed his tolerance of motion is so slight that almost any motion is plus randomity to him second horse gets into the street and he practically has nervous breakdown that fellow will have tendency to do this instead of matching stable datum for particle he will take all particles and stop them he starts to apply force and then bring all of these particles into mass so that they are each taken care of he can look at this whole group of particles and say thats table thats rock now hes got all of the particles named hes named it rock hes not going to do anything about these particles hes going to just mass them that is the state of mind which gets you mass unless you simply mock it up to have masstheres always that going onmock up universe to have universe etc or you can evolve them or have reasons for them but this is usually the case that an individual who is obsessively making mass has an intolerance of motion to the degree that second horse on the street would give him nervous breakdown so he takes any particles that are in motion and he is actually ill about this until he can take the particles and push them together and say ah rock whew now we can have some peace around here at the other end the fellow in space opera theres been riot that morning theres been fire in bunker 4 three prisoners have escaped and were shot in the courtyard and so forth and this fellow is saying gee things have slowed down around here lets create some confusion and get some motion started lets drop false message into the message center we are about to be attacked by the pruvians or something lets get something going around here well now that individual will disperse things hell disperse things preferably with an unknown and then he has an enormous amount of data none of which has any identification at all his level of expectedness and unexpectedness is way up hell have wonderful time wondering if he can possibly make head or tail of any of this gosh look at that the president shot and im plugged and gee you know i cant make any sense out of it at all you get the idea then how people vary unexpectedness and motion to fit their own considerations there is however such thing as state of good health in connection with this that sounds odd but there is one and that is for an individual to act in either capacity by changing his consideration on the subject of randomity itself in other words retain or attain liberty of increasing or decreasing tolerance on motion at will you can look at two horses on the street and say thats too many or look at morning in space opera and say thats too slow with difficulty whatsoever or you can say that the morning in space opera was too fast and the two horses on the street were not enough you could do anything you wanted on it that would be state of health regarding tolerance level of randomity but where an individual has lost his ability to vary his considerations of confusion and motionlessnesswhich is to say his plus and minus randomity he has lost his ability to have game and will then find himself being put out of games which do not fit his fixed opinion therefore he has limited himself in the number of games into which he can enter as an individual can shift his consideration of randomity so he can play large numbers of games and as his consideration on the subject of randomity becomes more and more fixed so that there is just certain amount of motion he can tolerate just certain amount of motion that he cant tolerate when hes fixed right there somewhere on the scale between total confusion and total motionlessness and thats it he has to find game which fits that idea of game his idea of an optimum randomity what then is game game is an optimum randomity that is satisfactory game optimum randomity what is an endofgame unoptimum randomitywithout regard to whether it is plus or minus too fast for him or too slow for him thats just both sides of fixed consideration an individuals ability to live then will to marked degree depend upon his ability to shift his consideration of what is confusion what is motionlessness and if he cant shift this opinionhe is sunk the organization or the person which tells the individual to conform to the environment tells him to fix his opinion of randomity to that environment has asked that individual to die the moment the randomity factor alters in the environment its asked him to run out of games another factor enters into this which is the saving grace and that is the emergency factor or the necessity level necessity level is sudden increase of randomity to sufficiency that the individual makes momentary adjustment to itin other words momentarily increases his tolerance for unexpected motion the unexpected motion there is so great that it puts him into higher level of motion and he takes care of it that is necessity levelit is the randomity itself driving the person when the randomity kicks the person he knows he must move but necessity level only occurs where the individual is in total stimulusresponse condition with the randomity itself and it is nothing to count upon at all give them that much more motion and people are just as likely to stay fixed as to go faster create too much randomity too fast and people will stay fixed they will not react on necessity level at all unfortunately there is such thing as nonnecessity level or non emergency level where things suddenly move too slow for the individual we dont have any mechanism to take care of that so people try to build up their tolerance for speed by going faster and faster and faster and they think they then can go faster and faster and faster and they never drop back toward tolerance of motionlessness its actually more important in this time and place to adjust peoples ideas of motionlessness and the tolerance of motionlessness than the tolerance for speed there are very many ways you could do thisyou could have person sit motionless for very long time but he usually cant tolerate that it exceeds his tolerances instead of building his tolerances on gradient scale certain processes have done this to some extent for quite while now to considerable benefit one way you could do this is have the preclear say things are going fast when they are practically standing still and then he tolerates them easily but actually hes gotten around it hasnt tolerated any motionlessness he has simply tolerated his new consideration the auditor has great deal to do with this today he can actually produce plus and minus randomity in the individual at will he can stuff the individual full one way or the other of stable data and that produces for the individual to some degree minus randomity he can pull some stable data out of the reactive banks and he will at once produce plus randomity hecan thus alter his reaction to motion his randomity by handling data but remember this is low order of thing compared to changing the consideration of person now as an auditor you have to know that you can add to or subtract from the data of an individual and thereby give him plus or minus randomity remember though that he would only get plus or minus randomity if he had fixed consideration on the situation but you have to know this business about putting in and pulling out stable data and producing randomity because it explains the various reactions of the preclear to auditing hes learning more the worlds getting more and more even more and more stable to him more real and all of sudden he adjusts by giving up stable datum which you very often misname consideration here he is getting more data and his attitude his consideration of randomity is fixed so as you give him more data and he spots more things and he gets more stable data all around why he simply gives up some of his old data you havent actually changed his randomity if youre doing smooth job of arc youre gradually upgrading him to higher tolerance of everything one of the ways he will adjust it is to suddenly spit out some old aberrated datum that is stable datum you have simply moved in one stable datum and moved out one stable datum the point of this is you have to change his consideration of speed thats all you have to change his ability to change his consideration of speed automaticity all right what then is this thing called automaticity if automaticity is related to randomity which it is then it would have lot to do with consideration too wouldnt it automaticity means non selfdetermined action which ought to be determined by the individual the individual ought to be determining an action and he is not determining it thats pretty broad consideration its something not under the control of the individual but if we said something not under the control of the individual as total unqualified definition of automaticity we would have this then that car that just went down the street would be an automaticity to you you didnt have control of it so this is not precision definition the precision definition has which ought to be under the control of the individual an individual will tolerate within himself so much random action of the materials which he ought to be controlling for instance you if you are fairly good driver would have difficulty when you were starting your car in the morning in tolerating the fact that it killed couple of times before you got it going so the sudden stopping of the motor was not really an automaticity to you there is an expectedness in it or lets take an unexpectednessyou shifted the gears and didnt quite get it in gearif your tolerance of randomity was good if your ability to change considerations was good youd flip the gear in and then it didnt quite go in again and you had to make second pass at it thats an unexpected motion its still not really an automaticity except in the severest definition of the word something has occurred which you should have controlled but didnt now we see automaticity and use the word mainly in connection with just this motion in the bankfacsimiles in motion around oneunder the control or not under the control of the individual many an individual will get all kinds of fast motions in the bankpictures action machinery etc and not even consider it vaguely random thats all right he says but they should be controlling itit ought to be doing what they say well from their opinion it is this other fellow fellow with different consideration of randomity gets one picture shifting an inch to the right unexpectedlytheres an automaticity going on here he says another fellow has machine he tells it to mock up dogs so it mocks up blue dogs pink dogs and then moves over to the other side and mocks up green dogs purple dogs and then mocks up from the back dogs with hats on dogs with canes dogs with heavy fur dogs with light fur dogs with five feet dogs with two feetho humlifes running as usual when the preclear says to you that theres an awful lot of action in the bank that means that he considers that the action in the bank which he is confronting is an awful lot it doesnt tell you how much action you would say there is in the bank so its the preclears consideration and opinion that makes an automaticity not yours its the amount of randomness which he ought to be controlling but which he isnt controlling and that depends upon the amount of randomness which he can tolerate and if he can tolerate tremendous amount of randomity plus or minus then nothing looks random to him at all and the funny part of it ishe can control it too and where these two things join at the crossroads youve got control of phenomena in the bank if an individual can tolerate it he can control it if he cant tolerate it he cant control it and thats all there is to it i hope you have some better understanding of these two words and what we are doing today in auditing the relation of stable datum to confusion is actually the relation of the stable datum to randomity you have to have clear understanding of randomity before you enter in upon that in teaching scientology auditing preclears and in developing your own understanding of the material of scientologyhubbard communications office hco bulletin of 26 october 1956 hpahca training processes the following training processes are recommended as necessary to the education of an hpa or hca student from the moment of his enrollment until his graduation it does not particularly matter whether the hpa or hca has been indoctrinated in the very latest techniques but it does matter that he is able to run the following if he can do this then he can carry on with almost any other technique l confront preclear this is done by the indoctrination course the student is taught how to handle communication with the preclear by dummy sessions and demonstrations by the instructor confirm and grind in auditorpc relationship and rudimentslook at who am i and the reality scale 2 arc straightwire this is run as the first process audited by the student on fellow student after leaving the indoctrination course the barest elements of arc straightwire are used and then the therapeutic technique is undertaken on the basis of tell something you wouldnt mind forgetting the basis of this process is to give the student subjective reality on the time track of human beings and to demonstrate that people slide back into the past and up toward present time as they remember various items which phenomena should be pointed out and observed by the student 3 subjective havingness this should be run both to give the student reality on the bank of the human being and upon havingness itself if the case being audited on subjective havingness is black case then the student is required to have the preclear mock up blackness or black objects in the blackness and remedy the havingness with those regardless of any dope off until the individual has clear field or can go on to some other process 4 8c b c with emphasis on and instruction with regard to the preclears ability to handle decisions this is the first walkabout process and is vital in the training of scientologist 5 opening procedure by duplication old style the notknow version could be run but is little complicated 6 over and under on the bank in making things solid 7 keeping things from going away in terms of small alternate objects with concentration on the fact that this is havingness process and also holds things still 8 terrible trio both sides the can have for the preclear the cant have for the preclears enemies training should be completed with very fast review of the more recent processes and giving these into the students hands not as something in which he has been trained but as something that he can use as fast as he attains reality upon them of the above list the first six are the most important from the standpoint of training throughout training the student should be carefully monitored as to his ability to communicate with his preclear auditing procedure should not be neglected from the moment of entrance into indoctrination until graduation since it is style of auditing we wish to achieve rather than teaching of processes when the student is taught data he should be given high power of choice over the data in which he is instructed but he should be instructed in such way that he can achieve the reality of the data since it is true and factual lrhdtnm l ron hubbardpab 99 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in

1 november 1956 facsimiles solids edited from l ron hubbards august 1956 hpahpc tape lectures for material about facsimiles the best is in dianetics the modern science of mental health american edition more recent processes turn up all the phenomena of facsimiles engrams locks secondaries etc so it is vitally necessary that this material is well known facsimile is an energy picture made by thetan or the bodys machinery of the physical universe environment it is like photograph it is made of mental energy it means copy of the physical universe on the track facsimiles have been corrupted it became picture which may be facsimile but isnt it would run and look like facsimile but is picture of something which didnt really happen automatic mockup is better description it is changed from the physical universe for example man walks down the street and sees girl he has picture of the girl as he walks down the street his machinery gets to work and he then has picture of bedroom he never saw her in the bedroom but on delusory basis he puts her into one if he is totally sane there is liability to this those pictures are not aberrative unless the preclear is way down scale when he will start mourning over this girl he only saw once in the street he has failed to differentiate between his facsimile and mock delusion and hallucination come under the heading of this alteration of the physical universe facsimile this delusory picture is called dubina term taken from the movie world next is the plain mockup which you know is only mockup and not facsimile or dubin the auditors error in the past was failing to recognize facsimiles as facsimiles and too often calling them dubins source of dubin is somebody told you and if person is in wrong valence he gets pictures of things this valence has told himeg preclear is in mothers universe and she hastold him all about how horrible father is one day he looks through his bank and finds pictures of father beating mother thing which never really happened mother said so and this contains mothers mockups which are dubins the only worrisome source of dubins is being in the wrong valence one makes them up out of remarks which are dubins and these we call synthetics split universes and the preclear finds his own facsimiles which are sometimes quite startling to him dont make the mistake of calling real facsimile dubin and refusing to process it matter where it comes from whether dubin or facsimile this is handled by mockups and you dont have to differentiate remember not to ignore the whole track phenomenawhich are facts dont assault facts of this nature unless you want to make game out of it and when you do so be aware that you are doing it in modern living the foremost reason of the failure of modern psychotherapy is that they never believed what the patient was saying and never understood what was happening the preclear told them about prenatals etc and was invalidated when he wasnt believed in the genetic entitys bank are such things as the sperm sequence ovum sequence and the spermovum sequence and they are three separate lines of engrams furthermore on the sperm sequence we can move back on the ge line to father and often find the wrong father as we come forward we find the development of the preclears body in the womb gestation with pictures along the line these pictures have black visio or they have dubin which was made out of pictures which were heard by the child and then the child dubbed in the environment but the actual visio is black it is dark and noisy in the womb you may run into vacuum which compares to supercold piece of metal which when contacted by the thetan pulls in the entirety of his bank afterwards when trying to remedy his havingness you have him sitting in the middle of the vacuum of course this picture of supercold object is still behaving like supercold object this accounts for the way people get stuck in space opera they were in space suits out in space and got shot as long as they were warm they were okay but the moment they touched supercold object their bank rushed in and they were brainwashed the prenatal area is black and vacuum is so confusing that the blackness is the total answer thetan can give to it he covers all that up with blackness so one has two types of blackness here third type of blackness is when man walks in the dark stumbles over something and gets an engramwhich is totally black one gets accustomed to these various kinds of facsimiles it is not necessary to go into them the main point is that they are there and must be handled the heart of some of all consequences in living guilt conscience various conflicts are contained in the electronic phenomena of the bankfacsimiles dubins and mockups this bank is the apparently unalterable pattern of behaviorin order to change about the behavior of body and facsimiles it is necessary to change the thetan it is necessary to change the bank there are three types of bank l the somatic bank 2 the analytical bank and 3 the reactive bank you know the analytical bank is there but not that the reactive bank is there it sneaks up on you and one day the sperm sequence restimulates you and you start to wigglethat small picture like that will make whole body wiggle is but matter of consideration remember all these are considerations facsimile could influence the whole body or just one part of it the preclear accepts the analytical bank but is surprised to find reactive pictures such as prenatals past lives etc turning up while he is being audited these pictures were primarily created to have an effect on somebody else when they ceased to have an effect on somebody else they began to have an effect on the preclears body therefore they survive the definition of survival is noeffect game will continue as long as there is absolute effect occurring an action will occur until the end of the action cycle which is startchangestop the thetan uses pictures to handle and control the body the facsimiles under the preclears control is wonderful piece of machinery and out of his control nightmare he gets aberrated facsimile contains all perceptions about 54 or more i stopped counting at 54 eg joint positions body motion perception of heat small motion photons visio touch smell sight and sound actually have to be handled sooner or later if you are handling any facsimiles facsimiles were first designed to have an effect upon somebody else to thetan his body is somebody else so while he is having an effect on the body he is still having win because there have been other facsimiles on the ge line his stimulus does very often not get the exact response on the body it gets some other response and introduces an unknown element the thetan thinks he is just handling one bankhe is actually handling thousands of banks that have been there before him there are not other thetans in the body the facsimiles are just the residue of other thetans in the bank these are the facsimiles and reactions made by other thetans in the bank and this is often very spooky thing when thetan runs into this amount of unknownnesshe wants the body to jump and it lies down to sleephe is apt to get puzzled life is contest of trying to get body or other bodies to do the various stimulus response mechanisms we need sound to handle the bank we say something and something restimulates all kinds of meanings and significances creep into this bank and people can get stuck on certain phrases in these banks and it is wonderful how certain phrase can aberrate single life refer to dianetics the modern science of mental health there is doubt about this bank being powerful and formidable but so is our ability today to handle ithubbard communications

communications office brunswick house 83 palace gardens terrace london w8 _____________________________________________________________________ 15 november 1956 the auditing of solids edited from l ron hubbards august 1956 hpahpc tape lectures auditing could boil down to one processthat is if the preclear is capable of doing it also most importantly if the auditor if he has been recently indoctrinated has established the rudiments has the preclear well in the session and can handle any randomities that occur in other words this process takes the whole of scientology into account that process is called solids the way to run solids is find the principal stop point on the track the principal vacuum or something you think might have been failing that you just arbitrarily pick an age somewhere in the middlean incident after which the preclear says he became different to what he was before before giving the command explain to him the proper meaning of the word facsimile dont use the words incident or pictures then you say can you find facsimile later than the incident you mean the vacuum he finds one later and when he does you tell him make it solid if the preclear is being pedantic give this command make it more solid than you first perceived it making it little more solid than it was is sufficient the preclear will at first be using effort but after while he will be working by postulate keep running this until the facsimile flickerflacks and changes and then take the preclear off it dont let the preclear communicate too much incidentally dont have the preclear forget to make the invisible particles in the facsimile more solid as well otherwise they will eventually build up ridge to which the other facsimiles as he finds them will stick making the invisible particles solid will obviate that if the preclear doesnt understand what you mean by making the invisible particles more solid ask him to open his eyes and look at the wall then ask him to make the particles between him and the wall more solid he will then understand what you mean by invisible particlesthen you say can you find facsimile earlier than the incident he finds one earlier than the incident and you say make it solid after while the automaticity of the facsimile disappearing or changing will wear off the preclear will not only make the picture more solid he will stop it dead in its tracks it wont blow unless you introduce this other command all right dispose of that now can you find one later than the age all right make it solid okay dispose of that keep him out of engrams because we are not running anything out we are increasing and improving his ability we are running something in you are having your preclear who has mass motion or space confront something which has and he cannot duplicate it nor it him and you are coaxing him into the understanding that he can you are trying to make the preclear capable of making things more solid you are not trying to undo vacuums engrams or operations you are trying to show him that he can handle facsimile and make it solid see that the preclear does not directly address an engram or vacuum or difficulty also dont upset his power of choice by telling him not to do it steer his attention off it tell him he can find facsimile earlier or later than that dont get sloppy as an auditor its tough process use and maintain good 8c to make sure that the preclear is always following directions make sure he does keep him at it and see that he executes the commands as given for if he makes things solid before you ask him to he may take the road which contains lot of dynamite such as touching vacuum the preclear is not bright while he is being audited because his bank is too fascinating to him keep him running the process and your preclear will suddenly realize what his conflicts with the environment are these conflicts with the environment with which he is engaged are the real conflicts of life gradually his perceptics will turn on but only when some emotion has turned on its because you are running the band above solids it isnt an endall process because there are other things above solids and effort it has an extroverted side which is better than the old trioie look around the room and find something you can have look around the room and find something you can permit to remain and look around the room and find something you can dispense with this process runs this way look around the room and find something you wouldnt mind being solid he finds something and you say good make it more solid if you said make it solid you would be invalidating him the preclear will say that the walls are getting very solid too solid for his comfort because he has probably been taught in physics class that walls are composed of small particleswith holes in themwhich isnt true solids shed small particles but that does not mean that solid is made up of small particles making something solid later or earlier in this lifetime only is the limitation of this process after this his track starts coming in as he makes things solid the havingness starts filling the vacuum areas dont run vacuum areas by making them solid or youll sit in that auditing chair for pretty long time the preclear will start picking up losses everything he picks up and makes solid is loss which is the first and foremost reason why he made facsimiles in the first place they are substitutions for loss and that is the explanation of the phenomenon of sublimation he will keep on talking about the loss of possessions marital partners and familial connections this does not violate game conditions because he is running losses of things and times he lost and because you are not auditing the losses you are auditing the pictures as long as you are auditing the pictures you have got the primary game still going dont have the preclear make incidents solid only have him make facsimiles of the incident solid otherwise he will be feeling terrible the thetans game is to make nothing out of facsimile which is nogame condition he is going toward the truth and by making the facsimile solid you are going towards making game when running solids subjectively the preclear will start getting things way up the track when you ask him to find facsimile earlier than the incident you dont care about the incident you want to know where the incident is so you dont run into it the values of running before and after facsimiles by making them solid and auditing directly towards the reduction of vacuum are not comparable if you try to take something out of the bank you will lose if you try to add something to the bank you will win why dont we just run scs and blow the preclear out of his head and stabilize him through some exteriorization drills because we want to get the preclear to make things in his head more solid otherwise for the rest of his career in this universe he will be leary on heads the only thing that is wrong with any preclear who is stuck in the head is that he cannot handle the stuff that is there this process is the best to date and it takes long time to run but for the amount of ability it regains in the case it is the fastest process we have this process belongs to effort on the knowtomystery scale l ron hubbardhco training bulletin 30 november 1956 slp 8 1 getting into communication with your preclear mimicry psycho rushes around in the middle of the room and jumps up and screams and you rush around in the middle of the room and jump up and scream b touching the preclear on locational or any other process where you walk the preclear around you are in communication with him to the degree that you touch him gradient scale touching him on the elbow taking hold of his elbow and eventually making his body turn this way and that commands look at who am i who does this hand belong to auditor indicating own hand or various parts of his body being sure to maintain some physical contact with preclears below 2 0 on tone scale where communication is solid 2 havingness subjective this is just patchup of havingness so that if the preclear caves in

going away find some objects in the room you dont dislike have him spot quite few maybe 20 you select out of these three you are sure are nonsignificant to this preclear have him go and get them and place them some distance apartat least three feet between object i and object 3and not directly in front of him two objects on one side one way off side the other slightly off side and one way off the other side alook at auditor mentions object 1 pick it up keep it from going away now you keep it from going away is the insistent version and he must be doing it check to see that he is doing it put it back in exactly the same place command agreed upon beforehand so that he isnt surprised by this look at object 2 then repeat above commands look at object 3 then repeat above commands b look at object 1 pick it up keep it from going away put it back in exactly the same place leave it totally uncontrolled look at object 2 then repeat above commands look at object 3 then repeat above commands part is run several times before running part b7 keep it from going away on the body everything you run on the right foot you run on the left foot everything you run on the right ear you run on the left ear everything you run on the head you run on the feet etc keep your hand from going away now make it flipflop keep it from going away now make it flipflop 8 keep it from going away by sight 9 connectedness look around and find something you wouldnt mind making connect with you on how many vias could you make it connect 10 handling of confusion make the wall say to preclear his body part of his body etc this means go to preclear furnishes the name different name each time for each of the six sides of the room then make the wall say to as above this means dont go to as above alternate once around the six sides of the room on this means go to then on dont go to until fairly flat then this means stay in this means dont stay in run as above 11 confuse that wall 12 causing confusions confusion which you could cause mock up confusion 13 stopcs now im going to give you little processa little drill that we have here in scientology first i want you to get your body moving toward that wall over there and somewhere along the line ill say stop and i want you to stop your body got that all right now get it moving stop thats fine all right now turn around here taking him by the elbow now were going to run little process im going to ask you to get your body moving toward that wall and somewhere along the line im going to say stop and when i say stop i want you to stop your body repeat above commands stop your body absolutely still stop your body absolutely still and do it as quickly after i say stop as you possibly can b when i ask you to change your body i want you to change the bodys position from to b locations designated by auditor lets see how rapidly you can change the bodys position c when i say start i want you to start the body moving start 14 tolerance of motion and stillness preclear sitting at window or ambulatory look at the street now find something still now find something in motion find something still find something in motion 15 with what could you ally your control or invent way to control people or look around and find something that would assist you in controlling people 16 over and under solids have him pick the centre of his life an engram in the middle of his life the commands are before and after this point get facsimile of something after that keep it from going away leave it totally uncontrolledget facsimile of something before that keep it from going away leave it totally uncontrolled or make it solid let go of it or make it solid skip it 17 time process select command wording to communicate to the preclear invent way to best overcome overwhelm beat whip make subservient put in the background make know its been licked time 18 valences mock up woman then mock up first significant woman in this lifetime then later one etc mock up man then as above mock up robot or any other valence spotted 19 invent an individuality to cope with it alternate with invent worse situation 20 invent an enemy get the valence to fight the wall will strip valences 21 keep it from going away on the body keep your body from going away alternate with leave it totally uncontrolled safest in mockup form or now make it flip flop 22 mockup startcs startcs on mocked up body 23 mockup stopcs stopcs on mocked up body change run as mock up the body make it flipflop 24 rehabilitation of abilities for any ability the preclear always wanted to have and couldnt do for example for speaking arabic mock up arabic objects keep it from going away then mock up arab men women and children keep him her from going away then mock up arab men women children stop him her from talking start him her talking l ron hubbardpab 101 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via

from the research papers of l ron hubbard theory the most adequate answer to lifes puzzle is games the ordinary concept of games or play is comprehensible to anyone games have many factors some work well in processing some dont all explain life the basic game of thetan is evidently nothing versus something as in the process make it solid he can never really be something thus can never really duplicate himself solidyet he makes solids across spaces out of game impulse practice always process toward games condition never process toward games condition always process games conditions never process nogames conditions this is more complicated than you think all games are aberrative all games are continuing by definition since an unstarted game isnt game and finished game isnt game in the following list we have the most processable games conditions and the mosttobe avoided nogames conditions each column of the list could be knowing or unknowingknowing games condition or unknowing games condition knowing nogames condition or unknowing nogames condition using both lists at knowing games level we have sanity at an unknowing games level we have aberration neurosis or psychosis games

of result winlose expecting revelation effect on self effect on self effect on others effect on others stop communication arc change communication noarc into it out of it agitation calm noise silence some silence control control startchangestop change the most important responsibility responsibility inspecting these two lists we find all unlimited and highly workable processes under games conditions we find all limited and unworkable processes under nogames conditions we process the preclear playing as game in all phases we then avoid nogames conditions in processingit is true that the games condition list contains regimen unworkable in life it isnt supposed to be its aberrative and we process it the only certain processes which can be run on nogames conditions are consequences the penalty resulting from and mock up confusion to which the nogames condition could be stable datum now behold that the list of nogames conditions is summary of the native state of thetan that means that the native state not only does not process but winds the preclear up in difficulties if processed to establish the native state run out the unknowing games conditions of the preclear from native state thetan apparently descends thusly native state serenity knowing nogames to to to operating tone scale knowing games thetan conditions to to to unknowing bodies antagonism games conditions to to to reactive minus unknowing banks tone scale nogames conditions processing however does not take the exact reverse route operating at level of knowing games conditions auditing converts the unknowing games and nogames conditions of the preclear into knowing games conditions and into further knowing games conditions further goal of auditing may very well be the attainment of nogame it would be knowing game however not an unknowing and it would not be actually condition bad condition of case would be unknowing condition concerning games good condition is knowing games condition condition

auditor sees case sets goal diagnoses and resolves weve got real auditor here on pc too wow lrh auditors daily report monday pc has had about 800 hours of processing with very little results he has given auditors hard time in the past he wont give one i ran today all day rudiments by control pc started to come off lot of machines and started to follow my orders happily i am only going to try to fix up his present time problems and get him into present time he seems to be badly stuck in some whopper of an engram vacuum full of engrams lrh tuesday ran pc on 8c part this morning and as id done yesterday established the session with rudiments by control pc will now follow my directions and is in session he stopped altering the commands he is pc now ran him today using dianetics book one techniques with the new added command make it more solid using gradient scale the engram i ran him through is an electrocution deal where he stepped on third rail when he was young boy his track is caved in on it and there he is stuck it started to unwind thats it the grouper lrh pull him out of this and he will be steamboating terrible trio and other processes have effect on him like water on duck or like trying to destroy pillbox with beanshooterin this engram his body died and he went to report station he goes around in serenity of death right lrh wednesday holiday thursday ran pc all day today on the same engram in the same manner as on tuesday this is slowly unraveling and as it is running out his tone comes up he almost dropped his accent at one time during the session he didnt learn english until he was seven years old he popped in and out of the engram several times and because of this engram he has had reality on his body with his eyes closed since he was twelve years old he is now aware of his body with his eyes closed pc is coming up the line lots of cognitions if i have time i want to run universes so true effect you could have on steel rails would have helped here maybe things rails cant have lrh friday ran pc on same engram again today in the same manner as yesterday it is all out except the one moment of jolt he received as he stepped on the third rail the tremendous impact and electrical charge is frozen in space and time ran it bit more in the afternoon session and found that his havingness was too low to let go of all this energy so i ran terrible trio and it worked very well he found that he was having the facsimile of the object instead of the object itself now he is having the object at least now he can remedy his havingness excellent lrh saturday ran pc on terrible trio and service facsimile using the commands what could it get you into what could it get you out of pc cognited on service facsimile and it broke away and moved out pc ran terrible trio very very well pc felt much better at the end of his intensive he was satisfied so was i pc is now ready to run terrible trio and mothers and fathers universes with good reality and benefit before it wouldnt have worked as well so next auditor run them general comments pc had never really been in session before and had never been in present time pc is long way from being in good

exhaustion 33 chapter eight 39 the man who succeeds39 first aid41chapter one on what does holding job depend on what does holding job depend familial connections who you know personal charm luck education industry interest intelligence personal ability to one grown old and even somewhat cynical in the world of work the first several seem to have dominance only the young appear to be left with the illusion or delusion that personal ability intelligence interest education and industry have anything to do with it and the very very cynical would have us believe that indeed these are only the symptoms of being very young we have too often seen the become the foreman the new soninlaw yesterday the shipping clerk soar to board membership and we all too often have known that the and soninlaw not only had aptitude in the first place but that with fear of discipline they act more carelessly of the firm than the worst employee present familial connection is something dependent upon the accident of birth but leaving familial connection until some other day what have we left there is who you know personal connection plays dominant part in obtaining keeping and improving position there can be doubt of this one has friend who works for the jimjambo company the friend knows of an opening the friend has other friends and these still other friends and so into the jim jambo company one can settle down and work with some security and hope of rise and then there is the matter of personal charm how often have we seen the young stenographer who couldnt spell cat suddenly soar with her typing fingers still all thumbs to the post of the executive secretary to the boss wherein while she cant spell cat any better she can certainly spell raise and raise again and perhaps even supper club or diamond necklace and we have also seen the young man with good front soar above his elders because he could perhaps tell the right joke or play slightly worse game of golf we have seen too the factor of education all gone awry in firms and governments and the trained man at how much cost of eyesight become learned beyond credit yet passed over for some chap who didnt have degree to his name beyond certain degree of push we have seen the untutored madly ordering the millions and the wise advising score industry as well seems to have scant place to those cynical few of us who have seen it all the eagerness of the young to slave is all too often braked by the older head who says why get in sweat about it youngun itll all come out the same and perhaps weve stayed after hours and daubed ourselves with ink or lingered at our post beyond all demand of duty only to watch in times to come the lazy one we scorned draw the better pay and weve said it isnt justice something less than that and interest too weve seen come all to naught when our absorption in the deadly game of firm or unit with its rivals made us lay aside neglected our own wife or life and when weve burned the night and leisure time to work out solutions gauged to save our firm and have sent them in and have had them come back neglected and soon have beheld our fellow worker whose total interest was man or stamps and not the firm at all go up to higher posts we had some cause to be less interested we thought and interest in our work became condemned by those around us who not understanding it became tired of hearing it in our mouths 1intelligence against this hard beaten parade of broken illusions would seem to have bearing whatever upon our fates when we see the stupid rule the many when we see the plans and decisions passed which would have been condemned even by the children of the workers we wonder what intelligence could have to do with it better to be dumb we might come to think than have our own wits continually outraged by the stupidities which pass for company planning personal ability against this torrent this confusing chaos of random causes for promotion and better pay would seem wasted item we have seen our own wasted we have seen the abilities of others scorned we have seen the unable rise while the able remained neglected or even unemployed so personal ability would not seem the factor it might once have been to us small cogwheels in the clashing gears of business fate it must then certainly be luck and nothing but luck the whole way down and so it seems to appear even to an experienced eye that the obtaining the holding and the improving of job are all dependent upon chaos of causes all of them out of our control we accept instead of orderly expectancy tumbling mass of accidentals as our fate we try little we dress well and cleanly in order to apply for position we take ourselves to the place of work daily we shuffle the papers or the boxes or the machinery parts in fashion we hope will pass we leave by crowded transport to our homes and expect another days dull toil occasionally we start up correspondence course to give us small edge on our fellows and often drop it before it is done it seems that we cannot even do this little to help us on our way against this flood of accidentals we become ill we run out of sick leave still but hardly recovered we now have job we become the victims of an accidental cabal or slander and we have job we are thrust up against jobs we cannot do and then again we have job we grow too old our time is spent in remembering how fast we once were and one day we have job the lot of the man in the workaday world is uncertainty his goal is security but only few attain this goal the rest of us worry from day to day from year to year about our ability to get work hold work improve our lots and all too often our worst fears take place once we had the rich to look toward and envy but now the taxes which we bear have reduced despite their clever accountants even their number states and governments rise and promise us all security and then give us restrictions which make that seem shaky too from day to day new threats impose themselves on our consciousness world where the machine is king makes man cog and we are told of new developments which do the work of thousands of us and so we starve the advertisements thrust at us in our transports newspapers streets radios and tv all manner of things to own and matter how delightful they are to own we the men who make them cant own them not on our pay and christmases leave us little ashamed at how little we can buy and we make the coat do just another year and the years advance and we grow younger and each hour confronts us with the accidents which might make or break our futures wonder we believe in luck alone well there is the problem to eat we must have job to live we must continue to be acceptable on our jobs to better ourselves we must hope for the breaks and it all appears huge disheartening confusion composed of accidents good luck and bad luck or drudgery with nothing to win at the end of it 2what would you give for something to lift you out of such ruts perhaps you are not in them but if not youre one of the lucky ones men to escape these ruts have perpetrated the bloodiest wars and revolutions of history whole dynasties have been cut to the dust in an overpowering convulsion born from despair jobs get few holding them becomes more and more accidental at last none can longer stand the strain of insecurity and the answer is raw red revolution and does this come to anything revolution is that act of displacing tyranny with tyranny ten times more despotic than the old changing governments not even changing firms can change basic security the quest for security is quest for constancy and peace worker deserves these things he creates the goods he should have the wherewithal to live instead he has chaos but where is this chaos is it in the workers family some say so is it in the character of capital some say so is this chaos born of bad government many have said so is it in the worker himself some would like him to think that it is not in any of these things the chaos of insecurity exists in the chaos of data about work and about people if you have compasses by which to steer through life you get lost so many recent elements of the industrial age have entered into life that life itself needs to be better understood work and security are parts of life if life is not understood then neither will these parts of life be understood if all life seems chaotic matter of guess and chance then certainly work will seem chaotic but the role of work in existence is greater role than any other some say we spend third of our lives in bed and therefore beds are important but we spend more than third of our lives at work and if we dont work we dont have bed so it seems that work is more important by far if you add up the various parts of life love or sports or entertainment you will find that the majority of concentration is not on any of these but upon work work is the major role of our existences whether we like it or not if we dont like it we dont like life if we find man bit insane old time ologies would have had us look up his love life or his childhood newer idea and better one is to look up his security and conditions of work as security goes bad in nation insanity rises if we were to attack national insanity problems and conquer them we wouldnt build better insane asylums we would better the conditions of work life is seventenths work onetenth familial onetenth political and onetenth relaxation economics the paycheck struggle for is seventenths of existence lose man his income or his job and you find him in bad mental condition usually if were going to find proofs of this anywhere well find them everywhere worry over security worry over worth worries about being able to do things in life for others are the principal worries of existence lets be very simple people with nothing to do people without purpose most easily become neurotic or mad work basically is not drudgery it is something to do the paycheck tells us we are worth something and of course it buys us what we have to have to live or almost does all right worksecurity then is important but security itself is an understanding insecurity is unknownness when one is insecure he simply doesnt know he is not sure men who know are secure men who dont know believe in luck one is made insecure by not knowing whether or not he is going to be sacked thus he worries and so it is with all insecurity insecurity exists in the absence of knowledge all security derives from knowledge one knows he will be cared for matter what happens that is security in the absence of certain knowledge it could also be fallacy luck is chance to depend upon luck is to depend upon notknowingness 3but in truth how could one have knowledge about life when life itself had not been brought as knowledge into order when the subject of life itself was chaos how could work as part of life be anything but chaos if livingness is an unknown subject then workingness and all pertaining to work must be an unknown subject exposed to cynicism hopelessness and guesses to obtain hold and improve job one would have to know the exact precision rules of life if one were to have complete security it would not be enough to know fairly well ones job that would not be security for as time went on we would see as we have listed too many chances entering into it knowledge of the general underlying rules of life would bring about security of life knowledge of the underlying rules of life would also bring about security in job scientology is science of life it is the first entirely western effort to understand life all earlier efforts came from asia or eastern europe and they failed none of them gave greater security none of them could change human behavior for the better none of them and they bragged about it could change human intelligence scientology is something new under the sun but young as it is it is still the only completely and thoroughly tested and validated science of existence it doesnt demand twenty years of sitting on spikes to find out one is mortal it doesnt demand vast study of rats to know that man is confused scientology can and does change human behavior for the better it puts the individual under the control of himself where he belongs scientology can and does increase human intelligence by the most exact tests known it has been proven that scientology can greatly increase intelligence in an individual and scientology can do other things it can reduce reaction time and it can pull the years off ones appearance but there is intention here to give list of all it can do it is science of life and it works it adequately handles the basic rules of life and it brings order into chaos science of life would be actually science of good order such things as accidents and luck would if you could but understand their underlying principles be under your control as we have seen here even those who arent cynical can see that many chances enter into obtaining holding and improving ones job some of these chances seem so wide and out of control that nothing at all could be done about them if we could but reduce the chanciness of job if we could make the right friends and be sure that our education would count and have some slight security that our interest and intelligence and native ability would not go all to waste why then things would be better wouldnt they well well see what scientology can do to reduce the chanciness of the workaday world for you and for those you know whats life all about anyway 4chapter two handling the confusions of the workaday world we have seen how one might be led to believe there was something confusing about navigating ones career in the world of work and confusion there is to one who is not equipped with guides and maps basically it all seemed very simple this thing called work getting job one was educated into some skill and one read an ad or was sent by friend and was interviewed for job and one got it and then reported every day and did the things assigned and as time went on hoped for raise in pay and time going even further on brought one to hope for pension or governmental regime that would pay old age benefits and that was the simple pattern of it but times change and simple patterns have habit of being deranged the various incidents and accidents of fate entered into the picture completely aside from personal factors larger views alter things the government in sweeping economy fails to grant adequate pension the business for which one works is shattered by time of depression or ones health fails inexplicably and one is left on charity the worker in his workaday world is towering giant amongst his many foes the tinsel path sketched so happily by rabblerousers the great affection held for the worker by this or that ideology or political figure do not reflect fact man working at job is faced by difficulties large enough to him matter how small they might seem to successful industrialist few percent rise in taxes may mean that he thereafter goes without tobacco an entrance upon bad times for the business may result in lessened pay and there may go any and all luxuries and even some necessities or the job the effect of international currents governments business trends and markets all usually beyond his concern the worker is perfectly entitled to believe that his fate is not quite entirely predictable indeed he might even be entitled to be confused man can starve to death in few days few workers have many days of margin in their pockets if the currents change thus many things which would be vast problem to the very secure are watched as menaces by the worker and these things can become so many that all life seems too confused to be borne and one sinks into an apathy of daytoday grind without much hope trusting that the next storm by luck will pass over him as one looks at the many factors which might derange his life and undermine his security the impression is confusion seems well founded and it can be said with truth that all difficulties are fundamentally confusions given enough menace enough unknown man ducks his head and tries to swing through it blindly he has been overcome by confusions enough unsolved problems add up to huge confusion every now and then on his job enough conflicting orders bring the worker into state of confusion modern plant can be so poorly managed that the entire thing appears to be vast confusion to which answer is possible luck is the usual answer one resorts to in confusion if the forces about one seem too great one can always rely on his luck by luck we mean destiny not personally guided when one turns loose of an automobile wheel and hopes the car will stay on the road by luck he is often disappointed and so it is in life those things left to chance become less likely to work themselves out one has seen friend shutting his eyes to the bill collectors and gritting his teeth while he hopes that he will win at the races and solve all his problems one has known people who handled their lives this way for years indeed one of dickens great characters had the entire philosophy of waiting for something to turn up but luck while we grant that it is potent element is only necessary amid strong current of confusing factors if one has to 5have luck to see him through then it follows that one isnt any longer at his own automobile wheel and it follows too that one is dealing with confusion confusion can be defined as any set of factors or circumstances which do not seem to have any immediate solution more broadly confusion in this universe is random motion if you were to stand in heavy traffic you would be likely to feel confused by all the motion whizzing around you if you were to stand in heavy storm with leaves and papers flying by you would be likely to be confused is it possible to actually understand confusion is there any such thing as an anatomy of confusion yes there is if as switchboard operator you had ten calls hitting your board at once you might feel confused but is there any answer to the situation if as shop foreman you have three emergencies and an accident all at the same time you might feel confused but is there any answer to that confusion is only confusion so long as all particles are in motion confusion is only confusion so long as factor is clearly defined or understood confusion is the basic cause of stupidity to the stupid all things except the very simple ones are confused thus if one knew the anatomy of confusion matter how bright one might be he would be brighter if you have ever had to teach some young aspirant who was not too bright you will understand this well you attempt to explain how suchandso works you go over it and over it and over it and then you turn him loose and he promptly makes complete botch of it he didnt understand he didnt grasp it you can simplify your understanding of his misunderstanding by saying very rightly he was confused ninetynine percent of all education fails when it fails on the grounds that the student was confused and not only in the realm of the job but in life itself when failure approaches it is born one way or another from confusion to learn of machinery or to live life one has to be able either to stand up to confusion or to take it apart we have in scientology certain doctrine about confusion it is called the doctrine of the stable datum if you saw great many pieces of paper whirling about room they would look confused until you picked out one piece of paper to be the piece of paper by which everything else was in motion in other words confusing motion can be understood by conceiving one thing to be motionless in stream of traffic all would be confusion unless you were to conceive one car to be motionless in relation to the other cars and so to see others in relation to the one the switchboard operator receiving ten calls at once solves the confusion by labelling correctly or incorrectly one call as the first call to receive her attention the confusion of ten calls all at once becomes less confusing the moment she singles out one call to be answered the shop foreman confronted by three emergencies and an accident needs only to elect his first target of attention to start the cycle of bringing about order again 6until one selects one datum one factor one particular in confusion of particles the confusion continues the one thing selected and used becomes the stable datum for the remainder any body of knowledge more particularly and exactly is built from one datum that is its stable datum invalidate it and the entire body of knowledge falls apart stable datum does not have to be the correct one it is simply the one that keeps things from being in confusion and on which others are aligned now in teaching young aspirant to use machine he failed to grasp your directions if he did because he lacked stable datum one fact had to be brought home to him first grasping that he could grasp others one is stupid then or confused in any confusing situation until he has fully grasped one fact or one item confusions matter how big and formidable they may seem are composed of data or factors or particles they have pieces grasp one piece and locate it thoroughly then see how the others function in relation to it and you have steadied the confusion and relating other things to what you have grasped you will soon have mastered the confusion in its entirety in teaching boy to run machine dont throw torrent of data at him and then point out his errors thats confusion to him that makes him respond stupidly find some entrance point to his confusion one datum tell him this is machine it may be that all the directions were flung at someone who had real certainty real order of existence this is machine you say then make him sure of it make him feel it fiddle with it push at it this is machine tell him and youd be surprised how long it may take but youd be surprised as well how his certainty increases out of all the complexities he must learn to operate it he must know one datum first it is not even important which datum he first learns well beyond that it is better to teach him simple basic datum you can show him what it does you can explain to him the final product you can tell him why he has been selected to run this machine but you must make one basic datum clear to him or else he will be lost in confusion confusion is uncertainty confusion is stupidity confusion is insecurity when you think of uncertainty stupidity and insecurity think of confusion and youll have it down pat what then is certainty lack of confusion what then is intelligence ability to handle confusion what then is security the ability to go through or around or to bring order to confusion certainty intelligence and security are lack of or ability to handle confusion how does luck fit into confusion luck is the hope that some uncontrolled chance will get one through counting on luck is an abandonment of control thats apathy there is good control and bad control the difference between them is certainty and uncertainty good control is certain positive predictable bad control is uncertain variable and unpredictable with good control one can be certain with bad control one is never certain foreman who makes rule effective today but not tomorrow who makes george obey but not james is exercising bad control in that foremans wake will come uncertainty and insecurity matter what his personal attributes may be because there can be so much uncertain stupid control some of us begin to believe that all control is bad but this is very far from true control is necessary if one would bring any order into confusions one must be able to control things his body his thoughts at least to some degree to do anything whatever confusion could be called an uncontrolled randomness only those who can exert some control over that randomness can handle confusions those who cannot exert control actually breed confusions 7the difference between good and bad control then becomes more obvious the difference between good and bad here is degree thorough positive control can be predicted by others therefore it is good control nonpositive sloppy control cannot be predicted therefore it is bad control intention also has something to do with control control can be used for constructive purposes or destructive purposes but you will discover that when destructive purposes are intended bad control is used thus there is great deal to this entire subject of confusion you may find it rather odd for confusion itself to be used here as target but you will find that it is an excellent common denominator to all that we consider evil in life and if one can become master of confusions his attention is freed for constructive activity so long as one is being confused by confusions all he can think about are destructive things what he wants to do most is to destroy the confusion so let us then learn first how to destroy confusions and this we find is rather simple thing when all particles seem to be in motion halt one and see how the others move according to it and then you will find less confusion present with one adopted as stable datum others can be made to fall in line thus an emergency machine job or life itself can be viewed and understood and one can be free let us take glance at how this works in the first chapter we listed number of things which might influence obtaining holding and improving job one can handle this entire problem as people most often do by entering into the problem the single datum i can get and hold job by clutching to this as single belief the confusions and insecurities of life become less effective less confusing but suppose one has done this suppose that without further investigating the problem one when young gritted his teeth and shut his eyes and said i can get and hold job come what may therefore i am not going to worry about the economics of existence any more well that was fine later on without warning one got fired one was out of work for ten weeks he felt then even when he did get new job less secure less confident and let us say that some accident occurred and one was out of job again when once more unemployed he was once more even less confident less secure why let us take look at the opposite side of this doctrine of the stable datum if we do we learn that confusions are held ineffective by stable data and that when the stable datum is shaken the confusion comes into being again let us envision confusion as stopped it is still scattered but it is stopped what stopped it the adoption of stable datum let us say that one was bothered badly in the home by motherinlaw one day after quarrel one stalked out and by inspiration said to himself all mothersinlaw are evil that was decision that rightly or wrongly was stable datum adopted in confusion at once one felt better he could deal with or live with the problem now he knew that all mothersinlaw were evil it wasnt true but it was stable datum then one day when he was in trouble his motherinlaw stepped forward trueblue and paid not only the rent but the other debt too at once he felt very confused this act of kindness should not have been thing to bring in confusion after all hadnt she solved the problem then why does one feel upset about it because the stable datum has been shaken the entire confusion of the past problem came into action again by reason of the demonstrated falsity of the stable datum to make anyone confused all you have to do is locate their stable data and invalidate them by criticism or proof it is only necessary to shake these few stable data to get all persons confusions back into action 8you see stable data do not have to be true they are simply adopted when adopted then one looks at other data in relation to them thus the adoption of any stable datum will tend to nullify the confusion addressed but if that stable datum is shaken invalidated disproven then one is left again with the confusion of course all one has to do is adopt new stable datum or put the old stable datum back in place but hed have to know scientology in order to accomplish this smoothly let us say one has fears of national economy because of an heroic political figure who is trying his best that man is the stable datum to all ones confusions about national economy thus one isnt worried but one day circumstances or his political enemies shake him as datum they prove he was really dishonest one then becomes worried all over again about national economy maybe you adopted some philosophy because the speaker seemed such pleasant chap then some person carefully proves to you that the speaker was actually thief or worse one adopted the philosophy because one needed some peace from his thoughts invalidating the speaker would then at once bring back the confusion one faced originally all right we looked at the confusion of the workaday world when we were young and we held it all back by stating grimly i can get and keep job that was the stable datum we did get job but we got fired the confusion of the workaday world then became very confusing if we have only the one stable datum i can get and keep job as our total answer to all the various problems listed in the first chapter then assuredly one is going to spend some confusing periods in his working life far far better stable datum would be i understand about life and jobs therefore i can get hold and improve them and thats where we are going in this book 9chapter three is work necessary an understanding of life is necessary to the living of it otherwise life becomes trap to so many of us in the workaday world this trap takes the form of work if only we didnt have to work how many delightful things could we do if only we had some other way of getting money travel vacations new clothes what host of things would be ours if only we didnt have to work it is almost an educational factor of our society that work duress of is the root of our unhappiness we hear unions and welfare states as well as individuals basing all their plea upon reduction of work getting rid of work by virtue of reduced hours and the introduction of automatic machinery has become the byword of the midtwentieth century yet the most disheartening thing which could happen to most of us would be the loss of all future jobs to be denied the right to work is to be denied any part of the society in which we live the rich mans the moneyed dowager neither of them works neither is sane when we look for neurosis and folly in our society we look toward those who do not or cannot work when we look over the background of criminal we look at inability to work somehow the right to work seems to be bound up in happiness and the zest of living and demonstrably the denial of work is bound up with madness and insanity as the amount of automatic machinery increases in our society so increases the percentile of our people who are insane child labor laws injunctions against overtime demands for many papers and skills and conditions of being alike combine to reduce the amount of work that can be done by an individual have you ever seen retired man who pined for his desk today the doctrine of limited work educates us to believe that at such and such an age we must stop work why is this so popular when we can see for ourselves that the end of work is the end of life in most cases speaking politically for moment from the standpoint of sanity man more dearly needs the right to work than he does an endless number of pretended freedoms yet we carefully discourage in our children and in our society those people who make work unless work is made there will be work to do work is not something which springs readymade into our sight work is something that is created new inventions new markets new systems of distribution must be created and brought into existence as times change and old methods old markets old systems become inadequate and wear out somebody created the jobs we do when we work we either do job created by ourselves or by another it is not enough to coast along in job the job day by day has to be made by us matter who created it in the first place to work is to participate in the activities of our society to be refused part in the activities of our society is to be cast out by it somebody invented the difference between work and play play was seen to be something that was interesting and work was seen to be something that was arduous and necessary and therefore not interesting but when we have our vacations and go and play we are usually very glad to get back to the daily grind play is almost purposeless work has purpose 10in truth only the constant refusal on the part of the society to give us work results in our distaste of work when it exists the man who cannot work was forbidden the right to work when we go back in the history of the notoriously unabletowork criminal we find that he was first and foremost convinced that he must not work he was forbidden to work whether by his father or mother or school or early life part of his education was that he must not work what was left revenge upon the society which refused to let him take part in its activities let us redefine work and play play should be called work without purpose it could also be called activity without purpose that would make work be defined as activity with purpose where we have fault to find with working it grows out of our own fear that we will not be permitted to continue work there is nothing wrong with automation with all this installation of machines to do our work so long as the powersthatbe remember to create additional work for us automation could be blessing to the whole world providing as many new jobs are invented as were disposed of by machinery then wed have production and if the powers thatbe didnt fumble their basic economics and created enough money for us to buy all the new products there would be prosperity indeed so it isnt automation that is at fault if automation leaves people unemployed somebody wasnt permitted to invent new jobs for us of course if every new business is flattened by restriction and if every man who would invent work was prohibited from doing so then and only then would automatic machinery bring about our down fall despite the muchadvertised joys of vacations and endless play such things have never been other than curse for man the earliest mention of it was by homer in the lotus isles and didnt that crew go to pieces definitely there is more to work and working than having to have paycheck of course there are jobs more interesting than other jobs of course there are positions which are more remunerative than other positions but when one contrasts the right to have position with right to have one then one will choose even the less interesting and poorer paid tasks did you know that mad person could be made well simply by getting him convinced that he has some purpose in life well that can happen it doesnt matter how thin or artificial that purpose may be mad people can be made sane with it one instance comes to mind of crazy girl for whom nothing could be done that was the point in her case nothing could be done for her but one night near the asylum an auto accident occurred and an overworked doctor seeing her near ordered her to do some things for the victims she became well she became staff nurse she was never insane thereafter now noone pretends that we are all mad if we dont work but it is an astonishing thing that we drift in that direction when we are forbidden to labor great revolutions occur out of mass inability to work the crowds rebel not because they are angry over privileges which they always say but because they have gone mad having work it is truth that revolutions cannot occur when people are all employed and it doesnt matter how arduously they are employed either revolutions occur when people have been too often forbidden to work they go up in madness and the state often comes down in ruins revolution ever won anything life evolves into better condition by means of hard work not by threats if automatic machinery threw enough people out of work even though the machines were producing plenty there would be revolution why because by robbing them of work people have been robbed of purpose in life when that goes all goes good purpose bad purpose it does not matter so long as purpose exists why 11now do not think we have strayed very far from the last chapter we havent here is an understanding of life life has certain stable data that are the stable data of livingness once grasped then life and that part of it called work can be understood life is basically created thing but it has many elements in it creating against many other elements in it confusion occurs whenever two or more things start creating against each other thus life viewed impartially can seem to be confusion if one were to sit amongst all this livingness all this creatingness all this warfare without any purpose such an existence in its entirety would be fatal to be part of universe civilization and yet to have purpose is the route to madness the exertion of energy the exercise the time spent the things done are all of lower order of importance just to have something to do and reason to do it exerts control over life itself if you have purpose you have purchase on the small first particle necessary to make the whole understandable thus life can become terrible burden in the united states quarter of century ago and in other lands as well there was something called depression it came out of lack of understanding of economics during period of transition into machine age during it great president saw that work had been denied to his people he created work he thought he did it to get money into circulation to buy all the things the country could now make therefore he did not really rescue the bulk of his people from despair for the work he gave them was to be carelessly done poorly done all that was being demanded was time spent on the job he had wonderful opportunity to turn country into beautiful thing but the work given had purpose men who detest one job or another detest it because they cant see where it is going or cant believe they are doing any important thing they are working that is to say they report and go through motions and draw paycheck but they arent truly part of the scheme of things they dont feel they have anything to win in our civilization the stable datum to the confusion of existence is work and the stable datum of work is purpose even if the purpose is just getting paycheck it is still purpose any of us probably could do more important things than we are doing any of us could use some changes in our tasks but none of us and still stay alive and sane could do without something to do when we grow timid in the face of circumstance it is because our purpose our stable data have been invalidated it is as we have shown rather easy to knock person into state of confusion all you have to do is locate his stable datum on any subject and shake it this is trick we all use for instance we are arguing about economics with friend we dont agree with him we ask him where he got such an idea he says somebody wrote it in suchandso we attack the writer or the paper and discredit it in other words we win our argument by shaking his stable datum as nearly as we can find it life is competitive many of us forget we are part of team called man in contest with who knows what else to survive we attack man and attack our friends in the course of holding job it seems only natural that here and there in the organization would be people who were so insecure in their own tasks that they seek to spread insecurity around them having drunk of confusion too deeply having too few stable data person can begin to dramatize confusion to spread it to consciously try to make everything and everybody confused one of the favorite targets of such people is the stable datum of work although 12usually such people cannot even do their own jobs they are very anxious to make others tired of theirs they cut down the competition by carving up the stable data of others beware these people who come around and inquire sympathetically about your health because you look overworked it is almost easier to get overloafed than overworked beware these people who want you to sign petition to shorten the hours to be spent on the job the end product of that is job and beware too the fellow who is always taking it out of the firm because the firm can afford it remember that firm is part yours matter if they fire you tomorrow such people are trying to pull out from under you the stable datum of work if you are afraid of losing your job it is because you suffer already from too many forbiddings to work the only way to hold job is to make it every day to create it and keep it created if you have wish to create and continue that job then there must be something at crosspurposes with purpose there is something wrong between what you think would be good purpose and what purpose your job has government jobs are an interesting example because so often nobody seems to care really whether the job has purpose or not too often the purpose of having government job is just to have government job here in particular one has to understand about life and work itself for government job has to be created continually to continue and if it seems to have purpose then one should look over government itself and get at its purpose for the purpose of the government as whole in some part would be the purpose of the job held matter how small anyone suffering from distaste for work must basically have feeling that he isnt really allowed to work thus work is not stable datum in life and he must have as well some crosspurpose about the purposes of his job and too he usually is associated with people in his job who are trying to make work into something less than tasteful but he is to be pitied because he is unhappy he is unhappy because he is confused why is he confused because he has stable datum for his life and stable datum for life itself is the basis of good living as well as good job orientation 13chapter four the secret of efficiency what is control whether one handles machine of the size of car or as small as typewriter or even an accounting pen one is faced with the problems of control an object is of use to anyone if it cannot be controlled just as dancer must be able to control his body so must worker in an office or factory be able to control his body the machines of his work and to some degree the environment around him the primary difference between the worker in an office or factory and an executive is that the executive controls minds bodies and placement of communications raw materials and products and the worker controls in the main his immediate tools however it is far too easy for those anxious to agitate labor into measures not necessarily good for it and for executives who themselves are anxious for control and anxious about it to forget that the worker who does not control his materials of work and who is himself controlled factor only is practically useless to the plant itself both management and labor must be able to control their immediate environment the most apparent difference between an executive and worker is that the executive controls more environment than the worker to that degree then the executive must be more capable than the worker or the plant or business is doomed to difficulty if not failure what is good workman he is one who can positively control his equipment or tools of trade or who can control the communication lines with which he is intimately connected what is bad worker bad worker is one who is unable to control the equipment he is supposed to control or the communication lines he is supposed to handle people who wish to control others but who do not wish others to control anything bring us into difficulty by establishing fallacy that fallacy is that there is such thing as bad control control is either well done or not done if person is controlling something he is controlling it if he is controlling it poorly he is not controlling it machine which is being run well is controlled machine which is not being run well is not being controlled therefore we see that bad control is actually notcontrol people who tell you that control is bad are trying to tell you that automobile accidents and industrial accidents are good attempted control for bad or covert purposes is harmful and it carries with it the ingredient of unknowingness the person who is attempting control is actually not controlling he is simply seeking to control and his efforts are in the main indefinite and unpositive which of course are characteristics which control does not countenance when unknowingness is entered into control control can become antipathetic but it does not become fact if you have ever covertly controlled your car you will understand what is meant if you handled your steering wheel in such way that the car would not know which way it was then supposed to go you would soon be involved in difficulties you must handle the steering wheel of car in such way that the car then turns the proper turns and remains on straight course on straight road there is nothing hidden about your intention of controlling the car and there is nothing unknown about the response of the car when car fails to respond to your handling of the steering wheel control has ceased to exist in other words one either controls something or he does not if he does not we have developed misnomer we have developed the idea that there is such thing as bad control people who have been badly controlled which is to say who have been merely shaken up and have not been controlled at all begin to believe that there is something bad about control but they would really not know what control is since they have not been controlled in 14actuality to understand this further one would have to know one of the very basic principles of scientology which is the anatomy of control in part this principle consists as follows control may be subdivided into three separate parts these parts are start change and stop start change and stop also comprise cycle of action the cycle of action is seen in the turning of simple wheel the wheel starts and then any given spot on it changes position and then the wheel is stopped it does not matter how long the wheel is in motion it still follows this cycle of action man walking short distance starts changes the position of his body and stops his body he has if he does this completed cycle of action on longer span company starts continues and at some date early or late ceases to exist in change we get change of position in space or change of existence in time in start we have simple start and in stop we have simply stop things may start slowly or rapidly things may stop slowly or rapidly things may change very rapidly while they are going thus the rate of start the rate of change and the rate of stop have little to do with the fact that cycle of action does consist of start change and stop the ancients referred to this cycle of action in much more detailed fashion we find the vedic hymns talking about cycle of action in this wise first there is chaos then from the chaos something emerges and can be said to have been born it grows it persists it decays and dies and chaos ensues although this in essence is an inaccurate statement it is the earliest example of cycle of action modern scientology example of cycle of action is much more simply stated and is much more accurate cycle of action is start change and stop this parallels another cycle of action which is that of life itself the cycle of action of life is creation survival and destruction survival could be said to be any change whether in size or in age or in position in space the essence of survival is change creation is of course starting destruction is of course stopping thus we have in scientology two very useful cycles of action the first of them being start change and stop and the more detailed one being create survive destroy start change and stop imply the conditions of being or an object create survive destroy imply the intention of life toward objects control consists entirely of starting changing and stopping there are other factors in positive control if one can start something change its position in space or existence in time and stop it all at will he can be said to control it whatever it may be if one can barely manage to start something can only with difficulty continue its change of position or existence in time and if one can only doubtfully stop something he cannot be said to control it well and for our purposes he would be said to be able to control it poorly or dangerously if he cannot start something if he cannot change its position in space if he cannot stop something then he is definitely not in control of it if he is trying to start change and stop something or somebody without positively doing so he has entered unknowingness into the activity and the result will be questionable to say the least thus there is such thing as good control good control would consist of knowingness and positiveness girl who can start typewriter continue its motion and then stop it could be said to be in control of the typewriter if she had difficulties in starting it in continuing its action and in stopping it she would not only be in bad control of the typewriter she would be bad stenographer where bad control enters in so enter incompetence accidents difficulties inefficiency and not the least considerable misery and unhappiness as we define bad control as notcontrol or as an unknowing attempt at control without actually effecting control it can be said that unpositiveness results in great many difficulties 15to give you some idea of how far this might go in life you might get the idea of being moved around in room by somebody this somebody would tell you to go to the desk then would tell you to go to chair then would tell you to go to the door each time he tells you to go somewhere you of course have to start yourself change your bodys position and stop yourself now oddly enough you would not mind this if you knew that somebody was telling you to do it and you were capable of performing the action and you were not receiving orders in such wise as to interrupt your obedience of the command before you completed it let us say for instance that somebody told you to go to the desk but before you arrived at the desk he told you to go to chair but before you arrived at the chair told you to go to the door and then claimed you were wrong in not having gone to the desk you would be at that time confused this would be bad control since it does not permit you to finish any cycle of action before another cycle of action is demanded of you thus your cycles of action become involved and confusion results but this in essence would not be control since control must involve an understandable or knowing positiveness good control would not change the order before you had chance to arrive at the desk it would let you arrive at the desk before you were asked to start again for the chair it would let you arrive at the chair before you were asked to start again for the door now you would not mind the positive control but it is certain that you would be quite upset by the broken series of orders which did not permit you to finish any cycle of action now to give you some idea of how this could influence ones life which would you rather have give you series of orders such as above to move around room your father or your mother it is certain that you had the most trouble with the parent you would not have chosen to have given you those orders control is so far from being bad that person who is sane and in very good condition does not resent good positive control and is himself able to administer good positive control to people and objects person who is not in very good condition resents even the most casual directions and is actually not capable of controlling people or objects the latter person is also inefficient and has many difficulties with work and with life when person cannot control things or when he resists things controlling him he involves himself with difficulties not only with people but with objects it is also apparent that people with control difficulties more readily become ill and fail in other ways when person is incapable of controlling piece of machinery it often occurs that the machinery reverses the matter and begins to control him as an example driver who cannot exert positive control on car is quite likely eventually to be controlled by that car instead of driver driving car down the street we have car taking driver down the street and sooner or later the car not being very expert at control winds its driver up in ditch even mechanical failures are attributable to lack of control it will be discovered that an individual who cannot easily control machine is quite likely to have considerable difficulties with that machine the machine itself suffers sometimes in nearly inexplicable ways motors run for some men and do not run for others some machinery will go on for years in the hands of mechanic but when the mechanic leaves it and another takes his place who is not adept the machine may be found to break down and experience difficulties never before noticed in it it is stretching things little bit to infer that person who cannot control things needs only to look at piece of machinery to have something go wrong with it and yet there are cases on record where this has happened the factor involved is more easily understood in for instance an accounting department person who cannot control figures of course sooner or later involves the books he is keeping in complexities and intricacies which not even an expert accountant can straighten out 16the cycle of action of this universe is start change and stop this is also the anatomy of control almost the entire subject of control is summed up in the ability to start change and stop ones activities body and ones environment habit is simply something one cannot stop here we have an example of control whatever and we have the step beyond the last extremity of entirely lost control control begins to dwindle when one is able to change things and stop things but is not still capable of starting them once thing is started such person can change and stop it further dwindling of control if one can now call it such would be the loss of an ability to change something or continue its existence in time this would leave one simply with the ability to stop things when one finally loses the ability to stop something that thing has to some degree become his master in the stop of start change and stop we see in essence the entirety of the stable datum if one can stop just one particle or datum in confusion of particles or data one has begun control of that confusion in the matter of mass of calls coming into switchboard simultaneously each call insistently demanding the attention of an operator control is asserted on the switchboard by the operators stopping just one demand it does not particularly matter which demand is stopped handling just one call permits one then to handle another call and so forth until one has changed the condition of the switchboard from total confusion to handled situation one feels confused when there is nothing in situation which he can stop when he can at least stop one thing in situation he will then find it is possible to stop others and finally will recover the ability to change certain factors in the situation from this he graduates into an ability to change anything in the situation and finally is capable of starting some line of action control is then found to be very intimate to confusion worker who is easily confused is worker who cannot control things an executive who is frantic in the face of an emergency is an executive who even in good times does not feel that he has any ability to actually start change and stop situations in which he is involved as an executive franticness helplessness incompetence inefficiency and other undesirable factors in job are all traceable to inabilities to start change and stop things let us say that plant has good manager the manager can start change and stop the various activities in which the plant is involved can start change and stop the various machinery of the plant can start change and stop the raw materials and the products of the plant and can start change and stop various labor activities or difficulties but let us say that this plant is unfortunate enough to have only one person in it who can start change and stop things now unless the executive is going to handle all the incoming raw materials turn on and off all the machinery process every piece of material in the place and ship the finished products himself he will be unable to run the plant similarly an office manager who himself can start change and stop any of the activities of an office or handle them if he were the only one in the office who could would be powerless actually to run very large office in plant or in an office it is then necessary for an executive matter how good he may be to be supported by subordinates who themselves are not unwilling to be started changed and stopped by him but who can themselves start change and stop the activities or personnel in their own immediate environment in the plant now given good executive in plant or office and given good subordinates defining as good their ability to start change and stop things we would yet have difficulty if we reached lower down on the command chart and discovered that we did not have any working people who themselves were capable of starting changing and stopping their own particular jobs we would have condition here where the executive and the foreman would then be forced to do everything that was really being done in the plant to actually have good plant we would have to have an executive foreman and workers all of whom in their own environment were capable of starting changing and stopping things and who were at the same 17time including the executives not unwilling to be started changed and stopped in their duties providing positive and understandable orders were used as we look this over we see less and less the picture we have been uniformly presented with in plants and offices of the management and laborers as soon as we discover one worker in plant who does not have to start change or stop himself or anything else we would then have somebody who would justify this title of laborer it is apparent that from the topmost member of the board down to the lowest worker on the payroll each and every one of them is involved with starting changing and stopping people materials machinery products and pieces of the environment in other words each and every one of them present in plant or an office is actually managing something as soon as an executive realizes this he is then capable of running far more efficient business since he is capable then of selecting out from amongst them people who are best at starting changing and stopping things and these by example can bring others into state of mind where they too are willing to positively start change and stop things we have people in the workaday world whether managers or janitors who are for instance fixated stuck on starting these people can start all day and all night but they never get going such people talk about big schemes and big deals such people talk lot of enthusiasm about getting going but never themselves seem to move others matter what their class or classification get fixated on change these manifest this usually by insisting that everything keep running they talk all the time about keeping things going but they will not listen to any new ideas or will not receive any new machinery since that would necessitate stopping some old machinery and starting some new machinery thus we get antiquated plants and systems continued on forever long past their usefulness or economic value subdivision of this is the person who must change everything all the time this is actually another manifestation of trying to keep things running but instead of keeping things running these people shift everything there is to be shifted all the time if an order is issued they change the order if they receive the word to go they change it to stay but this it will be seen is an unbalanced condition where these people are actually unwilling to keep anything running anywhere and are in reality on an obsessive stop plants businesses factories ships and even the government are victimized particularly by people who can only stop things matter how well some unit may be running some order is issued that stops whatever it is doing it is enough for such people to discover that something is going to do something to cause it to stop usually one gets around this by failing to inform such people that something is running thus we can see that there are people who abuse the cycle of action of start change and stop and who are themselves fixated upon one or another factor in the cycle of action or who are incapable of withstanding any factor in it which means of course that they are in continuous and arduous confusion it is noteworthy that those people who can only start things are normally creative the artist the writer the designer is looked upon to start things he actually might also be capable of continuing them or stopping them but his purest function is creation there are amongst very rational and good men those whose greatest ability is continuing things they can also start things and stop things if they can really continue things it is upon these men that we depend for the survival of business or an operation then there is the class that is used by the society to stop things such people have normally police function certain things are declared to be bad and these things so designated are then turned over to people to stop them imperfect production is stopped by inspectors bribery corruption or crime is stopped by police other nationally aggressive persons are stopped by the military and it should occasion surprise that these specialists in stop are of course specializing in destroy it should occasion further surprise that when one looks at the 18element in the society most likely to decay the society one looks for those whose job it is to specialize in stops these people in the main while serving very good function for the society at large if they became fully in charge as in police state would only destroy the state and its people as has been noted since the days of napoleon the most recent nation which turned over the entire function of the state to police was germany and germany was stopped very thoroughly germany also effected nothing but destruction when we have society which is very good at starting we have creative society when we have society which is very good at keeping things running we have society that endures when we have society that is only capable of stopping things we have society which is destructive or which is itself destroyed therefore we must realize that balance amongst these three factors of start change and stop is necessary not only in an individual but in business and not only in business but in nation when one can only do one of these one is considerably limited in his usefulness the optimum condition would be for everyone from manager down to janitor to be capable of starting changing and stopping and to be able to endure being started changed and stopped thus we would have balanced and relatively unconfused business activity business can succeed unless it has been properly started unless it is progressing through time or changing position in space and unless it is capable of stopping harmful practices and even competitors as it is with nation or business so it would be with an individual holding down single job he should be able to start change and stop anything under his immediate control if he is running machine he should be able to start the machine to keep it turning changing and to stop it and this should be under his own determinism his machine should not be started by some engineer and stopped at some period of the day without any attention from himself furthermore if he felt the machine should be shut down and oiled he should have the authority to do so and should not have to withstand the pummeling of some machine foreman who without understanding the situation simply observed that machine was stopped which according to his lights ought to be running even janitor to have any efficiency at his job and thus to have clean set of offices or plant would have to be able to start change and stop the various objects having to do with his particular job he should not have to keep on sweeping after the floor is clean and he should not have to stop sweeping before he has cleaned the floor and he should be able to start sweeping the floor when he believes it ought to be swept naturally if he is able to do these things he is also able to cooperate with his fellow workers and himself be stopped or started or altered in his activity so as to execute his job while making it possible for them to do their jobs here however we envision nation or plant or an office or small section or department running without any supervision at all whereas there would be executives and foremen and workers it is doubtful if supervision of others would occupy much of anyones time as the ability of the worker and foreman and executive to start change and stop those things which they should handle and control declines it will be discovered that supervision enters it the less capable people are of starting changing and stopping the people or objects under their immediate control the more supervision they require when supervision gets up to 80 percent of the plants activities it is certain that the confusion will be so great that inefficiency will result in such magnitude as to ruin the activity supervision then is actually criticism of the junior it implies that junior does not know or is not able in the field of control cooperation and alignment of activity is different than supervision where one has chain of command one does not necessarily have supervision one does have however co ordinated planning for an entire operation which is then relayed to others in the operation so that coordination can take place if everybody is agreed on the worthwhileness of any activity 19and if everybody in that activity were capable of actually controlling those items or persons which were in his immediate sphere of action it would be found that planning would not have to engage in much supervision in order to effect the execution of the ideas involved this is very high order of dream only where scientology has been thoroughly at work could such thing occur that an organization could run in agreement with itself without supervision or punitive action one is able to gauge those workers around him by the amount of confusion in which they are involved that confusion tells one at once the degree of inability to control things that inability to control things may not be entirely the fault of the worker there are two things which can be psychotic one is the surroundings and the other is the person sane man has difficulty in insane surroundings an insane man has difficulty in even the sanest and most orderly surroundings thus there are two factors involved in any operation the person and the surroundings it could also be said there are two factors involved in any business the surroundings of the business itself and the business one sane business trying to operate in world of madmen would have very great difficulty getting along one way or another the inability of the madmen to start change and stop things would infect the business and deteriorate its efficiency thus it is not enough that an individual himself be capable of controlling his job he must also be able to tolerate the confusion of those around him who cannot control their jobs or he must be able to tolerate sane and steady control from those around him insanity is contagious confusion is contagious have you ever talked to confused man without yourself at the end of the conversation feeling little confused thus it is in work if one is working with great many men who are incapable one begins himself to feel incapable it is not enough to live alone it is impossible to work alone realizing this one also understands that his ability to control the immediate machinery or work tools with which he is involved would also include an ability to assist others in his vicinity to control those things with which they are involved many good worker has been lost to factory because the good worker could not make his own work good enough to satisfy himself being faced in his job with so many confused elements and orders that he at last rebelled thus good workers can be spoiled in any department it is possible to spot the people who spoil good workers they are the people who cannot start change and stop such things as communication or machinery and who are themselves most liable to franticness and confusion these are the people who would rather have solutions thrown in the wastebasket and problems posted on the bulletin board what could one do if he were surrounded by people who were confused and incapable of starting changing and stopping their various activities he could himself become sufficiently capable at his own job that he would set fine example for others and thus himself be stable datum in the confusion of that area he could do even more than this he could understand how to handle them and so understanding could bring orderliness into the minds and activities of those men so as to balk their inabilities as they might affect him but in order to do the latter he would have to know great deal about scientology and its various principles and that is somewhat beyond the scope of this particular volume for the individual worker who wishes to do good job and to go on having job and to rise in his position it is almost enough that he understand his job thoroughly so that part of it confuses him and so that he can start change or stop anything with which he is connected in that job and that he himself can tolerate being started changed and stopped by his superiors without himself becoming unsettled in other words the greatest asset and greatest job insurance worker could have would be calmness of mind concerning what he was doing calmness of mind is derived from the ability to start change and stop the objects and activities with which he is involved and to be able to be started changed and stopped by others without himself being as confused as they are 20thus the secret of doing good job is the secret of control itself one not only continues to create job day by day week by week month by month he also continues the job by permitting it to progress and he is also capable of stopping or ending any cycle of work and letting it remain finished workers are most often victimized by bosses juniors or marital partners who are not themselves capable of controlling anything yet who will not be controlled and who in some peculiar way are obsessed on the idea of control worker who is thus intimately connected with something that he himself cannot control and which is incapable of actually or really controlling him performs his work in confused state which can only lead to difficulties and distaste for work itself it can be said that the only thing bad about working is that it is so very often associated with inabilities to control when these are present then the work itself seems tiresome arduous and uninteresting and one would rather do anything else than continue that particular work there are many solutions to this first amongst them is to regain control of the items or functions which one is most intimately connected with in doing his job however control in itself is not an entire answer to everything for if it were one would have to be able to control everything not only in his own job but in an office or on earth before he could be happy we discover in examining control that the limits of control should be extended only across ones actual sphere of operation when an individual attempts to extend control far beyond his active interest in job or in life he encounters difficulty thus there is limit to the area of control which if violated violates many things there is almost maxim that if an individual consistently seeks to operate outside his own department he will not take care of his own department as matter of fact in scientology organizations it has been discovered that person who is consistently involving himself with things far beyond his actual scope of interest is not covering his actual scope of interest thus there is obviously another factor involved than control this factor is willingness not to control and is fully as important as control itself 21chapter five life as game it is quite obvious that if anyone controlled everything he would have game there would be unpredictable factors surprises in life this might be said to be hell of considerable magnitude if one could control everything absolutely he would of course be able to predict everything absolutely if he could predict the course and action of every motion in the entirety of existence he would of course have real interest in it we have already looked at the necessity of controlling the immediate objects of work but remember it is necessary if one controls these immediate objects to have other objects or environments which one does not absolutely control why is this it is because life is game the word game is used here advisedly when one is mired down in the sometimes titanic struggle of existence he is apt to discount the fact that there is joy in living he is apt to disbelieve that such thing as fun can exist indeed people when they reach into their thirties begin to wonder what happened to their childhood when they actually could enjoy things one begins to wonder if pleasure of living isnt itself some sort of trap and one begins to believe that it is not good thing to become too interested in new people and new things since these will only lead to heartbreak there are men who have decided that in view of the fact that loss brings so much pain they had better not acquire at all it is far superior according to these to live life of only medium privation than to live life of considerable luxury since then if they lost what they had the pain would be much less life however is game it is very easy to see game in terms of cricket or football it is not so easy to see life as game when one is forced to rise before the sun and reach his home only after it sets after day of arduous and relatively unthanked toil one is likely to dispute that such an activity could be game at all nevertheless it is obvious in various experiments which have been made in scientology that life matter what its emotional tone or lack of it is in essence game and that the elements of life itself are the elements of games any job is game game consists of freedoms barriers and purposes there are many more complicated factors involved in games but these are all listed in scientology primary amongst these is the necessity in game to have an opponent or an enemy also necessity is to have problems another necessity is to have sufficient individuality to cope with situation to live life fully then one must have in addition to something to do higher purpose and this purpose to be purpose at all must have counterpurposes or purposes which prevent it from occurring one must have individualities which oppose the purpose or activities of one and if one lacks these things it is certain that he will invent them this last is very important if person lacks problems opponents and counter purposes to his own he will invent them here we have in essence the totality of aberration but more intimately to our purposes we have the difficulties which arise from work if we had foreman who capably controlled everything in his area and did nothing else and if that foreman were not entirely mentally balanced in all ways which is to say if he were human we would find that foreman inventing personalities for the workers under him and reasons why they were opposing him and actual oppositions we would find him selecting out one or more of his workmen to chastise with according to the foreman very good reason but 22in actuality without any further reason than that the foreman obsessively needed opponents now very many involved classifications can be read into this by ancient mental analyzes but none of these need to be examined the truth of the matter is that man must have game and if he does not have one he will make one if that man is aberrated and not entirely competent he will make an intensely aberrated game where an executive finds all running far too smoothly in his immediate vicinity he is likely to cause some trouble just to have something to do unless that executive is in very good mental condition indeed thus we have management pretending often without any actual basis in fact that labor is against it similarly we occasionally have labor certain that management which is in fact quite competent is against labor here we have invented game where game can actually exist when men become very shortsighted they cannot look actually beyond their own environment there is in any office plant or activity the game of the office plant or activity itself versus its competitors and versus its outer environment if that office plant or activity and all the personnel within it are conducting themselves on wholly rational and effective basis they choose the outside world and other rival concerns for their game if they are not up to par and are incapable of seeing the real game they will make up game and the game will begin to be played inside the office and inside the plant in playing games one has individuals and teams teams play against teams individuals play against individuals when an individual is not permitted to be fully part of the team he is apt to choose other members of the team as his opponents for remember man must have game out of all these complexities come the various complexities of work and the problems of production and communication if everybody in plant were able to control his own sphere of interest in that plant and if everybody in the plant were doing his own job there would actually be lack of game for there are other plants other activities in the outside world and these always furnish game enough for any rational organization but supposing the people in an organization cannot control their own sphere cannot control their own activities and are obsessively attempting to create aberrated games all about them then we would have condition whereby the plant office or concern would not be able to effectively fight its environment and would produce poorly if not collapse aberrated or not aberrated competent or not competent remember life is game and the motto of any individual or team alive is there must be game if individuals are in good mental and physical condition they actually play the game which is obvious and in plain sight if they are not in good condition and if they are themselves incapable of controlling their own immediate environment they will begin to play games with their tools here the machinist will find his machine suddenly incapable of producing one would not go so far as to say that he will actually break the machine so that he can have game with it but he will be in mild state of fury regarding that machinery continually the bookkeeper unable to control his immediate tools of trade and not wellfitted into his concern will begin to play game with his own figures and will fail to get balances his adding machine will break down his papers will get lost and other things will occur under his immediate nose which never should happen and if he were in good shape and could play the actual game of keeping other people in the plant straight so far as their accounts and figures are concerned he would be efficient efficiency then could be defined as the ability to play the game to hand inefficiency could be defined as an inability to play the game to hand with necessity to invent games with things which one should actually be able to control with ease 23this sounds almost too simple but unfortunately for the professors that try to make things complicated it is just that simple of course there are number of ways men can become too aberrated that is not the subject of this book the subject of this book is work now realizing that life must be game one should realize that there is limit to the area one would control and still retain an interest in life interest is mainly kindled by the unpredictable control is important uncontrol is if anything even more important to actually handle machine perfectly one must be willing to control it or not to control it when control itself becomes obsessive we begin to find things wrong with it the individual who absolutely has to control everything in sight is upsetting to all of us and this individual is why we have begun to find things wrong with control it sounds very strange to say that uncontrol must also be under control but this is in essence true one must be willing to leave certain parts of the world uncontrolled if he cannot he rapidly drops downscale and gets into situation where he is obsessively attempting to control things which he never will be able to control and thus renders himself unhappy begins to doubt his ability to control those things which he actually should be able to control and so at length loses his ability to control anything and this in essence is what in scientology we call the dwindling spiral of control there are mental factors which we will not discuss here which tend to accumulate the failure to control to point where one is longer confident of his ability to control the truth of the matter is an individual actually desires to have some part of life uncontrolled when this part of life hurts him sufficiently he then resigns himself to the necessity of controlling it and so makes himself relatively unhappy if he never will be able to do so game consists of freedom barriers and purposes it also consists of control and uncontrol an opponent in game must be an uncontrolled factor otherwise one would know exactly where the game was going and how it would end and it would not be game at all where one football team would be totally capable of controlling the other football team we have football game this is matter of contest there would be joy or sport in playing that game of football now if football player has been seriously injured playing football new unknowing factor enters into football for him this injury lodges in what we call the reactive mind it is mind which is unseen and which works all the time one normally works on what we call the analytical mind and this we know all about anything that we have forgotten or moments of unconsciousness and pain become locked away in the reactive mind and are then capable of reacting upon the individual in such way as to make him refrain from doing something which was once dangerous while this is rather technical subject it is nevertheless necessary to understand that ones past has tendency to accumulate and victimize one in the future thus in the case of the football player while he plays football he is apt to be restimulated or react from the old injury received in football and so feels less than spirit of fun while playing football he becomes anxious he becomes very grim on the subject of football and this is expressed by an effort to actively control the players on another team so that they will not injure him again in motorcycle race famous motorcycle rider was injured two weeks later in another race we find this motorcycle rider falling out on the fifth lap without injury or incident but simply pulling over into the pits he did this immediately after motorcycle swerved close to him he recognized at once that he was unable to control that motorcycle he felt then incapable of controlling his own motorcycle and so knew one thing he had to get out of that race and just as this motorcycle rider abandoned that race so all of us at one time or another have abandoned sections of life now up to the time he had that accident the motorcycle rider was perfectly willing to not control any other motorcycle on the track save his own he did not worry about these other 24motorcycles since they had never injured him and the motorcycle racing game was still game to him however during the accident there was moment when he sought to control another motorcycle than his own and another rider he failed in that effort thus in his reactive mind there is an actual mental image picture of his failing to control motorcycle thus in future racing he is less competent he is afraid of his own machine he has identified his own machine with somebody elses machine this is failure of control now in order to become good motorcycle racer again this man would have to resume his attitude of carelessness regarding the control of the other machines and riders on the track and reassume his own ability to control his own machine if he were able to do this he would become once more daring efficient and winning motorcycle rider demonstrating great competence only scientology practitioner could put him back into this condition and scientology practitioner would be able to do this probably in very few hours this however is not textbook on how to eradicate former ills but an explanation of why men become incompetent in the handling of their immediate tools of trade these men have attempted to leave uncontrolled all the world around them up to the moment when the world around them hurt them they then conceived the idea that they should control more than their own jobs they failed to control more than their own jobs and were instantly convinced that they were incapable of controlling something this is quite different than leaving things uncontrolled to be capable of controlling things and to be capable of leaving things uncontrolled are both necessary to good life and doing good job to become convinced that one cannot control something is an entirely different thing the whole feeling of selfconfidence and competence actually derives from ones ability to control or leave uncontrolled the various items and people in his surroundings when he becomes obsessed with necessity to control something rather beyond his sphere of control he is disabused of his ability to control those things close to him person eventually gets into state of mind where he cannot pay any attention at all to his own job but can only reach out into the outer environment and seek effectively or otherwise to stop start or change things which have in reality very little to do with his own job here we have the agitator the inefficient worker the individual who is going to fail he is going to fail because he has failed at some time in the past this is not quite as hopeless as it looks because it takes actual physical injury and very heavy duress to make an individual feel that he is incapable of controlling things the dayto day handling of machinery is not what deteriorates ones ability to work or handle life it is not true that one gets old and tired and his ability to do things wears out it is true that one becomes injured in sudden short moments and thereafter carries that injury into his future work and the injury is what causes him to deteriorate the eradication of the injury brings him back to an ability to control his own environment the entire subject of work then brings us to the value of uncontrol machinist doing good job should be able to relax as far as his machine is concerned he should be able to let it run or not let it run to start it or not to start it to stop it or not to stop it if he can do these things all with confidence and calm state of mind he can then handle that machine and it will be discovered that the machine will run well for him now let us say the machine bites him he hurts his hand in it some other worker jostles against him at the wrong moment some tool given to him is defective and shatters an actual physical pain enters into the situation he tends to fall away from the machine he tends then to concentrate much more heavily on the machine than he should he is longer willing to leave it uncontrolled when he is working with that machine he must control it now as he has entered duress into this situation and as he is already anxious about it it is fairly certain that the machine will hurt him again this gives him second injury and with this injury he feels an even stronger urge to control the machine you see during the moments of injury the machine was out of control now while outofcontrol is game condition it is not desired or welcome to this particular machinist eventually it is certain he will look upon this machine as some sort of demon he will you might say run the machine all day and at night while asleep run it 25too he will spend his weekends and his holidays still running that machine eventually he will not be able to stand the sight of that machine and will flinch at the idea of working it moment longer this picture becomes slightly complicated by the fact that it is not always the injury delivered to him by his own particular machine which causes him to feel anxious about machinery man who has been in an automobile accident may return to the working of machine with considerable qualms about machines in general he begins to identify his own machine with other machines and all machines become the same machine and that is the machine that hurt him there are other conditions which enter into lighter phases of work in the matter of clerk we may have circumstance where he is ill from some other area than his area of work and yet because he has little time off is forced to work sick or not the tools of his own work his filing cabinets or his pens or his books or the very room become identified with his feeling of sickness and he feels that these too have bitten him thus he becomes obsessed in his control of them and actually degenerates in his ability to control them just as the machinist does even though these tools have not actually injured him he associates them with being injured in other words he identifies his own sickness with the work he is doing thus even clerk whose tools of trade are not particularly dangerous can become upset about his tools of trade and can first exert enormous control over them on an obsessed basis and at length abandon any control of them and feel he would rather be beaten than do an instants more work in his particular sphere one of the ways of getting over such condition is simply to touch or handle ones various tools of trade and the surroundings in which he works if man were to go all the way around an office in which he had worked for years and touch the walls and window ledges and the equipment of tables and desks and chairs ascertaining carefully the feel of each one carefully locating each one with regard to the walls and other items in the room he would feel much better about the entire room he would be in essence moving himself from moment of time where he was sick or injured up to present time the maxim here is that one must do ones work in present time one must not continue to work in old moments of injury if acquaintance with ones tools or touching ones tools of the trade and discovering exactly where and how they are is so beneficial then what would be the mechanism behind this we will leave until later in this book some drills and exercises calculated to rehabilitate ones ability to work and look for moment at this new factor 26chapter six affinity reality and communication there are three factors in scientology which are of the utmost importance in handling life these three factors answer the questions how should i talk to peoplehow can i sell people thingshow can i give new ideas to peoplehow can i find what people are thinking abouthow can i handle my work better we call these three factors in scientology the arc triangle it is called triangle because it has three related points the first of these points is affinity the second of these points is reality the third of these points and the most important is communication by affinity we mean emotional response we mean the feeling of affection or lack of it of emotion or misemotion connected with life by reality we mean the solid objects the real things of life by communication we mean an interchange of ideas between two terminals without affinity there is reality or communication without reality there is affinity or communication without communication there is neither affinity nor reality now these are sweeping statements but are nevertheless very valuable and are true have you ever tried to talk to an angry man an angry mans communication is at level of misemotion which repels all terminals from him therefore his communication factor is very low even though very loud he is attempting to destroy something or some other terminal therefore his reality is very poor very likely what he is being angry about apparently is not what has made him mad an angry man is not truthful thus it could be said that his reality even on the subject he is attempting to voice is poor there must be good affinity which is to say affection between two people before they are very real to each other and reality must here be used as gradient with things being more real than other things there must be good affinity between two people before they can talk together with any truth or confidence before two people can be real to each other there must be some communication between them they must at least see each other which is in itself form of communication before two people can feel any affinity for each other they must to some degree be real these three terms are interdependent one upon the other and when one drops the other two drop also when one rises the other two rise also it is only necessary to improve one corner of this very valuable triangle in scientology in order to improve the remaining two corners it is only necessary to improve two corners of the triangle to improve the third to give you some idea of practical application of this there is the case of the young girl who had run away from home and whose parents would longer talk to her the girl as clerk in an office was quite despondent and was doing very bad work scientologist whose attention had been directed to her by the office manager gave her an interview and discovered that her parents were intensely angry with her and would longer communicate with her at all they had been so upset at her refusal actually her inability to follow career as concert pianist for which they had her studying at great expense that they had washed their hands of her and the unpleasantness had forced her to run away to distant point since that time they had not communicated with her but had spoken to people she had known in her home neighborhood in very bitter terms concerning her in such state of mind since she was intimately involved with her parents and wished to be on the best possible terms with them she could not work her failure to perform her work was jamming communication lines in her own office in other words her affinity was very low and her reality on things was quite low since she might be said to have been elsewhere most of the time and thus the communication lines which passed through her hands were equally low and successfully jammed other communication lines in the office at which time this matter became of intense interest to the 27office manager now ordinarily in the workaday world the office manager would have dismissed her and found another girl but employment was critical at the time and this office manager knew the modern thing to do he sent for scientologist the scientologist knowing well this arc triangle did very ordinary thing to scientologist which apparently worked magic as far as the girl was concerned he told the girl that she must write to her parents regardless of whether they replied or not she must write and she did so naturally there was reply why was there reply from the parents well the girl having disobeyed them and having moved out from underneath their control was apparently longer in contact with them these parents did not consider her as real she did not actually exist as far as they were concerned they had actually said this to themselves they had actually tried to wipe her out of their lives since she was such disappointment therefore they had emotion about her whatsoever except perhaps sort of apathy they had been unable to control her and so they were apathetic about her since they had failed to control her at this stage the parents were glumly apathetic about the girl and she was not very real to them at all as matter of fact as they had started her on career she could not complete the girl could not have been very real to them in the first place since the career was undoubtedly beyond the girls capabilities so the scientologist had her write letter this letter was as we say in scientology entirely good roads and good weather the girl said that she was working in this other city that the weather was good that she was getting along well and hoped that they were both well and sent them her love the letter carefully did not take up any of the problems or activities immediately behind her leaving home the of the letter the affinity was quite high the c was present what the scientologist was trying to do was establish r reality the reality of the situation of the girls being in another city and the actual reality of her existence in the world he knew that she was sufficiently involved with her parents that if they did not consider her real she was not even real to herself of course the parents did not answer this first letter but the scientologist had the girl write again after four letters all of which said more or less the same things and entirely ignored the idea that there had been reply there was sudden letter from the mother to the girl which was angry not with the girl but with one of her old playmates the girl coached was held in line by the scientologist and was not permitted to explode back through the communication line but was coaxed into writing surprised pleasant letter expressing her happiness at having heard from her mother after this two letters came one from the father and one from the mother both of them were very affectionate and hoped the girl was doing well the girl of course replied to these very joyously but would have been completely propitiative if the scientologist had permitted her to do so instead happy letter went back to each of them and in return two more letters came both of them very congratulatory to the girl at having found job and found something that she was interested in doing in life with requests as to where her clothes should be sent and actually small draft of money to help her along in the city the parents had already begun to plan the new career of the girl which was in exact line with what the girl could do in life stenographic work of course the scientologist knew exactly what was going to happen he knew that their affinity and reality would come up and the girls reality affinity and communication in the office itself would rise as soon as this situation was remedied he remedied with communication expressing affinity from the girl and this of course as it always does produced reaction the girls work came up to par the girl began to progress and now that her feeling of reality was sufficiently high actually became very valuable office worker probably the reason why the arc triangle went so long undiscovered was the fact that person in apathy rises through various tones these tones are quite uniform one follows the next and people always come up through these tones one after the other these are the tones of affinity and the tone scale of dianetics and scientology is probably the best possible way of predicting what is going to happen next or what person actually will do the tone scale starts well below apathy in other words person is feeling emotion about subject at all an example of this was the american attitude concerning the 28atomic bomb something about which they should have been very concerned was so far beyond their ability to control and so likely to end their existence that they were below apathy about it they actually did not even feel that it was very much of problem americans processed on this particular subject had to be worked with for some little time until they began to feel apathetic about the atomic bomb this was really an advance over the feeling of emotion whatsoever on subject which should have intimately concerned them in other words on many subjects and problems people are actually well below apathy there the tone scale starts on utter dead null far below death itself going up into improved tones one encounters the level of body death apathy grief fear anger antagonism boredom enthusiasm and serenity in that order there are many small stops between these tones but one knowing anything about human beings should definitely know these particular emotions person who is in apathy when his tone is improved feels grief person in grief when his tone improves feels fear person in fear when his tone improves feels anger person in anger when his tone improves feels antagonism person in antagonism when his tone improves feels boredom when person in boredom improves his tone he is enthusiastic when an enthusiastic person improves his tone he feels serenity actually the below apathy level is so low as to constitute noaffinity noemotion problem noconsequence state of mind on things which are actually tremendously important the area below apathy is an area without pain interest beingness or anything else that matters to anyone but it is an area of great danger since one is below the level of being able to respond to anything and may accordingly lose everything without apparently noticing it workman who is in very bad condition and who is actually liability to the organization may not be capable of experiencing pain or any emotion on any subject he is below apathy we have seen workmen who would hurt their hand and think nothing of it and go right on working even though their hand was very badly injured people in dispensaries working in industrial areas are quite amazed sometimes to discover how little attention some workmen pay to their own injuries it is an ugly fact that people who pay attention to their own injuries and who are not even feeling pain from those injuries are not and never will be without some attention from scientologist efficient people they are liabilities to have around they do not respond properly if such person is working crane and the crane suddenly goes out of control to dump its load on group of men that subapathy crane operator will simply let the crane drop its load in other words he is potential murderer he cannot stop anything he cannot change anything and he cannot start anything and yet on some automatic response basis he manages some of the time to hold down job but the moment real emergency confronts him he is not likely to respond properly and accidents result where there are accidents in industry they stem from these people in the subapathy tone range where bad mistakes are made in offices which cost firms great deal of money lost time and cause other personnel difficulties such mistakes are found rather uniformly to stem from these subapathy people so do not think that one of these states of being unable to feel anything of being dumb of being incapable of pain or joy is any use to anyone it is not person who is in this condition cannot control things and in actuality is not there sufficiently to be controlled by anyone else and does strange and unpredictable things just as person can be chronically in subapathy so person can be in apathy this is dangerous enough but is at least expressed only when we get up into apathy itself do we have the arc triangle beginning to manifest itself and become visible communication from the 29person himself not from some circuit or training pattern is to be expected people can be chronically in grief chronically in fear chronically in anger or in antagonism or boredom or actually can be stuck in enthusiasm person who is truly able is normally fairly serene about things he can however express other emotions it is mistake to believe that total serenity is of any real value when situation which demands tears cannot be cried about one is not in serenity as chronic tone this subapathy can be mistaken rather easily for serenity but of course only by very untrained observer one glance at the physical condition of the person is enough to differentiate people who are in subapathy are normally quite ill just as we have range of the tone scale thus covering the subject of affinity so do we have one for communication on the level of each of the emotions we have communication factor in subapathy an individual is not really communicating at all some social response or training pattern or as we say circuit is communicating the person himself does not seem to be there and isnt really talking therefore his communications are sometimes strange to say the least he does the wrong things at the wrong time he says the wrong things at the wrong time naturally when person is stuck on any of the bands of the tone scale subapathy apathy grief fear anger antagonism boredom enthusiasm or serenity he voices communications with that emotional tone person who is always angry about something is stuck in anger such person is not as bad off as somebody in subapathy but he is still rather dangerous to have around since he will make trouble and person who is angry does not control things well the communication characteristics of people at these various levels on the tone scale are quite fascinating they say things and handle communication each in distinct characteristic fashion for each level of the tone scale just as in affinity and communication there is level of reality for each of the affinity levels reality is an intensely interesting subject since it has to do in the main with relative solids in other words the solidity of things and the emotional tone of people have definite connection people low on the tone scale cannot tolerate solids they cannot tolerate solid object the thing is not real to them it is thin or lacking weight as they come upscale the same object becomes more and more solid and they can finally see it in its true level of solidity in other words these people have definite reaction to mass at various points on the scale things are bright to them or very very dull if you could look through the eyes of the person in subapathy you would see very watery thin dreamy misty unreal world indeed if you looked through the eyes of an angry man you would see world which was menacingly solid where all the solids posed brutality toward him but they still would not be sufficiently solid or sufficiently real or visible for person in good condition person in serenity can see solids as they are as bright as they are and can tolerate an enormous heaviness or solidity without reacting to it in other words as we go up the tone scale from the lowest to the highest things can get more and more solid and more and more real affinity is most closely related to space in fact affinity could be defined as the consideration of distance since terminals which are far apart or close together have different affinity reactions one to another reality as we have seen is most intimately connected with solids communication consists of the flow of ideas or particles across space between solids while these definitions may seem very elementary and would not at all satisfy an mit professor they actually outreach and encompass an mit professors whole field of activity truths do not have to be complicated there are as described at considerable length and studied with considerable depth in scientology many interrelations of spaces and solids and ideas or particles since these are the most intimate things to livingness itself and comprise the universe around us but the most basic thing we should know about arc is simply emotional tone which is affinity the actuality of things which is reality and the relative communication ability concerning them 30men who can do things are very high on affinity very high in terms of reality and are very capable in terms of communication if you wish to measure their various capabilities you should study the subject much further whole book has been written about this triangle called science of survival then how would you talk to man you cannot talk adequately to man if you are in subapathy condition in fact you would not talk to him at all you would have to have little higher affinity than that to discuss things with anyone your ability to talk to any given man has to do with your emotional response to any given man anyone has different emotional responses to different people around him in view of the fact that two terminals or that is to say two people are always involved in communication one could see that someone else would have to be somewhat real if one does not care about other people at all one will have great deal of difficulty talking to them that is certain the way to talk to man then would be to find something to like about him and to discuss something with which he can agree this is the downfall of most new ideas one does not discuss subjects with which the other person has any point of agreement at all and we come to final factor with regard to reality that with which we agree tends to be more real than that with which we do not agree there is definite coordination between agreement and reality those things are real which we agree are real those things are not real which we agree are not real on those things upon which we disagree we have very little reality an experiment based on this would be an even jocular discussion between two men of third man who is present the two men agree on something with which the third man cannot agree the third man will drop in emotional tone and will actually become less real to the two who are discussing him how do you talk to man then you establish reality by finding something with which you both agree then you attempt to maintain as high an affinity level as possible by knowing there is something you can like about him and you are then able to talk with him if you do not have the first two conditions it is fairly certain that the third condition will not be present which is to say you will not be able to talk to him easily you should realize in using the arc triangle that once more the emotional tones are progressed through as one begins to develop communication in other words somewhere up the line somebody who has been totally apathetic about us is liable to become angry at us if one can simply persevere up through this anger he reaches only antagonism then boredom and finally enthusiasm and perfect communication level of understanding marriages fall apart simply because of failure of communication because of failure of reality and affinity when communication starts failing the affinity starts dropping people have secrets from each other and the affinity starts out the bottom similarly in an office or business it is perfectly easy to establish those people who are doing things which are not to the best interests of the firm since these people go gradually and sometimes not so gradually out of communication with the firm their emotional tone towards their superiors and those around them starts dropping and finally goes out the bottom as can be seen the arc triangle is intimately bound up with an ability to control and an ability to leave uncontrolled when an individual attempts to control something and fails to do so he then experiences an antipathy toward that thing in other words he has not been right he has been wrong his intention has failed his intention has you might say backfired upon him thus as one attempts to control things and then fails to control them he is likely to drop down tone scale about those things thus an individual who has been betrayed by the tools of his own trade is apt to treat them with lowering affinity level he becomes bored with them he becomes antagonistic toward them he becomes angry with them and at this stage the machinery begins to break up and finally he becomes afraid of them he becomes sad about them he becomes apathetic about them and longer cares about them at all at this stage he 31certainly cannot use them at all actually from the level of boredom down the ability to use ones tools of the trade is consistently lowered now how could one knowing this raise his ability to control the tools of the trade without even going to scientologist naturally if scientologist took over in this situation the entirety of control of tools or an area or of life could be regained but lacking this how could one simply handle the exact articles with which he is right now and immediately associated by using arc he could regain in some measure both his control of the tools and his enthusiasm for work he would do this by communicating and discovering his willingness for these and the people around him to be real or solid an individual could regain his ability over his immediate tools simply by touching them and letting them go this might seem rather pointless and he is apt to reach the level of boredom and become bored with the process just above this level is the pay of becoming enthusiastic it sounds very strange that if one simply touched his automobile and let go and touched it and let go and touched it and let go and touched it and let go possibly for some hours he would regain not only his enthusiasm for the automobile but tremendous ability to control the car which he had never suspected in himself at all similarly with people since these often object to being touched one can communicate if one really communicates and communicates well to these people listens to what they have to say and acknowledges what they say and says what he has to say to them gently enough and often enough so that it is actually received by them he will regain to very marked degree his ability to associate and coordinate the actions of those people with whom he is immediately surrounded here we have arc immediately adjusted to work it sounds strange that if we made bookkeeper pick up and lay down his pencil or pen for couple of hours he would regain his ability to handle it and would improve in his ability to make figures and that if we got him to touch and let go of his ledger for considerable length of time he would be more capable of handling that ledger and would make far fewer mistakes with it this sounds like magic it is magic it is scientology 32chapter seven exhaustion to work or not to work that is the question the answer to that question in most mens minds is exhaustion one begins to feel after he has been long on job and has been considerably abused on that job that to work any more would be quite beyond his endurance he is tired the thought of doing certain things makes him tired he thinks of raising his energy or of being able to force his way along little bit further and if he does so he is thinking in the wrong channels since the answer to exhaustion has little if anything to do with energy exhaustion is very important subject not only to an individual involved in earning his own living but to the state as well scientology has rather completely established the fact that the downfall of the individual begins when he is longer able to work all it is necessary to do to degrade or upset an individual is to prevent him from working even the police have now come to recognize the basic scientology principle that the primary thing wrong with criminal is that he cannot work and police have begun to look for this factor in an individual in establishing his criminality the basic difficulty with all juvenile delinquency is the onetime apparently humane program of forbidding children to labor in any way doubtless it was once fact that child labor was abused that children were worked too hard that their growths were stunted and that they were in general used it is highly doubtful if the infamous mr marx ever saw in america young boys being pulled off machines dead from work and thrown onto dump heaps where there was an abuse of this matter there was public outcry against it and legislation was enacted to prevent children from working this legislation with all the good intention of the world is however directly responsible for juvenile delinquency forbidding children to work and particularly forbidding teenagers to make their own way in the world and earn their own money creates family difficulty so that it becomes almost impossible to raise family and creates as well and particularly state of mind in the teenager that the world does not want him and he has already lost his game before he has begun it then with something like universal military training staring him in the face so that he dare not start career he is of course thrust into deep subapathy on the subject of work and when he at length is faced with the necessity of making his own way in the world he rises into an apathy and does nothing about it at all it is highly supportive of this fact that our greatest citizens worked usually when they were quite young in the angloamerican civilization the highest level of endeavor was achieved by boys who from the age of 12 on farms had their own duties and had definite place in the world children in the main are quite willing to work two three four year old child is usually to be found haunting his father or her mother trying to help out either with tools or dust rags and the kind parent who is really fond of the children responds in the reasonable and long ago normal manner of being patient enough to let the child actually assist child so permitted then develops the idea that his presence and activity is desired and he quite calmly sets about career of accomplishment the child who is warped or pressed into some career but is not permitted to assist in those early years is convinced that he is not wanted that the world has part of him and later on he will come into very definite difficulties regarding work however the child who at three or four wants to work in this modern society is discouraged and is actually 33prevented from working and after he is made to be idle until seven eight or nine is suddenly saddled with certain chores now this child is already educated into the fact that he must not work and so the idea of work is sphere where he knows he does not belong and so he always feels uncomfortable in performing various activities later on in his teens he is actively prevented from getting the sort of job which will permit him to buy the clothes and treats for his friends which he feels are demanded of him and so he begins to feel he is not part of the society not being part of the society he is then against the society and desires nothing but destructive activities the subject of exhaustion is also the subject of prevented work in the case of soldiers and sailors hospitalized during any one of these recent wars it is found that few months in the hospital tends to break the morale of the soldier or sailor to such point that he may become questionable asset when returned to his service this is not necessarily the result of his lowered abilities it is the result of injury compounded by inactivity soldier who is wounded and cared for in field hospital close to the front and is returned to duty the moment he can possibly support such duties will be found to retain in large measure his morale of course the injury received has tendency to repel him from the level of action which he once thought best but even so he is in better shape than soldier who is sent to hospital in the rear the soldier who is sent to the hospital in the rear is being told according to his viewpoint that he is not particularly necessary to the war without actually adding up these principles the word exhaustion began general use coupled with neurosis this was based on the fact that people with neurosis simply looked exhausted there was more coordination to it than that actually person who has been denied the right to work particularly one who has been injured and then denied the right to work will eventually encounter exhaustion technically in scientology it is discovered that there is such thing as gradual diminishing by continuing contact of the energy of the individual one does not become exhausted simply because one has worked too long or too hard one becomes exhausted when he has worked sufficiently long to restimulate some old injury one of the characteristics of this injury will be exhaustion chronic exhaustion then is not the product of long hours and arduous application it is the product of the accumulation of the shocks and injuries incident to life each of them perhaps only few seconds or few hours long and adding up perhaps to totality of only fifty or seventyfive hours but this accumulation the accumulation of injury repulsion and shock eventually mounts up to complete inability to do anything exhaustion can then be trained into person by refusing to allow him as child to have any part in the society or it can be beaten into person by the various injuries or shocks he may receive incident to his particular activities clear up either of these two points and you have cleared up exhaustion exhaustion then is actually the subject of scientology practitioner since only scientologist can adequately handle it there is point however which is below exhaustion this is the point of not knowing when one is tired an individual can become sort of hectic puppet that goes on working and working without even realizing that he is working at all and suddenly collapses from tiredness he was not experiencing this is our subzero or subapathy tone scale again and again we have the subject of control here the individual has failed to control things has tried and then gone down tone scale about them into the subzero band eventually he is incapable of handling anything even resembling tools of the trade or an environment of work and so is unable to inhabit such an environment or handle such tools the individual can then have many hard words cast in his direction he can be called lazy he can be called bum he can be called criminal but the truth of the matter is he is more capable of righting his own condition without expert help than he is capable of diving to the center of the earth 34there are some means of recovering ones verve and enthusiasm for work short of close work with scientology practitioner these are relatively simple and very easy to understand we have in scientology something we call introversion and something else we call extroversion introversion is simple thing it means looking in too closely and extroversion is also simple thing it means nothing more than being able to look outward it could be said that there are introverted personalities and extroverted personalities an extroverted personality is one who is capable of looking around the environment an introverted personality is only capable of looking inward at himself when we examine the arc tone scale we see at once that an introverted personality is shying away from solids in other words he is not confronting reality reality is agreement in the mental plane and is solids in the physical plane person who is capable of looking at the world around him and seeing it quite real and quite bright is of course in state of extroversion he can look out in other words he can also work he can also see situations and handle and control those things which he has to handle and control and can stand by and watch those things which he does not have to control and be interested in them therefore the person who is introverted is person who has probably passed exhaustion some way back he has had his attention focused closer and closer to him basically by old injuries which are still capable of exerting their influence upon him until he is actually looking inward and not outward he is shying away from solid objects he does not see reality in other people and things around him now let us take the actual subject of work work is the application of attention and action to people or objects located in space when one is longer able to confront people or objects or the space in which they are located he begins to have lost feeling he begins to move in mistiness things are not real to him and he is relatively incapable of controlling those things around him he has accidents he has bad luck he has things turn against him simply because he is not handling them or controlling them or even observing them correctly the future to him seems very bad so bad sometimes that he cannot face it this person could be said to be severely introverted in work his attention is riveted on objects which are usually at the most only few feet from him he pays his closest attention to articles which are within the reach of his hands this puts his attention away from extroversion at least to some spot in focus in front of his face his attention fixes there if this is coincident with some old injury incident or operation he is likely to fix his attention as well on some spot in former times and become restimulated so that he gets the pains and ills and the feeling of tiredness or apathy or subapathy which he had during that moment of injury as his attention is continuously riveted there he of course has tendency to look only there even when he is not working let us take an accountant an accountants eyes are on books at fixed distances from his eyes at length he becomes shortsighted actually he doesnt become shortsighted he becomes booksighted his eyes most easily fix on certain point in distance now as he fixes his attention there he tends to withdraw even from that point until at length he does not quite reach even his own books then he is fitted with glasses so that he can see the books more clearly his vision and his attention are much the same thing person who has machine or books or objects continually at fixed distance from him leaves his work and tends to keep his attention fixed exactly where his work was in other words his attention never really leaves his work at all although he goes home he is still really sitting in the office his attention is still fixed on the environment of his work if this 35environment is coincident with some injury or accident and who does not have one of these at least he begins to feel weariness or tiredness is there cure for this of course only scientology practitioner could clear up this difficulty entirely but the worker does have something which he can do now here is the wrong thing to do regardless of whether one is bookkeeper an accountant clerk an executive or machinist the wrong thing to do is to leave work go home sit down and fix attention on an object more or less at the same distance from one as one confronts continually at work in the case of foreman for instance who is continually talking to men at certain distance away from him the wrong thing for him to do is to go home and talk to his wife at the same distance the next thing she knows she will be getting orders just as though she were member of the shop definitely the wrong thing to do is to go home and sit down and read paper eat some dinner and go to bed if man practiced the routine of working all day and then sitting down to rest with book or newspaper in the evening it is certain that sooner or later he would start to feel quite exhausted and then after while would fall even below that and would not even wonder at his unwillingness to perform tasks which were once very easy to him is there right thing to do yes there is an individual who is continually fixed upon some object of work should fix his attention otherwise after working hours now here is process known as take walk this process is very easy to perform when one feels tired on finishing his work matter if the thought of doing so is almost all that he can tolerate without falling through the floor he should go out and walk around the block until he feels rested in short he should walk around the block and look at things until he sees the things he is walking near it does not matter how many times he walked around the block he should walk around the block until he feels better in doing this it will be found that one will become little brighter at first and then will become very much more tired he will become sufficiently tired that he knows now that he should go to bed and have good nights sleep this is not the time to stop walking since he is walking through exhausted he is walking out his exhausted he is not handling the exhaustion by physical exercise the physical exercise has always appeared to be the more important factor to people but the exercise is relatively unimportant the factor that is important is the unfixing of his attention from his work to the material world in which he is living masses are reality to increase ones affinity and communication it is actually necessary to be able to confront and tolerate masses therefore walking around the block and looking at buildings will be found to bring one upscale when one is so tired that he can barely drag himself around or is so tired that he is hectically unable to rest at all it is actually necessary that he confront masses he is simply low on the tone scale it is even doubtful if there is such thing as fall of physical energy naturally there is limit to this process one cannot work all day and walk around the block all night and go to work the next day again and still expect to feel relieved but one should certainly spend some time extroverting after having introverted all day take walk is within reason near cureall if one feels antagonistic towards ones wife the wrong thing to do is to beat her the right thing to do is to go out and take walk around the block until one feels better and make her walk around the block in the opposite direction until an extroversion from the situation is achieved it will be discovered that all domestic quarrels particularly amongst working people stem from the fact that having been overfixed rather than overstrained on ones work and the situations connected with it one has failed to control certain things in his working environment he then comes home and seeks to find something he can control this is usually the marital partner or the children and when one fails even there he is apt to drop down scale with vengeance 36the extroversion of attention is as necessary as the work itself there is nothing really wrong with introverting attention or with work if one didnt have something to be interested in he would go to pieces entirely but if one works it will be found that an unnatural tiredness is apt to set in when this is found to be the case then the answer to this is not drop into unconsciousness for few hours as in sleep but in actually extroverting the attention and then getting really relaxing sleep these principles of extroversion and introversion have many ramifications and although take walk is almost laughable in its simplicity there are many more complicated processes in case one wished to get more complicated however in the main take walk will take care of an enormous number of difficulties attendant to work remember that when doing it one will get more tired at first and will then get fresher this phenomenon has been noted by athletes it is called the second wind the second wind is really getting enough environment and enough mass in order to run out the exhausted of the last race there is such thing as second wind there is such thing as return to extroversion on the physical world in which one lives similar to take walk is another process known as look them over if one has been talking to people all day has been selling people all day or has been handling people who are difficult to handle all day the wrong thing to do is to run away from all the people there are in the world you see the person who gets overstrained when handling people has had large difficulties with people he has perhaps been operated upon by doctors and the halfseen vision of them standing around the operating table identifies all people with doctors that is to say all people who stand still this by the way is one of the reasons why doctors become so thoroughly hated in society since they do insist on practices known as surgery and anaesthesia and such incidents become interlocked with everyday incidents exhaustion because of contact with people actually necessitates that the havingness another scientology term for reality of people has been reduced ones attention has been fixated upon certain people while his attention he felt ought to be on other people and this straining of attention has actually cut down the number of people that he was observing fixed attention then upon few people can actually limit the number of people one can have which is to say limits ones reality on people in general the cure for this is very simple one one should go to place that is very well populated such as railroad station or main street and should simply walk along the street noting people simply look at people that is all it will be found after while that one feels people arent so bad and one has much kinder attitude towards them and more importantly the job condition of becoming overstrained with people tends to go away if one makes practice of doing this every late afternoon for few weeks this is one of the smartest things that salesman can do since salesman above and beyond others has vested interest in being able to handle people and get them to do exactly what he wants them to do that is buy what he has to sell as he fixes his attention on just one too many customers he gets tired of the whole idea of talking to people or selling and goes down tone scale in all of his activities and operations and begins to consider himself all kinds of swindler and at length doesnt consider himself anything at all he like the others should simply find populated places and walk along looking at people he will find after while that people really do exist and that they arent so bad one of the things that happens to people in high government is that they are being continually protected from the people and they at length become quite disgusted with the whole subject and are apt to do all manner of strange things see the lives of hitler and napoleon this principle of extroversion and introversion could go much further in society than it does there is something that could be done by the government and by businesses in general which would probably eradicate the idea of strikes and would increase production quite markedly workers on strike are usually discontented not so much with the conditions of work 37but with work itself they feel they are being victimized they are being pressed into working at times when they do not want to work and strike comes as an actual relief they can fight something they can do something else than stand there and fiddle with piece of machinery or account books dissatisfied workers are striking workers if people become exhausted at work if people are not content with work if people are upset with work they can be counted upon to find sufficient number of grievances to strike and if management is given enough trouble and lack of cooperation on the part of the people on the lower chains of command it can be certain that management sooner or later will create situations which cause workers to strike in other words bad conditions of work are actually not the reason for labor troubles and disputes weariness of work itself or an inability to control the area and environments of work are the actual cause of labor difficulties any management given sufficient income to do so if that management is not terribly aberrated will pay decent working wage and any workman given half chance will perform his duties cheerfully but once the environment itself becomes overstrained once the company itself has become introverted by overt acts on the part of the government once the workers have been shown that they have control over management there can be after that labor disputes underlying all these obvious principles however are the principles of introversion and extroversion workers become so introverted at their tasks that they longer are capable of affinity for their leaders and are longer capable actually of viewing the environment in which they work therefore someone can come along and tell them that all the executives are ogres which is obviously not true and on the executive level someone can come along and tell the executives that all the workers are ogres which is obviously on that side not true either in the absence of broad treatment on individuals which is gargantuan task full program could be worked out that would handle the principle of introversion it is certain that if workers or managers get introverted enough they will then find ways and means of inventing aberrated games such as strikes and so disrupt production and decent relationships and living conditions within the factory the office or the concern the cure would be to extrovert workers on very broad scale this could be done as one solution by making it possible for all workers to have two jobs it would be necessary for the company or related interests such as the government to make available sufficient number of public works projects to provide work for workers outside the sphere of exact application in other words man who is made to work continually inside and at very fixed task would find considerable relief at being able to go outside and work particularly at some disrelated task as an example it would be considerable relief to an accountant to be able to dig ditches for while machinist running stationary machine would actually find it very joyful experience to push around bulldozer such plan then would actually take introversion and extroversion with large hand and bring it about workers who are working in fixed positions with their attention very close to them would then be permitted to look more widely and to handle things which tended to extrovert them such program would be very ambitious but it would be found it is certain to result in better labormanagement relations better production and considerable lessening of working and public tension on the subjects of jobs and pay in short there are many things that could be done with the basic principle of extroversionintroversion the principle is very simple when an individual is made too introverted things become less real in his surroundings and he has less affinity for them and cannot communicate with them well furthermore what does communicate is apt to communicate at his lowered tone scale so that even good news will be poorly received by him in such condition he becomes tired easily introversion results in weariness exhaustion and then an inability to work the remedy for it is extroversion good look at and communication with the wider environment and unless this is practiced then in view of the fact that any worker is subject to injuries or illnesses of one kind or another dwindling spiral will ensue 38which makes work less and less palatable until at length it cannot be performed at all and we have the basis of not only nonproductive but criminal society 39chapter eight the man who succeeds the conditions of success are few and easily stated jobs are not held consistently and in actuality by flukes of fate or fortune those who depend upon luck generally experience bad luck the ability to hold job depends in the main upon ability one must be able to control his work and must be able to be controlled in doing his work one must be able as well to leave certain areas uncontrolled ones intelligence is directly related to his ability there is such thing as being too smart but there is such thing as being too stupid but one may be both able and intelligent without succeeding vital part of success is the ability to handle and control not only ones tools of the trade but the people with whom one is surrounded in order to do this one must be capable of very high level of affinity he must be able to tolerate massive realities and he must also be able to give and receive communication the ingredients of success are then first an ability to confront work with joy and not honor wish to do work for its own sake not because one has to have paycheck one must be able to work without driving oneself or experiencing deep depths of exhausted if one experiences these things there is something wrong with him there is some element in his environment that he should be controlling that he isnt controlling or his accumulated injuries are such as to make him shy away from all people and masses with whom he should be in intimate contact the ingredients of successful work are training and experience in the subject being addressed good general intelligence and ability capability of high affinity tolerance of reality and the ability to communicate and receive ideas given these things there is left only slim chance of failure given these things man can ignore all of the accidents of birth marriage or fortune for birth marriage and fortune are not capable of placing these necessary ingredients in ones hands one could have all the money in the world and yet be unable to perform an hours honest labor such man would be miserably unhappy one the person who studiously avoids work usually works far longer and far harder than the man who pleasantly confronts it and does it men who cannot work are not happy men work is the stable datum of this society without something to do there is nothing for which to live man who cannot work is as good as dead and usually prefers death and works to achieve it the mysteries of life are not today with scientology very mysterious mystery is not needful ingredient only the very aberrated man desires to have vast secrets held away from him scientology has slashed through many of the complexities which have been erected for men and has bared the core of these problems scientology for the first time in mans history can predictably raise intelligence increase ability bring about return of the ability to play game and permits man to escape from the dwindling spiral of his own disabilities therefore work itself can become game pleasant and happy thing there is one thing which has been learned in scientology which is very important to the state of mind of the workman one very often feels in his society that he is working for the immediate paycheck and that he does not gain for the whole society anything of any importance he does not know several things one of these is how few good workmen are on the level of executives it is interesting to note how precious any large company finds man who can handle and control jobs and men really is such people are rare all the empty space in the structure of this workaday world is at the top 40and there is another thing which is quite important and that is the fact that the world today has been led to believe by mental philosophies calculated to betray them that when one is dead it is all over and done with and that one has further responsibility for anything it is highly doubtful if this is true one inherits tomorrow what he died out of yesterday another thing we know is that men are not dispensable it is mechanism of old philosophies to tell men that if they think they are indispensable they should go down to the graveyard and take look those men were indispensable too this is the surest foolishness if you really looked carefully in the graveyard you would find the machinist who set the models going in yesteryear and without whom there would be industry today it is doubtful if such feat is being performed just now workman is not just workman laborer is not just laborer an office worker is not just an office worker they are living breathing important pillars on which the entire structure of our civilization is erected they are not cogs in mighty machine they are the machine itself we have come to low level of the ability to work offices depend very often on more than one or two men and the additional staffs seem to add only complexity to the activities of the scene countries move forward on the production of just few factories it is as though the world were being held together by handful of desperate men who by working themselves to death may keep the rest of the world going but again they may not it is to them that this book is dedicated 41first aid if somebody is injured you can assist in many ways recovery from burn or bruise or even sprains or breaks is much swifter with scientology assists the most elementary assist is easily done for ages man has known that laying on of hands or mothers kiss was effective therapy even gripping in pain an injured member seems to help but man neglected the most important part of laying on of hands this follows do this exactly and do it with minimum of talk place your index finger or fingers or palm on the injured member very lightly and say to the person put your attention on my hand now change the position of your finger or palm and have the person do it again it is best to touch the individual on spots which are further from his head than the injury do not talk excessively but coax him as you touch briefly spot after spot to put his attention on your finger or fingers or palm change the spot every moment or two be calm be reassuring if the person experiences pain or trembling as result keep on for the assist is working continue in this fashion for many minutes or half an hour if necessary until pain or upset is gone during this assist the person has his eyes closed it is not power from your finger which is aiding him it is power he generates by looking at your finger down through his body you are putting him into communication with the injury his communication with it brings about the recovery ordinarily injuries sprains burns scalds broken bones headaches and colds heal slowly because the individual is avoiding this area with his own energy 42pab 103 professional

the doctors new conscience in look magazine december 11 1956 you see they arent completely bravethe amas proposed principles of medical ethics these principles are intended to serve physicians individually or collectively as guide to ethical conduct they are not laws rather they are standards by which physician may determine the propriety of his own conduct they are intended to aid physicians in their relationship with patients with colleagues with members of allied professions and with the public to maintain under god as they have through the ages the highest moral standards l the prime objective of the medical profession is to render service to humanity with full respect for both the dignity of man and the rights of patients physicians must merit the confidence of those entrusted to their care rendering to each full measure of service and devotion 2 physicians should strive continuously to improve their medical knowledge and skill and should make available the benefits of their professional attainments 3 physician should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma or sectarian system nor should he associate voluntarily with those who indulge in such practices 4 the medical profession must be safeguarded against members deficient in moral character and professional competence physicians should observe all laws uphold the dignity and honor of the profession and accept its selfimposed disciplines they should expose without hesitation illegal or unethical conduct of fellow members of the profession 5 except in emergencies physician may choose whom he will serve having undertaken the care of patient the physician may not neglect him unless he has been discharged he may discontinue his services only after having given adequate notice he should not solicit patients 6 physician should not dispose of his services under terms or conditions which will interfere with or impair the free and complete exercise of his independent medical judgment and skill or cause deterioration of the quality of medical care 7 in the practice of medicine physician should limit the source of his professional income to medical services actually rendered by him to his patient 8 physician should seek consultation in doubtful or difficult cases upon request or when it appears that the quality of medical service may be enhanced thereby 9 confidence entrusted to physicians or deficiencies observed in the disposition or character of patients during the course of medical attendance should not be revealed except as required by law or unless it becomes necessary in order to protect the health and welfare of the individual or the community 10 the responsibilities of the physician extend not only to the individual but also to society

and the world was simple thing it was all very very simple and then one day somebody told him he was simple and ever since that time he has been trying to prove that he is not and that is the history of the universe the human race the fifth invaders the fourth invaders the 312 invaders the people on mars saturn jupiter arcturus the markab galaxy the markab system the psi galaxy galaxy 82 i dont care where you lookthats the story only its too simple story much too simple story because thetan would have to admit he was simple if he understood it l r hhubbard communications office hco training bulletin of 6 february 1957 the following procedure is not for general release to the field and is to be released only to organizational staff the reason it is not being generally released to the field is that very few auditors have the skill necessary to run these techniques the entirety of this will be released somewhat modified and much more expanded some time in the future and forms the backbone of book therefore i will appreciate your courtesy in not releasing these techniques to anyone but keeping them in the clinic until the book can be written since you will scoop if you do not and the book will have that much less meaningfulness and appeal the reason i am releasing these at this moment is that we need them and we have every right to use them but i do not wish them to be generally released since they are actually so powerful that an auditor who is badly schooled would not be able to handle them at all on preclears he is better off using that in which he has been trained it will take book to get him totally oriented on this subject procedure cch this procedure has two forms it has the long form and the short form the long form is omitted here since it is not necessary in any broad number of cases and the short form is entirely right out through the top the name cch is taken from communicationcontrolhavingness these are the immediate exercise targets of this procedure the goal of this procedure is to take the preclear from as far south as preclears can be reached straight on through as far north as preclear can be pushed therefore the breadth of procedure cch is much greater than any other auditing procedure ever released this procedure is covered rather adequately in the long series of lectures of the 1 6th acc which specifically cover technique this does not mean the entirety of the 16th acc lectures it means that section of the 16th acc lectures which was immediately addressed to technique study of these lectures is recommended before extensive use of procedure cch is engaged upon in the clinics copies of these lectures are being made available to washington and london the goal of the auditor is to discover an ability in the preclear and improve it the first discoverable ability of preclear is communication in one form or another this even applies to person in comatose state such person quite ordinarily responds to tactile if you do not expect him to acknowledge he is not able to acknowledge our communication to him by tactile since he at first cannot sufficiently or adequately control the body in order to make the reply hpahca processes group 1 communication processes taught in indoctrination parts of communication look at who am l b hand contact mimicry commands put your hands against mine then mimic and contribute to the motion of my hands acknowledge when the preclear hascompleted the command then say put your hands in your lap then the auditor does the same repeat this process c hand mimicry gradient scale of spaces hand mimicry is run the same as hand contact mimicry with the following changes in the commands put your hands up facing mine with about one inch distance between your hands and mine then mimic and contribute to the motions of my hands while maintaining the same distance between our hands acknowledge then put your hands in your lap auditor then puts his hands in his lap when this level of the process is flat the auditor then puts more space between himself and the preclear on gradient scale and changes the distance part of the command accordingly use gradient scale to limit of 3 feet d mirror image hand mimicry the commands are put your hands up facing mine mimic my commands mirrorwise that is when i move my hand back you move your hand back on the same side of the body and when i move my hands forward you move your hands forward correspondingly good put your hands in your lap full body mimicry the auditor picks two spaces in the auditing room marking them out with chairs or other objects or using the rug one space is for the preclear and the other for the auditor the auditor explains to the preclear as follows i am going to step into my space and deliver command to you which will consist of series of body positions when i have finished executing this command i will step out of the space you are then without any further command on my part to step into your space and mimic the command i have given when you have finished doing that then you step out of that space and that will be the end of that command the process is then repeated if the preclear is not doing good job of mimicking the auditor or is thrown into inordinately long communication lags the process may be run with the auditor stepping into his space and giving the command while at the same time the preclear steps into his space and mimics the command that is to say the command is executed simultaneously by the auditor and the preclear instead of the auditor first executing it and then the preclear following it with mimic group ii locationcontrol processes parts of control locational locate the __ the auditor has the preclear locate the floor the ceiling the walls the furniture in the room and other objects and bodies b connectedness look around here and find something you wouldnt mind making connect with you make sure while running this process that the preclear is making causing things to connect with him rather than he connecting with the things if he connects with the things it is nogames condition it is important that this be stressed in the session c 8c solids do you see that ____over there good walk over to it good touch it good now make it little more solid good let go of____ good the process is then repeated with the auditor selecting the object each time d scs i am going to tell you to start the body then i want you to start the body all right start the body if the preclear has started the body he acknowledges the execution of the command the auditor then repeats this process note these commands must be used exactly and be duplicated by the auditor you should also get the preclears agreement to do it each time the change portion of scs is runas follows the auditor picks and arranges with the preclear the location of three spots in the room the auditor then designates these spots as spot spot b and spot c and has the preclear stand in one of them the command duplicated each time is as follows im going to tell you to change the body from spot ___ to spot___ then you change the body from___to___ okay when the preclear indicates that he has heard this and understood the auditor then gives the command change the body from___to___ spots b and c may be chosen by the auditor in any order the stop portion of scs is run as follows im going to tell you to get the body moving in that direction the auditor indicates direction across the room i then want you to get the body moving and somewhere along the line ill tell you to stop i then want you to stop the body when the preclear has stopped his body the auditor then acknowledges and repeats the process and commands as in the previous two the auditor always duplicates the commands and gets the agreement of the preclear to make sure that he has started changed and stopped the body himself while running the above three processes group iii duplication processes opening procedure by duplication go over to the___ look at it pick it up what is its colour what is its temperature what is its weight put it down in exactly the same place the preclear obeys each command and answers each question in turn the auditor then says indicating the other object go over to the___ look at it pick it up what is its colour what is its temperature what is its weight put it down in exactly the same place the auditor using the same words same objects and the same formula over and over again this process must be run with good arc at all times and with good duplication of the commands and with good control b keep it from going away the auditor asks the preclear to select number of objects in the room which appear real to the preclear the auditor then selects two of these objects these objects should be of size that is easy to handle with the hands and of significance as nonrestimulative as possible to the preclear the auditor then selects two of these objects and places them either on table in front of the preclear within easy reach and with some distance between them or else on the arms of the preclears chair one object on each arm the commands of the process are pick up the___ good keep it from going away good when the preclear has kept it from going away for at least an instant and with certainty the auditor then says put it back exactly where you found it good the auditor then says indicating the other object pick up the___ good keep it from going away good put it back exactly where you found it good the process is repeated c hold it still the commands for this process and the execution of it are the same as the process keep it from going away with the following exceptions the command hold it still is used in place of the command keep it from going away group iv havingness processes objective havingness terrible trio look around here and find something you would be willing to have look around here and find something

_____________________________________________________________________ 15 february 1957 good processes prepared from the research papers of l ron hubbard the material in recent pabs much of it has come from an lrh research paper that still contains material not covered on some modern processes and general theory of primary value in the research paper it is given in extremely staccato fashion as the paper was the basis for conferences where the material could be expanded here is some more of the material the best processes are those which fastest convert unknowing games conditions to knowing games conditions this does not disregard the fact that ones goal of processing might be at very far reach the static nogames conditions do describe the static and various harmonics of the static the nogames conditions list does not anywhere describe workable processing tools games conditions and games conditions only do that here are some of those fastest processes control start change and stop on objects or preclears body emphasis on stop why emphasis on stop it has long been known in scientology see scientology 880 that the ability to hold points locations masses and objects including bodies in space at ones own direction and choice is the essence of control without the ability to fix locations in space there is self determinism where one is concerned with the physical universe he collapses if he cannot hold space the exact commands and procedure of control processes are contained in recent pabs as well as in early bulletins to be released the effectiveness of any processing is as great as the extreme of good control is exercised by the auditor corollary to this is that how well one lives life is measured by the extent of his good control of the things within his actual boundaries of interest fight the wall this is very fascinating process the auditor makes he has to make him the preclear fight the wall bodily since there is accepted social behavior in man on this subject the way that preclear will do this process varies somewhat wildly what his running of the process does is to bring him up to confrontingness of walls and environment it does this through exercising games condition fighting and causing the preclear to exercise this games condition knowingly it is not designed to 7 nor does it run out the preclears ability to fight the total command is having directed the preclears attention to wall fight the wall you dont tell them how to fight it you tell them to fight it the amount of bruised knuckles and holes in plaster can be cut down by providing the preclear with mattress or other protector and it works just as well the purpose of the process is not damage although preclears are known to go into fighting walls with peculiar enthusiasmthis can also be run by mockups but not as substitute for making the preclear use his body do not make thinkingness process of this it is doingness and confrontingness process it can be run outdoors on trees etc as well as in the auditing room opponents the main thing about opponents is that there are not enough of them an opponent is games condition have the preclear tell lies about the subject of opponents that is good process have the preclear invent opponents of these two invent is best but lie is lower harmonic of invent and can be run all the way south when opponents become scarce to an individual they become so precious and valuable that he will neither confront have nor let go of anything he considers to be one he will fight himself and do all sorts of things but he will not do these things he becomes extremely aberrated on this point and will attempt to discover enemies or find out or some such thing this is compulsive games condition with unknownness havingness is extremely poor on such an individual the exact commands are tell lie about an opponent tell lie about opponents invent an opponent individuality lot is said about individuality indeed it is highly important subject either individuality is very bad thing and causes human troubles is very good thing or it is games condition the truth is that individuality is an aberration and games condition it therefore good or bad processes whereas namelessness unidentifiedness does not an extreme or exaggerated view on the subject of individuality is havingness upset and contains unknowingness knowingness about identity includes awareness of game good process is invent an individuality that would impress people run it for all eight dynamics examples invent an individuality that would impress animals invent an individuality that would impress god cant have an interesting little creative processing process is mock up mock up and then say that bodies cant have it or say that your body cant have it further use of this is to say that the mest universe cant have it auditors call this escape processing effect lie about an effect you are having examples im not having any effect from my tooth im not having any effect from that wall or that wall is giving some money lie about an effect you are having on any dynamic problems problems must be handled in auditing never leave the present time problem unhandled this does not mean that the problem is flat when the preclear says he now knows what to do about it or can solve it etc the problem is not flat until he can tolerate it solved or not solved if he must solve it then he is not able to tolerate the problem and it is not flat people think that all problems or some problems must be solved they think this because they cannot tolerate or confront the problems problems are processed by invent problem of comparable magnitude to the problem until preclear can have the problem undercutting the above is having the preclear tell lies about the problem inventing problems of comparable magnitude must each time be questioned as to how could that be problem to you another process related to problems is consequences of solutions since problem not confronted persists and confronted does not persist then preclears can discover that they have been not solving problems because they were scarcesolids what are you looking at make it solid what are you looking at etc vacuums vacuum is supercold object which if brought into contact with bank drinks bank objects at 25f or less have high electrical capacitance low resistance this was psychiatry before earth shocks ether can act similarly this is how one mechanically forgets the past he depends on pictures loses pictures to vacuum incident vacuums drink up the preclears havingness they are just incidents and they are brainwashing you encounter these running solids opponents individualities more solids problems undo them restimulation when one violates games condition intends to have an effect on something and doesnt one often puts the effect on the body one thus gets noeffect on opponent makes an effect on self this is restimulation it is also stimulusresponse effect you could have on people preclears any dynamic remedies this the condition of selfauditing while auditing is the above restimulation the same process resolves it to split valences term that really makes psychiatrist feel like somebody is schizo their nickname for the schizophrenic it is an odd misnomer in that it means split personality and the trouble with schizo is that he needs splitting not that hes split hes in anothers valence and what is required is to remove or split the preclear out of that others valence steps series of steps rather than single process or command worked best by test at the hubbard guidance center and the london hasi clinic 1 get the preclear under control with startchangestop lots of it this cant be slid over or brushed through carelessly the total reason for getting the preclear under good control is that he is under bad control or he wouldnt be preclear even though the bad control is his own though it is his own it is not knowing the auditors job is to make the preclear causative throughout the preclear must be cause toward all things in the session the control by the auditor is necessary because left to his own devices as he has been for aeons the preclear will be effect of his reactive bank pictures circuits and figure figure the one thing of course that the preclear is effect of in session and not causative toward is the auditing the auditor pandetermines the whole thing 2 unjam the track with what are you looking at make it solid anything jamming sticking holding the track time can be run as valence in the following steps examples could be mother dog book machine town house gun etc you can readily see in this command make it solid that the preclear is being cause toward the thing or person it is of considerable relief to the preclear 3 choose valence or valences weakest universe preferred at this point skill comes into great demand the obvious here would be usually the correct valence to run obvious to the auditor it wont be obvious to the preclear for example the weakest universe would be to the preclear the one that gives trouble he never gets bothered or upset about that person he never even thinks about that person or when he does it is only with the mildest feelings why because hes wearing the head of that person hes looking from not at if you find you have picked the wrong valence to run go back to 1 and choose again at 3 4 what would interest universe so chosen run this flat 5 invent an opponent of comparable magnitude to you are getting games condition here scarcity of opponents is the stickiest condition there is in human relations run this until preclear does it well and comm lag is flat 6 what would get the attention of here the preclear will name or invent things that would get the attention of the universe being run what you know about the service facsimile will apply here run it out this way what would get the attention of 7 look around here and find something that cant have answers must be things physically observable in the auditing environment this must be run very very flat key process 8 what could you protect from this actually could be run as above having the preclear look around the room and find what he could protect____from however if 7 has been run flat as pancake it can be run as subjective process as given 9 what communication could you prevent from originating you will see that this gives the preclear games condition and an opponent it isnt flat when the preclear is still giving answers from the bank he should make some 10 problems of comparable magnitude the command is invent problem of comparable magnitude to this is an important process note that it has to be flattened well and that it is not flat when the preclear says he feels better about it or will handle it it is flat when the preclear can have the problem does not have to solve it could have it permit it to remain or dispense with it problems games condition solutions nogame condition 11 invent game you could play with this lighthearted little process is dynamite dont neglect it run it on the preclear and youll see what highlevel process looks like when it really bites it will bite if you have properly run the preceding ten steps 12 make fight the wall this is done of course with mockups until the preclear does them extremely well and with full control of the mockups and comm lag is flat 13 run 4 to 12 again to check this procedure cleans up universes and valences when running this keep the preclear at it and do not lapse into discussion or excessive twoway comm aside from the processes themselves use twoway communication in delivering the process to the preclear not in getting the preclear to deliver the bank to the auditor this is lot of processes for one bulletin but we can include more detailed material on these in future pabs5410c20 8acc14 the parts of man this is discussion of the parts of man as understood through r261 and r262 the parts of man are related to overts and motivators this is because thetan as such cannot be harmed and therefore cannot receive motivator so he would have to have confusion of identity to receive motivator man consists of four distinct separate though related parts 1 thetan 2 body 3 thetan machinery 4 reactivesomatic mind dianetics covers the first four dynamics even the first dynamic can be split into these four parts when you thought you were treating the first dynamic you were actually treating the third the absolute book 1 clear would be the awareness of awareness unit around the end of 1951 lrh mentions that erasure of all facsimiles would result in demolishment of the body see advanced procedures and axioms in book 1 we were talking about engrams of this lifetime erasing these would give relative clear the only trouble was that the awareness of awareness unit after few years of this research kept insisting on exteriorizing and it turned out to be the person himself if he felt bad when he was out sort of with character he is not stabilized so the first dynamic is the awareness of awareness unit as modified by various things pieces of thetan machinery are his creations hidden and forgotten by him all the energy used by the machines really comes from the thetan though for randomity he may consider that he needs to eat to keep on going he can also understand something from someone else add it to his own machinery and blame someone for giving him machine the thetan invests the body with characteristics then he is afraid of losing these characteristics but this is really problem he can invest himself with these characteristics the thetan can also duplicate himself he can create new different life unit with full determinism power personality etc it could have more power than he if it is set up that way sex is the supercondensed manytimesviad activity of creating other life forms it is only more complex because it is considered to be the thetan actually needs system to create living being thetan machinery is not intended to have life of its own but sometimes the thetan endows machinery with life in dmsmh lrh talks of the possibility of setting the mind alongside the body this was misinterpreted worst in etherapy one can do this and get himself haunted by living beings he can create them then go off and leave them this is basic life multiplication 1d creating 3d through 2d so mankind could have one common ancestor it would not make that one superior however since the offspring could just as well be the superior ones furthermore an individual could just repostulate himself back into his creative unit and thus disappear especially since in reality there is time all one could lose would be the knowingness that he had done it one would have to shut that off for oneself now do you think you understand valence little better having multiplied himself often an individual had laid aside this ability begun to hang on to the only one computation and is holding his ability to be himself closely to himself he tries hard to maintain an identity as 1d he becomes too involved in his own agreements andthinks he needs sex to create being but even that creates only body which is the granted beingness of many individualities based upon one individuality that started that genetic line the thetan got so complex with all his machinery and so interlocked with so many other individualities he granted so much beingness in all directions that he forgot who and what he was and just knew he was supposed to be this identity and repeat the manufactured creation of this identity this would make him solid and his machinery would have composited at this point he would be body and his machinery would become the reactivesomatic mind the thetan gets so solid as body that he can be taken over and controlled by another thetan and his machines the reactive mind that goes along with body cannot be controlled unless another thetan comes along and takes over the body however the body can control the reactive mind there is difference between the reactive and the somatic mind thetan can create another thetan from this we can get species which implies other species hence 5th dynamic thetans are generally not as anxious to control animal bodies as human bodies since mens affairs are complex enough to be interesting to control so animals are generally body reactive mind condensed thetan machinery by addressing the alterised complexity as in psychotherapy we would never get an asis ness but just more mass the auditor thus must address the right part the thetan otherwise he might as well try to process rock as body the rock is more complex being denser therefore it has more vias on the comm lines the distance from cause to effect in rock has so many vias and complexities in it that it loses both cause and effect for the rock the impulse towards religion in most people is to discover basic cause however it leads them to go through vias which gets them lost the way to find cause is to find the highest level of freedom assume it and then know because you will be cause and will therefore be capable of being an effect as processing improves we find that the better we understand something the better we can control it and the less need to process it so that it can be controlled so in modern scientology and dianetics it is only necessary to knock out the factors you dont want to process because you understand them well enough to control them the first of these is the reactive mind there is sense in processing it since we know how to control it also theres use in processing the body medicine will take care of that machinery is interesting but its not necessary so were left with only the thetan to process and we process the thetan just enough so that he can take control of his other parts having recognized them right thought as in christian science would work fine if you had clear to begin with the christian scientists have limits on what right thought is but actually right thought is optimum survival on all dynamics so in processing we can start with be three feet back of your head for those who dont respond to that the overtmotivator sequence is good place to start its the mechanical process by which thetan becomes solid enough to be body surrounded by his machinery which has become the bank behind the overtmotivator sequence lies the consideration that matches the overt and motivator you must be downstairs from pandeterminism to self determinism for this to happen justifier is the mockup or overt act demanded by person guilty of an unmotivated act it is something nonexistent as an effort to justify the unmotivated act its false motivator theres nothing really wrong with the motivatorovert sequence it balances out one gets insane or even hurt by it but the unmotivated act justifier sequence is the villain thus the thetan is doomed because he can never really receive motivator thats the whole reason for the dwindling spiral thetan can never be harmed but he can consider hes been harmed act harmed and dwindle everything the pc tells you is search for justifier his search through his bank quickly asises his few true motivators so he has too many overts and must get himself sick downtrodden and betrayed motivator hunger he gives justifiers and pretends theyre motivatorsthe way you could get him into this dwindling spiral is to define harm for him this gets into good and evil r261 and r262 it only requires the consideration that harm can take place to set off the unmotivated actjustifier sequence you just get this consideration from yourself person must have intended harmful destruction and succeeded to define the concept harmful for himself only when someone destroys something hes created does he define harm for the other fellow he had to do it first himself because he had to communicate first to be communicated to since otherwise he couldnt have been located any solidity or departure from the static is lie the way we depart from the absolute truth of static is via the lies of justifiers this is the source of all inabilitys and deficiencies the thetan also has an anxiety about creating an effect another thetan can never get motivator thetan knows he can never receive an effect except as he considers it and agrees so he knows he can never create an effect on another thetan so he must consider life units as solids he gets upset when he considers them thetans hence people turn away from scientology because they are afraid of exterior beings the thetan wants to create an effect but cant without being guilty of an unmotivated act all he had to do to get messed up was to discover he could harm others he then tried to justify his unmotivated acts and got solid and his whole past track would be nearly all hallucination the insane pack along an enormous number of mocked up facsimiles justifiers pictures of things that never occurred good violent fast way to handle this state of affairs is to have the pc mock up things that anything on the seventh dynamic could do to him this remedies his havingness motivator hunger you can actually use all dynamics another process the pc spots all the spots where he or anyone considered that harm could be or had been done r261 and r262 in creation of human abilitypab 107 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 3537 fitzroy street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 1 march 1957 specific for terror stomach there is specific process which goes this way you ask the preclear to put into the six sides of the room the four walls the ceiling and the floor in regular order the statement to him or to some part of his body this means go to and the preclear furnishes the location he does this with each wall the floor and the ceiling in rotation now you had better let him have the walls etc first of all say it to him then after while say it to his body now the next time round you get him to put into the walls etc this means dont go to then the next time we go around to this means go to and finally we get this thing flat these commands are run in alternation until it seems fairly flat now the reason why you ask him to supply the name of the location each time is simply to see how his communication lag is coming along if you didnt ask him to add the name you would not see his comm lag when you ask him to originate location this puts little stopper on the line now when we have that pair of commands fairly flat we go on into the next pair this means stay in is completed with all the six sides of the room and the alternation command in this case is this means dont stay in and we run these alternately covering the six sides of the room each time now of course this is essentially the anatomy of the confusionthe confusion basically of person doing or trying to do two things at once so we get him to sort out the stable data this is technique which has been with us for some time it is what we call one of our specifics and it is specific for terror stomach now this is something for you to have because these terror stomachs can cause you some difficulty for instance one of the commonest things that you find in prison work or in people who are under pressure from the police in one way or another is the terror stomach with some people just the thought of possibly being arrested would turn one on now just why the police are the commonest restimulator of the terror stomach lies of course on the back track the stomach is guilty of the overt act of eating it is continuously guilty of this act and becomes quite frantic on the whole subject of being incarcerated this is rather funny because the stomach is already incarcerated and is continually incarceratingit puts food into jail three times day and so we get police putting somebody away as being the commonest restimulator of the terror stomach terror stomach is simply confusion in high degree of restimulation in the vicinity of the vagus nerve this is one of the larger nerves and it goes into agitation under this restimulation now medical science has already solved this already knows how to take care of it they simply cut the vagus nervethat it brings on fairly early death and completely disrupts the entirety of the gastric system is of course not considered it is comparable with electric shock which incidentally is almost uniformly followed by an early strokenow here we have specific and this somatic has not had any alleviation from any other process prior to spring 1956 at that time some other processes came in which are to some degree faster but they have not yet been tested on terror stomach with any thoroughness they are more powerful but they have not been thoroughly tested against this specific somatic with good auditing and good communication we can apparently at any tone level seem to be able to use this process successfully this is quite remarkable the terror stomach flattens out and if it does recur it will be quite minor but the preclear should be warned about this so that if it does recur he can come in again to see the auditor who can continue the process and flatten it further it is specific and for long time i figured out the confusion of where to go and where to stay and figured out the disenfranchisement of the game somewhat disenfranchisement brought about condition of confusion which was best expressed in the stomach evidently we can handle that today i can tell you with some confidence that the only thing that would interrupt your ability to handle this would of course be your communication with the preclear this would have to be pretty good before you could use this process to establish communication with preclear suffering from the terror stomach is of course one of the more interesting things to do because the preclear is quite frantic he leaps around goes in and out of session etc nevertheless in spite of this the process does level out the terror stomach which is just bundle of confusion with this process one would apparently be dealing with nogames condition because something is talking to the preclear but remember that the preclear is making something talk to him for the first time the walls are always telling people something and when walls become warnings and when the various items of the physical universe become associated all under the headings of warnings then you have terror stomach well the common denominator of warning is not conditional actually it is warning about change of position what has deteriorated in the preclear is the ability to differentiate messages so that all messages mean go to dont go to____ stay in and dont stay in the process runs out in essence the bad 8c of the universe and you just turn it into good 8c when running the process ask the preclear if he is putting the postulate behind the wall in the wall just ahead of the wall ask him how it is going now what is the progress of the various points how much space is the postulate occupying now has he any inclination to put the postulate into the whole building or compulsion to do this or that and so on you just go on policing it you see but dont slow it down with too much policing because this process is quantity processunlike almost any other process we haveits very low scale and so is quantitative ie how many times he gets it into the wall so you want him to do as many of these commands as possible now the reason i bring up this process is to acquaint you with it and also because it is so wonderfully illustrative of the relationship between aberration and learning rate subject which i will be continuing in another pab l ron hubbardhco bulletin of 8 march 1957 copies to

w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 15 march 1957 learning rate part 1 this is one of the more important things with which we have to do scientology has always been the science of knowing how to know with some diffidence i tell you it is also the basic science of education education happens to be just one part of large whole education is seldom creative and is therefore just middle ground of activity getting people to know something rather than getting people to invent something to know you will see are quite different in scientology itself however we engage in great number of educational activities and just for that reason alone you should understand education education really takes off from series of basics which we have good grip on and nobody ever knew where education took off from before well it takes off from scientology this is factually true nobody ever before had these basics it is quite amazing if you asked an educator about these thingson how you taught people and so forthhe would be flabbergasted some of his ideas are interesting and complicated enough to be fascinating but they are not sufficiently effective in order to educate somebody you had to know what the mind was all about and unless you knew the nearly total anatomy of the mind you could not hope then to do much educating and the educational world did not know the anatomy of the mind and so they didnt do much educating that is the simple background of the situation but the funny part of it is that if you tell an educator some of the basics of education he will agree with you all the time he knew these things all the time he will tell you but little conversation will show you that these things are not aligned properly and are tied up with all sorts of extraneous data and that he has idea of relative importance of the various data both pertinent and extraneous he could not evaluate for you the data you have fed him but would be in such total agreement with the basics that you feel that he would be rather apt to go anaten stagger yawn etc but he would know for sure that he had met someone who could tell him about his business if you know about the mind you can educate mind this is certain and quite true now here is the coordination you have wall say to yourself this means go to_____ what are you actually doing you are really running out the total significance of wall you are evidently doing about half hundred different things while doing this process if you listed the things which make this process work you would be likely to have couple of sheets of foolscap but let us take one of them here and let us see how walls are always teaching you something how fire plugs are always teaching you something and how grass is always teaching you something etc the least that wall teaches you is that it is wall now when you ask preclear to walk over and touch that wall as in step of 8c he finally finds out that there is wall there which is the goal of the process now what is this but learning that he has wall there now process lag and learning lag would be the same thing for these purposes it takes him this long to find out there is wall you will understand that the wall gets more solid to thepreclear and lot of other parts of scientology immediately accrue that are off the subject of learning rate but we are just taking up this one thing we call this thing learning lag learning lag is how long it takes the wall to get the message through to the preclear well it takes as long as the preclear is in high unknowing games condition high unknown games condition is effect on self and effect on other things and yet his ability in the universe depends upon his differentiation amongst objects for the wall says to him this is wall but because there can be effect on self in very obsessive way the wall saying to him this is wall means of course this is hospital spittoon differentiation in perception this is sometimes quite evident in sudden exteriorization because of loss of havingness which occurs at that time it is not that his mest body is what gives him perceptionthis is not truebut the havingness of the mest body makes his perception possible you reduce his havingness by exteriorizing him suddenly and his perception goes by the board and of course he goes downscale and look is way up there at the top of the know to mystery scale just below know and you drop him down the scale to nolook and sometimes in sudden exteriorization you may drop him down to delusory look they not only dont see what is there they see something that is not there well what is this in essence but an inability to perceive which is an inability to learn suddenly exteriorized with havingness dropped they look at the ceiling and it is the same ceiling they were looking at moment before with their mest bodys eyes but it is now hospital ceiling well some via is occurring between themselves and the lesson the ceiling is trying to give them and that lesson is this is ceiling they dont perceive that they perceive better lesson what do we mean by better lesson we mean more convincing one the hospital ceiling was far better lesson it was much more convincing it was saying this is ceiling to somebody who was so anaten and fogged out that he just could not resist learning that lesson or differentiate and so the hospital ceiling kept saying to person in this condition this is ceiling until it became all possible ceilings the moment you reduce his havingness he drops in tone and picks up the most dominant lessons as we go downscale then with preclear he can be expected to pick up more and more dominant lessons and what is aberration aberration would simply be pattern of convictions and we could say for the purposes of education that aberration is really series of lessons that were learned too well for example fellow was raised in tough neighborhood and was taught that the thing to do to get on in life was to bash everybody over the head and he learnt this lesson very very well but he never learnt another lesson which was presented to him later in life that the way to get on in life was to be able to live with the people therefore we find that what is wrong with him is lesson learned too wella wrong lesson the schoolboy who studies his lessons very often reads something which is not in the book and learns it much better than what is in the book this is because we get into alteration and change of location at once now wrong location and wrong datum are more or less the same thing when we move data into solids we get the most dominant thing they perceivelocation first we have postulates and then we have located postulates that is lower order of postulate but is still higher than most peoples heads we find out then that aberration consists of number of lessons which person has learned too well that would be an interesting way to talk about it and would certainly grip the imagination of an educator but there is something else riding alongside of it which wipes it out as total explanation and that is his willingness to learn wrong lesson and that is his learning lag now why is he willing to learn these wrong lessons he just is he has decided some time or other without any prompting that this was the way things were now many people simply by getting into the band of agreement are way up tone scale from where they were before but remember people can go downscale into agreement too so the datum is confirmed he generated it himself and then it was agreed now and only now do we enter the field we could call learning rate or learning lag or education just for reason at all he assumed for instance that his mother was badwoman he had reason he just assumed itno prenatals in other words one day he decided she was beast and went along playing the game that he was sad little orphan just out of thin air and then one day he had been postulating this all the time she blows up which she never did before and does something dreadful to him like sending him to bed without supper or issuing threats etc and this confirms his assumed belief now take the reversal that he has postulated his mother as an angel and all of sudden she turns and becomes drunkard etc he is then always trying to convince people that she is good woman and yet he knows that she is bad one then one day he gives up entirely and he now has another conviction only he didnt generate this conviction it was exterior to him now one of the fondest things that your preclear thinks is that he caused everything everywhere but he covers this up and advertises to one and all including himself that he is not responsible for anything that ever happened to him now this is quite remarkable because it is complete reversal in advertising that he is totally irresponsible he yet really believes that he basically caused everything now you know from oldtime ownership processing that if you misown something it gets very real and solidso at least 50 of the things that happened to him have been from exterior sources if they are in restimulation they are the things that didnt happen to him you see and the things that did happen to him are misowned the other way he is misowning both ways he says he caused something but this was really caused by someone else if it is in heavy restimulation in other words there are other things that work in the universe besides the preclear he not only has to discover that he exists but that other things exist too the random factors in case lead us then to conclude that the premises of education and conviction only go for short distance they go up to selfgenerated data and thats quite way but it doesnt take us the whole distance therefore handle this thing as far as it goes handle the premise of learning rate and lag and other material of this character just as far as it goes it is terribly effective as far as it goesit is so effective that you are likely to go completely overboard and then wonder what happenedbut what happened is that you moved out of that range into the range of selfgenerated noncaused attitudes noncaused attitudes are undone by communication so we find communication vastly superior to education communication will always undo education but it has to be terrible communication to do nothing but fix ideas what do we have in terms of processes here well we have lot of processes i am not trying to give you anything but decent resume here of the exact place something occupies before i tell you about it because this is so good you will possibly try to supplant communication with education you must not do that because selfgenerated data can supplant education now where do we go then with this thing called education learning rate learning lag and so forth well let us become glibnot but all of uswith regard to such thing as industry and learning rate we will take that up in the next pab l ron hubbardpab 109 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 3537 fitzroy street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 1 april 1957 learning rate part 2 to continue with how we use this factor of learning rate and learning lag and so forth you can interest an industrialist by telling him that it is learning rate that is impeding his own operation how many instructions has he put out that have not been followed you can say that these people really do want to cooperate with him but that the learning rate is so poor that these people cannot absorb the instructions this is the stable datumsomething he will understanda better stable datum than anyone else will ever give him labor is all bad is the usual stable datum given to him you will explain to him the trouble with his executives and foremen etc the reason why his production curve is down or his machinery busted up etc is entirely because the learning rate varies from person to person you can remind him of the stupid child and the bright child in the same classroomone child doesnt learn as much as the other simply because it takes one child too long to learn what the other child learns rapidly but it is learning rate it isnt learning quantity now you get very technical at this point and explain the difference between these two children is the learning rate do not go into quantitybut he will assume at once that the length of time it takes somebody to learn something establishes then how much he knows that is not quite true but it is awfully convincing you can say to him now actually there are not thirty people mr industrialist in the thousands in your plant who are really the cause of your labor difficulties certainly not more than thirty these people are against you because they dont know you immediately he will say that is so true you continue they dont know you because their learning rate is so poor that they have idea what you are trying to do or what you want them to do they are merely in revolt and they dont know against what this will make sense to the industrialist you tell him now i could pick these people out with the greatest of ease you could do this through the use of personality analysis tests which should make it quite clear to you and he could check these against their service records and you can be quite sure that the records would agree with your analysis he will wonder how you could establish their learning rate so rapidly when you didnt even talk to these people just use learning rate as substitute conversationally for aberration comm lag etc and it translates so we are in communication with him even if it is bit of stretch we are in communication ill give you an example stupid judge is one who cant learn the rights and wrongs the ins and outs from the witnesses and all the attorneys will tell you at once that this man is stupid judge because his decisions are incorrect but sometimes they take person who is simply stupid judge and they say he is vicious judge but actually you could say his difficulty in learning is so great that he becomes emotionally disturbed at the thought of learning and therefore exerts punishment in revenge on the people who have brought this torture upon him his learning faculties are so poor that it becomes painful for him to learn you see how you could just talk to somebody and without accusing anybody of being insane or aberrated etc you could probably sell him processing for the whole of his executiveand foremen levels of his staff to increase their learning rate and the reason for this so that his postulates will stick that is what he can see will happen but this is not what you do at this point you have point of agreement and you as scientologist take departure from it you have made point of agreement that it is learning rate and learning lag that causes randomity on his communication lines you can tell him this and convince him because it is almost true and it is certainly true within the realm of his experience but you in actually processing people depart from it youre not interested exclusively in the employers postulates sticking youre not interested at all in this you are interested in giving the person determinism over data youre not interested in persons learning rate really but in his power of choice to establish or review the importance of data this is what you reestablish with the person you dont teach him then to get into state of hypnotic impulse you teach him power of choice over data and only then will the data become of use to him and then only can he become social in his behavior the answer to the question is in total disagreement with the industrialists modus operandi it is not in agreement at all i have talked to some of these boys within the last year and it is quite interesting that the moment i started to establish the fluidity and the right to think for labor the right to live and the right to be for labor we were talking on different planets and this is the secret of their failure if their system of money control was successful system there would be more of it today than there is and it would be an increasing system and it is not it is decreasing system they must have short glance at something but youre not going to involve yourself with this short glance management will buy learning rate completely they will buy this whole thing because they themselves cannot face communication but they can face learning communication is too high for them and we have tried to sell them this for several years it is too high for them because you are trying to make them face static they will not do this but they will however face learning rate so what do you tell them knowing this full well you say you are going to increase the learning rate of their staff members you dont discuss technically how you do it you just give him wonderful examples eg ask how long it takes person to learn to use one of his machines well he may say it needs an apprenticeship of five years then you can reply what long time obviously due to the very slow learning rate then ask him how does he know the man can really run the machineask him about his repair and maintenance bill you can tell him that certainly he personally knows about these machines but that is why he is sitting at the top in an administrative post but what about these other people how does he know that they know take the junior executive who is not very effective doesnt get things done his learning rate is so poor that he doesnt understand what his employer wants done it could be that he is very willing to do anything for him but he never finds out what now lets have conference with this employee and see if this is the case and sure enough it always is the case if youre dealing with somebody who cant get things done you are for sure dealing with someone who cannot absorb data and you just prove it by getting into communication without mentioning communication you will talk about learning rate and learning lag ive tried this out and found that you can do wonders with it in ordinary conversation the definition of you as scientologist in such circumstance would be someone who decreases the learning lag of peopleincreases their speed of assimilation of data this is how you could describe your job you can talk about reaction time and the vast amount of data that the environment demands of people etc take professional football team one of the most difficult things here is that they have to learn new plays all the time what if they have good player who cannot learn new plays and always uses the old ones that is where they lose their games well what do we do we speed up the ability of learning new plays now you can really start to get technical you have some agreement here your listener has not yet begun to suspect that you can do something for him but that will be matter of just short timelearning rate is important to the truck driver he has to learn that there is truck in front of him on the road before he can put his brakes on now suppose it takes him long time to learn thishe has wreck so people with low learning rates are accident prone your job as scientologist is to make sure that people have fast reaction time by increasing their learning rate but do not forget that this is purely method of obtaining agreement and introducing your subjectit is not an end in itself this occupies fairly interesting section in scientology but its accomplishment is not effected by direct drill this is never done why did it take people nine months to learn to recognize an aircraft in 11 25th of second on the aircraft recognition courses because it was done by drill and the recognition officer very very often was not so good at recognizing planes but increasing learning rate by drill etc usually only increases familiarity and automaticity learning rate governs reading time there are many systems which speed up your reading time but the practice of reading or the practice of acting simply increases the familiarity with what you are doing to point where you can neglect it and that is never the goal of scientologist his goal is not to get something more automatic his goal is to establish or re establish power of choice over data totally fixed datum is in the past where would person have to go to recover it in the past of course person to stay in present time has to have all his data in relatively fluid condition so the reestablishment of the power of choice over datato be able to accept it or reject it at willcomes first and the whole process of increasing learning rate which is secondary thing is the process of recovering power of choice over data all education is trying to do is fix data and all scientology is trying to do is fix or unfix it at will this is what scientologist is doing and that is the goal of the processes used and incidentally they are the only things that will increase learning rate and cut down learning lag and increase reaction time etc but the final product in the framework of the society itself is actually coming from something else than the society believes it is coming from now anybody will happily let you come in and teach or process person as much as you please about his job if they think this is the drill to increase his learning rate and so you have freedom to process people but what you are doing is reestablishing his power of choice over the data he has he always then winds up knowing more about it and his learning rate depends upon that power of choice to fix or unfix data at will and some processes which i will be giving you in future pabs will be aimed at doing this very precisely l ron hubbardhubbard communications office 37 fitzroy street london w 1 phone langham 3601 hco bulletin of 8 april 1957 group

thus the group auditor has only available to him in any group which contains new or unclear people 1 attention 2 person thus we see at once that significance process or any process aimed at thinkingness in new or rugged group or one which contains any rough case must not be run lets audit the whole group always not just the disciplined ones so we must delete all thinkingness processes

come into its own group chairs are widely spaced so the assistant group auditor can walk through anyone not doing the command is manually guided into doing it not verbally by the assistant group auditor the auditor asks only did he do the command not did the command have an effect upon his health if the former persists the latter follows the use of significance in command puts thinkingness beyond the auditors control hence see that wall put it there is wrong with the put it there the pc has to think that the auditor cannot be sure he did and cannot enforce it easily all group auditing

office 3537 fitzroy street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 15 april 1957 education educationpoint of agreement the learning processes are all of them extremely interesting to the auditor because they bring to his attention at once that the common denominator of communication and aberration is at once telling somebody something you say to somebody helloyou mean in essence i am here you are there and i recognize it its the relay of an idea well now learning itself has been for i dont know how long very compartmented its been very carefully grooved so that learning as we speak of it then prior to 1956 meant what they meant in schooland that was the inflow of ideas now when you speak to somebody out in the public about learning he thinks youre talking about inflow of ideas from some source or another either from book or teacher that is very narrow look and when i talked to you about this before i was using learning in that definitionan inflow of ideas it is not true that learning rate or the rate one will permit ideas to inflow is the common denominator of aberration or anything else but it looks like it the truth of the matter is if you only considered inflow it would be like considering the motivator without the overt act now you know as an auditor how important it is to look at the overt act rather than the motivator dont look at these inflows all the time if you continue to look at these inflows and nothing but these inflows you will make as many mistakes as have been made in the past umpteen thousands of years in the field of education and lets not make these mistakes all over again education could have been defined this way education is the process of placing data in the recalls of another do you see that thats what education thought it was doing it thought it was placing ideas in the recalls of another and making recall possible by somebody else of data related to him now thats not very complicated and that is the trouble with it it is not complicated enough for educators now we deal with simplicities and this is the first time we really find fault on the line of simplicityits an idiots definitionand thats the process that is being carried on at this moment at yale princeton harvard and columbia down here at george washington at oxford cambridge and the sorbonneany place across the world at which they consider themselves tops in educationthey are placing ideas in the recall of others few schools departed from this from time to time almost by accident and usually under duress from their student bodies heidelberg is an example of this heidelberg never considered the relay of ideas important it considered having been to heidelberg important and that was quite different as long as we maintain this idea of inflow only we are in trouble education does not happen if education means inflowing ideas then you are also talking about hypnotism you see theres differentiation there we are talking about beating somebody up and laying in anengram this too would be education wouldnt it so we have education and aberration very very closely associated in fact education was aberration life was busy teaching somebody lesson and the lesson it succeeded in teaching him was not to do any more living and that little lesson then was always at the base of education and it was done so that education itself could be considered aberration in other words educational systems did the lazy thing they did the easy thing they simply paralleled the game of the mest universe in teaching somebody not to live and living paralleled it why they then thought they were doing good job but lets look at education as it was done you taught somebody something by saying pigs have snouts theyre not supposed to say yes the classroom is supposed to be quiet later on you put an examination in front of them and it says what do have and theyre supposed to immediately answer and write have snouts youre supposed to be able to associate this completely so its just test of recall now as you know therapeutically recallsand by the way if you dont know this try it some time just sit and ask somebody to recall something about some person and do nothing but that and notice that you get decline of case thats an interesting thing you had to use the whole of the arc formula something really real some time you were in communication with and the reverse side of it tooin other words the entirety of the straightwire formula inflow and outflowto get away with it but if you just asked somebody to remember something about george remember something else about george remember something else about georgeif you asked him what he was doing hes picking up every moment he ever saw george motionless this erases you see all the rest points of george and leaves nothing but the confusions and the halfway feeling that george is there so we sort of move george as disembodied entity into present time and confirm the valence now this is quite trick but you just knock these rest points out and george becomes confusion therefore nothing but recall used therapeutically and educationally would wind somebody up in rather confused state he would be sort of half hypnotized just nothing but recalls so if you give people data like pigs have snouts and then ask them what has snout or what has you have given them stable datum and now youre taking it away from them you might look up some time university record as to suicide and nervous breakdown such record is honestly kept i know i did this once and i had lot of trouble i wanted to know how many students had committed suicide in that university and they wouldnt own up to it but i found out there had been quite few and thered been great many nervous breakdowns all at examination time they spend the whole semester giving somebody some stable data and then at examination time they take that all away suddenly in other words simply implanting the recall and then pulling it back out again has been defined as education but it is nothing but black operationnothing but to do this to little kids is to do away with their initiative therefore time for revolution in the field of education is definitely at hand education would have to be defined much more broadly but remember in the old logics about action definitions well youd have to give it an action definition it would have to be real definition that gave its use and purpose for it to be of any kind of game itself the reason why teachers go into nogame condition is because teaching itself is not really game it is putting bunch of other people in nogame condition and of course thats only part of game to teach subject it would be necessary for the person being taught to be able to receive nonsignificant disrelated idea from another person you see that would be necessity in order to teach somebody something the next condition that we would have to meet would be making certain that person could maintain his power of choice over the data given to him so we would give him some data which were incorrect and giving him these incorrect data we would find out if he could remember them and if he could reject them the idea of being able to reject datum and still remember it to know that its untrue and nonfactual and still be able to recall it is of course bettered by further action being able to wipe it out completely or not even recall it and that is skillthe next thing would be to feed him datum have him give objective examples and active examples of this datum so that its not then just string of words and then ascertain whether or not he could still reject it or accept it and then ask him to rephrase it and eventually he will form something which will to him be an agreeable stable datum and having done this we would then have accomplished power of choice over datum to get him to remember or repeat nonsignificant datum would be the longest haul at first and you may find people who have terribly long haul on the subject of incorrect data you give him an incorrect datum and he cant reject it but when you have made that possible you can then give him datum have him give objective examples of the datum have him rephrase it give objective examples of his datum accept it reject it handle it throw it around and the next thing you know he has something which will buff the entirety of confusion surrounding that subject you have created there something which is armor plate as far as he is concerned he knows datum now he doesnt know it as recall thats the trick you see this is entirely different now its hard to describe how he knows it because theres nothing there to describe except the datum itself so to write long chapters on this new type of knowingness would be an impossibilityits something that is experienced it easily goes on beyond the field of description all right lets take look then at education and find out why you would do this that wayrather than to just place something in somebodys recalls to have him really know it as datum why would you do this would there be any sense in this at all well yes there certainly would be the individual would be able to use that datum he would be able to evaluate its importance he would be able to handle it and handle with it many other things in other words you have given him something for his utilization now i want to tell you little difference in the field of education itself the stress of teaching in modern school today is this how to occupy the childs time thats right thats what they teach in modern training schools great stress is put on this you have child just so long he has to be taken out of his home for that length of time you have to keep him occupied in school and thats just about it and you wonder why child of twelve or thirteen doesnt really know how to spell his penmanship is poor his reading is worse and so on thats because different thing has come into view now this is not the tradition of the little red schoolhouse of song and storybook through the generations there was another tradition in this country and i dont know where the tradition i have just described came from but this other tradition was the american tradition and it went like this you had to get em and put some shoes on em in hurry and teach em readin writin and rithmetic as fast as you could because they werent going to be in school very long and the teacher who was put through normal school so called hundred years ago was taught that you have got to be fast you never know when papas going to take him out and put him behind the plough give him some education before it happens to him you probably will get them in the winter months when theres not much work to do but in the summer youre never going to get them hence the summer vacation of course the child loves this idea he doesnt have too much sympathy with education in the most part as it is performed but if school really educated him im afraid youd have an entirely different attitude on the part of the child now i have been very fortunate to know in my life quite few real geniusesfellows that really wrote their name fairly large in the world of literature and scienceand i consider myself very fortunate to have known them because they are so rare why are they so rare i found something peculiar about these fellowsthey were for the most part taught in peculiar schools they were taught in some ymca school or they were taught by some englishman who ran little college for difficult children in the street they were all taughtit seemsin some kind of offbreed school now this is peculiar because the school existed to large measure to take care of people who were slopovers from the usual educational systemthere wasnt very much education involved the fellow would come in and hed be interested in something and therefore they had the master give him his head one chap by the way who gave us solid fuel rockets and assist takeoffs for airplanes too heavily loaded on aircraft carriers and all the rest of this rocketry panorama and whoformed aerojet in california and so on the late jack parsons by the way was not chemist the way we think of chemists he was not taught in the field of chemistry beyond this fact there was little professor who opened up school nobody could do anything with jack so they sent him over to this school and the professor found out he was interested in chemical experiments and turned him loose in the laboratory and gave him lot of encouragement he eventually became quite man it is interesting that this completely sloppy type of education is apparently quite workable here are some learning processes try them out and see the difference between knowing datum and knowing it as recall 1 learning process 1 flatten each part thoroughly before going to next give pc 3 numbers have him repeat see if he remembered repeat this process b give him incorrect datum have him repeat it discover if he could remember it discover if he could reject it repeat this process c give him vital datum concerning rudiments of auditing in the case of scientologist for example see if he can repeat it see if he can rephrase it have him give objective examples see if he can reject it repeat this process 2 learning process 2 discover things auditor and pc can agree on in vicinity b feed pc vital data scientology and rudiments for example get him to give objective examples rephrase and reject and accept 3 learning process 3 have pc discover unimportant data in environment 4 assigning identity this is walkabout inside and outside commands look around here and find something you could have for what is it used or what is it called could you invent another use name for it 5 objective forgettingness this is notknow process it is another walkabout commands look around here and find something it would be all right to forget or notknow if these five processes are flattened early in the week note the changes repeat and effect further changes l ron hubbardpab 111 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication

eyesight and glasses compiled from acc tape material of l ron hubbard it is interesting to know that thetan doesnt look through his eyeballs he has two little gold discs one in front of each eye lens these are not the lenses of the eyes but as you might say mockedup energy they are little gold discs that are superimposed over the eye and he looks through these the eyeballs merely serve to locate these discs an eyeball isnt even good camera some people dissecting eyeballs to find out how people looked with them have been totally baffled since the first time this was done because it is about the worst camera that anybody ever had anything to do with what the ophthalmologist doesnt know is that the individual looks through these little discsthe ones in front of each eyeand when things begin to deteriorate or when the anchor points of the body deteriorate they are liable to follow suit they become distorted one way or another they begin to qanda with the distortions of the eye themselvesthe eye reacts to light so these little golden shields react to light after while the little gold shield becomes black or corrodes in some fashion which makes it very difficult to look through of course we dont know why he is looking through them in the first place when they do deteriorate the individual starts wearing glasses the person thinks this is necessary the next thing he does is to make the lenses of the glasses stronger he puts on pair of glasses this is big shielda big disc this disc also goes in front of the eyeball and he knows this and he cannot see things unless he looks through one the reason why glasses become very difficult in an auditing problem is that one is not auditing glasses i have audited glasses just as an experiment for long time havingness in terms of glasses or in terms of eyeballs does produce some sort of change but havingness in terms of little golden discs produces an awful alteration in terms of eyesight sometimes faster than is comfortable you can take this oldtime effort processing and produce change of vision with everybody with permanence but fantastic alteration of vision can occur making somebody very uncomfortable have the preclear get the effort to see followed by the effort not to see followed by the effort to see one after the other the next thing you know is that all the little muscles in theeyes will start to qanda with the little golden lenses in front of the eyeballs which are changing under all this processing and the next thing you know is that he is seeing double crosseyed or something like that things will turn on with tremendous brilliance as though somebody swung rheostatand he will turn it down quickly because that would mean that he would be confronting too much you should thus change his idea of what he should be able to confront if you change that idea he will then adjust the machinery of sight but if you attack the machinery of sight directly you are just forcing him to confront and you get this phenomenon of person turning up his vision and turning it down again at once you get the person capable of being able to get beautiful scenes and visio in the bank and then going totally black you get person cleared up tonight and tomorrow morning he is psychotic wreck that is all under the heading of havingness and confrontingness when you remedy havingness and confrontingness he will remedy the rest of it there is reason why thetan couldnt stand in the middle of the room and look at everything just as clear and flat and hard as it ever was he doesnt need any mechanics he certainly has to be able to be it and have it in other words he has to be able to occupy the middle of something and he has to be able to do lot of things before he can even see something but all of these things adjust on straight havingness havingness will change vision and special perception that is something nobody can argue with but the whole problem of glasses is the problem of confronting i once had bomb go off in my face with some authority some time or another because i was standing in place where i shouldnt have been standing at all total miscalculation on my part the startlement that i could miscalculate to this degree did in after that i couldnt see finally my eyesight turned on bit and got way up to 3120 420that in the service is what wall i was doing combat service and navigation and every other thing i was supposed to do with that kind of eyesight clear through until 1946 after the war was over i was still wearing black glasses i was trying to write books and what piece of paper in what typewriter my instincts are very good and i was perceptive enough and wasnt unwilling to confront things to such degree that i ran into doors or did embarrassing things but i was rather upset because my marksmanship was way off i shot too many bullets into too many forbidden directions i guess or something of the sortthat used to be great hobby of mine so i wore glasses contact lenses trying to increase my vision i found out that vision increased only when you diminutivized the subjects you were looking at in other words the more powerful the glasses become the smaller they make the objects you look at appear think that over for moment in terms of confrontingness and it will amuse you of course the world isnt quite as formidable if it gets that small very highpowered pair of glasses reduces the size of the face you are looking at by about half people who are wearing glasses are very often not aware of this but if you put new pair of glasses on somebodys nose and put him in car and tell him to drive he does some of the most fantastic things in other words confrontingness is altered by glasses i dont know that sight or lines or clarity of vision is altered but certainly confrontingness is altered by pair of lenses the moment i found that out i was vastly amused because i didnt want things to be that small and my eyes were simply recovering from having been torn up which was an interesting state of affairs i got some processing ran out lot of these things and my eyes came back up and flickered all over the placethey got anywhere from 1520 to 2520 which means they were above normal sometimes and way below normal at other intervals i foundone day whilst reading report that i couldnt make out anything the printing was all blurry and going askew there were ghost letters riding above every line and i just couldnt make head or tail of the report i was thinking that id better use monocle or magnifying glass i suddenly realized that i was reading an ama report with total unwillingness to confront it i threw it aside picked up novel and the print was perfect so i can sympathize with those who wear glasses because i have been over the jumps i have been all the way at the bottom of not even being able to find the door to almost being able to find the door on up to being able to find two doors where is the havingness of the person located in terms of the body scholar has fixed vision point at certain distance from his eyes he has had havingness in that point and then he hasnt had havingness if you make somebody keep book from going away at that distance his eyesight will change all over the place just have him open book and keep it from going away now leave it uncontrolled now keep it from going away he gets headaches eyeburn his eyes practically bleed before you get through because you are restoring the havingness at the exact distance where it was fixed and lost you get all sorts of phenomena of this character but it isnt really problem of how good are the optic nerves of course you shove an icepick through persons eyes like the psychiatrists dohe is not going to be able to see well because he has already got now i am not supposed to see with the thing i have an awfully hard time with blind people on this now i am supposed to i can get them to see get them to do everything then they suddenly realize that they were not supposed to be able to seeand they shut off their sight again but you process some more and so on but any time you have vagary in the adjustment of sight it is vagary in the adjustment of havingness there must be something there to observe the havingness goes by quantity dont get the idea that people are afraid of seeing anything youre figuring right along with the type of figurefigure that has never worked for anybody in any time or place he is just afraid to look at things so we will take him out and make him confront things if by some necromancy he is able to have that thing or some part of it then he will be able to see it and will not be afraid of it if we can get him to confront then his fears will change people know this but this other thing that people are afraid of things that they have irrational terrors and all that is all pretty well resolved on just this one basis there is something there to confront then there isnt anything there to confront this is loss of havingness if their havingness goes down far enough ie their idea of quantity falls far enough out of adjustment they will begin to detest seeing it they wont quite like to see it now there can be too much of it or too little of it in either case the scarcity or importance or responsibility factors alter and they get so that they cannot confront it they are perfectly willing to listen to radio but are they willing to listen to radio 24 hours day they finally say this is too much i cannot confront it and they turn off their hearing in some fashion you can actually fool your considerations to this degree you say look at all the books ive got to write or read look at thata tremendous number of them there you got one little book which is not going to last you two hours actually you can have much too little to read it is quite fascinating the variations in confronting are tremendous study astigmatism distortion of image is only an anxiety to alter the image you get an astigmatic condition when person is trying to work it over into substitute if he possibly can here again it is case of not enoughhe didnt have enough some mens wives just disappear right in front of their faces just black statue will be standing there thats visual occlusion or the woman will disappear entirely she will have midriff or something like that only they dont tell anybody about it for this means of coursethat they are mador something wrong there with his havingness of his wife and his willingness to confront or not to confront that girl there is another factor that enters in he would actually be in love with martha but be married to jane so jane gets blurry because he is trying to see martha and he will do it on an axis he will twist all things over there is another whole class of sight disabilities which are not allowed by or listed by the bulk of ophthalmologists these people do not really go in for these things they say these are bizarre effects and they doubt that anybody really sees them which is fascinating way of dodging out from presented phenomena thetan with buffer in front of him feels that he cannot receive various wavelengths and he knows there are some dangerous ones he thinks they are dangerous to him and he has tremendous number of considerations about this the considerations are utterly fabulous in quantity concerning the amount of protection one has to have the conditions under which one can do things this degenerates to point where man can only see well when he is wearing certain pair of carpet slippers it can get this far removedi got this from writer oncehe could only write when he was wearing certain pair of carpet slippers i talked this over with him and all of sudden discovered that he could only see when he was wearing that pair of carpet slipperspab 112 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via

flat as simple locational commands show that object the second stage is run alternately between body and room objects the commands are show that object then show your body part show that object show your body part the third stage of objective show is run similar to opening procedure by duplication two objects such as chair and table near together are selected and one part of the preclears body such as the head the eyes the right hand etc is selected the preclear is asked to show the auditor the table the body part the chair the body part the table the body part the chair etc care should be taken in running this process not to use body parts which will embarrass the preclear the target of the process is actually the engram bank and it will be found that at great long length the preclear will come clear of facsimiles the target of the process is not the second dynamic and in running it any specialization toward second dynamic aberration defeats the process thoroughly this process actually will produce clear if it is carefully and completely run it is not tone 40 process which means that you acknowledge the originations of the preclear l ron hubbard lrh mdnm may 20 1957 this bulletin applies to outside preclears cch should be used on staffissue 47 1957 ca midmay the magazine of dianetics and scientology from washington dc the radiation picture and scientology l ron hubbard the country has become very involved with radiation in the past year or so and as we in scientology have achieved much clearer understanding of this i think i owe you rundown on scientology and radiation at the outset let assure you that our total interests in radiation at this time are two only that radiation can create hysteria and scientology handles hysteria and secondly that hysteria because of radiation puts people in rather poor condition and scientology can rehabilitate them we have political or international interest in radiation as you can remember the hasi in phoenix arizona was there at the time when great deal of bomb testing was being done in nevada only 250 miles away at that time we had some vague interest in radiation but it was more in the direction of locating any deposits of uranium which might have escaped notice being in possession of instruments which could measure radiation we were quite shocked to discover that the atmosphere and the grand pianos began to count somewhat alarmingly this was immediately after an hbomb had been buried under nine feet of dirt and had been exploded these radioactive dust particles swirled around the southwest for quite while before they separated themselves out we were worried we were worried because the amount of radiation was obviously alarmingly great and i was as worried as the rest perhaps even more so because of my responsibility for our people in the phoenix area i felt that we could not go on in the immediate vicinity of great deal of testing and so i came east to give congress and establish offices somewhere away from that area there were other local reasons but this radiation reason was more or less primary back east we made further tests but we continued to be impressed we read about radiation in the public press we read how the government was saying how it was not dangerous and we read apparently responsible scientists on the subject saying that it was very dangerous but because we had seen grand pianos counting like uranium mines we were of course of the opinion that radiation was an extremely dangerous thing without further examination of this subject and paying attention only to what was printed in the public presses we saw reason to change our attitude concerning radiation but some things have happened recently which have brought about considerable changei have just completed congress in london and was in communication with members of parliament through hasi representative on the subject of radiation it was clearly and cleanly stated by an authoritative member of the british government that russia was making full use of the hysteria factors inherent in radiation in order to stop england from constructing hbombs and to impede her defenses in other ways he had incontrovertible proof that the hysteria campaign being conducted by russia inside england and the united states was totally an effort to impede their national defense russian campaigns you must understand are of the mental brainwashing type radiation is tailormade to their agent provocateur tactics when i returned to america two things became very obvious the first of these was that only the press of russia and the united states did not report my remarks made at the nuclear radiation and health congress at the royal empire society hall in london other newspapers the world around carried the remarks as headline news these remarks were to the effect that the greatest danger of radiation was hysteria at the congress i said that the hbomb was not weapon because it was far too powerful it would not coerce obedience but only terror these remarks are more or less complete in book now being published called all about radiation for the british market only another thing that happened is that i remembered why i left the authors league of america some years ago its board had begun to offer prizes to deify minorities and it was taking other partyline data and trying to foist it off on american writers the newspaper guild so far as i know is not entirely clear of this influence the other thing i did was to take geiger counter and make test of washington little earlier this geiger counter had been giving false evidence because the stick used with the counter as will happen evidently had some uranium stuck to it but with the counter in good operating order and clean it was discovered that the background count of washington dc was the same as it was in 1932 when i was going to george washington university and studying radiation in other words there has apparently been general increase of count in london or washington because of bomb testing i did more than this i made calculation of the amount of gamma and cosmic rays which fall on earths surface daily and compared this to the amount of test radiation waste which would be thrown into the atmosphere yearly the figures do not compare the added manmade radiation will probably never add up to your luminous dial watch on the whole track radiation was dangerous for the good reason that there was more radiation in those times that could be exploded however radiation is halflife matter and the older the universe gets the less radiation there is available to throw at people and good thing too while we have doubt whatsoever of the actual dangers of bomb dropping on city we are now in position to doubt rather thoroughly the vaunted harm from test bombing which is being sold the populations of earth evidently by the communist propagandists the us population is being stampeded by russia toward leaving the us defenseless already this has accomplished defective us civil defense and is gaining momentum toward public demand for bombs this is how russia works russia works on the population imagination russia uses any knowledge of the mind she has to instill fear and bring about destruction she is an unworthy purveyor of scientific information russia has already succeeded rather well in this field of seizing control of the mind there is essential difference between dialectic materialism and wundtian psychology yet wundtian psychology is taught in all the universities of the united states england being an older and more mature government than the united states government has already awakened to this and is taking active government steps to halt this matter of public panic england for instance is not buying wundtian psychology england is buying scientology in rather largeamounts but this is not yet true of the united states that it will come about in the future is more or less certain thing but that it does not exist at the time is fact only the better iqs of the us as yet buy scientology we can be assured on the score of falloutit isnt dangerous at this time it does not compare to the amount of natural radiation with which we are being bombarded if you went down to florida to live you would increase your radiation count much more than it would be increased if you stayed well north and the government blew off ten thousand more test bombs in other words just exposure to clearer view of the sun will give you more radiation than you could be hit with in the near future because of test bombs its just fact that there isnt enough uranium around to actually thoroughly contaminate the atmosphere at this time i know that this is in controversy to my own statements on the subjectwhich is very interesting my own statements were made in the light of our earlier experience we had experienced test fallout in phoenix and i had not made further tests or calculations in other words i myself had been swept up in this campaign to frighten the populace half to death the reaction to radiation is thus entirely completely and wholly mental dianazene depends for its reaction upon wholetrack radiation incidents and xray and sunburn in the current life by taking away the engram which can react to the worry about radiation worry about radiation is then made nonpainful if you add all this up you will clearly see that scare talk about radiation is the source of radiation sickness in our present world the atom bomb is too powerful weapon to be used for control of human beings and is therefore not weapon but it does promise the population future and so promising it damps out efforts toward survival this itself can bring on sickness but we should not delude ourselves in thinking that actual radiation in dangerous quantities is adrift in this atmosphere at this time it is not all i invite you to do is to get scintillometer or geiger counter and test around there is probably an ionospheric flash which gives tiny sudden shock of radiation for the briefest instant of timeless than the amount you would get from simple xrayand this acts as restimulator to wholetrack incidents but it isnt true that radiation is drifting around biting you at this time on the subject of strontium90 it is interesting to note that sufficient intake of calcium renders person completely immuned to any effects of strontium90 child should be made to drink more milk and probably should have his diet fortified little bit with calcium if anybody is truly worried about it this fight then is in the propaganda field it is not in the field of actual science i am extremely surprised at some of the scientists who are saying that radiation is dangerous these men professionally should know their business and they are not expressing the true data on the other hand neither is the government making actual data available the government is seeking to convince the public on the score of opinion opinion has validity in science if you want to know about radiation why go and look for some radiation in the atmosphere and if you cannot find more than the usual background count then you must assume that there isnt any extra radiation in the atmosphere i am not saying that the scientists who have been beating the drum on the dangers of radiation are communistinspired i am not saying that these men are communists i am merely saying that they are aiding and assisting communist campaign we will not assist commie propaganda aimed at stampeding the us public into revolt against us defense the us can bargain her way out of this i am very hopeful that general control of radiation the world around will be achieved and i am sure that if it is not achieved national governments are dead i am also fairly sure that there will never be such athing as an atomic war i have looked this over rather carefully and i personally dont believe that national governments will last long enough at their present rate of nonsurvival activity our cue is to make nothing out of radiation if we mention it at all people who are worried about radiation are worried because enough talk about it has thrown enough engrams into restimulation to make them actually quite ill we can do something about restimulation but we have business aiding this public hysteria in any way we are the people who take care of hysteria and not the people who stir it up what we are doing is bit bigger than one of mans new destructive toys our campaign is to sell scientology if we sell it well psychiatry and psychology will collapse for instance one of the most unfortunate things that psychiatry and psychology have ever engaged upon has been this mental health campaign of this spring these people are not capable of withstanding public scrutiny their general activities are sufficiently harmful to their patients that if they stick their head up just little bit further even people in the government will be able to see that there is swindle involved there i expect within the next two or three years to see complete and thorough congressional investigation of charity rackets and would expect to see psychiatry and psychology leading the van in those who are being investigated before you begin to advertise that you can do something you should be able to do it we ourselves are suffering from comm lag of seven years not for seven years were we able to train auditors uniformly up to level to get the maximum possible results out of dianetics and scientology we accordingly experienced considerable public kickback now we are making our promises good it is possible for us to withstand the most minute and searching scrutiny on the subject of what we are doing and how we are doing it the validation program of all certificates which we are now entered upon is very worthwhile step in this direction we can today train an auditor we can train him very very well we have the processes which make an auditor able to audit and this will accrue into our attaining dominance in the field of the human mind rather easily all psychiatry and psychology need to do is to fight us little harder to advertise themselves little more strongly and the public and the government will see to it that they collapse furthermore psychiatry and psychology are playing it too close to the government and if people begin to turn away from the government because of the governments promise to extinguish them with an hbomb they will also turn away from anybody who supported the government in the field of brainwashing we have gone little off track here with radiation danger of with politics the need to do something about and we are not off track any more we are in the business of scientology and scientology rises considerably above the tinkerings of few somewhat deranged scientists and the bickerings of few misanthropic men wearing political crowns for the moment we have today very easily the most powerful weapon extant in the fourth dynamic that weapon is scientology we are not using it for evil we are using it for good therefore we will win with it the answer to all this is to sell scientology to individuals dont try to sell it to groups one doesnt easily talk to group one should sell it to individuals and he should use the skills of scientology to bring about better understanding on the part of individuals of themselves and of himself i am not saying that the various governments might not do something dangerous with testing i am not saying that hbombs are good weapons i am only saying we can survive it i am only saying that we have one casemewho has had 502 times the allowed amount and is surviving nicely thank you and other cases that are in like condition because of good processing i am saying that with good modern auditing scientologist can survive itso why worry about it as an organization and as individuals were going uptone faster than others are going down and man faces many enemies more dangerous than radiation i am giving you all this in explanation of what you will now begin to see come from the central organization and that will be scientologygood auditorsvalidation of oldcertificatesgood processingbona fide clearsother things which we have waited to see all these years we are making the grade now rather easily we are doing things that we never thought were possible before we are living up to any optimism which i ever gave out i knew i could do it i am afraid that i was overconfident in some other directions but there is one thing that i have never done i have never told you other than what i believed implicitly and completely i have been as honest with you as i knew how to be and i have been as honest about my shortcomings as i have been about my victories you can count on that you know you canfor you always i invite your cooperation in this new campaign of oursa brandnew campaign to sell

students busy at all times do not let them have unassigned work while at the academy 2 the director of training is not the director of processing if after the student intensive and weeks comm course students case is not in condition so the student can be trained the director of training or the instructor should send the student to the registrar and should not attempt patchup by another student when the director of training constitutes himself the director of processing he not only denies the organization income but most usually continues the agony of the student and does not get training done 3 answer the students questions 4 the stability of the director of training and his instructors depends upon the apparency of their agreement with on what should be trained and how it should be trained when they innovate in disagreement with organized schedules they lower the appearance of stability and deprive themselves usually of the cooperation of students 5 it is not the place of the director of training or an instructor to defend the organization lrh or the past track of dianetics and scientology any new subject combating vested interests develops some randomity rather than defend against critical attacks by students it is much more productive to look over the students case with an eye to sending him to the registrar 6 the director of training and his instructors are there to give service service is always harder to give on an individualized basis and easier to give on wide group basis however we are training individuals and even though it is difficult service must be given 7 on the head of the director of training and his instructors rests any future failure the student may have in processing preclears quality of training is to the level of staff auditor

explanation of aberrative character of radiation as cosmic rays gamma xrays et apparently move through solids without encountering resistance they then invalidate solids this is direct invalidation of the solidity of anything including mockup thus it tends to say thing is not therethus that creation has not been made this then has been used as means of discounting creativeness or of discounting solids for example any child being xrayed has been baffled as to how he wasnt there when the picture was made the rays went straight through this made him feel he wasnt solidwas not real when body is over xrayed it ceases to create sexually and creates on cellular level in highly irresponsible way this is cancer radiation ills stem from the notthereness of creations mental image pictures mockups are apparently vanished making things solid remedies all such radiation ills easily show objective and subjective does as well radiation then is the proof that solid thing is not solid this is an invalidation that one has created thus radiation is seen to hit at all creativeness its irresponsibility factor is also thisone cannot be responsible for things which are proven not to exist this also tells us that time began on an invalidation of solids in actual proof procedure cch run with this understanding and problems of incomparable or comparable magnitude to radiation resolves radiation l

year old child i knew her mother had been messing her up by telling her how much she was like mama and how weak mama was so i ran present time problem on solid terminals then give your handthank you the ptp was ok gmyh produced immediate change by the girl using all the normal childish ways of trying to stop the auditor after about ii2 hours she went anaten but good for 1 hour and then came out of it i carried on for l2 hour everything seemed ok so we had lunch after lunch i went back on to gmyh but only just checked ptp not very thoroughly within very short period10 minutespc was anaten this lasted for approximately i hour when pc rallied into present time changed her body position to that of lady reclining in chairjust like mamaand doped off this also lasted about i hour then pc came up to present timethen into enthusiasm which lasted well after i ended the session after tea i gave her another i hour on gmyh with apparent change at an enthusiasm when i say anaten on this case i mean the pc was doing the process not even mechanically most of the time but eyes shut and doped after this she felt good i then sent her home to her father and stepmotherboth of whom have had lots of auditing they couldnt believe the difference especially after only six hours the child is now in better conditon than she has ever been before l ron hubbard lrh mdnm 6357hubbard communications

confront preclear with auditing only or with nothing training stress have student and coach sit facing each other neither making any conversation or effort to be interesting have them sit and look at each other and say and do nothing for some hours student must not speak fidget giggle or be embarrassed or anaten coach may speak only if student goes anaten dope off student is confronting the body thetan and bank of the preclear hlstory developed by l ron hubbard in washington in march 1957 to train students to confront preclears in the absence of social tricks or conversation and to overcome obsessive compulsions to be interesting number training 1 name dear alice commands phrase with the he saids omitted is picked out of the book alice in wonderland and read to the coach it is repeated until the coach is satisfied it arrived where he is position student and coach are seated facing each other comfortable distance apart purpose to teach the student to send an intention from himself to preclear in one unit of time without vias training stress the command goes from the book to the student and as his own to the coach it must not go from book to coach it must sound natural not artificial diction and elocution have part in it loudness may have history developed by l ron hubbard in london april 1956 to teach the communication formula to new studentsnumber training 2 name acknowledgments commands the coach reads lines from alice in wonderland omitting he saids and the student thoroughly acknowledges them the coach repeats any line he feels was not truly acknowledged position student and coach are seated facing each other comfortable distance apart purpose to teach student that an acknowledgment is method of controlling preclear communication and that an acknowledgment is full stop training stress teach student to acknowledge exactly what was said so that preclear knows it was heard ask student from time to time what was said curb over and under acknowledgment let student do anything at first to get acknowledgments across then even him out teach him that an acknowledgment is stop not beginning of new cycle of communication or an encouragement to the preclear to go on history developed by l ron hubbard in london in april 1956 to teach new students that an acknowledgment ends communication cycle and period of time that new command begins new period of time number training 3 name duplicative question commands do fish swim or do birds fly communication bridge between position student and coach seated comfortable distance apart purpose to teach student to duplicate without variation an auditing question each time newly in its own unit of time not as blur with other questions and to teach him how to shift from one question to another with communication bridge rather than an abrupt change training stress one question and student acknowledgment of its answer in one unit of time which is then finished to keep student from straying into variations of command to insist on communication bridge when question is changed even though the same question is asked it is asked as though it had never occurred to anyone before to teach students that communication bridge consists of getting three agreementsone agreement to end this question second agreement to continue session in general and maintain arc third agreement to begin new question teach student that preclear is part of these agreements to teach student never to vary question or shift question or command without bridge history developed by l ron hubbard in london april 1956 to overcome variations and sudden changes in session number training 4 name preclear originations commands the student runs do fish swim or do birds fly on coach coach answers but now and then makes startling comments from prepared list given by instructor student must handle originations to satisfaction of coach position student and coach sit facing each other comfortable distance apartpurpose to teach student not to be tonguetied or startled or thrown off session by originations of preclear and to maintain arc with preclear throughout an origination training stress the student is taught to hear origination and do three things i understand it 2 acknowledge it and 3 return preclear to session if the coach feels abruptness or too much time consumed or lack of comprehension he corrects the student into better handling history developed by l ron hubbard in london in april 1956 to teach auditors to stay in session when preclear dives out number training 5 name hand mimicry commands all commands are by motions of one or two hands the auditor makes simple hand motion holding his hand or hands in the final position the coach bobs his head as having received it the coach then mirrorwise makes the same motion with his hand or hands the student then acknowledges if the motion was not correctly done by coach the student acknowledges doubtfully then repeats the motion to the coach if the coach does it well student thanks coach by shaking own two hands together prize fighter fashion keep motions simple student must always be able to duplicate own motions position student and coach are seated facing each other at short distance coachs knees inside students purpose to educate student that verbal commands are not entirely necessary to make student physically telegraph an intention to show student necessity of having preclear obey commands training stress accuracy of student repeating own commands teaching student to give preclear wins teaching student that an intention is different from words history developed by l ron hubbard in london april 1956 from the principles of body mimicry developed by lrh in camden nj in 1954 the following group of processes are usually taught in upper indoctrination course number training 6 name plain 8c commands look at that wall walk over to that wall with your right hand touch that wall turn around all with acknowledgments not tone 40 preclear is acknowledged when he originates physical contact position student and coach both ambulant in room with center obstacles student walks with coach who does process for student purpose to give preclear reality on environment control in following directions and havingness not all effects fully explored training stress precision in repetition of commands by student and experience on gradient scale in directing another body than own handling of originations acknowledging execution of commands by preclear when this process develops somatics on preclear it must be continued until flathistory developed by l ron hubbard in camden 1953 originally called opening procedure of 8c 8c being full auditing procedure aimed at negative thought the only surviving part of this is now called 8c and means the above process original intention was to place preclear within the control of the auditor so auditing could occur proved so successful became an endall in itself nominated in summary research project 1956 as responsible all by itself for approximately 50 of results achieved by auditors across the world number training 7 name hischool indoc commands same as 8c but with student in physical contact with coach student enforcing commands by manual guiding coach has only three valid statements to which student must listen these are start to begin process flunk to call attention to student error and thats it to end session other remark by coach is valid on student coach tries in all possible ways verbal covert and physical to stop student from running 8c on him if the student falters comm lags fumbles command or fails to get an execution on coach coach says flunk and they start at beginning of command cycle in which error occurred coach falling down is not allowed position student and coach ambulant student handling coach physically purpose to train student never to be stopped by preclear to train him to run fine 8c in any circumstances to teach him to handle rebellious people training stress stress is on accuracy of student performance and persistence by student start gradually to toughen up resistance to student dont kill him off at once history developed by l ron hubbard in london 1956 number training 8 name tone 40 on an object commands stand up thank you sit down on the table thank you these are the only commands used if student has trouble with training 9 have him do tone 40 on an object with 8c commands position student standing beside table holding ashtray which he manually makes execute the commands he gives purpose to make student clearly achieve tone 40 command to clarify intentions as different than words to start student on road to handling objects and preclears with postulates to obtain obedience not wholly based on spoken commands training stress have student give orders for while alone then begin to nag him to get them up to tone 40 commands have student silently permeate object with command and an expectancy that it will do it when student can see his intentions going in accurately when he wonders why object doesnt instantly obey when he is not stumbling through energy or depending on his voice the training process is flat this process usually takes the most time in training of any process and time on it is well spent objects can be ashtrays or rag dolls history developed by l ron hubbard in washington dc 1957 for the 17th acc number training 9name tone 40 on person commands same as 8c this is not tone 40 8c cch 12 student runs fine clearcut intentions and verbal orders on coach coach tries to break down tone 40 of the student coach commands that are valid are start to begin flunk to tell student he has erred and must return to beginning of cycle and thats it to take break or stop session for the day other statement by coach in session is valid on student and is only an effort to make student come off tone 40 or in general be stopped position student and coach ambulant student in manual contact with coach as needed purpose to make student able to maintain tone 40 under any stress of auditing training stress the exact amount of physical effort must be used by student plus compelling unspoken intention jerky struggles are allowed since each jerk is 3 stop student must learn to smoothly increase effort quickly to amount needed to make coach execute stress is on exact intention exact strength needed exact force necessary exact tone 40 even slight smile by student can be flunk too much force can be flunk too little definitely is flunk anything not tone 40 is flunk history developed by l ron hubbard in washington dc for the 17th acc the following processes are taught in the communicationcontrolhavingness course number cch 0 name rudiments goals and present time problem commands establishing session beginning by calling attention to room auditor and the session to begin discussing the preclears goals for the session auditor asks for present time problem and settles it with problems of comparable magnitude or incomparable magnitude or by locational processing in general remarks and commands enough to bring about arc at sessions beginning but not enough to run down havingness of the preclear position auditor and preclear seated at comfortable distance apart purpose to make known the beginning of session to preclear and the auditor so that error as to its beginning is made to put the preclear into condition to be audited training stress to begin sessions not just let them happen to educate the student into the actual elements of session and condition of preclears to stress the inability to audit something else when present time problem is not flat to demonstrate what happens when preclear doesnt know session has begun or has goals for it or what happens when present time problem only half flat when other things are engaged upon stress that it is done each session explain closure mechanism of problem with preclear the solution of the liability of solutions history developed by l ron hubbard in elizabeth nj 1950 goals in wichita kansas in 1951 present time problem london 1952 rudiments phoenix 1955 number cch 1 name give

in chairs without arms close together auditors knees both to auditors left of preclears knees outside of auditors right thigh against outside of preclears right thigh this position reversed for left hand in both hands preclears knees are between auditors knees purpose to demonstrate to preclear that control of preclears body is possible despite revolt of circuits and inviting preclear to directly control it absolute control by auditor then passes over toward absolute control of his own body by preclear training stress never stop process until flat place is reached to process with good tone 40 auditor taught to pick up preclears hand by wrist with auditors thumb nearest auditors body to have an exact and invariable place to carry preclears hand to before clasping clasping hand with exactly correct pressure replacing hand with auditors left hand still holding preclears wrist in preclears lap making every commandl and cycle separate maintaining tone 40 stress on intention from auditor to preclear with each command to leave an instant for preclear to do it by own will before auditor does it stress tone 40 precision to keep epicenters balanced cch i b should also be flattened history developed by l ron hubbard in the 17th acc washington dc 1957 the name and command for cch 1 has since been revised to give that hand number cch2 name tone 40 8c commands look at that wall thank you walk over to that wall thank you with the right hand touch that wall thank you turn around thank you run without acknowledging in any way any origin by preclear acknowledging only preclears execution of the command commands smoothly enforced physically tone 40 full intention position auditor and preclear ambulant auditor in physical contact with preclear as needed purpose to demonstrate to preclear that his body can be directly controlled and thus inviting him to control it finding present time havingness other effects not fully explained training stress absolute auditor precision drops from tone 40 flubs total presenttime auditing auditor turns preclear counterclockwise then steps always on preclears right side auditors body acts as block to forward motion when preclear turns auditor gives command gives preclear moment to obey then enforces command with physical contact of exactly correct force to get command executed auditor does not check preclear from executing commands history developed by l ron hubbard in washington dc 1957 for the 17th acc the name and command for cch 2 has since been revised to you look at that wall number cch 3 name book mimicry commands auditor makes simple or complex motion with book hands book to preclear preclear makes motion duplicating auditors mirror imagewise auditor asks preclear if he is satisfied that the preclear duplicated the motion if preclear is and auditor is alsofairly satisfied auditor takes book and goes to next command if preclear says he is and auditor fairly sure preclear isnt auditor takes back book and repeats command and gives book to preclear again for another try if preclear is not sure he duplicated any command auditor repeats it for him and gives him back the book tone 40 only in motions verbal twoway quite free position auditor and preclear seated facing each other comfortable distance apart purpose to bring up preclears communication with control and duplication control duplication communication training stress stress giving preclear wins stress auditors necessity to duplicate his own commands circular motions are more complex than straight lines history developed by l ron hubbard for the 16th acc in washington dc 1957 based on duplication developed by lrh in london 1952 number cch 4 name hand space mimicry commands auditor raises two hands palms facing preclears and says put your hands against mine follow them and contribute to their motion he then makes simple motion with right hand then left did you contribute to the motion good put your hands in your lap when this is flat the auditor does this same thing with half inch of space between his and preclears palms when this is flat auditor does it with wider space and so on until preclear is able to follow motions yard away position auditor and preclear seated close together facing each other preclears knees between auditors purpose to develop reality on the auditor using the reality scale solid comm line to get preclear into comm by control duplication training stress that auditor be gentle and accurate in his motions giving preclear wins to be free in twoway comm history developed by l ron hubbard in washington 1956 as therapeutic version of dummy hand mimicry something was needed to supplant look at who am l and find the auditor part of rudiments number training 10 name locational processing commands you notice that indicated object thank you auditor enforces command when needed by turning preclears head toward object run inside an auditing room or outside auditor indicates obvious objects naming them and pointing to them position auditor and preclear seated side by side or facing each other or seated or walking outside purpose to control attention since attention is being controlled by facsimiles an unknown control supplanting with known control brings preclear up to present time see also pre logics highly therapeutic process can be substituted for present time problem to some degree in cases that cannot run present time problem as process training stress that coach or preclear always looks in direction of objecthistory developed by l ron hubbard in elizabeth nj in june 1950 to bring preclears into auditing room after they had been brought up to present time number cch 5 name location by contact commands touch that indicated object thank you position auditor and preclear may be seated where the preclear is very unable in which case they are seated at table which has number of objects scattered on its surface or auditor and preclear may be ambulant with the auditor in manual contact with the preclear as is necessary to face him toward and guide him to the indicated object purpose the purpose of the process is to give the preclear orientation and havingness and to improve his perception training stress training stress is upon gentleness arc and the raising of the preclears certainty that he has touched the indicated object it should be noticed that this can be run on blind people history developed by l ron hubbard from locational processing in 1957 number cch 6 name bodyroom contact commands touch your body part thank you touch that indicated room object thank you position auditor and preclear move about together as needed the auditor enforcing the commands by manual contact using the preclears hands to touch objects and touch body parts purpose to establish the orientation and increase the havingness of the preclear and to give him in particular reality on his own body training stress training stress is upon using only those body parts which are not embarrassing to the preclear as it will be found that the preclear ordinarily has very little reality on various parts of his body impossible commands should not be given to the preclear in any case history developed by l ron hubbard in 1957 in washington dc as lower step than bodyroom show number cch 7 name contact by duplication commands touch that table thank you touch your body part thank you touch that table thank you touch your same body part thank you touch that table thank you touch your same body part thank you etc in that order position auditor may be seated preclear should be walking usually auditor standing by to manually enforce the commandspurpose process is used to heighten perception orient the preclear and raise the preclears havingness control of attention as in all these contact processes naturally takes the attention units out of the bank which itself has been controlling the preclears attention training stress training stress is on precision of command and motion with each command in its unit of time all commands perfectly duplicated preclear to continue to run process even though he dopes off good arc with the preclear not picking one body part which is aberrated at first but flattening some nonaberrated body part before aberrated body part is tackled history developed by l ron hubbard in 1957 in washington dc as lower level process than opening procedure by duplication or show by duplication all contact processes have been developed out of the prelogics number cch 8 name trio commands look around the room environment and tell something you could have run until flat look around the room and tell something the body body part cant have valence form look around the room and tell something mother or other valence cant have long form look around the room and tell what you could have run flat look around the room and tell something you would permit to remain run flat look around the room and tell what you could dispense with dispense in long form is sometimes run first when preclear is set on wasting position auditor and preclear seated at comfortable distance both facing toward majority of the room purpose to remedy havingness objectively training stress run it smoothly without invalidative questions one of the most effective processes known when thinkingness can be controlled somewhat run when havingness drops or for full intensive history developed by l ron hubbard in london in 1955 name derived from the three questions of the long form originally called the terrible trio number cch 9 name tone 40 keep it from going away commands look at that indicated object thank you walk over to that indicated object thank you touch that indicated object thank you keep it from going away thank you did you keep it from going away thank you and so forth position auditor and preclear ambulant auditor assisting by manual contact purpose the purpose of the process is to increase havingness of the preclear and bring about his ability to keep things from going away which ability lost accounts for the possession of psychosomatic illnesses training stress the training stress is on precision and accuracy and finding out that this is actually tone 40 8c with thinkingness addition this is the first step on to the route of making things solid hlstory developed in 1956 in london england by l ron hubbardnumber cch 10 name tone 40 hold it still commands look at that indicated object thank you walk over to that indicated object thank you touch that indicated object thank you hold it still thank you did you hold it still thank you etc in that order purpose to improve an individuals ability to make things more solid and to assert his ability to control his environment training stress same as cch 9 history developed by l ron hubbard in london england in 1956 number cch 11 name tone 40 make it little more solid commands look at that indicated object thank you walk over to that indicated object thank you touch that indicated object thank you make it little more solid thank you did you make it little more solid thank you etc in that order position auditor and preclear ambulant purpose to assert control over the preclear and increase the preclears havingness to increase the preclears reality on the prelogics to reverse the flow of solids training stress complete precision of performance stress 011 all the cch 9 cch 10 and cch 11 that they include control of thinkingness of the preclear and therefore should not be run with tremendous amount of auditor trust of the preclear and should not be run until the lower levels of cch are to some degree flat as they will give the preclear losses history developed in 1956 in london england by l ron hubbard number training 11 name arc straight wire commands recall something that was really real to you thank you recall time when you were in good communication with someone thank you recall time when you really liked someone thank you the three commands are given in that order and repeated in that order consistently position auditor and preclear seated facing each other at comfortable distance purpose to give the student reality on the existence of bank this is audited on another and is audited until the other student is in present time it will be found that the process discloses the cycling action of the preclear going deeper and deeper into the past and then more and more shallowly into the past until he is recalling something again close to present time this cyclic action should be studied and understood and the reality on the pictures the preclear gets should be thoroughly understood by the student the fact that another has pictures should be totally real to the student under training history developed by l ron hubbard in 1951 in wichita kansas this was once very important process it has been known to bring people from neurotic to sane level after only short period of application it has been run on group basis with success but it should benoted that the thinkingness of the individuals in the group would have to be well under the control of the auditor in order to have this process broadly beneficial when it was discovered that this process occasionally reduced peoples havingness the process itself was not generally run thereafter it is still however an excellent process with that proviso reduction of havingness in some cases number cch 12 name limited subjective havingness commands what can you mock up ok to preclears answer mock up what preclear said he could mock up ok shove it in to yourself ok when this is relatively flat mock up whatever preclear said he could ok let it remain where it is ok when this is relatively flat enter on the third part mock up whatever the preclear said he could mock up ok throw it away ok if the preclear cannot throw the object away at once have him duplicate it many times and move one of them slightly further away from him until he has at last thrown one away if the preclear cannot mock anything up remedy his havingness with blackness if the preclears field is invisibility have him put glass objects of many sorts and sizes on table and one after the other keep them from going away if mockup disappears have preclear keep on trying at it because he will eventually be able to get it back position auditor and preclear seated facing each other purpose to remedy the havingness of the preclears bank training stress not to give the preclear any losses he must successfully complete each step and the auditor must do things on gradient scale until the preclear has successfully completed each command given history these and other creative processes were developed by l ron hubbard in london in the fall of 1952 number cch 13 name subjective solids commands what can you mock up ok to preclears answer this is asked once every time one changes the type of mockup mock up whatever the preclear said ok now make it little more solid ok did you do that thank you various objects are mocked up and made little more solid the preclear can be told to do what he pleases with these this is not tone 40 process position auditor and preclear seated purpose to make it possible for the preclear to mock up subjective objects and make them little more solid preparatory to running then and now solids training stress on knowing what the preclear is doing how he is doing it where he is putting the mockups so that the preclear is certainly policed and is certainly doing the process if the preclear neglects to do the process even though he receives the command and nods his assent he is of course going out of control of the auditor history developed by l ron hubbard in 1956 in london number cch 14name then and now solids commands get pictureand make it little more solid thank you look at that auditor indicates objectand make it little more solid thank you these commands are given with tiny pause between the first and second phrase as it will be found that the glance of the preclear at the object tends to give him the impression that he has already made it little more solid before the auditor gives the command if this auditing command is broken into two commands position auditor and preclear seated facing each other comfortable distance apart purpose to straighten out the time track of the preclear to clear up his bank to disclose his life computation to show up the whole track to give preclear practice in handling time to get rid of unwanted facsimiles and in general to handle in its totality the reactive mind training stress on leading up with gradients toward any failure that the preclear may have in making something little more solid in keeping the auditor from chasing all over the bank every time the preclear has second picture show up or third or fourth or fifth on the same command the auditor wants one picture and wants one thing or the picture itself to be made little more solid we do not do two or three pictures and then room object the preclear can get easily lost on the track unless this is obeyed furthermore it will be noted that the preclear goes out of present time further and further and then less and less and then further and further and then less and less and this cycle of further into the past and then less into the past finally winds up with bringing the preclear wholly into present time history developed from over and under solids which was developed by l ron hubbard in late 1955 and improved by him in 1956 the process more or less completes the work begun on the reactive mind in 1947 it will be noted that many earlier processes and effects are woven into then and now solids number training 12 name think thought commands think thought thank you position auditor and preclear seated comfortable distance apart purpose to give the student some reality on the thinkingness of other people and demonstrate that the control of thinkingness is possible training stress should be on the fact that after the control of the body has been asserted and control of attention flattened control of thinkingness can take place there is really nothing wrong with the preclear except that he cannot control his thinkingness thus he cannot change considerations at will because he is stopped by the bank this is the most permissive of such processes since the preclear cannot really help to think thought and we do not much care whether he thought it or the bank thought it history developed in 1955 in phoenix arizona by l ron hubbard number cch 15 name rising scale processing commands the chart of attitudes is employed the top and bottom buttons of which are deadsurvive nobodyeverybody distrustfaith losewin wrong right neveralways i know noti know stopchangestart noresponsibilityfully responsible stoppedcauses motion full effectcause identificationdifferentiation owns nothingowns all hallucinationtruth i am noti am nogameunlimited games the auditing commands in this process are get the idea of bottom button do you have that idea all right now change that idea as nearly as you can to top button ok how close did you come thank you this is run many times on the one set of buttons until the preclear has certainty that he can maintain the upper scale idea position auditor and preclear seated comfortable distance apart purpose to give the preclear drills in changing his mind and to demonstrate that he can maintain higher levels of certainty and that he can alter his considerations and incidentally to probably change his glandular structure to the better until they have better performance which is of great importance to the process and has little to do with scientology training stress the training stress is on maintaining arc with the preclear yet being definite about what idea the preclear is supposed to get the prerequisites demand that the thinkingness of the preclear be to some degree under the control of the auditor the auditor must not be impatient with the preclear but let the preclear try again and again to get these two ideas one lowscale idea and change that idea into an upperscale idea the preclear must be in fairly good condition with regard to havingness or the process can fail history this process was developed in the fall of 1951 by l ron hubbard in wichita kansas and is taken from scientology 88008 as published in england and as given in the creation of human ability page 129 as r251 this is probably the oldest purely scientology process in existence it was not entirely workable in the past because it was not understood that the body has to be brought under the auditors control and that the attention has to be brought under the auditors control before the thinkingness of the preclear can be brought under the auditors control the process however run on preclears who were not in too bad condition has been continually successful both in changing their physical beingness and abilities the latter being in the sphere of interest of scientology the first preclear on which this and opening procedure by duplication were run was mary sue hubbard number gp i name bank processes engrams secondaries locks perceptics and whole track

world reality get the idea that object is thinking about itself perception of environment reality scale processes number training13 name fishing cognition commands this is general arc answering the preclears origin process when the preclear experiences somatic when he sighs when he gives reaction to tone 40 process the auditor repeats the process two or three more times random number and then pausing the process asks the preclear how are you doing now or what is going on and finds out what happened to the preclear just as though the auditor has not noticed that the preclear had reaction the auditor does not point out the reaction but merely wants discussion in general during this discussion he brings the preclear up to at least cognition that the preclear has had somatic or reaction and then merely continues the process without further bridge this is done randomly it is not always done every time the preclear experiences reactionposition whatever position the preclear and auditor are in as directed by the process they are running but usually with the auditor touching the preclear for example in give your hand the auditor continues to hold the preclears hand after he has said thank you and asks the preclear how he is doing training stress is that the fishing of cognition is an art and it cannot be taught by general command that the auditor must not asis the preclears havingness by asking him how are you feeling now that the preclear must not be placed in possession of the knowledge that he can stop the auditor from auditing by having reaction or experiencing reaction to the processing otherwise he will begin to experience them simply to stop the auditor thus the use of training 13 is not routine and regular but is random it should be stressed that this can be used while running any and all tone 40 processes it should be stressed that the tone 40 is run as itself and that fishing cognition is run into the process between cycles of command and acknowledgment and command and acknowledgment after thorough acknowledgment one can fish for cognition thus pausing momentarily in the process get things straightened out maintain arc with the preclear and then go on with the tone 40 process one does not enter fishing cognition between the command and the acknowledgment one never reacts to what the preclear is doing the instant that the preclear does it otherwise one educates the preclear to stop one training stress here is that tone 40 process is not run on an automaton basis history developed by l ron hubbard in washington dc in 1957 while developing cch on the following notes from lrhs notebook i use processes to restimulate thought or action and when this happens i fish out cognition and either continue the process or bridge to the next process it was developed basically to keep auditors in communication with the preclear since tone 40 processes give some auditors when they are studying them the idea that they are

_____________________________________________________________________ 1 july 1957 the rehabilitation of abilities in this pab i want to discuss question which many field auditors have confronted withie that of increasing the preclears willingness in practicing musical instrument or to keep writing or just to regain lost ability if you take an individual and make him play musical instrument as parents and schools do his ability to play that instrument will not improve we would first have to consult with him as to what his ambitions are he would eventually at least have to agree with the fact that it is good thing to play an instrument once in while we find bad boy he cannot be put in school and has to be sent to military school they are going to force him in order to change him occasionally this bad boy is sent to school which simply thinks the best way to handle such cases is to find something in which he is interested and to allow him to do it such school once existed in california and consecutively produced geniuses the roster of world war iis scientists practically marched from that particular school they figured that it must have been the example set by the professor his purity in not smoking cigars or something like that what actually happened was this they took boy with whom nobody got any results and said isnt there anything you would like to do the boy said and they answered well fuss around in the lab or grounds or something and someday you may make up your mind the boy thought this over and decided that he wanted to be chemist nobody ever sent him to class and told him to crack book and nobody ever complained very much when he blew up something in the laboratory and the next thing you knew the boy was an excellent chemist nobody interrupted his desire to be chemist it existed then and from that point on he was not himself interrupting his willingness to be chemist educationally this is very interesting point supposing we had only few minutes as coach on football team and we wanted to pick out the number of men who were going to be the first squad and quickly put them in good shape so that they could win special game we would only have to ask this question now i want any one of you people whose desire to be football player stems from the age of ten to step forward maybe half of the squad would step forward here would be your first team what about the little runt that has only been the water boy he is the best quarterback in the world because he wanted to be football player but the man who was merely qualified and who thought it was good way to get through school get scholarship some coaching or make couple of dollars or perhaps only really wanted lots of women because he knew that women gyrated around football players will utterly pulverize the team because he is an unsupportable person he is doing this on via and he isnt really willing to be member of football team his willingness is missingnow lets have this ordinary team play against team of allstars and they will make the allstars look like bunch of punks it is too simple method of selection for anybody ever to have used you could by series of almost straightwire questions ask fellow who has difficulty in playing trumpet can you recall time when somebody told you it was bad thing to play trumpet this limited process might stand up for two or three questions and you might be able to key out the lock he has against being person who plays trumpet and his ability to play trumpet goes up then somebody else walks up to him and tells him something about how bad it is to be trumpeter and he goes right back to where he was it is not permanent improvement at all it is possible that person who was very good on the piano in his last life is born into family who didnt have piano why because he cannot confront one there isnt one now because he cannot have one now he starts to learn something about this and he goes along fine until he thinks that he ought to have an upright piano to practice on this has been restimulated little and his parents say to him oh i dont know thats much too expensive youll have to pick something else somebody has raised an objection to it well his willingness at that time is exerted in the direction of trying to be part of this new team called the family and this is being subordinate and so is his idea of playing the piano he doesnt force the matter but that confirms to him the scarcity of pianos he is liable from then on not to be able to play note or even learn how to read music he is just as liable to be stopped again the willingness to write is systematically killed in american universities i have lectured on writing to harvard university students many times and they have asked how one develops style personally as far as style was concerned all one had to do was express what he wanted to say and that was style it is more complicated than this and sometimes just for gags why write in the valence of shakespeare or other literary figure i have said to these students stylewell i can tell you how you would find out whether you had style or not or how to develop one just sit down and write hundred thousand words the class fainted one hundred thousand words nobody could write one hundred thousand words from there on out that killed it what was this all about we obviously had class of writers that had been carefully trained to be very good in every line they wrote that isnt how you write at all you write that is all you do write for lots of people about lots of things these students were looking for some magic sesame and the professor there is carefully monitoring them of quality quality quality correcting their ideas punctuation marks their schematics and so on correct correct correct chop chop chop for there isnt going to be writer in this class you dogs the final result of this is complete unwillingness to write it is true that person can be quantitatively coaxed into doing something that he apparently couldnt do before but it is only when you carelessly or accidentally tripped over this having confronting contribute to mechanism writing lies in the band of contribute to if you have to write in order to have you rather suffer for it because an art is almost totally in create contribute to and it goes between those two lines and when those are fallen away from you get fouled up if person keeps writing or talking pointlessly like making out government forms to be sent to the state department or internal revenue you know nobody is ever going to read any part of them and you could make these forever and your willingness to do so would go by the boards eventually because there is communication formula involved there is havingness confrontingness contributingtoness people get so bad about this that they cannot fill out reports the revenue down here deprives itself of billions of dollars of revenue every year not because people are unwilling to pay their income tax but because they are longer capable of confronting form then after that the effort is not to fill out the formpeople will permit you to take things away from them if you do it gracefully and dont upset their willingness too much the way you make greedy or selfish child is to make him against his will give up things to other children you will eventually drive him into the only one category parents usually never consult the childs willingness they consult his havingness handle it and they have spoilt child it is interesting to watch child that has been around somebody who always consulted him but didnt take very good care of him as opposed to child who had the best of care but who never was consulted little boy is sitting on the floor playing with blocks and balls and is having good time along comes the nurse and picks him up and takes him into the other room and changes his diapers and he screams bloody murder the whole way he doesnt like it she keeps on doing this to him placing him around never consulting his power of choice and he will eventually grow up obsessed with the power of choice he has to have his way he becomes very didactic he is trying to hold down the last rungs of it and his ability will be correspondingly poor particularly in the handling of people now this is quite different you know the child is hungry or this or that and you know he ought to eat the child will eat if he is kept on some sort of routine supper is at 600 and he will get used to eating at 600 the willingness never quite overwhelmed him he finds out the food is there at 600 and so he makes up his mind to eat at 600 you provide the havingness and he provides the willingness if you dont override that he will never have any trouble about food then somebody comes along and talks to him and says hey wouldnt you like to go into the other room and change your clothes and the answer is i am afraid that you are making horrible mistake if you proceed from that point on the basis of well ill give you piece of candy persuade seduce coax etc that is psychology the way psychologists handle situations and it doesnt really work you take one of two courses either you run expert 8c with lots of twoway communication and so on or you just let him grow there is other choice kids dont like to be mauled and pulled around and not consulted you can talk to child and if your arc is good with him you can make him do all sorts of things he will touch the floor his head point you out and find the table he will fool around for while and after that you can just say do so and so and lets go and eat and he will do it he has found out that your commands are not necessarily going to override the totality of his willingness so your commands are therefore not dangerous you have confronted him and he can confront you therefore you and he can do something suzie always gets kick out of this because i am always having my children bring slippers and caps and other things and they sometimes bring some of the most outrageous errors and i always thank them very much take it and as brandnew thought say go and put these in the closet now and they do very happy about it they never get the idea it is wrong just because they have made mistake it is quite amazing because when i say to one of them well how about going to bed huh the answer is okay child sometimes says i want to stay up with you and they insist on doing so exerting their power of choice just letting child do what he is doing and not interfering with him and not running any 8c on him is psychology you might as well shoot child as to let his circuits run away with him they are never going to be in communication with anybody they wont grow or get experience in life for they didnt change their havingness they didnt have to change their mind work exercise or do anything but they respond very readily to good 8c and communication but it certainly takes good communication to override thisnot persuasion but good communicationpeople think that persuasion works with children it doesnt its communication that does the trick you say well its time for you to go to bed now and he says dont stay on the subject leave it alone and just talk about something else what did you do today where how oh did you is that fact well how about going to bed and the answer will be okay one doesnt have to use force go into communication with the child and control follows this as an inevitability omit control from the beginning when bringing up child and he who looks to you for lot of his direction and control is gypped he thinks you dont care about him however as in the case with the playing of musical instruments learning of languages or the arts and abilities consult the preclears or childs willingness to restore an ability run this technique from slp 8 rehabilitation of abilities for any ability the preclear always wanted to have lost and couldnt do for example for the speaking of arabic mock up arabic objects keep it from going away then mock up arab men women children stop him her from talking start him her talking should it be particular musical instrument the preclear wants to play have him mock up the instrument make it solid keep it from going away stop and start it playing and this will rehabilitate his abilityif procedure cch has been run before l ron hubbardhubbard communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 1 july 1957 addition to the auditors code 17 never use scientology to obtain personal and unusual favors or unusual compliance from the preclear for the auditors own personal profit l ron hubbard5707c15 18acc1 what is scientology scientology is aimed at total know since other know is total it is hard to describe scientology since there is other datum of comparable magnitude only one other organization of knowledge on earth has had similar goal buddhism it squirreled when it went into tibet as lamaism but there was faith in buddhism it was analytical the best refuge to take when asked what scientology is would be refuge into incomprehensibility by saying that it is epistemology buddhism and scientology both try to select out the importances of life and fill mans void of knowledge with accurate observation buddha could be called the first scientist authority has nothing to do with knowledge those things i tell you are true are not true because i tell you they are true and if anything i tell you or have ever told you is discovered to differ from the individual observation be it good observation then it isnt true we have certain positive procedures as valuable as they are if they incline us to lock at them not at what they help us to look at if they lead us to believe that they are thing not means to doing another thing we will be in the same blind condition as presentday religions and social sciences and we will have to rediscover our blindness on the way up wherever we develop an area of special knowledge such as trs and processes we must understand that they are means to an end not an end in themselves someone who forgot what trs were could in theory do them all beautifully but be unable to use them in session because he had forgotten what they were for to create the proper communication atmosphere for the session there is an enormous wonderland below blindness this keeps people from seeing their blindness using alice in wonderland in trs is joke based on this imagined knowledge the wonderland is the dispersal that results from the individuals reaction to being kicked in the teeth when he looks at something he wont look again eventually he decides not to look at anything but if he catches sight of something he will go on via and look at something else instead this is how the wonderland of the social sciences was created someone couldnt confront man so he turned around and created myth about man he must have been blind never to have noticed exteriorization or to have recorded the existence of the phenomenon somewhere thetan has the ability to create form to create universes when the ability dims out when he is not doing it very intelligently he begins to see things in the universe that he doesnt want to look at then he disperses and combines his ability to create and to notis the universe he then builds is below the level of the universe he is in you have to bring him up north for him to discover that he is in trappab 116 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 3537 fitzroy street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 15 july 1957 solids and chronic somatics i am giving you in this pab my latest findings in the handling of chronic somatics however i would like to point out that before this technique can be run on given preclear you must have him thoroughly under controlie the person his attention and thoughts it is way of running problems of comparable magnitude to chronic somatic not all people can do this immediately if they cannot make things solid it may even be very dangerous to run but it does handle the chronic somatic providing you have already run the preclear on cch communication control havingness when you have done this you can come back again substituting this process for problems of comparable magnitude to the chronic somatic the preclear must be able to make things solid he has got to have his attention under your control and have his body under control he must also be able to make things solid objectively ie look at the wall and make it little more solid and subjectively ie having the preclear make the mockups little more solid which is to say that you would have to take the preclear through procedure cch before this would work but on the next time through you could kill his chronic somatic deader than mackerel you would simply omit running problem of comparable magnitude to the chronic somatic and run the intensive in this manner 1 present time problem 2 control in all its facets 3 8c keep it from going away 4 8c hold it still 5 8c make it little more solid 6 subjective havingness make the mockups little more solid 7 then and now solids then go right back to wondering if he had any problems about auditing which is now the present time problemif people are very low on havingness the auditing always becomes present time problem go up again into control and make sure that you have the preclear thoroughly under control run through the 7 steps again only then would it be safe to run this techniquethis process joins up phenomenon which has been around for years and which was never known to be turned on at will this phenomenon is he knew about it all the time all auditors know this phenomenon the preclear has sinusitisit is from johnny punching him in the nose when he was fiveand he says yes but i knew it all the time well he never knew it all the time because he had sinusitis it is only after he realizes that he knew it all the time that he gets well that is the recovery of the game which underlies the game he has been playing that is the hidden game the most disturbing thing in the world is to have preclear that you have been working on cognite he says well yes my mother was actually prostitute he never realized that before and you say what do you know about that and he says i knew it all the time he knew it all the time but he couldnt identify what it was that he knew all the time when we talk about cognitions we are actually looking for the master cognition which is i knew it all the time only he didnt know it all the time in other words he recovered the hidden game it is the other game that we have suddenly got sight of football made him sick but all of sudden we spotted lacrosse or vice versa he knew all the time that it was lacrosse that made him this sick or football that made him this sick he knew it all the time but only now is he well how do we trigger this at will the postulate of change is ought to beshould be limited just as change is on any other level but awfully effective the postulate which underlies havingness is enough havingness is quantitative so you cannot run this without running the whole works evidently he would have to be able to mock up hence the first pass at this in cch he would have to be able to make things little more solid otherwise you wouldnt be able to risk this one but it evidently turns on rather at will this i knew it all the time in other words the hidden game you run the process this way tell the preclear to mock up enough _ whatever the chronic somatic is and make it little more solid for example take case of obnosisif you are not good at observing you will miss on this every time this is one of the reasons why we have more or less unconsciously been stressing obnosis the auditor has to be able to look at somebodyand it is not the fellows belief that all women are bad he is sitting there with chronic sore throat complete glandular arrest with club in his hands and you are trying to read his thoughts out of all these things take the one thing he is complaining abouta sore throat the first thing you do is run the bad condition then just run the condition after that the terminal and you will shift his attention and turn off this i knew it all the time i knew my mother used to choke only he didnt because before that he told you well mothers very sweet girl very nice to i dont know why i never turned out all right have him mock up enough sore throats and make it little more solid then mock up enough sore throat singular and make it little more solid and good mock up enough sore throat and by this time he will say well yes so and so and so probably his attention shifted and this is method of doing it it has shifted his attention from the badness of the condition to the condition mock up enough throat he has condition known as throat and this oddly enough in this particular instance becomes the solid for the terminalenough throat only it will mean two different things to the preclear and you want the preclear to duplicate your commands exactly which he will only do if he is thoroughly under your controllet us take bad eyesight for an example although this is not necessarily the process you would use the preclear came to you to be audited because he had shooting pains in his right kneecap he has never been able to work because of it draws compensation as result of the compensation he has an easy life and this is control mechanism if you take this away from him against his better judgments the difficulty you will have in keeping him in session thereafter is absolutely zero he has bad eyesight and you have him mock up enough bad eyesight and make it little more solid few times enough eyesight condition or circumstance make it little more solid enough eyes and make them little more solid there is his chronic somatic i have guarantee whatsoever that this will work in all cases at all times because i cannot guarantee that you will have him in condition whereby he can execute the commands when given he must be in condition whereby he can execute the auditing commands and if the auditing commands are mock it up which means he has got to be able to get mockups which you can turn on with cchhe has to be in condition where you have some guarantee that you can control his thoughts you can say put an emotion in the wall he will feel the wall mentally but he didnt do what you said therefore you dont have his thoughts under control in other words the persons attention and thoughts must be under your control before this works but when you have accomplished this this process works with thud l ron hubbard5707c17 18acc3 theory and definitions of auditing the pc is less than or equal to the bank and the auditor is less than or equal to the bank but the pc auditor is greater than the bank person cannot audit himself because the basic ingredient of all auditing is communication and person cannot really talk to himself especially in pt because talking to oneself puts half the cycle out of pt someone could mock up circuit that talks back or assume valence that feeds the past back to him where he thinks something is feeding him an effect from the past or talking to him when person self audits he uses these circuits to feed stuff back to him it gets him nowhere the best he could do would be to handle mental image picture which was seeking to handle him or to handle the environment the only things in the bank that give the pc trouble are the moments he didnt handle the worst moments when he gets pictures of these moments he tends to go out of control and backs off or boils off an auditor would acknowledge get him to confront it only communication got him into his mess only communication can get him out therefore there has to be another terminal for him to communicate to in 1952 we got scientology different approach to the problem of the bank instead of erasing the bank we put the person himself in good enough condition so that he can handle anything thats real clear not someone with blank bank the things that are right with person are the things that are wrong with the person what is wrong with being is what the being can do and what the being is any scale in scientology could be drawn as v actually as flare exponential perhaps distance tolerance is the key to the affinity scales distance narrows as person gets into worse condition he has to be closer and closer to things to know they are real high on the scale tremendous distances can be tolerated here there is also lots of trust at the bottom distance is tolerable persons ability to handle things depends on his ability to handle distance he interiorizes into those things that he cant trust until he is the thing he distrusts person can control at distance with comm as control diminishes he loses reach cant project intention cant trust etc tone goes down with competence going down auditing is an expansion of distance pc starts with inverted distance trying to escape or with close distance solid comm line as in cch1 however running away from things tends to make them stay with them body of soldiers running away from the enemy goes to pieces they dont reform regroup cant sustain discipline when you run away part of you stays there also when running away or being unable to tolerate proximity being has concept of distance theres place to hide anyhow the part that stay there is the mip if one cant occupy some part of the universe the only recourse is dispersal which closes actual distance the thetan never gives up running what part of that incident could you confront loosens it up unsticks the person from it people never have trouble with situations they have confronted only with those from which they ran away this is an example of that which you resist you become the subzero tone scale shows the distance going inverted as one tries to run one thing establishes distance communication but it has to be real communication not inval and eval it has to be to the person space is viewpoint of dimension ie lookingness ie communication communication can have closure factor if it is just looking but two thetans in real two way communication can hold their distance and go upscale if you find that when two people talk the longer they talk the closer they get smashed together then one of them isnt communicating when people dont know what something is they have trouble communicating with it when someone tries to communicate with the bank it kicks back and thus gives the thetan the idea that he is punished for communicating but his facsimiles arent real in dianetics we thought person somehow took and stored all these pictures but there is not really amechanism like the file clerk of taking and storing these pictures the object is still there grown thin thats picture every consecutive moment of the universe from its beginning until now is potentially as solid as it was then the only reason it isnt as solid is that you dont to confront it so you thinned it down the only serious reactive pictures are the thinnies one made before or as one way from something unconfrontable this sounds complex but its only problem in change of space you dont carry the pictures you left viewpoint there when you didnt totally confront something and it is still looking all you need to do is to get someone to be willing to confront old universes he wouldnt confront before and you will have clear summary auditing is to raise the ability of another person so that he can handle the bank the body others etc it is communication processhubbard communications

confidence in being able to audit should be raised history developed by lrh for the 18th advanced clinical course in washington dc july 1957 training 6 8c remains itself but is changed as follows number training 6 name 8c commands first half of session period student silently steers coachs body around room not even to walls quietly starting turning and stopping coachs body second part of session commands are look at that wall thank you walk over to that wall thank you with your right hand touch that wall thank you turn around thank you student may touch coachs body position student and coach walking side by side student always on coachs right except when turning coach purpose first part to accustom student to moving another body than his own without verbal communication second part to accustom student to move another body by and while giving auditing commands and to accustom student to proper commands of 8ctraining stress complete crisp precision of movement and commands student as in any other tr except tr 5 is flunked only for current and preceding trs thus in this case the coach flunks student for every hesitation or nervousness in moving body for every flub of command for poor confronting for bad communication of command for poor acknowledgment for poor repetition of command and for failing to handle origins by coach history developed by lrh in camden new

parts of man arc and states that the ability to communicate on 8 dynamics must be regained in order to lead successful spiritual life the book will then give process to rehabilitate communication it is based on our old recall secret the version is entirely straight wire the reason secrets cannot be dredged up in people is because they will not tell them this process bypasses divulgence of data and works well without informing on oneself the process the auditor explains to the pc that he is not looking for hidden data to evaluate it he is only asking the pc to look at the data the auditor then makes list of valences paying great attention to those the pc considers unimportant or is very slow to divulge then the auditor takes this list and runs repetitive straight wire 1951 as follows think of something you might withhold from valence he repeats this question over and over until comm lag is present he never says something else you might withhold because auditor wants pc to think of some of these many times before selecting another valence auditor runs little locational or trio he then takes next valence the same way the list is covered once then the same list is covered again the object is speed cover many people given time the auditor can do the same thing on all dynamics variation instead of valence body parts may be used think of something you might withhold about your body part leave sexual parts or obvious psychosomatic difficulties until last dont begin on withered arm pc cant cut itsummary it is amusing to realize that this process overlords all early psychotherapies but they using this effort to locate secrets thought that divulgence and confession were the therapeutic agents these have bearing on the workability further early efforts naively thought there was one secret per case actually there are billions it is easy to get into past lives on this basic secret is that one lived before this can be emetered with great success if the auditor realizes that the meter is only useful to find out if valence or dynamic is hot or flat locating actual data for the auditor to know about is useless to the process itself eight or eight thousand or eight billion secrets later will discover the pc in better communication this is our only goal warning the invasion of privacyhorror ofcan stop the process cold if the auditor is too nosey the auditor will strike data gusher sooner or later in the pc it is unimportant the process may run down havingness the secret mechanism is also used by pc to keep body from going away some address to this last

office 3537 fitzroy street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 1 august 1957 confronting present time we all know about the unreality of processes too high for preclear you ask him to do something too high for him and he oddly enough can do it he can get the idea of doing it and he will even tell you he is doing it some preclears can actually walk around and touch the walls for as long as you want them to and it doesnt affect them it means that particular preclear who is doing this has responsibility whatsoever for walking around and touching the walls it doesnt affect him except that irresponsibility is running out all the time i dont know if there is such thing as technique that is thoroughly above the preclears ability to run it is only much longer reach i have taken very badoff case and told him to mock up scene which everybody could see i told him to do this over and over and over and i turned his mockups on brilliantly i have said in congress create that wall etc the funny part is that it almost killed the audience and they didnt even spot what it was during the congress that almost mowed them down they thought something else was responsible for it they complained about two or three other processes which if run on individuals would hardly affect them at all but they didnt complain about this one we were making them confront the wall create the wall take ownership of the wall take ownership of the universe and it was so far from them that they were unaware that they couldnt do it when you can imagine people walking up and down the street out here being unaware of the fact that they are unable to confront the street you have got aberration really nailed their irresponsibility has grown to the point of not even knowing they cannot to the point of doing it all the time you process them for while and they will just become aghast at confronting the street it feels all right to them for while and all of sudden they will get somatic and flinch here and they are not sure that they want to touch that tree they are actually coming upscale toward this action people evidently get interiorized into universe and then dont ever exteriorize it is because they find more and more in it that they are unwilling to confront so their awareness of its existence drops all blindness is an extreme unawareness for instance if one were all wound up with some other person and that other person died or disappeared there was too much absent in present time but this is not factual as writer in the new york area i used to go down to the village with some of the boys and used to have some knockdowndragout arguments discussions personal feuds brawlings etc we were always doing something wild or weird crowd of us went up to sing sing one time just to see how it felt to sit in an electric chair we were always having criminals and things electrocuted in stories in order to know how they felt we walked through the green door we were always doing something like this and life looked very alive and full and it seemed impossible to reach through it or to it or to exhaust it in any way looking back after long time and at long distance it seems to very much like new york and the villagedull andit is all tame and long time ago but that is merely because i am not in contact with it the same dramas still go on to give you an idea of short circuits an artist hannes boks nextdoor neighbor was walking past thrift shop and bought painting because she wanted the frame when she got home she wiped off some of the dust and found out that the painting was submission to the new york worlds fair in 1939 it had the artists name on it so hannes bok took look at it and said thats ron wrote to to find out about this and that was right she wants to give the painting to and is sending it here in other words there are all kinds of wild little actions randomities short circuits and so forth going on in the world this one was intimately enough connected with that i would be alerted to it but if i were in the scene there would be all kinds of actions that would only vaguely come close to this in which i would be vitally interested why they also concern now because i am part of the scene so at this distance i am aware of new york because something intimately concerned but in new york everything would concern so i would be intimately interested in it people become rather easily convinced there isnt much in present time i have seen race drivers talking about their humdrum lives it is wild you talk to these twa and american airline pilots they think their life is little bit humdrum i was down at the airport the other evening to meet couple coming in from ireland and the snow was coming down thickly quarter of century ago any wooden propellor trying to chew through that much snow would have just been torn into splinters at once well evidently steel propellor isnt affected the leading edges dont gather ice any more and lot of other things dont occur i know that airplanes have been made totally proof but pilots were flying through this snow on schedule and landing and taking off and continuing airline schedules and i could hardly see the length of the administration building and i imagine that if id gone into the pilots shack where they were checking in they would have been saying aw its just another darned night and they would wish they could do something interesting in such case man has disconnected himself to some degree from present time and therefore not much in present time affects him connectedness as process will help to remedy this condition look around here and find something you wouldnt mind making connect with you and see that he makes it connect with him and not him with the object you might say that there is so much danger in present time that he must disconnect most of the present time from himself as i was saying the personal interest factor extends from new york to washington dc when something personal occurs well if you were in new york there would be lot of personal things occurringwhat cab driver said to another cab driver would become personal matteron higher dynamic this is by the way the dwindling scale of the dynamics you are looking at when you look at distance from time itself seems to strip away from us our adventures and objects and havingness but havingness is only an awareness of existence why we so readily consent to have present time stripped away at this mad rate is quite interesting because we are to marked degree in control of it for instance i had time shift on the other day rather inexplicably and startlingly and it upset for little while as i was traveling through time at the usual routine rate of speed which would be my rate of passage through time and i had lot of things to get done i accidentally extended time on some kind of an automaticity i hadnt been aware of i got lot of things done and came back and found that five minutes had passed and it upset because about twoandahalf hours should have passedso concept of time is something which is quite variable it sometimes changes on us when we skid or take our fingers off it our machinery which is carefully saying one second one second one second slips over into the old machine which we had which said one secondonesecond without at the same time impeding our motion motion is not necessarily related to the abstract time it only appears to be but why are people so anxious why do people have so little time as they go downscale it is quite interesting but they do have less and less time the further downscale they go well they are just that anxious to have present time stripped away and they are counting on this mechanism of the universe which will take this present time away and dispose of the walls space and in just little time they hope not to be there any longer some part of them is very frantic although they appear to be very calm therefore they avidly consent to this thing and then one day they complain second postulate that they havent enough time to do anything therefore they cannot do anything quite fascinating enigma if you said total responsibility you would be saying to admit the authorship of be willing to admit the authorship of any created thing anywhere whether yours or anothers and misresponsibility would be the miscalling of authorship in other words those things which you yourself had done or made you would say i did or made these things and those things which other people had made you would say you had made them you thus get this misresponsibility now total responsibility would come out of not just the assignment of the correct authorship to everything and would be the fact act or final consequence of being willing to do so only willingness is necessary one has to be willing to do that and that is the state of mind you should bring your preclear intoonly willing to do that as far as anchor points are concerned if person made them and said that he made them all will be well but if he said he didnt make them when he actually made them that would be horrible that is misresponsibility for instance if you have preclear mock up an anchor point and actually fit it into some point in his skull in contradistinction to the others he will get headache why should he get headache since the anchor point belongs there because he didnt make those anchor points now he makes one and he puts one in and he is assuming ownership of the others he didnt find the anchor point that belonged there and put it there and then say well i put it there but i didnt make it if he had done that he wouldnt have had headache and the anchor point would be there mishandling of life however is not as serious as the desire to mishandle it an anxiety to mishandle life willingness to mishandle it or an unawareness that one is unwilling to handle it properly are the aberrative factors not the actual mishandling of it any thetan can play the game of saying well i made these body anchor points he did it consciously and he can play that game but to have to admit that from some exterior compulsion would be something else take for an example you having to take charge of the mimeograph machine which is running badly it is not your department you dont desire to take it over but you have to and the next thing you know is that you have busted the mimeograph machine what happened here one sees people do this in offices all the time one thinks one is being forced to take responsibility and one is unwilling to take that responsibility thinking it belongs to someone else so that correction under duress that is to say misownership and misresponsibility under duressalways has grave consequencesthis works in many fields for example traffic cop stops you for speeding and comes up alongside of the wheel and says that you were speeding and you say yes i was speeding he says you have been doing 65 miles an hour and you correct him and say 68 officer and he says well it is pretty slippery today and you say i know it it unnerves him he may or may not give you ticket but the chances of his giving you one are much cut down you are not buttering him up or telling him that you have learned better now or anything of the sort but saying the exact facts of the case tends to asis them you have knocked out his first postulate l ron hubbardacc bulletin 10 august 1957 cch 18 this is cch 18 named after the 18th acc the following process is to be run by students on

clear scientology clear would be able to confront the physical universe other bodies his own body other minds his own mind and other beingswithout trimmings the first step on this road is the drill called training 0confronting do it for at least 25 hours and youll never have trouble with preclear systems allowed both feet flat on the floor twitches squirms talk if you have difficulty feel the floor and your chair back as you sit that adds confronting the universe confronting isnt just lookingso dont try to confront with your eyeballs only do it and may you never be the same again nothing

recommendations concerning us validation of certificates were made by the validation committee of the freedom congress held july 4 through 7 at the shoreham hotel in washington dc and accepted by the congress and myself for the us scientologists play the game of life they put life into living homo sapiens lets life live him and this planet has large lack of people who knowingly play the game of life the reality of the game of life can only be communicated by those who play it scientologists do play the game our ability as players determines how well and how swiftly we win at making life game for all men and this is one of the goals of scientology our direct ability to control to communicate and to have men women groups and governments determines the degree to which we can create game of life and knowledge of livingness to all men your ability as scientologist to play and to communicate playingness and livingness will determine how soon and how well we can win the validation program can better enable you to play and live on all dynamics matter how well you are doing now truthfully can you be more able yes man will ordinarily light fire by rubbing dry sticks together when he can use match the match is obviously better tool the validation program will sharpen your old tools and provide you with better ones we have today in scientology better communication control and havingness on ability than ever before the validation program is intended to give every professional scientologist the basic tools of livingness and the ability to use them these are his by right of his own very existence by right of the fact that he helped build the better bridge that ron hubbard asked him to help build and by right of the fact that he cannot help but want to play the game better once he realizes that there really is better level of game now in existence through his participation in this program toward this end we the validation committee propose and recommend the following procedures dedicating them to mankind and the creation of human ability 1 that there be two classifications of validation the professional auditor of any grade coached in training drills and cch processes and passed by the hco board of review and b doctors of scientology coached and trained in the use and coaching of these skills and validated by the hco board of review to both use cch processes and coach others in their use subject to approval by the hco board of review 2 we further recommend that travelling hco board of review be organized to sit in major cities for the purpose of validating for the use of cch processes those professional auditors coached by doctors of scientology in the field3 that notification be sent to every professional auditor in the field that his professional certificate of whatever grade is as valid today and as honored as it was upon the day it was issued 4 that doctors of scientology authorized to coach other professional auditors in training drills and cch processes take responsibility for their areas in seeing to it that all professional auditors those holding professional certificates in their respective areas are personally contacted and the purposes of the 1957 validation program are thoroughly and carefully communicated and received we of this committee deem ourselves highly honored at having been selected for this recommending committee we pledge our cooperation in this 1957 validation program and urge the fullest cooperation by all auditors everywhere that we may have for the first time in earths recorded

_____________________________________________________________________ 1 september 1957 the big auditing problem if you were to take mediumly good race driver and you wanted to make out of him championship race driver im afraid you would have to train him from scratch and you would have to train him with great deal more ardor than you would have to train just kid that just walked in from kokomo with an interest in motors nevertheless if you were successful in training mediumly good race driver with lot of races behind him straight from scratch and all the way through you would have championship race driverthere would be doubt about this whatever whereas the kid from kokomo might or might not i will tell you at once the first and foremost factor and that is auditing does require certain amount of stamina it takes certain amount of what it takes just to stay around scientologythere is that you see it takes certain amount ofto use technical term guts you know that in the first place the problem of living is complicated by the fact that you know what the other fellow is doing and he doesnt you go down to the bank and your communication is disturbed by the degree that you know the fellow behind the tellers window is 15 the like of which youve never seen before and he thinks hes just good average human being doing job and you count your change more carefully than you would on some other bank teller now there is tremendous advantage in this you dont walk around all the time in figurefigure wondering whats wrong with you because you dont always get along invariably with other people uniformly well now you realize that the bulk of the human race is walking around with the belief that there is something wrong somewhere but they dont quite know what it is and it worries them now when you get up to degree where you have some idea of this worry you are aware of the factors which exist the fact that your awareness has increased is all in your favor one of the great truths of scientology is that increased awareness is the only factor which offers any road out that is an awfully simple truth but youll find out that people dont know that they think that less awareness is the road out and that is the road down into the basement all rightyou live in world that is trying right now to commit suicide on the grandest scale it has ever attempted although i will say that when they dug up that last cave down in the middle east and found seven civilizations they did find under the shreds of the seventh civilization green glass which looked awfully like the green glass from an atomic explosion out in the middle of the new mexican desert in other words tens of thousands of years ago there was evidently another atomic blast and perhaps everybody has been coming forward through barbarism and so on up the lineit is quite amusing to notice that atomic radiation does reverse the genetic line it gives throwback it produces the more original forms so you would expect the human race at this time to be walking toward greater and greater individual survival and less and less group survival and here you are with some kind of notion of the fact that the third dynamic exists and you are able to march out bit on the third dynamic and the rest of the world is retreating back to the first dynamicprobably an inverted first i just had report from our public relations unit concerning the amount of attention being paid to injured persons alongside the road and on the street and the report summed up that practically attention was being paid now to anybody who was injured that is quite interesting because it has suffered according to public relations considerable shift in attitude during the last two months you are quite well aware of the fact that there might be just tiny amount of radiation in the air which would never really damage anybody physically at all yet which would restimulate people into heavy unknowing games condition so they would begin to act more and more hectic and on the first dynamic this would be one of the first symptoms that you would discover in societyeverybody takes out on the only one classification now that is the road to death it doesnt matter whether or not the society at large ever is atombombed that point is not of any great interest to us it is of great interest to us however that the effects of radiation and its presence in the society drives people down the dynamics all right so although it is pretty hard to live around scientology very often somebody tells you know that is awfully restimulative material which is in these lectures ive heard this said two or three times oh i dont know ive sat through lot of lectures and it just restimulated and im in terrible shape now and ive also heard somebody in the organization look at remark like this and laugh they say well the only real difference is that youre in terrible shape thats sure but now you know it and if youre in bad shape its better to know it than not know it thats for sure what happens to scientology and scientologists in world of this character what happens to us why should we know what we know and know it well and so on thats because your basic attitude toward the world at large will have to be more and more an auditors attitude toward preclear if you are going to accomplish any survival at all to get anybody to do anything will probably require an auditor here in the near future i will give you an idea of this in north africa they had the arab with the gun and whip he could force people to do things with gun and whip and he accomplished tremendous amount of extermination but he certainly didnt advance that civilization very much in south africa they had bit of the whip but everybody just gave up the south african native is probably the one impossible person to train in the entire worldhe is probably impossible by any human standard ill give you an example south african native is being shown how to sow crops and he has basket and hes got some seed and hes walking along back of the harrow discand he is supposed to throw seed out this way seed out this way seed out that way seed out this way white man is riding little tractor thats pulling the disc and scraping the soil for the seed and this scene was enacted and was witnessed and was told to with considerable hilarity as some kind of an idea of learning rate the white man was sitting on the little tractor pulling the harrow the native along behind him sowing the seed straight down in handfuls on the ground the white man got off the tractor came back to the native took the basket away from him put his hand in the basket threw it to the right put his hand in the basket threw it to the left and gave it back to the native and the native waited the white man got on the tractor drove along and the native took handful out of the basket and threw it straight on the ground so the white man got off the tractor came back took the basket away from the native showed the native throw it to the right throw it to the left gave it back to the native took his seat again on the tractor the native followed along behind took handfuls and threw it straight on the groundand this went on for very long time the native never did throw any handfuls of seed to the right and left never did that is farming in south africa now did anything ever come along and change that yes man had to cease to be homo sapiens and had to become homo scientologicus in order to accomplish any action that was anywhere near efficient in south africa and we have had some auditors in south africa who have actually succeeded in training natives easily and well and have successfully managed large organizations there thats certainly something now with these people it was still possible to get something done but what had this native done was this native what we think of as primitive stock we make great many mistakes we say child is in native state native is in native state people are in barbaric condition and then they grow up and become civilized how do we know that this barbaric condition isnt retrogression from highly civilized condition back to an only one category how do we know that isnt true how do we know that that native didnt at one time achieve great civilization of culture which then collapsed on him and he went back into state of being barbarian but the point is is this true that native is in clearer state and is it true that it requires livingness to advance somebody in that crude state up to condition of ability that is not true the child the primitive the native are in retrograded states they are worse off than somebody who is at civilized or thinking or analytical level i will give you an interesting example of this if you can tell the difference between lot of little kids you run into and psychos ill give you medal now the funny part of it is that little kids have something to hope for they have the future to grow up into and thats their only asset almost everything else is on the debit side of the column here is this poor devil who has been slugged hes just lost body hes been put into state of anxiety here hes got another body is it going to get along right or isnt it hes got the hope that it will grow and that alone can carry him forward and color the world brightly for him but at the same time he is suffering from death shock and because he is suffering from death shock he is coming along very timidly with his learning now that is the condition little kid is in and when you know that little kid is in that condition boy can you handle him you dont label him with this omnipresent overused term insane or psychotic you dont do that this person is having terrible time trying to adjust himself to his environment and control body which is suffering from many responses he does not understand and he is at his wits end the delusions of children and death delusions are quite similar when person dies and starts to pull out of that body he generally snaps in on himself torrent of facsimiles of one kind or another he has all sorts of weird things that go boomp in the night present themselves at that moment and very often you get preclear who is suffering merely from the death shock and he is psychotic hes crazy he doesnt know whether he is coming or going why because hes surrounded by things he cannot understandand that is the common denominator of all lack of orientation of all aberration its being surrounded by things you cannot understand and child surrounded by these things he cannot understand therefore can produce what we call childhood delusions but i cant find any real difference between these childhood delusions and the delusions being suffered by person about to die or person in an asylum when the kid gets worried hes worried now who can handle him mamas and papas across the face of earth today particularly in america have just about given up we have whole philosophywe hardly dignify it with the name of science or even really dignify it with the name of philosophywhich tells us that the child must be permitted to express himself that you let the child do anything he pleases in any direction that he pleases and he will be all rightnow that is modern psychology at work with children and it is not true child requires understanding and child requires assistance in controlling the environment around him which is already too big too strong and is moving much too fast on him he has to be set good example of 8c i am not now talking about heavy discipline illshow you the shortness of discipline how many people have told you to be good boy or good girl and when you were good boy and good girl they never came to you and said thank you for being good boy or good girl i almost startled little quentin out of his wits couple of evenings ago i told him to be good boy now and go to sleep he was feeling upset stay in bed now get some rest he was very quiet for half an hour i went downstairs again and noticed he was still awake and i said thank you very much for being good boy he smiled looked sort of dazedit really shook him and ever since then hes been sayinghe always says it with enthusiasm but with this he just about bursts the walls hello daddy he is really in communication probably the first time its happened to him in seventysix trillion years you get the idea somebody did give him an order and then did finally acknowledge that he had executed it but there is common lag on the executing of such an order as be good or go to sleep and there is never an auditor there to say thank you never an auditor there to say you did it so life is furnished with these tremendous numbers of unfinished cycles if one is bad it gets acknowledged confirmed and pushed around but if hes good its sort of neglected that is an interesting factor right there but all i am telling you is that children south african natives and now the entirety of this world in which we are living present to us an auditing problem we are rich in being able to understand what is happening in our environment and we are rich also in knowing exactly how to handle such circumstance or condition nobody knew before that is factually true here on earth l ron hubbardissue 54 1957 ca early september the magazine of dianetics and scientology from washington dc more confronting l ron hubbard that which person can confront he can handle the first step of handling anything is gaining an ability to face it it could be said that war continues as threat to man because man cannot confront war the idea of making war so terrible that one will be able to fight it is the exact reverse of factif one wishes to end war the invention of the longbow gunpowder heavy naval cannon machine guns liquid fire and the hydrogen bomb add only more and more certainty that war will continue as each new element which man cannot confront is added to elements he has not been able to confront so far man engages himself upon decreasing ability to handle war we are looking here at the basic anatomy of all problems problems start with an inability to confront anything whether we apply this to domestic quarrels or to insects to garbage dumps or picasso one can always trace the beginning of any existing problem to an unwillingness to confront let us take domestic scene the husband or the wife cannot confront the other cannot confront second dynamic consequences cannot confront the economic burdens and so we have domestic strife the less any of these actually are confronted the more problem they will become it is truism that one never solves anything by running away from it of course one might also say that one never solves cannonballs by baring his breast to them but i assure you that if nobody cared whether cannonballs were fired or not control of people by threat of cannonballs would cease down on skid row where flotsam and jetsam exist to keep the police busy we could not find one man whose basic difficulties whose downfall could not be traced at once to an inability to confront criminal once came to whose entire right side was paralyzed yet this man made his living by walking up to people in alleys striking them and robbing them why he struck people he could not connect with his paralyzed side and arm from his infancy he had been educated not to confront men the nearest he could come to confronting men was to strike them and so his criminal careerthe more the horribleness of crime is deified by television and public press the less the society will be able to handle crime the more formidable is made the juvenile delinquent the less the society will be able to handle the juvenile delinquent in education the more esoteric and difficult subject is made the less the student will be able to handle the subject when subject is made too formidable by an instructor the more the student retreats from it there were for instance some early european mental studies which were so complicated and so incomprehensible and which were sown with such lack of understanding of man that student could possibly confront them in scientology when we have student who has been educated basically in the idea that the mind is so formidable and so complicated that none could confront it or perhaps so bestial and degraded that one would want to we have student who cannot learn scientology he has confused scientology with his earlier training and his difficulty is that he cannot be made to confront the subject of the mind man at large today is in this state with regard to the human spirit for centuries man was educated to believe in demons ghouls and things that went boomp in the night there was an organization in southern europe which capitalized upon this terror and made demons and devils so formidable that at length man could not even face the fact that any of his fellows had souls and thus we entered an entirely materialistic age with the background teaching that one can confront the invisible vengeful religions sought to move forward into foremost place of control naturally it failed to achieve its goal and irreligion became the order of the day thus opening the door for communism and other idiocies although it might seem true that one cannot confront the invisible who said that spirit was always invisible rather let us say that it is impossible for man or anything else to confront the nonexistent and thus when nonexistent gods are invented and are given more roles in the society we discover man becomes so degraded that he cannot even confront the spirit in his fellows much less become moral confronting as subject in itself is intensely interesting indeed there is some evidence that mental image pictures occur only when the individual is unable to confront the circumstances of the picture when this compounds and man is unable to confront anything anywhere he might be considered to have pictures of everything everywhere this is proven by rather interesting test made in 1947 by myself when it was discovered that if an individual could be made to run lock of something he had just seen run another lock on something he had just heard and run an additional lock on something he had just felt he would at length be able to handle much more serious pictures in his mind i discovered although i did not entirely interpret it at the time that an individual has further pictures when he can confront all pictures thus being able to confront everything he has done he is longer troubled with the things he has done supporting this it will be discovered that individuals who progress in an ability to handle pictures eventually have pictures at all this we call clear clear in an absolute sense would be someone who could confront anything and everything in the past present and future unfortunately for the world of action it will be discovered that one who can confront everything does not have to handle anything in support of this is offered that scientology process problems of comparable magnitude in this particular process the individual being processed is asked to select terminal with which he has had difficulty in that the definition of terminal is live mass or something that is capable of causing receiving or relaying communication it will be seen that terminals are quite ordinarily people in the problem category of anyones bank the person is then asked to invent problem of comparable magnitude to that person he is asked to do this many many times it will be found midway in the process that he is willing to do something now about the problems he is having with that person but at the end of the process new and strange thing is found to occur the individual longer feels that he must do something about the problem indeed he can simply confront or regard or view the problem with complete equanimity now an almost mystic quality enters this when it is discovered that the problem in the physical universe about which he has been worried often ceases to exist out there in other words the handling of problem seems to be simply theincrease of ability to confront the problem and when the problem can be totally confronted it longer exists this is strange and miraculous it is hard to believe that an individual who has drunken husband could cure that individual of drink simply by processing out the problem of having drunken husband and yet this has occurred i am not saying here that all the problems of the world could be vanquished simply by running problems of comparable magnitude on few people but neither am i saying that all the problems of the world could not be handled by problems of comparable magnitude on few people and indeed i am at this time undertaking an experiment in this direction on the subject of the atomic bomb it is an oddity that the longer this experiment is continued the less responsive these bombs are to test firing perhaps it could be said however that if there existed one person in the entire universe who could confront all of the universe the problems of the universe for all would deintensify enormously mans difficulties are compound of his cowardices to have difficulties in life all it is necessary to do is to start running away from the business of livingness after that problems of unsolvable magnitude are assured when individuals are restrained from confronting life they accrue vast ability to have difficulties with it there are many other things about confronting which are intensely interesting but these we will take up in later issue an earlier issue of ability carried in it full resume of training 0 the name of which is confronting this drill done for great many hours will be found intensely efficacious in the handling of life wife and husband whose way has not been too smooth would find it extremely interesting in terms of resolution of domestic difficulties to coaudit with this training drill alone each one running it upon the other for at least 25 hours this would have to be done of course on turnabout basis of not more than 2 hours on one and then switch from coach to auditor to run confronting in this fashion and with considerable gain it would be necessary to have some understanding of what coach is and in one of these coauditing teams what an auditor is much fuller understanding of this will be contained in the student manual the team sits in straightbackedpreferably uncomfortably uprightchairs the coach and auditor sit facing each other short distance apart it is the task of the coach to keep the auditor on the ball the auditors feet must be flat on the floor his hands must be in his lap his head must be erect and he must not use any system or method but must simply confront twitching muscle jittering finger alike would be reproached by the coach the coach has several terms he uses the first of these is start at which moment the session begins every time the auditor falls from grace does not hold his position slumps goes anaten unconscious twitches starts his eyes wandering or in any way demonstrates an incorrect position the coach says flunk and corrects the difficulty he then says start again and the session goes on when the person in the role of auditor has been extremely successful over period of time the coach can say win and then again start when the coach wishes to make some comments or give some advice the coach says thats it straightens up this point and then again says start in the coaching itself only these terms are employed start flunk win thats it anything else the coach does or says is disregarded by the auditor unless the coach has said thats it and has then advised on point and then has started again the coach would be at liberty to do anything he wished short of physical violence to make the auditor nervous or upset him the coach could say anything he wished between start and another command as above and the auditor would flunk if he paid any attention or did otherwise than simply confrontedordinarily all the coach does is make sure that the auditor goes on confronting however it should be understood that the drill can be toughened up considerably the coach can do anything to throw the auditor off the simple business of confronting if the auditor so much as twitches smile looks embarrassed clears his throat or in any other way falls off from plain and ordinary confronting it is of course always flunk it should be understood that drill sessions are not auditing sessions in drill session the entire session is in the hands of the coach who is only in vague way the preclear of the session in an auditing session the entire session is in the hands of the auditor there is basic rule here anything which the auditor or student as he is called in the drills is holding tense is the thing with which he is confronting if the auditors eyes begin to smart he is confronting with them if his stomach begins to protrude and becomes tense he is confronting with his stomach if his shoulders or even the back of his head become tense then he is confronting with the shoulders or the back of his head coach who becomes very expert in this can spot these things at once and would in this case give thats it straighten the auditor out on it and would then start the session anew it is interesting that the drill does not consist of confronting with something the drill consists only of confronting therefore confronting with is flunk various nervous traits can be traced at once to trying to confront with something which insists on running away nervous hand for instance would be hand with which the individual is trying to confront something the forward motion of the nervousness would be the effort to make it confront the backward motion of it would be its refusal to confront of course the basic error is confronting with the hand the world is never bright to those who cannot confront it everything is dull gray to defeated army the whole trick of somebody telling you its all bad over there is contained in the fact that he is trying to keep you from confronting something and thus make you retreat from life eyeglasses nervous twitches tensions all of these things stem from an unwillingness to confront when that willingness is repaired these disabilities tend to disappear of course tumultuously married couples may encounter some knockdown and dragout moments in doing this confronting drill however it should be kept in mind that it is the coach in these training drills who is bound by the instructors code and that the only harm that can result would come about if the auditor were permitted to blow leave the session without the coach even with manhandling getting the auditor back into the drill it will be found that these blows occur most frequently when the person being coached in other words the auditor is being given too few wins and is being discouraged by the coach of course things he does wrong should be flunked but it will be found that the way is paved to success with wins therefore when he does it well for period of time the auditor should be told so go into this drill expecting explosions and upsets and simply refuse to give up if they occur and you will have it whipped in short order go into it expecting that all will be sweetness and light and everyone should be little gentleman and little lady and disaster will loom neither i nor the management are responsible for cuts contusions violent words or divorces resulting from attempts to run confrontingness drills by husbands and wives on each other may you never be the same l ron hubbardhubbard communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 9 september 1957 processes to be run on hgc preclears from this date the following processes are to be run on hgc preclears from this date until otherwise notified on preclears who have points below the zero line of apas very brief rudiments then cch 1 cch 2 cch 3 and cch 4 these processes are not run on basis where each is killed dead before the auditor goes on each is run to flat spot and then bridged to the next it would be amazing to run one of them more than couple of hours except perhaps cch 4 book mimicry but even this is only run to mediumly flat spot as soon as the auditor has gone through these four processes once he goes over each one again possibly using now cch i b dont give that hand instead of give that hand it will be noted that each one of these tends to unflatten the other three further pc may get response at all on cch i until he has run cch 3 and cch 4 hence to grind on one only is folly of the first order the object of these processes cch 14 is to get the person under control by which is meant the body only when that is done can an auditor hope to go on with success once the person is under control it is quite easy to put attention under control this is best done by training 10 locational processing it is to be noted on low scale case that tr 10 can be enforced thus the pc does not fly out of control on preclears who have most points above the zero line of an apa here again we have to hit the cch steps but in this case we first handle rudiments with the following thoroughness 1 we clear help can the auditor help the pc can the pc help the auditor do people ever help people etc on two way comm basis break this down until the pc comes through any compulsive help or wasting help 2 we clear pt problem making sure again that the pc can invent problem of some sort about something we run pt problem on terminal only never on condition further we run this until the pc is willing to let the pt problem ride we dont want him to be willing to do something about it but we never let this process occupy 15 of an intensive why because havingness is the clue to problems and person obsessively has problems when he doesnt have havingness if problem takes too long to clear the auditor blundered by running pt problem and should come off of it at the first logical spot and return to it after he has later run havingness 3 goals are then cleared in full it doesnt matter if this takes the rest of the intensive the questions are formally audited as follows tell something that youre absolutely certain will be there in tell something you would really like to have in the times are one minute five minutes one hour one day three days one week one month three months six months one year two years three years ten years these times are not absolute but may be changed by the auditor but they are close to pat as given the auditor does not figure out for the preclear the dates on which these times will occur the pcs figuring out the date is part of the processfrom here the auditor selectively shoots up apa by running oldtime trio with all three parts in this he knocks out remain and dispense with as well as have he runs this trio as follows he runs many haves then bridges to many remains then bridges to many many many dispense withs then he bridges to haves then runs many many many remains and bridges to many dispense withs then he bridges to many many many haves runs many remains into which he bridges and then bridges to many dispense withs he can keep this up in this order each one of the legs of trio tends to unflatten the other two legs all three have to wind up flat this is run first inside and then if being concentrated on outside goals can be run again as above if desired for then will run differently if the auditor has any suspicion that he does not have the pc under control he runs the early cch steps briefly and accomplishes it if the foregoing basic things are done then many other things can be done an analysis of profile will tell us few things about preclear and while we do not yet have every point on an apa taped we do have several foremost is the point nervousdepressed when this is low the pc doesnt have any reality on anything stable datum the first stable datum the pc gets may well be achieved by the oldy arc straightwire gone through just few times thats cracked plenty of peoples cases the early cch steps are all aimed squarely at that point look at who am l also hammers at that point when i see before and after with change on nervous depressed when it was low always about 90 i think the pc never found the auditor actually its lack on any stable datum of any kind the auditor may be found only after the pc has gotten hold of some very minor stable datum something thats really real in the room recall moment that is really real to you the second point we have even better established through test is the critical when this is low the pc is on obsessive change and will let nothing remain getting him to let just one thing remain and to be still can shift this critical letting things remain is the key to low critical iq is another big win for us now since we know what iq is all about iq is the ability to wlthhold or give out datum on self determined basis incidentally we also shoot valences with withhold it is run the same way whether shooting valences or raising iq one finds the weak valence from which the pc could withhold nothing and finally gets the pc to be able to withhold things from that valence exteriorization is accomplished by recall moment of loss when pc gets this flat he can then be run on old scs routine not stopcs and he will exteriorize easily psychosomatic difficulties have been vanished rather easily on withhold look around here and find something from which you could withhold that skinrash leg whatever eyesight can be shifted by control trio with emphasis on disappear the failed case is case in which thought can always be overpowered by mest the pcs ability to make his thinkingness prevail against mest has failed too often and cannot change only mest changes therefore this is usually the below zero on the apa pc making him think things and do things doesnt much change him because he is too weak in thinking to prevail against mest look at it and tell something about it you could handle or think thought that would be all right for you to think and other approaches done by clever auditor can crack this sort of thing up on an even gone case this is point which occasionally needs attention particularly when we have pc who is not changing on apa or iq if an intensive didnt change him he cant think against anything the oldest workable remedy known is spot something around here that isnt thinkingafter being trained in the trs it is necessary to run student on the remain button of control trio or trio and upon withhold processes to up his test i have turned out this bulletin rapidly for use in the hgc and on students in training this bulletin will only be modified when necessity becomes apparent nothing in this bulletin will overcome sloppy

in general should not be suspected of being under anybodys control much less the auditors but it is probably more under the auditors control than it is under the preclears control when i say to you do you think that thinkingness is under control you should be aware of the fact that it is less under the preclears control at any time than under the auditors control thats one the boys dont get always they think well can i get the preclears thinkingness under control well you can do it better than the preclear but that is horribly bad and when you get this clear you will see that you have to get the body under control and get attention under control before you aim at thinkingness therefore condition to running trio is this is the person of the preclear under control is the attention of the preclear under controlthose are two conditions necessary to run trio now to assume the power of choice is also under the preclears controlmuch less thinkingnessis of course pretty grim it moves trio outrageously high so you could say then that there are two versions of trio and i have been fishing around for one of them ive been doing some work on this for the last several weeks and i finally got this thing tapedi do mean taped all right trio would just be trio just the way it is but there is an undercut in trio trio could be directive process and it would be prefaced by get the idea of having that clock get the idea of having that picture indicating picture on wall get the idea of having that sofa get the idea of having that chair get the idea of having that table do you see this now that is highly directive isnt it now that would keep thinkingness under control in the kind of case who was having rough time with it all right now lets take the second version get the idea that it would be all right for that clock to remain as it is get the idea that it would be all right for that wall to remain as it is got that just an indicating process all right now here comes the clincher instead of dispense with or notknow we run into actually brandnew process its rationale is much higher its get the idea of making that clock disappear get the idea of making that chair disappear get the idea of making that ceiling disappear etc small objects are much easier for the preclear to make disappear than large ones but you havent told him to make it disappear have you you have told him to get the idea of making it disappear they usually interpret you literally and try like mad to make it disappear and it usually does for short time now this process is restimulative too anyway weve got point and that is simply this that this as process all by itself is probably one of the killer processes of all time i have solved this enigma why doesnt preclear exteriorize easily and stay exteriorized and we ask this question and we ask this accompanying question why does preclear get sick when you ask him to conceive static now obviously wed have to get somebody to conceive staticbefore he could himself stay comfortably outside what keeps preclear from conceiving static its because he associates static with loss and he says all right if there is nothing there ive lost it dont you see ive lost something if theres nothing there therefore id better not conceive static conceiving static is therefore painful well the truth of the matter is whenever he lost anything something disappeared all right the funny part of it is that he never noticed that he didnt lose totally every time he still had other objects he lost his tiepinwell heavens hes still got his tie hes still got the floor the room this universe space but he never realizes this in these instances and so thats why weve been running this process here on recall moment of loss just to see if we couldnt accustom someone to conceiving static very directly on loss and whether or not the individual would exteriorize just as such on the process now that was test that was made the test process recall moment of loss sandwiched in with havingness then has been run with the expected result that we would get this fellow concentrated on exteriorization and little more able to conceive an exteriorization certainly now final figures from this are probably not available from testing yet they arent but regardless of that here is the rationale an individual cannot conceive static if he associates static with loss if loss is painful so we have to cure him of the painfulness of loss consideration of before we can exteriorize him easily now how do we do this we have to go back to automaticity the universe has been taking things away from him it has become an automaticity and we find that the universe has an automaticity known as time and time itself is consecutive series of losses all right so we have to cure this fellow of losses before we can get him to appreciate time otherwise hes so afraid of losing it that he parks himself on the track and this is stuck on the track phenomena all right the process which is aimed at this the experimental process recall moment of loss sandwiched in with havingness trio now handles it on thiscontrol trio it had better be called and its third command is get the idea of making that object disappear well this gets him to take over the automaticity of all the losses which he has experienced unwillingly you see that its the universe thats been taking the things away and an individual then just by spotting objects and getting the idea that they are going to disappear or are disappearing of course then does take over this automaticity of losses and he becomes accustomed to it after while and he should come out of the woods on it now all of these invisible masses that preclears have around them are actually simply symptoms of mass loss mass loss now when an individual has visio has never seen anything couldnt see anything the only thing hes looking at is stuck loss got the idea hes looking at the nothingness of something that was there all right you take over that automaticity with this third command on control trio therefore you have highly directional highly workable set of processes and each part of that trio would be run relatively flat and go on to the next part and i would say youd probably run it something on the order of oh certainly not hundred commands eachyoud try to stay in that order of magnitude and you could just run it round and round its get the idea of well what would be necessary before you got to that process it would be necessary to get an individuals body under control which takes the early steps of cch and then put his attention under control great many processes can do this chief amongst them has always been locational processing and if you were to just run the ordinary locational processes you would eventually get his attention under control the auditor taking control of somebodys attention actually puts the preclear into more control of attention than the preclear ordinarily is which is one of the freak things people look at this and they say well we must be running the fellow out the bottom and we wouldnt be running the fellow out the bottomwell we leave trio in its timehonored style and so on just as it has always been but we do have this lowcut trio and its rather killer you take somebody with glasses his eyesight will do more tricks in less time on this third process of control trio things will go black well why do things go black well blackness makes things disappear doesnt it and you take over the automaticity of using blackness to make things disappear night grabs the way of the universe once in every 24 hours on earth here this is the one weve been looking for to turn on visio now if you wanted to turn on sonic with this youd have to go down to noisy part of town and just run trio on sound but you wouldnt dare do thisrun control trio on sound you would not dare do this of course if the preclear did not already have trio on objects flat obviously visio would turn on before sonic there are many things that you could do with this people who have anaesthetized areas in their bodylike they have chest sensation in their chest etcdo weird things with this process this control trio got it i wanted to tell you particularly about this particular process because it is specific and it will be found to be very useful to you we had to find out if one version of this would run without killing preclear and thats recall moment of loss actually recall moment of loss should act as havingness process because it asises all of the loss points on the track and it should be havingness process all by itself but we didnt want to be so bold as to run it with havingness until i find out differently this control trio and recall moment of loss are making bid for our chief exteriorization processes l ron hubbardhubbard communications office washington dc hco training bulletin of 24 september 1957 curriculum of cch to be done well cch 0

rudiments and goals all you need to clear up if somebody is having too much trouble trying to locate or isolate problem is to clear up the semantics of problemwhat does he mean by problem i got this rich one off preclear one day doing this quite fascinating thing what was problem i finally asked and he told problem was something that could never be solved whenever you run withhold on valence you finish up with cant have on the valence and that flattens it off better you will find it is quite often more advantageous to run locational processing than it is to run problems of comparable magnitude problem of comparable magnitude is all right but its thinkingness process and on case that is having an awful lot of trouble it gives them hell to run locational processing but nevertheless it does run out the present time problem which is most fascinating any one of the rudiments are excellent processesany one of them twoway communication is something that has never been stressed much on this side of the waterit has been taught very thoroughly on the other side i took up lot of the 4th london acc on the subject of twoway comm how you handle twoway comm you have to keep the reality of it very high and you have to be willing to interrupt obsessive outflows of the preclear etc and obsessive silences twoway comm is very interesting way of going about things and it isnt just talking it is establishing high level of reality it consists of the auditor feeding experimental data to the preclear in order to have the preclear look it over and decide about it one way or the other in twoway comm you dont let preclear asis everything he knows thinks or wants to do all right now we look over this and we discover that the rudiments consist in part of present time problem now we already know that present time problem can be run in this wiselocational it can also be run as problem of comparable magnitude so we have lot of processes connected with present time problem now lets take another one of the rudiments clearing the auditor actually the crudest way known of clearing the auditor is who do i remind you of tell something you dont like about these are real crude ways of clearing the auditor the best way of clearing the auditor we know of is in training 13 which is could i help youhow could you help mehow could i help anybody elsehow could you help anybody elsehow do other people ever help other people do women ever help women do men ever help men do men ever help women do women ever help men and you just beat it to pieces on big long bracket now this goes so far that it becomes fantastic process in itself you take father and mother valencesthey are usually quite hot you can run this on help this is usually quite necessary on case thats going to hang up because the only reason the case is sitting there isto waste help and you can run case on any process matter how excellent on basis of wasting help until the case simply cant find enough ways to waste it and he goes down tone scale you have to understand the case is trying to waste help it isnt find the auditor in the rudiments today it is clear the auditor the only point on which hes cleared is help can i help you can you help all right now lets take another facet of this goals actually handbook for preclears has been helping us out just to the degree that it does do little clarification on goals and gets the guy stirred up the real reason the handbook for preclears is used at the hgc is quite an interesting one its simply to stir the case up so itll run out all right this guys sitting there in sleep and hes just gonna run locational you know and hes in disoriented state anyhow he isnt here and he isnt home and he isnt anywherewell lets get him worried lets get him chewed up little bit lets get him restimulated somewhat lets get him interested in this all right these problems then do tend to swim to the top you run some relatively nondirectional process and does it bite on now if youre going to run nondirectional processesthat is to say give that hand and so onyoure going to have to have something to run them against and something like the handbook for preclears gives you something the guy thinks while hes going over this sort of thing he thinks oh my blah blah the trouble with is i have nothing to do and i dont want to do anything and i never will have anything to do but i got to thinking about goals from the usual standpoint of their high generality with most peoplei wonder if there is anybody around who could articulate with great conciseness what he would like to doand i found on all sides that failure to articulate was the main difficulty the person had feeling he wanted to do something and this would be wonderful and it was all in sensory capacity now if he could be made to articulate this why we would really have something and i experimented on t little bit and we see that today in the handbook for preclears now if you can get him to articulate in session anything about the future you have won on the subject of goals but it must be in the alignment of this persons frame of referenceit must be aligned with his life not aligned with something we think he ought to live so lets take look at clearance of goals goals would not be likely to run on high generality in other words they are specific personal and intimate its what do you think what do you want what is aligned with your life and we cant beat around the bush with this one if were going to get any place with it all right lets take goals as process you could run goals for 25 hours with the greatest of ease and we just had report of terrific win here on preclear who was run on locational for 25 hours so it looks like the rudiments could be the session so if somebody says well now i ran the rudiments and then we got into some processingfascinating you see rudiments are dignified today with cch 0 as an appellation all right we discover this preclear in this terrible condition of not wanting any auditing not going any place all of his goals being somebody elses goals two things we can do at once are clear the auditor and then run goals now how would you really run goals with twoway comm goals could be run with twoway comm in this way you ask the preclear what he is absolutely sure would happen in the next two minutesin the next day three days from nowone week from nowone month from nowand one year from now and we want something hed be absolutely sure would happen now were running right there the reverse process of atomic bombs which say futureno futureno future well basically whats wrong with anybody why does he jam on the track its because of future he has been denied to point where his loss is so great that he dare not owni knew person at one time case that was by the way psychology major one of the roughest cases i have ever run into the case put on the total appearance of being saneit was dramatized sanity and yet the case would make odd remarks like i really think people are crazy well why do you think people are crazy i would say well because people say they can tell right from wrong and you know theres difference fascinating the case would make odd remarks like this from time to time one day the case made remark on goals like this well its really best to tell people that things cant happen to them because otherwise they might hope that they could and then theyd be disappointed now you disentangle that this was all taught to this person by the way at the university of california at berkeley the person was also taught that the best way to preserve anybodys status quo etc was to drug them and so on i mean it was gentle course all right this person was stark staring mad and had future of any kind slightest future brought out by this five hours on just this one type of question is there anything going to happen in the remainder of this afternoon will anything happen the rest of today is there anything going to occur any place in the world the rest of today and the confident answer with great certainty was five hours and finally we broke through itwell you will probably sit there for the rest of the day wrangling with and screaming at the way you have been doingand it busted and i finally got the person to admit that there was some slight possibility that there would be room here for the rest of the day and it busted this case it read from total nofuture up well this case was an isolated case as weve occasionally had now and then and this was an inspirational sort of process that cracked through well now we see this process of goals on the basis of futures and person without futures cannot have fancy future called goal and all goal is is fancy future determined by the person and if he has future at all determined by anybody then he isnt going to go anywhere from that point and any goal he has is totally unreal so the best way i know of to clear up goal is as follows twoway comm is there anything thats going to happen in the next couple of minutes we finally get this totally thrashed out till hes got some great big certainty that there will be something couple of minutes from now and then we move it up day and then we move it up weekthree daysand move it up week and move it up month and move it up year and we get certainties at each one of these stages and levels regardless of on what now the person knows that that is going to occur he knows there is going to be future there now lets have him put something in this future that he now has had created hes created future hes got certainty on it its up there all right now lets put some desire in the future and we get goal now what would you like to have happen in the next couple of minutes or what would you like to do in the next couple of minuteswhat would you like to do tomorrowwhat would you like to do in three dayswhat would you like to do in weekwhat would you like to do in monthwhat would you like to do in year and we will get these weird things which have desire in them they are all getridofs and if you really plowed such person down on it he would get down to the bottom of the ladder which is knock this body off right now and when he says i would like to get rid of my fear of darkness i would like to get over feeling bad every time my mother screams at mewell now these arent desires these are runaways these are flinchesthese are lets not confront it lets get out of the universe lets scram and the final result is the basic postulate if i could just get rid of this body right this instant i would be all right all right so that thing doesnt even vaguely get flat unless there is real goal like id like to have stick of candynow thats goal see thats goal tomorrow id like to walk down the street and find couple of bags of gold lying on the corner you see it has to have desire in it next week why id like to go camping id just love to go camping then theyll always modify these things in some way or other because of course i cant because i have to work and i dont have any money and yak yak yakyou got the idea theyll modifythese goals as long as theyre modifying them they dont have goal because theyre making postulate and the mest universe is kicking the postulate in on them so how do you solve this if its this arduous how do you solve it well run build future two minutes these times are only approximate tomorrow three days week month year just build the fact that there will be something there that time is going to advance in those areas then we build desire into it well what would you like to have happenwhat would you like to do in two minutes day three days week month year all right well he didnt give you anything he really wanted to have happen he said id like toif i were brave enough id tell you id like to get rid of you and and everything but im not brave enough so all i will say is i would like to get rid of the darkness that would be fine all right twoway comm consists in the main of keeping preclear talking busting through their silences knocking them into line and manhandling them with pomp you keep em talking and therefore it is skilla very high skill but after youve built future you build into it something they would like to have happen in that future all right so here is modus operandi now that makes this process build future on that span then build something theyd like to have happen in that future now build new future go all over the same first process again on prediction next couple of minutes what hes sure is going to happen what he could be certain about what could you be certain about year from now all right weve built futurethen youll find out thats little stronger and then we build something in that future that hed like to have happen and then we build new futuresame first process againand then the second process of adding the desire to it and we finally will come out into the clear now there is way to run goals for twentyfive hoursslug slug slug now you can run help for twentyfive hours too on just who helps who when where has there ever been anybody in the whole universe who ever helped anybody in the whole universe is the most general form of question but here we have these rudiments then moved out into processes and its possible to just handle intensives with rudiments now we find somebody wasting helpwell hes hard to put into session and if you are going to help him anyway it isnt goals thats in trouble its help and if you try to help him too much and hes wasting help he will eventually waste help by blowing so its help that has to be cleared if goals wont got this all right l ron hubbardpab 122 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 3537 fitzroy street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 15 october 1957 the five levels of indoctrination and procedure cch the first thing that we should take up is the state of scientology at this time and to tell you that we are on plateau we are certainly on plateau and it is plateau so very much higher than man has ever walked before that it is well worth saying it is level that can be maintained if people want more results than we can get today from cch properly used there will have to be better auditor than we can make today the idea that this is it periodically has occurred in scientology right now we are justified in saying that we are on plateau which does not have to change when you can process catatonic schiz fivedayold baby youve got it made in the world of homo sapiens the only further adventure we might adventure upon would be the processing of the thetan not connected with the body and that would be an entire field about which we know practically nothing but anybody who is having anything to do with bodies is well within the reach of procedure cch providing it is used by an auditor who has been validated through the five levels of indoctrination cch used by an auditor who has not been validated would be the least guaranteed thing i can think of at the moment i have already thrown up my hands in few expressive horrors when i have seen auditors who have not been through the five levels fumble around with any tone 40 process and it is so grim that even now to you watching it untrained trying to do one of these things it would not look like auditing back in old book one days fellow could sit down beside someone on couch and say go back to that engram and it looked like auditing it doesnt look like auditing today it is the difference of indoctrination which makes the difference the person who applies it has been successfully checked through the five levels of indoc it is now the auditor plus the process that is one of the reasons why we knew we were on plateau there wasnt something you could tell out of cch easily to your aunt mames little girl to fix up her fear of cats it is interesting that such employment does not reach any level that you yourself can consider good result somebody untrained does not achieve any great result with it and is liable to leave his preclear in badly restimulated condition we are dealing with package of dynamite with procedure cch we have to take into account the five levels of indoctrination successfully passed which is necessary to apply cch to preclear cch is very sloppy title for procedure cch is really c for control d for duplication c for communication c t for control of thought havingness and that is the real name of it first we get the person under control get him into the capability of duplicating and then we move him up into communication more or less on person level now we take the mind the mind consists of mental image pictures and if duplication is addressed to the mind we getcommunication the third zone is the control of the thetan which brings us to control of thinkingness ct i will show you more graphically what these three things are 1 notice that you are sitting in the chair notice that you have body sitting in chair 2 get picture of cat can you note that it is picture that is the mind its pictures and the apparatus which handles pictures 3 get picture of cat again answer this question what is looking at the cat that is all you ever need to know about thetan with cch as we extend out from the thetan we get the physical universe so actually there is fourth thing there which undercuts the body and that would be the physical universe in other words you are in immediate and direct contact with everything that you will be expected to study or ever process in scientology every one of these things that i have mentioned the physical universe body mind thetan may have clearer appearance to you or some other condition connected with it but there isnt anything outside of this we omit the physical universe because it is pretty hard to look totally at the physical universe right at this moment but for sure you are looking at all the body you have got as far as this picture is concerned it may flop over and have many cross associations and you could trace this endlessly as i have as far as thetans are concerned the most you will ever learn about one is your own beingness or the observation that something is being moved made alive and motivated this is the entire target of cch there isnt anything else to shoot at all of these things intimately then relate to the thetan and we have control duplication communication control of thinkingness and havingness that relate to thetan we could process in any one of these zones when you process any part of these four things you really cater to some slight degree to the other three but you can concentrate upon any one of these things cch has in its concentration levels first the body then the mind and the thetan just happensnowhere in cch do we intimately address thetan but we can come close to addressing thetan by addressing thinkingness here is what cch does it makes the person more aware of body and he eventually recognizes to some degree that he can control the body next it addresses the physical universe in the locational processes of the next facet actually it addresses intimately the thetan plus the physical universe how can you as an auditor overcome the obsessive mental changes which occur you cannot see what he is thinking you put his body under control then you get him into communication and then you can also clarify and control to some degree his thinkingness at thinkingness we are standing at borderline between the mind and the thetan by control and duplication we get communication when we have communication we can straighten up the fellows time track and his habitat in the final process then and now solids let be much more positive about this the makeorbreak point of any case is this can he make things more solid or cant he person who can make things little more solid can also be processed on almost anything and get along fairly well i knew there was one point above which cases process easily with almost any technique you use and there was point below which process seemed to have anything to do with person as soon as this was isolated we had things made for we could graduate somebody up to toleration of solids we can cross this borderline in all cases today but how about the fellow that we cannot communicate with at all he has another bug that we have to overcome and that is the bug of obsessive change when you tell him to think of cat he has to be able to think of cat when cases failed in the past it was that the preclear never thought what we had told him to think he said so but didnt do it here we have this thing if we can get him to think the thought keep it from going away we can graduate him up to solidsthere are two things that you do with person you control his person and you make him duplicate and communicate you control his thinkingness so you use the early steps of control of person which are give your hand tone 40 8c handspace mimicry and book mimicry over and over until you are absolutely sure that the fellow can think when you tell him to then you go into the next stage which is tone 40 keep it from going away tone 40 hold it still and tone 40 make it little more solid what is the bank doing he has some attention units which get stuck on the track that are only being fixed by the bank sticking him so we do all these things on the body and then we do practically the same things on the attention after that we have got it made because we can graduate him to making something little more solid lets take him aside and let him get the inside confidential story of the whole thing have him take look at his mind and there comes the trickiest step of cch it only condenses almost the entirety of what an auditor had to know that was developed in three years this is the rough process and i dont make any bones about it you can either subjectively remedy havingness or you cant so the way we run cch is to graduate person up to making things objectively the outside world or subjectively mind solid and then have him straighten out the whole track all sorts of odd and interesting thoughts occur when we use this thing then and now solids above this we do have couple more things they are super developed geewhiz processes completely unusable on homo sapiens however you start winding up why you go over into these processes ill give you some idea of where this goes you could turn on persons mental image pictures the size of that wall in three dimensions with total perception in half an hours processing abilities are not perishable the only thing which is perishable is willingness processing is still matter of choice person would never refuse processing or help if he knew what it was that which refuses processing is not the person after while it isnt that he pulls up on you and surrenders he finally takes an apathetic look and says what you are doing is not bad i wouldnt mind being lot better you give him surfeit of control until he finds out it doesnt kill him maybe he can control something now now that is the background theory of cch what i want to punch up is that if you wish to handle body illnesses they come under the heading of person if you want to handle mental actions you would do it with control of attention and if you wish to handle thetan it would be through control of thinkingness l ron hubbarda basic chart of process types october

copyright 1957 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedissue 57 1957 ca late october the magazine of dianetics and scientology from washington dc escape l ron hubbard well ive been working now for lot of years to bring dianetics and scientology up to point of supermagic it was easy to get them up to magic in world where results aside from accidentals had been the order of things it was simple to create magic cloying illness resolved fast heal of broken limb recovery from fixations and obsessions it was easy to repair these that was simple magic and time and again ive told you this is better and its been true and auditing worked better but what were we really looking for we knew all of us that we were in sort of trap called physical universe and although it was all right to say wed gotten in ourselves and that it was each mans fault it is nevertheless true that it was trap complicated by innumerable traps it was all right to say that it was natural for man to kill deer but that wasnt making it any easier on the deer it was all right to recover enough data to know that dying wasnt fatal but still men died and dying often hurts by actual consent of our own we are torn from our friends and possessions and crushed into new lives but just because we understood it made it less arbitrary less painful just because we could better understand the trap made it less trap ive heard people say i dont know what i ever would have done if you hadnt come along ron a11 right why should somebody like have to come along if all the world is right and the universe an expression of deep love we curse at manmade hells we spot cause in villainies uncountable yet think now what are we doing in universe in which hells are possible sure maybe you even asked to come here but deep in pain and shock shadowed by your own forgetting why puzzle now if this universe is good placeyou wouldnt say lions cage is good place for child nor would you jeer at and accuse child who unwittingly stumbled into lions cage what is the cage doing there in the first place for child to fall into lets be sane we can rationalize this universe we can explain complaints we can blame the inmates but is it not true that we came unwitting into it what do we really want out of dianetics and scientology what could i really give you that you want escape is there anything wrong with escape is man mad who seeks to leave fire that chars him mass that crushes him world that laughs at his dreams and scolds him for his stupidity escape why not escape why not let few others escape after all were not all only ones we can feel and we can cry tell why christianity won so well wasnt it because of promised escape tell why buddhism won so sweepingly because it promised escape well why not escape if the great religions of all time became great on the promise of escape we must assume that lot of people want out and that theres something wrong with in this universe is breaker of bones defiler of deeds mocker of gallantry and peace i can say this with equanimity i dont have to get emotional or even personal about it spirit seeks to advance to improve each way is blocked this universe knows only how to decay is there way out yes there is we have it in scientology now i have found it and charted it i know exactly how to open the gate for whom ah yes thats the news we used to sayif your case is in good shape or if you really want to of course you want to but it didnt require magic to open the gate it required supermagic to let our friends go free for seven years or less you have believed in you saw enough to know two things that i was sincere and would continue to work on it and b that progress line existed which improved all right what has been done the auditing skills have been created which led an auditor up to this what has been done in the lower steps of cch we can rescue the people lowest down even the unconscious peoplei told the 18th acci am through researching south all further hgc researches will consist of going north i went north faster than i had thought i would i have now taught the auditors in washington and the academy instructors how to go all the way north all the way i know why youre here and the fast way out i have taught auditing skill to academy students and the 18th acc ive taught all the way north to the hgc auditors what is the way out with

prepared from l ron hubbards second lecture to the 17th american acc in washington dc on 26 february 1957 i want to talk to you about the reality scale and the whys and wherefores of hand contact mimicry for very very long time we had the arc triangle we had affinity and reality and afterwards had communication lot of people thought that reality was the most important corner but evidently communication was the most important corner because by processing with communication we could do some astonishing things twoway communication pc has problem you make him talk about it if you dont go to point where you excessively reduce his havingness he will have tendency to desensitize on the problem this is one of the oldest therapies known you go and tell friend youre in trouble and you feel better however in scientology this thing took on new burnished radiator cap nobody knew before what it was in communication that made things communicate and made it therapeutic and so forth we isolated the various parts of communication and we isolated much more importantly the billjoe interchange of twoway communication now what can you do with communication well lot of people go around and they dont have any reality on scientology because nothing has ever happened to them their idea of what it takes to get reality on something isthey cant examine somethingthe reality must have mass it must have an impact very heavy effect now remember that you can reduce havingness by communication but within that framework let us take somebody who has reality on anything happening to him of course he has reality on anything happening to him hes in high games condition which means effect on self total effect on others so youre trying to plow through his consistent postulation that there must be effect upon himself of any kind whatsoever and if you get through that barrier then he says i have some reality on this subject if you destroy his effect on self then hell believe you this is totally idiotic but thats the way it works now we get this fellow he has reality on scientology but hes got toothache we have him say hello to the tooth have the tooth say okay to that hello have the tooth say hello to him and have him say okay to the tooth which makes twoway comm have him do this few times and the toothache goespoof we take heavier mass than this like an arthritic leg arthritis is ridge illness and therefore you go up or down from the ridge and youve got it made we can make him get rid of his arthritis even by simply putting him in apathy about it you could hammer and poundhim until he was sitting there very very quietly and unable to wiggle in any way and he wouldnt feel his arthritis well he wouldnt feel anything else either you take slight little somatics little conditions or fears of things and run twoway communication on them and you get some fabulous results lets say somebodys afraid of stove have him say hello to the stove and have the stove say okay have the stove say hello to him and have him say okay to the stove after while he wont have any fear of touching the stove oddly enough he will receive less effect from the stove even if hot that is quite important it tells you that the body does not naturally lend itself to injury but injury takes place only in highly aberrated condition you should be able to take body and throw it up against the wall hard enough to crush its skull in have it drop to the floor stand and walk awayproviding you arent holding in suspension the image picture of its hitting the wall and being injured now ill give you an example of that i want you to look at this ashtray now im going to raise this ashtray and then im going to put it back on the desk is that action now in existence where youve got some pictures of it havent you this universe doesnt make things survive only you make things survive and this is you are holding the engram in restimulation which permits it to have an effect youre so doggone hipped on the subject of survival that its just marvelous to behold that is because thetan cannot do anything else but survive naturally anything thats surviving he can go into good communication with people like to look at the pyramids why well the person is surviving and evidently the pyramids are surviving so there is medium of interchange thetan looking at solid is much happier if the solid is surviving if this solid has duration then the thetan can have means of communication between himself and the solid in spite of the fact that the thetan cant be solid so people really dont have much of tendency to look at and study and examine very closely things of very finite survival periodsthings that die right now things that vanish right now but they could say look it became nothing just like i am and therefore i have another communication point with it sudden disappearances stay hung in the bank that is different than something with finite life things with very finite small life are not very important but solids which suddenly disappear are quite curious to thetan hence we like magic shows and such things now lets add these factors up this nothingness tends to survive only when arrived at under that circumstance there was something there now theres nothing there so that i give you motion of mest and you make picture survive but its not any longer moving in mest mest has very very finite duration so we have to rig up all sorts of things so itll survive so itll continue and people like to have things continue but after while when things have not continued with them for long time then they get onto another kick they only hold on to it was something and suddenly became nothing so therefore they hold on to losses and the whole track at length becomes concatenation of losses communication oddly enough has always attended one of these losses it is not true basically that communication asises or destroys or knocks out any mass but communication has always accompanied the vanishment or destruction of mass so the preclear gets these two things involved with each other and then he goes through an automaticity of having mass vanish when he communicates you must get this clearly the only thing that asises mass is asising mass but communication always accompanied this and after while the preclear gets one very solid conviction that if he talks to something something disappears its not true sound is another aspect of communication which is fabulous you realize the first sounds were evidently those which accompanied explosions or destructive actions electronicparticles traveling through space will carry with them sound even in the absence of air sound does not go through vacuum unless you have some carrier for sound it doesnt reach you at all therefore sudden electronic explosion was usually the first acquaintance with sound its true that he had to put sound there in order for sound to be there but he has number of experiences whereby something blew up and therefore disappeared and sound took place so youll find any preclear willing to swear that sound is disintegrative not all communications contain sound but sound is disintegrating factor so communications with sound combine the destructive aspect of sound of which the preclears convinced with the as ising aspect of communication itself of which he is again convinced and between the two of them you get an awful loss of havingness if youre not very careful communication verbal tends to asis or knock out the masses in the bank of the preclear so we just start right in auditing him now if he has present time problem which is terribly pressing well you could do something with this if you didnt talk about the problem too much if you ran problems of comparable magnitude to it youd probably add to his havingness the way we got away with it with running engrams was quite peculiar the person was having to put the engram there to some degree in order to run the thing this made him capable of confronting the incident and so brought discharge of the fixation he had for that incident and yet did not rob him particularly of the incident the mass we were running the significance out of the mass its interesting but where person couldnt afford to lose anything he couldnt even afford to lose significance and so we couldnt run an engram well communication goes much further south and we have condition here whereby we see an individual drop through the bottom just by too much yacketyyak with the auditor on the subject of his particular phobia or bank this tells you by the way at once one of the most condemning facts of psychoanalysis i started digging up all the factors utilized in psychoanalysis and i discovered this fantastic thing that i couldnt find any factor present which was therapeutic beyond the fact of telling friend your troubles there is therapeutic rationale behind it because you get the asising of mass where freud achieved any resultlets be generous lets say he did achieve some resultslets find out how long it took him to achieve them an old lady came in from bavaria and talked to him for few minutes and just ranted on and on and all of sudden said that she felt better and got up and left freud as far as i can discover never had any results from cases who went longer than very few hours in psychoanalysis in other words freuds results were the magic results person came in and said this is wrong and that is wrong and felt better and went away if you let the patient talk too long he is going to go out the bottom and that i guarantee they talk themselves down the tone scale just take preclear whos in bad shape and have him tell you about his problem or something and he drops on out the bottom doing this you can watch him go right on downscale its possibly an experiment you ought to make to really understand this just make somebody tell you his trouble over and over and over and you will understand at once why freud got spectacular results in very few hours and why nobodys gotten any results since in great many hours brainwashingthats the biggest joke of this halfcentury brainwashing fellow will talk out enough havingness to throw himself into an introverted condition youve got his mind concentrated upon his bank and now you make him talk and out goes the havingness and he goes right on downscale with great speed please understand this as auditors know what you are looking at youre just looking at the vanishment of mass and thetan believes that to be recognized and to be able to prove things and to be able to demonstrate to the world that he is there and that things have happened to him he has to have massand so we get the third corner here affinity is actually the consideration of distance communication is an interchange of ideas but reality is what it is about and what it is proved by looking all around now i would say that the weakest comer of the arc triangle is aaffinity this has the least monitoring effect upon preclear but is the most strongly demonstrated it is not good entering point c and r run out or reestablish and is very easily monitored c is less easily monitored by and r and you pull r and c apart and youve got nothing you have reaction you have universe so c and r communication and realityare very very closely associated and reality has scale and because c is closely associated with reality reality then again after 54 started to take certain prominence reality is scale in its own right and that scale begins at the top with postulate which postulate continuing can make consideration you can acquire considerations by other means than postulating all you have to do is agree with an existing postulate or an existing consideration and you too can have the considerationyou didnt have to postulate it in the first place its postulates continuing postulatesconsiderationsand the next step down from there is agreement and here we see this vast panorama of everybody agreed with everything which knits them all together in the same time continuum its postulate consideration and then couple of guys or more have this same consideration and having it then we have specialized considerationit is shared in common and this we call an agreement shared consideration having accomplished that we get solids we get proof of the consideration and that takes place in spaces and solids but reality actually is the solid aspect whereas is more closely associated to the spatial aspect because they wish to prove it and convince one another they get something that can enter the phenomenon of sight and the other phenomena of touch smell here we have spatial relationships established and confirmed by mass what happens to somebody who is longer convinced even though the mass is there where would he go the one just below that is line the mass called terminal tends to vanish and the line between couple of terminals tends to take place and appear and then below that we get terminal line and dont mistake that for postulate condition you get this person selling you beautiful bill of goodsbecause theres nothing therethat hes in postulating condition he has become the total effect of his postulates total effect of his considerations total effect of all masses total effect of all lines and now he cant even see lines and masses such person is liable to tell you my thoughts affect things thousands of miles away its true that an ot can affect something thousands of miles away but he isnt an ot hes got lumbago ots dont have lumbago you start to process him and what happens the line shows up you process him longer and shadowy things show up at either end of the line and the line starts to disappear and the terminals start to appear and then you process him little bit longer and boy do those terminals become solid and after he is able to make terminal have an effect upon him so that his confidence in this is unassailable he can only then enter into the world of agreement only then are his agreements binding and valid only then can he make them or break them up to that time he is obsessed by any agreement of the past track he is the victim of all the upper scale at any point he is on the scale and that is true of the tone scale or is true of any other scale person you know does not move up level by level of the tone scale he broadens up the tone scale he becomes the whole scale there is big difference person who is in good shape can postulate consider which is to say continue postulate agree make masses or make masses disappear or make lines between masses appear or disappear at anypoint you find him on the scale he can do the points from there down and you win for him the ability again you make him willing to have the ability again to do the points from there up the reality scale is very important it tells you that communication down below line terminal is almost totally first dynamic communication the person actually gets convinced that if he thinks it it arrives in chesapeake bay you see he gets telepathic idea of his own thinkingness naturally all terminals there are are all there too and all lines are there too now whats the state of case at any one of these levels well it matches up right there alongside the old tone scalethe subzero scale and the original tone scale in their continuum you see from serenity clear on down to waitwait not even unconscious this level is paralleled by this reality scale and theres also series of communications which go down along the whole line lets take our preclear at the point where he doesnt know youre there and doesnt know the room is there and doesnt know hes there and doesnt know that he has body sitting there and he just doesnt know but hes performing on some social machinery where is the entrance point the first thing that you can do with this preclear we believe now that would recall to him an ability would be the recognition of the existence of line hence your hand against the preclears handthats line by establishing line he can come into cognizance of the terminal your arm is liable to get awful real to him unless his hand and arm get real youre not going to find anything else gettin real it doesnt mean that person responds to hand contact mimicry only when he is in terrible shape anybody ought to respond to hand contact mimicry you do hand contact mimicry with most anybody who hasnt had his hands cleared and youre going to get some results thats for sure solid communication line is very fine but what if you break it well you can break it so slowly that the person doesnt notice that the hands have ceased to be lines and have become terminals there is little space an inch between your hand and the preclears hand and he hasnt noticed to any great degree affinity starts to take place because weve got some distance but the affinity youll find will be first worst and then best with the terminals close together hand contact mimicry is the point back to which i would drop at any time i became very suspicious that i was auditing over the head of the preclear ive gone way over his head therefore ive given him loss so therefore momentarily i would consider he was in bad communication with meand his reality on possibly could be graduated up to line now reality contains level known as havingness in this little band of mass there is scale inside the reality scalethe havingness scale and that has to do with the consideration of mass its what you do with mass that scale is quite an interesting scale in itself it starts out probably with waste or maybe with substitute it is so messed up at that point of mass that it is very hard to get preclears to come up uniformly as to which one is the lowest one it possibly goes this way waste substitute waste substitute waste substitute until you get up to the next one just as you find great many false emotions jammed in at the level of apathy on the affinity scaleand im sure youve seen thisso do you find this waste and substitute kicking around and kicking at each other on the havingness scale have is the next one up if person cant have something you can have him waste it enough and youll find out after while hell say well i can have it what is the next important waystop on this havingness scale the next one up the line is confrontand thats awfully important person who cant confront something is liable to have to have it as his highest expression and if he cant confront it and cant have it its cinch that he will waste it and if he cant even waste it its cinch hell substitute and we get freudian and other sublimations and all of that sublimationthey never knew what theytalked about this is not sublimation im talking about this thing called sublimation is substitution i mean why get sublimative about something that is easily done if person hates women it is cinch that he probably hates woman and substitutes for her all other women but this is not clean statement of it for this reason you get identification which is substitution of one woman for anotherand then you get disassociation he cant even identify any more hence your lower waste level hes wasting now substitute youll find preclear after while will on some subject disassociate he says that ashtray isnt that ashtray you get the idea he says this ashtray is camel well now thats disassociation he cant recognize thing for itself but it must be something else so we must understand that as an action of mass to lie on the lower end of the havingness scale its just as simple as that now as we go upscale further from confront we run into something which is pretty doggone high and thats contribute to people if they are prevented from contributing to something go downscale now if contributing to something is getting rid of mass its somebody else is going to have something besides yourselfand you take person who is sitting down at have or below and you make him contribute little bit and he gets to be sick puppy hell just go on down into waste and substitute it is very high manifestation it holds true all up and down this havingness scale that if an individual is prevented from helping from contributing in some fashion he gets very ill not in auditing but in real life lets go on even higher than this and what do we get to we get to create so the havingness scale which fits at that innocuous word mass on the reality scale consists of the doingnesses with regard to mass and they begin at the top with create go down at once into contribute to into confront into have into waste and on down into substitute that all belongs at mass these are all the things you do with mass now probably there are bunch of doingnesses with agreement ask an attorney there are probably doingnesses with postulates and doingnesses with linesask the telephone company and these things probably too form up other scales quite similar to the havingness scale and when you had all these doingness scales paralleling the reality scale you would have this difference the thing which is the reality scale and its aspects which would be the doingness scale considerations with regard to these things in actuality would be over here on this other scale we mustnt confuse the thing with what you do with it you can have without doing its pretty hard however to do without having which is why reality is so important in running on the preclear now i hope you understand these two scales and i hope you will take them around with you on auditing and look them over little bit and understand what they are all about because were still talking about arc and as matter of fact well be talking lot about survive which is old hat but it has certainly been polished up and it certainly has nice new band and it certainly fits on lot more heads than it used to l ron hubbardhubbard communications office hco bulletin of 13 november 1957

_____________________________________________________________________ 15 november 1957 communication and isness man is as well off as he can consider himself dangerous to his environment i will tell you little short anecdote which is quite amusing well sometime early in 1945 i flunked my overseas examination well i crawled around and felt sorry for myself and the fact of it was that the judo instructor there at the hospital brought up the idea that there was shortage of people in the warthere was so he kept up my training for i think it was july 25th that i went down to hollywood and three sailors with petty officers ratings accosted on the street they were drunk they were out to kill officers and the three of them tied into an unbelievable thing happened one of them turned around facing him while the second one took heavy beer bottle to bring it down on my skull i took the fellow who brought the beer bottle down threw him over my head into this fellow who went down and hit the side of bumper the beer bottle hit the pavement broke the end off and the other fellow reared up where he had been sitting on the running board of car and i put it in his face thats what you are trained to do overnight the wound in my side healedovernight they wouldnt let out at all but i could get extended leave from the hospital i went down to hollywood and messed around at the studios in the middle of all that i managed to complete all the researches which id stacked up and which had been interrupted by the war steam where had it come from you get your teeth shoved in this way and that and you develop tremendous amount of inflow and then one day you just outflow the chief petty officer in charge of the shore patrol had been sitting at his desk telling under circumstances should you have taken any action you were trifling with your life telling what good boy i ought to be and then through the door he saw the shore patrol bring these people in of course they were all saturated with blood and they were all messed up and he just shut up right then he was running the usual social dramatizationyou must protect yourself the society teaches you to hold in all you have to do to somebody is to prevent him from outflowing to make him ill and someday he decides to outflow not only the social world but the world of yourself can act to cause you to prevent outflow outflow is prevented by regret it is prevented by all sorts of things if one has something terrifically valuable he protects itwhich is what prevent an inflow well when you say prevent an inflow you might as well say prevent an outflow if you hold flows from coming in toward you you might as well flow them in because sooner or later that dike that you put up is going to burst so you get these confounded actions in this universe composing picture of tremendous inflow not balanced at all by outflow what does this all add up to any time that you protect and defend you are aiding and abetting all the structures which make up this universe the child who is taught to defendhimself against these big vicious automobiles some day turns out to be one of the lousiest drivers you ever saw because he is taught to defend and protect all you have to assume is that safety is desirable to have all of the ills of pandoras box swarm around your head just what boxing glove can hit thetan i wouldnt know thetan has to mock himself up to be reachable you are dealing with the idea of what person is supposed to feel as result of when it comes to inflows and thats just an idea if person overdefends himself through some exaggerated idea of pain he will suffer the full consequences of that over defense just to the degree that anybody else overdefends himself to that degree so the reason for the defense or the reason for safety is variable but the consequences of it arent as long as you deal with masses and agreements and ideas directly concerning masses you are all right but when you go back into an opinion of what it ought to be as far as the preclear is concerned you are of course immediately in trouble any auditor who is having rough time with preclears not snapping them out of the hop immediately is paying attention to this factor which is variable which is opinion figurefigure ideas ideas ideas suppose we had cops in the society but there was the idea around that there were cops we would get some of the nuttiest ideas you have ever heard of we would have set of ideas about cops different for each person in the entire community why because there is way to experience cops cops are an idea which one cannot get into communication with therefore we get this great oddityabundance and scarcity only it isnt actually the possession of quantity it is only apparently quantitative it is having something to go into communication with im very sure that the whole world of disease is built entirely on this mechanism i seriously doubt the existence of any given germi seriously doubt it it is very embarrassing to men in sailing ships and so on very embarrassing to these fellows to have venereal diseases happen when they have had contact with women at all and i have seen that often enough in young boys that were as pure as the driven lily to understand completely that we didnt have here germ at work we had series of ideas at work fascinating subject in view of the fact that it has ruined as many lives down the decades and centuries as it has when you socially enter great many prohibitions against communication on the second dynamic you will get all sorts of interesting ideas aberration is caused by cut communication with the mass and is remedied by re established communication with the mass look what they are doing with the abomb this is one of the silliest things you ever saw in your life they make everything about it confidential secret and nobody must be let in on it and there is possibly more illness to radiation than that the formula for creating an illness is to establish terminal get everybody convinced that this terminal is there and refuse to let them communicate with it now one of the dangerous things to do with scientology would be to put it under the counter in the first place it isnt terminal terminal however must be maintained and access to that terminal must be preserved and it mustnt be put on confidential any part of it why because its already dynamite we do anything with it that can be done with anything lets not cut line to it and lets not put it beyond reach there would be certain fatality in doing that and yet every group that has ever learned series of great truths has inevitably gone into secret priesthoods concerning them which was of course destructive action it isnt jumping into ten thousand volts of current that electrocutes man its having so many times in the past disconnected from electricity when confronted with it every time you disconnect you to that degree lower your own toleranceobviously the electricity flying through these poles is more real to the individual being the line than the actual terminal of the pole why is it more real to him and his body because it has the greatest effect on him and his body he can touch the pole but he cant touch the juice that tells you there must be some terrific reality about the dangerousness of this juice and the pole is either in apathy or nonexistent therefore you can only teach one thing to preclear horribly enough and that isyou can communicate with it the communication with mass is the only thing we can do for him but we have to have mass we can get him to conceive of an isness and we can get him to communicate with it and by this he will change his mind concerning its existence he will change his mind concerning its conditions but most particularly and more important to you he will change his mind with regard to its abundance or scarcity and therefore its importance it is the scarcity or abundance of things which denotes their value or importance man who has lived too long without women will consider women dangerous so scarcities and abundances do declare the final state of ones reactions to anything when something becomes very scarce it is because one has cut communication and that action of cutting communication is the same action of defending or protecting self now as i say you can break out of this you can have this tremendous resurgence you can outflow you can act and thats all there is behind one of these resurgences by the way there are other factors or you as an auditor can bring him gently and quietly up on gradient scale until he can again communicate with the objects in his environment and he again will experience the same thing he experienced when he did this tremendous outflow we are reaching towards the same goals but were saying that by communication we establish the isness of existence and by doing that why we make people well l ron hubbardpab 125 professional auditors

_____________________________________________________________________ 1 december 1957 the parts of man i am going to go over with you the parts of man the first thing were going to take up is exteriorization as the most important part of man its the causation thats the thetan now the fact that you cant weigh one is because this is the author of weighing there is however way of experiencing this it is personal attitude it is personal view an individual can exteriorize and experience this phenomenon it is very easy to experience being thetan but its not easy to experience seeing one so therefore people tend quite markedly to become only ones here is phenomenon which person can experience himself but cannot observe in others there are many ways to experience the idea of somebody else exteriorizing exteriorization is the phenomenon of being in position of space dependent on only ones consideration able to view from that space bodies and the room as it is that is exteriorization well people who have difficulty controlling the body from close up i can assure you wont get out of their heads because they cant control anything at distance if you cant control body from distance you will find yourself very very reluctant to get out of your head it is as simple as that any phenomenon which occurs beyond the point of willingness to be out of the head or control the body from distance is regulated by the scarcity and abundance of bodies and universes and if you cant see your body then there is scarcity of them if you cant see the universe there is scarcity of that thats all there is to that now here is exteriorization keep your head from going away take your hands and hold on to your head and keep it from going away i dont know how many hours it would take with some preclears probably black 5 would have to sweat along at this for fifteen or twenty hours before he was really there but he would get there on that one technique that is quite amazing isnt it there are probably about five thousand other techniques this is the only shotgun one that i know the one that doesnt ever fail it is only contingent upon one thingbeing able to take hold of your head that is necessary prerequisite to that technique all right now lets take the next fact about this and we find that vision depends upon scarcity and abundance the ability to exteriorize depends on the willingness to exteriorize but the willingness to experience is totally monitored by the amount of things available to experience thetan gets quantitatively minded what good is human being the fact is there are too many of them to be seen now how about too few well on frontier the fewness of people is one of the fabulous things man dramatizes when he gets into an area of too few people he then kills the people who exist and when he gets into an area where there are too many people he then overlooks the people who exist somewhere in between this you will have progressive society and such society was the united statesanywhere between twentyfive and hundred million peoplethe united states was in there pitching but now that it has begun to exceed that people have started to disappear they arent that sounds to you like cynical statement if we were to have an atomic war and cut the population down to fifty million youd get another view it is simply statement of scarcity and abundance all right we take somebody and we can get him out of his head but would he just go out of his head without being gotten out of his head well yes scarcity and abundance will actually kick him out of his head scarcity and abundance of what lets say that the preclears idea of the scarcity or abundance of rooms depends then upon his willingness to view them you have to put him into direct contact with the isness of rooms now lets go little bit further than that and look at the body if he has too few bodies he is certainly going to be unwilling to get out of the body he is in and if he has too many right where he is hell be trapped there too he wont know where he is so remedying his havingness on the subject of his own body is very necessary to an accurate and stable exteriorization so much for exteriorization lets go off now into the second part which is the mind by mind today we mean that structure of mental image pictures and machinery on which the preclear is depending for his opinions and ideas the structure of the mind is totally composed of mental image pictures im afraid the mind doesnt produce any thoughts the mind may be considered to have certain phonograph records the phonograph record as you know doesnt play unless you put needle on the platter well the thetan is the needle on the platter and unless the record is played directly it doesnt activate it any livingness even thetan exteriorized tends to utilize some sort of mental image pictures but when he reads all of the records in the mind as the absolute truth and fact and conviction when he is obeying concatenations of i am supposed to we have behavior patterns we have mental reactions we have all of these various things that were never studied by the way in psychology i dont know where psychologist lives but its certainly not in this universe now the exact workings of this mechanism depend on association and differentiation or identification and differentiation now when that part of the mind which we call reactive mind begins to identify everything with everything in order to get certain pattern responses and is able to exert its influence upon person far better than the thetan himself can we say that this person is suffering from reactive conduct aaaa now associationdifferentiation are the two principles of the mind it is supposed to tell the difference between two or more things and it is supposed to tell the similarity between two or more things now mind in good shape doesnt identify what causes association to become identification lack of objects lack of incidents lack of experience when you have too few things happen to you youre liable to have all sorts of things happen to you in other words if you are busy and there are lots of incidents there is high probability that you will not suffer the consequences thereof but if you are not busy and you are idle then you are liable to long for those times when you were very busy and if you are ever worried about mental image picture its because you havent enough to worry about where all drama is tailormade for you you are in grave jeopardy in tv screen world you are apt to be in trouble because the tv is only pattern of lights and shadows which is restimulative mechanism to shuffle your bank around and give you again some segment of that which you have already experienced its funny thing that people will not read about certain periods if you are talking to somebody who is very upset on the subject of past lives you should realize that he was probably just executed up at sing sing in 1932 or 1933 and he just cant stand the idea it is only people who are borderline insanity cases who got up and screamed about past lives this i have kept very careful tally on they were people who were terrified people who were incapable ever of holding their own on the subject they couldnt have talked about it very long before past life would have snapped in and snapped their heads off those incidents which are most scarce tend to stick hardest lets look at this thing called the mind and lets find that the mind is mechanism for overcoming the lack of incidents lack of experience in present time by storing pictures andknowingnesses of the past which could be made available to the present preclear is always losing incidents one of the methods of not losing them would be to simply suspend them as picture now if you restore his ability to make these pictures solid youve really done something he can have the picture then any time he wants in its full form you have to change the idea of how much picture and incident is actually necessary in order to alter the preclears viewpoint and you change that with scarcity and abundance scarcity and abundance naturally comes up and is handled by havingness now lets take up the final and remaining part of man which is the body now the body is solid appendage which makes person recognizable the body is game of considerable magnitude and very popular at this time it is quite old but still very popular the body can be monitored and handled by mental image pictures and it can also be monitored and handled by thetans fortunately but body is subject to these two other things it is actually not possible to change body without changing the other two things the body is modified by the mind and the thetan and is actually very low order of mest now the anchor points of the body are quite interesting in that the body exists as solid only within these spaces and in the absence of some of these anchor points the body will aberrate its shape we know the fastest way to change body shape is to put the thetan into condition of willingness to handle anchor points and then remedy the scarcity and abundance of anchor points and put the actual anchor points back there and have him put them back there you will see the body change its shape health and general characteristics now mental image pictures also influence the body and they influence the body basically by influencing these anchor points facsimile evidently imposes itself by magnetic fields and currents and other things upon the anchor point system it is quite interesting so therefore the body is handled and controlled on mental level through these anchor points if you were sailing along seventyfive feet back of your head some day and you see some preclear come along just shift your range of vision enough to find that preclears wing anchor points if you were to get hold of one of these wing anchor points and just bend it off linethe person will walk in circle as long as you hold the anchor point out of line the person will walk out of line joints operate because of anchor point structure the body is then held together by electronic structure which is easily influenceable and that electronic structure has much more command upon the body than the mest around it and the thetan goes through these very many vias of mental image pictures and these anchor points and thus influences the structure of the body now to influence the mind by influencing the body is only possible by doing something to the havingness of the thetan now you can influence thetan by influencing the body lets not overlook this point but that influence only takes place to degree that it influences abundance and scarcity in other words as you influence his ideas of havingness of bodies so you influence his condition with regard to bodies and we reinfluence the body we find out that body can be moved thus influencing the thetan or two or three bodies can be put back thus influencing the thetan and we have simply run the back flow of mass reaction on the person and we do that in auditing all the time we adjust the persons havingness his ability to communicate with an isness his ability to conceive an isness to communicate with it this is havingness this is the way you run havingness there in essence we have the body but with the three subdivisions of human being we have to include the fact that he lives in the universeall right these then are the three parts of beingness with the condition that one lives in the universe and these are interinfluencing these parts of man each one of them are insistent upon experience incident man grows old minds become complicated thetans become wise but at time does their capability or ability in general lessen only their willingness to live increases and decreases and that increases and decreases in direct ratio that there is scarcity or abundance of the various things in which they are interested and these scarcities and abundances influence them and monitor their conduct or any culture the cure for this is to put the person into communication with actual isness or the isness of any given object and to permit him to reacquaint himself with that and so by auditing his life can be righted l ron hubbardissue 60 1957 ca early december the magazine of dianetics and scientology from washington dc

experiments of the new such periods of change are violent many things many men may not survive them what will it take to survive this change who can survive it and sail onward to live in new times the lucky and the clear but who are the lucky but the clear scientology for the individual is passport to this new time scientology for the group is the survival of the state old shaky basis of thought could last out the fire of the period of change quivering unstable person could survive the duress of the times just now to come ones first duty to all is to be himself clear able to survive able to lead his own destiny by the handones next duty is to his fellows to be sure their ability can compare to the tasks imposed by the new state of things the answer to these trials is contained in scientology and scientology is the answer to you only clear could think and act fast enough to live in disaster and to make others live only clear could survive in space only clear could enjoy the

know the wayhubbard communications office 1812 19th street nw washington dc hco bulletin 1 of 3 december 1957 clear procedure definitions goals there are three possible goals in processing preclear the first of these is mest clear the second is theta clear the third is operating thetan by mest clear is meant book one clear here we defined clear in terms of facsimiles this is rather simple mechanical definition it said in effect that so far as human beings were concerned our preclear finally arrived at point where he had full colorvisio sonic had psychoses or neuroses and could recall what had happened to him in this lifetime this is almost babytalk sort of clear it pays heed at all to identification with body and it has nothing to do with ability today by running creative processes four years old we can turn on visible facsimiles and weed out the bottom spots of operations and what not this is actually rather easy goal somehow ive never given real tight procedure for achieving it even though the essence of the processes have been around for very long time completing step six of clear procedure in full gives us mest clear by theta clear is meant clear obtained by clear procedure as is being delineated in this regimen the main trouble is amusingly trying to reach mest clear without running into theta clear i personally dont believe now that it can be done without actually shoving the pc back in his head every time he pops out thus the goal of this procedure is actually theta clear this is what we mean then when we say clear we mean theta clear by operating thetan we mean theta clear plus ability to operate functionally against or with mest and other life forms for the first time we have here the matter of ability an operating thetan is not an absolute term theta clear is more absolute term than operating thetan an operating thetan is theta clear not mystical mystic out on an inversion who can also do something thus we have two goals which contain ambition to accomplish anything and one goal which contains much ambition now here is another puzzle in definitions which is highest the theta clear or the operating thetan well the answer to that is not what we used to think as doingness is not really at the top we find that we will probably make an operating thetan before we achieve theta clear for theta clear would probably not be much interested in operating therefore we see that the actual goal we are trying to reach matter in which limited sense is operating thetan operating thetan is then highly variable goal thetan who can move in and out of body is actually operating somewhat but he is not really theta clear since theta clear in its highest sense means further dependency upon bodies the goals of the auditor therefore do not rack up one two three mest clear theta clear operating thetan they actually stack up on very gradient scale between thetan inoperative and thetan who can operate the auditor is therefore seeking to reach with the pc state wherein the pc can function at time does the auditor suddenly arrive with pc in startling new shiny state all of sudden that can be called certain thing in that pcs often expect this suddenly bursting into the light the auditor is subjected to disappointment when hehas actually achieved an enormous gain for the pc in other words pcs gain on smooth gradient scale and do not suddenly become something there is only one point on the road up where something does happen and that is exteriorization when the pc exteriorizes for the first time he feels there must be cause for rejoicing and has the idea he has gotten somewhere well in fact you could achieve the same result by hitting him over the head with club he would exteriorize the point is not exteriorizing the pc but cutting down his dependency upon body pc who exteriorizes and is not carried right on with the same process that sprang him out of his head until it is flat will go back into his head in an hour or week and will be harder to dig out the next time in other words this point of exteriorization does happen and does mean to the pc that he is himself but it shouldnt mean very much to an auditor beyond his noticing that this phase has been entered in the case for in truth thetans dont stay out of their bodies very long if they are not in good shape thus exteriorization means less than ability to act to live to be and do the attention of the auditor should be upon the increasing ability of the pc to handle life not upon the distance the pc gets from his body is that clear well it tells us that arriving at state of clear is easy if that means stable outside and that any state of betterment on the road to operating thetan is an honest achievement thus an auditor should at all times go toward the state of operating thetan and should not be mixed up in the oddities of exteriorization for day hgc clear procedure goes straight toward exteriorization and achieves it but it also goes straight toward increasing ability to handle life the latter is the auditors best goal the auditing goal should go in the same direction as this new definition for operating thetan an operating thetan can be at cause knowingly and at will over life matter energy space and time subjectively and objectively this action definition of operating thetan is the true goal of the auditor and if followed with complete understanding will achieve the best possible results in this discussion of goals and definitions i am telling you cleanly that the goals of mest clear and theta clear are not worth following from the auditors standpoint you can let pcs think what they will about them the only goal worthy of the auditors time whatever the state of case of the pc is operating thetan to achieve one on any subject it is only necessary to place the pc to some degree at willing and knowing cause point with regard to that subject all the steps of hgc clear procedure are leveled at operating thetan but you need not tell your pc that you can use the words release mest clear theta clear or any other if you like just remember there is only one payoff goal and that is operating thetan mest clear can see facsimiles with sonic present lifetime has psychoses or neuroses upper part of apa in uk oca graph above 135 iq theta clear can exist knowingly independent of bodies release average third of graph

internationally the booklet published in great britain will be photolitho of the us photolitho copy the booklet may not be published in whole or in part by anyone but the hco clear procedure continued step one participation in session by the pc we have long known that arc was important just how important it is was established by some tests i made in london in 1956 wherein every time the pc showed any restlessness or other signs of loss of havingness instead of remedying havingness i carefully searched out any fancied break of arc and patched it up the loss of havingness vanished in other words loss of arc is even more important than loss of havingness since repair of arc restores havingness lack of havingness is only one symptom of lack of communication there are two ways an auditor according to long practice can err one of these is to permit twoway communication to point where the pcs havingness is injured the other is to chop communication to such degree that havingness is injured there is point past which communication is bad and short of which lack of communication is bad here we have auditor judgment at play because the pc will fidget or go downscale in tone when his havingness drops an auditor can see when the pcs havingness is being lowered because pc will go anaten or start to grind into the process an auditor can tell whether or not the pc feels his communication has been chopped when either happens the auditor should take actionin the first instance by shutting off the pcs outflow and getting to work and in the second instance by making the pc talk out any fancied communication severance participation in session by the pc is not something the auditor sees to at the beginning of the session and then forgets for the rest of the intensive this step is continued throughout the intensive and is given as much attention as any process being run at the time the auditors attention is always therefore upon two thingsfirst the continued participation in session and second the action of the process grouped under this head we would also have ways and means of getting the pc into session in the first place an unconscious pc used to be an apparent road block downtone antagonistic youcanthelpme pc was also rough one these two things are countered by always carefully starting session and following through on standard cch 0 it is as important to open session with baby or an unconscious person as it is with any other preclear it doesnt matter whether the pc is answering up or not it is only necessary to assume that the pc would answer if he could answer and that the mechanics of voice and gesture are simply absent from the answer therefore one always carefully starts every session paying attention to what is happening where it is happening who is there help goals and problems obviously anaten or inability to control the body are the present time problem of the unconscious person or the child one can actually audit this with plain question and simplyassume after bit it has been answered then give the acknowledgement and ask another question just as though the pc were in full vocal action auditors still fall for the belief very current that unconscious people are unable to think or be aware in any way thetan is seldom unconscious regardless of what the body is doing or not doing present time problem is highly vital point of preclear participation if preclear is being nagged too thoroughly by pt problem auditing can actually send him downhill if done without addressing the problem whole intensive even seventyfive hours can be wasted if the auditor does not clear the pt problem the preclear generally doesnt know he has one which is nagging him for the rough pt problems go into the apathy band and below into forgetfulness rather rapidly therefore the auditor should ferret out the pt problem with an emeter adroit use of an emeter does not include evaluating for the preclear but it certainly does include ferreting out pt problems the emeter is also used for valences and sometimes psychophysical difficulties auditor use the word psychophysical rather than psychosomatic and stay out of medical field the running of pt problem today is the most pt problem valences psychophysical ailments all run beautifully with mock up something worse than terminal or invent something worse than terminal to run this it is necessary to isolate the terminal most intimately connected with the pt problem or the valence or psychophysical difficulty one then clears the command and you always better do that with any command and lets go the whole idea of worse than is the whole of the dwindling spiral people who are trying to get better and be more perfect and think the right thought lose all control of getting worse being imperfect and thinking the wrong thought all these worse thans are then left on automatic and we arrive at something less than optimum in fact we arrive with the dwindling spiral we also arrive with the point of return we also arrive with the declining ability to heal or get well and we also arrive with old age after running worse than on the pt problem we proceed with other parts of cch 0 clearing help will be found quite beneficial but to get pc to participate who is downright ugly about it running help is usually only partial solution when these only ones get going they really snarl on the subject of getting audited here cch 1 is of benefit questions asked but this of course defeats the purpose of step one participation of the pc in the session is necessary in order to place the pc somewhat at the cause point in the actual fact of auditing this fits the definition you can always change body or recover it from some illness by auditing without much helping the pc himself therefore the pc while under auditor control is still somewhat at cause what with comm bridges and clearing commands etc but he is made to feel bad effects from being at effect if ample arc is used in other words the pc cant be entirely at cause in session or he would be selfauditing which isnt good but he can be salvaged from being total effect by good arc when the arc drops out that does leave the pc at more or less total effect thing you have probably noticed the things to be done in cch 0 should be done thoroughly at intensives beginning and should be glanced at whenever new session starts and should get bow when new command is used but all cch 0 is is collection of mechanical aids to assist the pcs participation in the session and to assist the auditor in arc although cch 0 must be used always it is not total substitute for arc the sum of cch 0 is find the auditor find the auditing room find the pc knock out any existing pt problem establish goals clear help get agreement on session length and get up to the first real auditing command cch 0 isnt necessarily run in that order and this isnt necessarily all of cch 0 but if any of these are seriously scamped the session will somewhere get into troublewhen the participation of the pc ceases in session he must be gotten back into session by any means and then participation is reestablished pc is never permitted to end session on his own choice he seeks to end them when his participation drops out of sight the trick question what did i do wrong reestablishes arc the problem of handling pc who is not cooperative who does not wish to participate is highly special problem in the first place it is the pcs engrams that do not want to continue in the second place it is the engrams which are doing the talking one ordinarily tackles this case with formal opening of session brief but positive and then sails in with cch 0 just as though the person were unconscious which of course the person is participation by an unconscious person while covered above requires the additional refinement of technique one must always find something the preclear can do and then better that ability an unconscious person is usually lying in bed if not the command must be varied to fit the environment but the best command is something like you make that body lie in that bed slightly upper grade process to person sitting in chair is you seat that body in that chair in such cases grip on the pcs hand and the use of slight squeeze each time the auditor acknowledges considerably speeds the process there is another special caseor maybe it isnt so special there are many people who cannot tackle present time problem with process if the auditor sought out pt problem and then ran something worse than related terminal or problem of comparable or incomparable magnitude he would find the pc digging in hard unable to handle the process thus some judgment must be used in such cases dont run pt problem on somebody in very bad shape casewise there is an awful lot to know about starting sessions the bad off case and the case in very good condition alike require special handling for the case just mentioned who cannot handle pt problem with process there is always locational tr ten tr ten will run pt problem or anything else if slowly thus many person with pt problem can only participate in session to the extent of tr ten you notice that objectwall floor chair etc by introducing in the auditors and pcs bodies as couple of the items being spotted along with everything else we eventually wind up with find the auditor find the auditing room find the pc and we get there without pt problem being in full bloom in running you notice that object there are some things that must be observed most important of these is this one any process which turns on somatic must be continued until it longer turns on somatics this is true particularly of tr ten 8c and trio the case hangs right there until the process is flat whether in one day one year or six another thing which must be stressed is the inclusion of the auditors and pcs bodies because some pcs when exteriorized snap back in when they see the body is reason to avoid it in tr ten another thing is to make the pc use his eyes to view the objects and if he doesnt turn his eyes toward them then it is up to the auditor to use manual direction of the head and even pry the eyes open balks are ever permitted in auditing if tr ten is being run at problem every now and then the auditor pauses and discusses the problem again with the pc in order to keep it in restimulation until tr ten can run it out the high case is worse problem than auditors commonly believe in the first place high case can blow situation out of the bank with considerable ease and if the auditor insists on sledgehammering it out with process then pc participation blows rather than facsimile high case participation can also be misunderstood in that there are lot of cases that think they are high which arent heres how you tell real high case from bogus i can do everything case thetan in good shape can be cause when he looks at something in the bank it becomes the effect bogus high case can think anything he wants without anything having an effect on the bank you want to watch this point because here is the definition of ot thoroughly at work pc at cause case that has pictures and everything and is impatient to geton with it but does not markedly alter the bank with thinking alone is not high case but an old wide open case of dianetic days twoway communication as process is the key to all this if you put pc on an meter and locate present time charge you can if the pc can somewhat handle his bank get him to twoway comm the incident flat very quicklyin five or ten minutes at the most this is all the process used it would take an actual emeter run to give you full reality on this here we are looking at the basic difference amongst cases that difference lies in the ability to knowingly cause bodies are the same they all react alike banks differ only vaguely and only in content and significance engrams are engrams and they all behave alike there is only one difference amongst pcs we called this basic personality in book one we can be lot more simple about it now that i have my teeth into the subject few more feet the difference is degree of knowing causability what do we mean by cause the basic old scientology definition is still at work causedistance effect joe knowingly shoots bill joe is at cause bill is at effect mary gives john present mary is at cause john is at effect bill says boo to joe bill is at cause joe is at effect but when we introduce knowing cause and cause at will into this cause distanceeffect idea we see we have something else added the person at cause is there because he knows he is there and because he is willingly there the person at cause is not at cause because he does not dare be at effect he must be able to be at effect if he is afraid to be at effect then he is unwilling cause and is at cause only because he is very afraid of being at effect education can show person he can be at effect without liability then he can be at cause without having to be because he doesnt dare be at effect auditing in its whole operation is teaching the pc this pc slides from terrified effect to tolerated effect to knowing cause with regard to any incident he contacts if he is audited properly the pc who has to get rid of all his engrams because he has to get rid of them because its all too horrible winds up with good auditing into tolerance of the pictures since he has learned he can tolerate them and so can swing around to cause so we have this great difference in pcs degree of knowing causability is the extent that he is willing to be at cause and the extent he is willing to know he is at cause plus the ability to cause things you will see this on an emeter in pt problem handling bill has pt problem it drops dial when first contacted the auditor using his understanding of scientology two way comms on it the incident discharges and longer registers after few minutes mary has pt problem it drops steeply on the emeter the auditor tries to twoway comm on it the charge remains the same or mary begins to disperse she doesnt hold to the subject the auditor at length finds that twoway comm only serves to run down her havingness the charge remains on the meter dial what is the difference between bill and mary bill can be at knowing cause mary is either obsessive cause or heavy effect bill can blow facsimiles mary cannot on mary the auditor is very wise to enter upon tr ten one version of tr ten is called short spotting you notice that nearby object so long as the pc can see with his eyes the object or feel the auditors hand on it the process works it is spotting right up close if run with mediumly near and far objects such as the room wall it is very effective in getting case going it has given some cases their first reality on auditing but the rule still holds here about somatics when somatic is turned on with process turn it off with that process see auditors code 13 this is entirely true of short spotting in that it almost always turns on somatics when you start it you have to flatten it and thats often lengthy remember this about pc participation low case cant handle the bank therefore you keep high arc and kidglove him through session very high case doesnt need dynamite therefore you retain his participation by going as rapidly as you can medium average case needs arc something of dynamite something of kidgloves something of twoway command in all good auditing cases improve just because you start pc low doesnt mean hell always stay low check the case often see if his causability is rising if it isnt he isnt improving and you better go easier or heavier probably when case doesnt improve you didnt handle pt problem that is the only thing which can keep case from gaining so check every session for one there are probably thousands of ways to gain the participation of the pc there are probably thousands of ways to open session there are probably an infinite number of tricky things you can do however this breadth of choice should not obscure the following 1 pc who is not participating in the session is not at cause 2 an auditor who isnt able to maintain arc who isnt able to freeze process for short time even tone 400 process and reestablish arc will not get results 3 the endall of processing is the attainment of goal the goal of ot one always processes the problems and difficulties of the pc he does not process the process processes only assist in processing the pc they will not do anything by themselves processes are road map to the goal of ot they are nothing in themselves the target is the condition the disabilities of the pc how one achieves the eradication of these difficulties is secondary to the fact of their eradication scientology is route attained after several thousand years of attainment by man and the route is important and valuable and must be travelled correctly but the concern is the pc not the route 4 new auditor can be adrift with his tools he is uncertain as to what he is attacking he should have reality on engrams locks keyins secondaries the time track the key buttons of scientology such as communication control and havingness given an understanding of all these and the theory of scientology itself he can almost pilot his way through case with twoway comm but twoway comm will not work if one doesnt understand all the above so twoway comm is not conversation the pc has had few trillion years of that and it hasnt made him well so twoway comm is highly specialized thing done with full understanding of the thetan bank and body good twoway comm means participation by the pc 5 scientology is precise commodity something like engineering pc is precise thing part animal part pictures and part god we want the ability to handle things and the god and the less unthinking responses in the pc the better off he will be therefore pc who isnt cogniting regularly is being processed beyond his ability to do and it is necessary to drop back downscale to find something he can do 6 the golden rule of processing is to find something the preclear can do and then to improve his ability to do it at once you will have participation the highest ability one pc had was to get drunk resolution of his case was entered upon by having him invent ways to get drunk 7 the attention span of children and psychos is not necessarily factor since it is only the phenomena of dispersal against mental blocks keying in of incidents the auditor can pay attention to it or not as he likes short regular sessions on people with limited attention span get more gain per week than steady grind since the participation is maintained 8 the auditor remains at cause in all sessions without forbidding the pc to be at cause see the rules in dianetics the original thesis l ron hubbardhubbard communications office 1812 19th street nw washington dc hco bulletin of 7 december 1957 hgc procedure the following is laid down as an entirety of processing to be done in the hgc in london other processes or variations are allowed goal operating thetan definition an operating thetan is one who can be knowingly at cause over life matter energy space and time cch 0 in brief find auditor find pc find auditing room clear help and goals but in the main handle the pt problem if it exists if it doesnt exist do cch 0 briefly and quickly and get on with the session it will be noted that giving pcs attention to auditing room or environment can turn on somatic after three or four commands after one command of have you got an auditing room this becomes process called locational if locational turns on somatic it must be run until somatic is flat therefore the auditor has business attempting locational or getting the pc involved unless he intends to do something about it present time problem the pc is put on an emeter before pt problem is discussed when the emeter has been adjusted one third of dial surge when pc squeezes cans the auditor asks if the pc has present time problem after little discussion of this the needle may surge if it does the auditor locates the pt problems most intimate terminal and runs with the pc still holding the cans invent something worse than indicated terminal until the problem flattens out on the dial the auditor can ask for and run another pt problem or even three or four but always flattening down the surge of the needle if the pc is 50 below the center line of the apa it is not safe to run invent instead without scouting around invent but knowing the graph in the first place simply two way comms the problem and runs locational until the problem flattens out on the needle the auditor does not begin with invent and then change his mind and run locational it is an either or the auditor starts with invent or he starts with locational and whichever he does he does not change if locational turns on somatic it must be run until locational longer turns on somatics once the pt problem is flat the auditor puts away the emeter scs steps scs begins with 8c of any kind if 8c turns on somatic it runs until it longer turns on somatics 8c is run formal or tone 40 start is then run as per 1956 change is then run as per 1956stop is then run as per 1956 if each of these is flattened in turn it does not mean that scs is flat it means only that start is probably unflattened thus one again runs start after stop runs change after start stop after change until none of the three unflatten the others more 8c can be run there is error in liberally running 8c which is after all more complicated locational of short spotting sort spotting steps spotting itself is broad process locational is only one of many spotting processes spotting spots in the past in space in the present short spotting locational done up close are all effective spotting depends for its workability on the dislike of thetan of being located it runs best of course with the thetan at cause doing the spotting connectedness is the basic process on association of theta with mest all forms and kinds of association including being caught in traps are prone to become identifications as in dianetics connectedness puts the thetan at cause in making the mest or people when run outside connect with him the command is get the idea of making indicated object connect with you the auditor points the worse off person is the less reality they have on far objects havingness is complicated connectedness also permissive one thus trio is above connectedness and may be used when connectedness is flat l ron hubbard lrhrd copyright 1957 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedpab 126 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous

december 1957 problems handling and running easily the most important process in scientology is problems of comparable magnitude it has peers we dont care how low process runs or how high it runs but nowhere in scientology do we have process which runs as high and low as problems of comparable magnitude now that idea of span should be clearly understood by you there are processes which undoubtedly run lower or higherof this we are certain but other process runs both so low and so high the only thing necessary in problem of comparable magnitude is for the terminal selected to be real to the preclear now that is necessary condition for the running of it problems of comparable magnitude become real only if the terminal or terminals selected become real that is the first condition where this process breaks down it is actually not being run since problems of comparable magnitude by definition is process which brings the preclear to invent situations of similar importance to given situation and the given situation must be composed of one or more terminals now what do we mean by terminal it would be any fixed mass utilized in communication system thus you see man would be terminal but post could also be terminal thus head could be terminal but so could hat but between the two we get hat as questionable it is questionable to the degree that it has less mass and is easily shed somewhere along the line there is border between terminal and condition now we have to know what condition is condition is circumstance regarding mass or terminal when you are asking for problems of comparable magnitude if you run them on conditions you are calling for circumstance or problem comparable to circumstance which doesnt have any fixed position and never did have any fixed position and never did operate in any communication system so you are describing descriptionand there is nothing into which the preclear can get his teeth first we must conceive then difference between condition and terminal that is quite important for you to conceive if you cant conceive the difference between condition and terminal why youre in for it this technique will forever be beyond your graspand that is very easy thing to conceive however the light is on now on is circumstance regarding the light so you wouldnt run problem of comparable magnitude to on but you would run problem of comparable magnitude to the light do you see that it sounds idiotic but lot of people miss this one lets take this now and see that there are masses and all masses are only relatively fixed masses are masses and they are not by the way particlesmasses are something that are shed from thetan by mockup and particles are something that are shed from masses you dont run particles so what we mean as terminal has relatively fixed identifiable isolatable location in space now just why you dont run particles just why you dont run problems of comparable magnitude to words just why you dont run problems of comparable magnitude to conditions of one kind or another that is best demonstrated by your running it some timeand thats happy adventure for the auditor not the preclear to make real surefire test why you should run something like this problem of comparable magnitude to fancy words now that is indefinite enough and up in the air enough you would shoot the bottom out from your preclear fast enough the auditor to run this successfully must choose first and foremost terminal as his targetnot condition the next thing is to choose the right terminal now you must understand the procedure of running this technique now you wonder why im stressing this the most fabulous thingthis technique can go off the rails faster in auditing than any other technique i know anything about now one of the things that is most remarkable about it is that auditors do not accept from the preclearproblems in other words an auditor who is obsessively solving problems would have an awful time running this technique because he has to accept from the preclear problem every time the preclear answers the question the way to run it is this it actually requires about three answers you said give problem of comparable magnitude to your mother and the preclear said the atlantic ocean now if the auditor said well how could that be problem to you you would get this oddity the preclear would say well the atlantic ocean overflowing its banks now an auditor who cant stand problems would accept this one as problembut it is condition the first thing the preclear gave was what he conceived to be comparable terminal then he gave condition and only on another repetition of how could that be problem to you would it come home to him but there was problem involved with ithow could that be problem to you so the auditing commands are give problem of comparable magnitude to terminal how could that be problem to you and if necessary how could that be problem to you and as many times as necessary to get the preclear to finally dredge out the problem unless the preclear can get that idea of problem the technique is unworkable the semantics of the thing may throw him therefore the command could be cleared with some profit the word that is liable to throw the command is problem not comparable magnitude and because those are polysyllabic you are liable to believe that on some preclears comparable magnitude is where they will hang up and this is not where they hang up the auditing of it must include another thing and that is feeling on the part of the preclear himself figuring on it this is evidently necessary part of the running we say problem of comparable magnitude to your mother the preclear says the atlantic ocean we say how could that be problem to you the preclear says oh its overflowing its banks and you say all right how could that be problem to you he says oh i could figure out some way to keep it from going over its banks if youre not sure yet because you wouldnt be sure with that one you say but how could that be problem to you oralternative command here can you get yourself figuring how to do that hell get thatthats what you want hes got to get an idea of himself figuring it out you want that included in the anatomy of the running of it now an alternative command to all this is incomparable magnitude as i have just mentioned when you tackle something so huge so formidable that it would mean couple of hours comm lag on the part of your preclearyou see hes just this moment been informed that he is going to be electrocuted at dawnyou want to desensitize him and blow him out of his head and leave them dead body which would be good jokesomething on this order you see you realize that this problem could be huge his fixation is unbelievably great it goes from horizon to horizon down to the very center of the earth and fills the entire universe onthe other side and thats how big this problem is now this technique of incomparable magnitude enters in at the bottom on problems if person cant get datum of comparable magnitude why what do you suppose that you should do get problem of incomparable magnitude you cannot evaluate on single datum except by postulate of course you yourself should be in condition whereby you simply say that is important or that isnt important and that could then be the evaluation of any single datum but you would longer be human you are aware of the fact by the way that you cannot be human and be rightthat is not possible i have mentioned that before now here we have then necessity to have evaluation by others evaluation from other people now get this idea of the onlyoneness of problems or situations when person is longer pronouncing the evaluation of things in some grand and kingly style when he has surrendered this in order to have more intricate and involved game he then needs two data it requires certain amount of experience of evil to experience good and we get some people who are around telling us how bad it all is who have experienced great deal of kindness this is great oddity you should look it over all you have to do is to restimulate the early goodness to slip into the consequences of the later evil supposing somebody was just being filthy mean and we compliment him on his good heart his love of his fellow menand well watch him chuck his cookies hes liable to fold right up in front of you you could restimulate such thing into being until it collapsed and was longer button we understand things when we are longer evaluating by postulate but when we are being polite and evaluating by proof by demonstration we longer are able to accept an onlyone thing this is bad thing because thetan is to marked degree an onlyone creature and it restimulates his own beingness when he falls into the lower harmonics of his own beingness he comes to grief all youve got to do is exaggerate being thetan in any one of its facets and youre in trouble but now it doesnt say that you cannot attain these things i said the lower harmonics how does he get to the lower harmonics by fixation by fixations on various incidents and certainly on things which exist as onlyone there is nothing else like it so you can never look away if you want to look at such thing you have to look at it and this becomes very bad very very bad as matter of fact it becomes very amusing when you have problems of comparable magnitude because person is using when he runs this his desire for evaluation but hes putting evaluation on cause basis and you are running off the highest logics in logic straight out of the bank so person doesnt have to have beautiful sunshine in the streets in order to have beautiful day do you understand that person to marked degree ceases to be dependent upon his environment to give him pleasure or pain if you stand around and wait for something else to decide it is something or other you are in bad trouble now children do thisdo this to such marked degree that they dont even know how much pain is painful until they ask momma or ask poppa child is dependent on exterior evaluation and ive seen child go so far as not to eat ice cream why ice creams bad i dont like ice cream i said what i was pretty fast on my feet as an auditor and i said who told you that oh well who told you that i said ice creams good horrible thing to do i ran out the other persons magic spell and ran my own in kids straightwire rather fast you can straighten out almost anything with child if you straightwire them thus we look over the situation and find out that an individual is made to suffer by life to degree that he is made to by life thus his evaluation of life from himself as cause point as an ability is necessary to his recovery we find this under problems of comparable magnitude we could go off and discuss the whole subject of logic you realize the second we say comparable magnitude im going to point your attention to the prelogics by the way im going to ask you to read those the only reason problems of comparable magnitude works so well and easily is that the individual puts certain things on automatic which is to say he will not take certainresponsibilities for one side of dichotomy he abandons all responsibility for evil its an interesting state of affairs because he becomes incapable of handling evil and then goes on this onetwo basis of stimulusresponse and in his next life hes going to be totally evil he didnt take any responsibility for it and its going to eat him up you take enough responsibility for lion youll dine on himevery time there is an interesting experiment that you can perform yourselfi advise that you should perform this to have an understanding of responsibility and automaticity because automaticity and responsibility are nowhere more necessary to understand than in problems of comparable magnitudeand that is this get the idea of the effort it took to make that wall get the idea of anything in the line of effort and feel almost at once the overwhelming irresponsibility concerning it it could be an irresponsibility so great it could make you practically ill if you wanted to be real mean to preclear not improve him particularly you could just ask him give an idea of the effort necessary to make your case he would be sitting right there in total irresponsibility for his case his case is there hes not responsible for it now how do you recover his responsibility for anything he has to be able to handle it now you could put something on automatic but usually when you do you will sooner or later get into an irresponsibility for it because thats what automatic is so we put something on automatic well if we put problems on automatic then we ourselves become problem eventually without our consent in other words we put problems on automatic then we ourselves become solution and when we ourselves are in nothing but solution the whole world around us is nothing but problem and were obsessively solution and all the problems are automatic we wind down faster than any other method i know well wind up being problem thats all the whole service facsimile can be summed up by just this one wordsolution service facsimile is solution thats all if you took over this automaticity of problems the individual then could recover from his service facsimile but remember that you had better run terminals not conditions what i have just been talking to you about solves in toto all of that which we were going over in 1952 concerning service facsimilesand that is quite mouthful if you do it this way if you know how to do it if you can look over this whole thing and see quickly how it is done and why it is done and get it set and settled so you know whats going on with the preclear then youll be able to handle chronic somatics directly you will be able to handle any dynamic directly l ron hubbardhubbard communications office 1812 19th street nw washington dc hco bulletin of 16 december 1957 present time problem the handling of present time problem is relatively simple but requires certain deftness on an emeter definition present time problem is one which has its elements in the material universe in present time which is going on now and which would demand the preclears attention to such an extent that he would feel he had better be doing something about it rather than be audited example auditor locates girl friend as pt problem of pc he runs problem with invent something worse considers it flat never looks at it again in intensive girl friend calls up pc every night invalidates him finally makes him so sick she carts him off in triumph to hospital blunder auditor tried to clear pt problem for the whole intensive not at the beginning of each session blunder auditor in this case went backtrack to dead wife to clean up charge pt problem is cleaned up as itself only one doesnt backtrack to get why the pc has such problem when doing cch 0 pt problem is checked at the beginning of every sessionand if there is break at noon is cleaned up also at the beginning of the afternoon session pt problem doesnt always bop on the meter at the first question the auditor has to spend little time asking around and making sure then he audits it on if it falls under above definition of pt problem things to audit pt problem with very bad off case tr ten and if it turns on somatic flatten tr ten you notice that object an average case isolate the terminal most closely associated with the problem and run invent something worse than terminal and then flatten it off with invent problem of comparable magnitude to terminal also can be run spot where terminal is now okay spot where you are now okay very easy case two way comm about the problem and terminals getting pc to cognite until the charge is gone where the pt problem is pain in some member of the body the auditor can run recall an unwanted member that hurts and when that has been run for few cycles from present to past recall lost member that hurts always run lost and unwanted in the same session and for the same length of time short spotting will also relieve pain but is rough on the pc unless wholly flattened and run along with medium and long spotting l ron hubbardhubbard communications office 23 hancock street joubert park johannesburg hco bulletin of 18 december 1957 psychosis neurosis and psychiatrists an auditor who does not understand the true character of neurosis and psychosis is likely to find himself trying to understand neurotics and psychotics and psychiatrists and to the degree of that ununderstanding could become the effect of these if we examine the definition for operating thetan we find his highest capability is knowing and willing cause this should tell us at once that the definition of neurosis and psychosis would be unknowing and unwilling effect and this is the actual definition of either neurosis and psychosis are different only in degree of singleness of effect neurotic is the subject of one or more unknown causes to which he is the unwilling effectbut he can still function to some degree which is to say he can still be cause in other lines psychotic is the complete subject of one or more unknown causes to which he is the unwilling effect and any effort on his part to be cause is interfered with by the things to which he is the effect in other words psychotics outflow is cut to zero by the inflow now let us examine the potential number of neuroses and psychoses in the light of the above definitions how many aspects are there to life unit which is to say thetan perhaps the number is infinite but at least we can say the number of aspects is very large there are additional aspects in this or any other universe in other words when you examine the aspects or abilities of basic life unit you have examined all the aspects or abilities there are in universe there arent any left over even if you include gods in every universe you will see that you have not escaped the potentialities of life units all the aspects and abilities there are are the aspects and abilities of thetan the only thing that can be done with these aspects or abilities is included at least in this universe in the formula of cause and effect take one ability and add to it the idea of cause and effect of the more simple variety cause distance effect fix it so it can never be flowed against by anything else and we have source of neuroses now take being at the effect point of this flow if this being is the effect point of flow he can never flow back against we have here what we could carelessly call neurosis but there is other qualification for this neurosis than that it be unwillingly received and unknown therefore known stuck flow at person which he is not unwilling to receive does not cause neurosis now as we make this stuck flow unwillingly received then unknown and make it so that it bars out all back flows of whatever kind on any subject then we have psychosis as there are other aspects than those of thetan we see at once that all neuroses and psychoses are exaggerated concentrated abilities the recipient still trying to be cause transfers himself to false cause point we call this dramatization he seeks to do only the ability and other we have then psychosis as he can do other thing because he is really unwilling and unknowing effect seeking to be cause by dramatizing the effect he loses all the abilities but this one ability this makes peculiar and lopsided personality people object to it partially because it is false cause and partially because it denies society all the other social abilities of the person the psychotic himself is insufficiently willing or knowing about it to object to it thus we have the standard scientology method of eradicating one of those psychoses or neuroses actually we dont even use these words or admit them as any kind of irreparablestate we are not in such business we say we must find something the preclear can do and then improve it let us say that we find something the preclear can do knowingly and willingly and have the preclear do it to improve it all you have to do is get him to reach toward the source of the cause of his condition the lowest level cause of any difficulty is mest therefore the objective processes of trio locational 8c etc work uniformly well since anybody here is to some degree the unwilling and unknowing effect of this universe now where does the psychiatrist come into this and why is he bad fellow to have around in the society well in the first place he is cognizant only of insanities as every insanity is only an exaggerated and concentrated ability the psychiatrist can see in every ability an insanity there are other aspects or abilities than those of thetan any one of these can pressure as detailed above into an insanity psychiatrist or any other person totally associated with insanity then sees all abilities as parade of insanities only where abilities are several and performed socially not antisocially do we have sanity the psychiatrist never or rarely inspects the sphere of sanity to him all things then add up to madness since every madness is compounded of abilities disarranged as above let us see good example of this is fine statesman he plays polo has satisfied wife collects old cars can do good job of work as carpenter fisherman and an ice skater he reads detective stories and plays good poker he is working on plan privately to disentangle the middle east and assist france one day he is at his club and he is joined by b b is political dilettante he spends most of his money on maps and treatises about the middle east he cannot ride sing or work and his family life is in ruins he is obviously neurotic at best his ideas are disassociated impractical but loud everyone at the club except b knows b is poor risk the sane versatile man hears b the neurotic sounding off about the middle east and saving france and how only b could accomplish this knowing bs character begins to wonder if he is crazy because he is interested in the middle east in such way and in any line the psychotic or neurotic is sort of mockery of the sane ability now as an authority on man and insanity but not an authority on sanity as is scientologist the psychiatrist studying insane people runs across b he classifies b as savetheworld type and notes that b is fixated on france and the middle east shortly thereafter the psychiatrist is called upon to render decision about he looks in his book finds is trying to do something about france and the middle east and of course classifies as insane another case george loves norma norma is at first very impressed george works hard likes to hike has some property he is fixing up at weekends now along comes oswald oswald says he loves norma oswald says he is mad about norma this is of course the case oswald has big ideas but job wouldnt walk out of the building if it was on fire gets rid of every piece of real or personal property that comes his way george knows oswald is nutty oswald loves norma george begins to think he george must be crazy to love norma because oswald does as an authority on twisted and insane love but not an authority on love the psychiatrist examining oswald finds he loves normas type of girl later examining george the psychiatrist finds that george is crazy because he loves the type of girl norma is well thats an exaggeration but you see where it goes the psychiatrist having noted that love was pretty well flung about in the insane wards leaps to the conclusion that all love is insane because it is so common in the wards and founds in flash of inspiration psychoanalysis which says all insanity derives from lovewe are held to mockery in all our loves and dreams by the neurotic and psychotic who specialize in mishandling these dreams and loves and so the world goes mad it is not safe to have experts on insanity who are not also experts on sanity such persons as those who know only the insane eventually judge that everything man can do is insane and that all men are mad and then we get society devoted entirely to the support of asylums until it is at last only an asylum itself the auditor should understand the mechanism behind neurosis and psychosis he should draw it out for himself on graph showing cause and effect he should understand that mechanism because it is the only thing there is to understand about neurotics and psychotics for all else they do is gibberish and ununderstandable if he truly understands this mechanism in all its phases then neurosis and psychosis can never make him an effect point and he can audit them with ease when he has to step out of character that far if the scientologist thoroughly understands that the downfall of psychiatry which is now occurring came about because the psychiatrist never understood sanity then we wont have any future specialists in insanity beyond these data society has long suspected versatility and the man of many skills we should have realized there was something right with him l ron hubbard lrhrd copyright 1957 by l ron

over life matter energy space and time subjective and objective this is working definition selfdeterminism and knowledge that he himself can be at cause point are then primary targets minimum requisite for auditor in using these techniques validated hubbard professional auditor certificate introduction i have been at work for seven years to produce series of techniques which any well trained auditor can use to clear people we now have them i am truly sorry that this took seven years actually it took more than twentyfive under other systems of research it could not have been done it was financed at first by my writings and expeditions some 15000000 words of fact and fiction articles ranging from political articles to westerns were consumed in large part by this researchbut it was free to act if not free from sweat bullying dictator wanted it for his mass slaveries as happened to poor misguided pavlov big corporation wanted it for better madison avenue approach to advertising another kind of slavery big research foundation like ford was there to interject their america first philosophy these had not paid for it therefore they didnt own it the work stayed free thus it prospered it did not wither in support of some aberrated cause it bloomed but the violence of protecting this work while continuing it took toll nevertheless special interests believed it must be evil if they did not own it between 1950 and 1956 2000000 traceable dollars were spent to halt this work newspaper articles radio ads as in seattle from the university of washington bribed patrons financed patients all cost money you hear the repercussions of this campaign even today money could not stop this work by then it was too late if anything had been wrong with our organizations my character our intentions or abilities the whole advance would have crumbled but we had achilles heels we carried on all that has survived of this attack bythe two apas the ama and several universities is clutter of rumors concerning your sanity and mineand rumors longer financed will some day die and so the work has emerged free of taint and misguided slants it is itself it does what it says it does it contains adroit curves to make one open to better believing some ism that makes it singular today in world gone mad with nationalism buddhism when it came to the millions was longer free of slant and prejudice taoism itself became national jingoism far from any work of laotze even christianity had its pitch and if these great works became curved with all the personal force of their creators how is it that our little triumph here can still be found in clear state well diamonds and palaces have been accepted from rajahs gratuitous printing of results has been the gift of warlords testament had to be written 300 years after the fact for this we can thank johann gutenberg and the invention of magnetic tape therefore although we have such stature as the great philosophies i charge you with thislook to source writings not to interpretations look to the original work not offshoots if i have fought for quarter of century most of it alone to keep this work from serving to uphold the enslavers of man to keep it free from some destructive pitch or slant then you certainly can carry that motif little further ill not always be here on guard the stars twinkle in the milky way and the wind sighs for songs across the empty fields of planet galaxy away you wont always be here but before you go whisper this to your sons and their sonsthe work was free keep it so summary step one establish participation in session of pc do not here or anywhere else neglect this factor maintain always arc pc must to some degree be at cause with regard to session if only by wanting it or some result of it or to escape some elsewhere consequence this step is cch 0 but it is run only to establish the thetan to some degree at cause with regard to the whole session this must be improved throughout the intensive applies even to dead pcs step two establish obedience of some part of the auditing room to the pc here he must begin at some level of knowingness he must know that he himself when ordered to do so can gain some compliance on the part of the auditing room this includes his own body thus we get you seat that body in that chair thank you you make that body continue to lie in that bed thank you we also get cch 1 and we get very important but neglected process run with two objects wherein the pc himself is ordered to keep one then the other from going away alternately hold it still make it more solid all with two objects stress is on you do it step three establish control of pcs body by pc here we have cch 2 but we also have an even more important series of processes scs in all their ramifications on the body here is pc at cause with regard to body it is expected that lots of scs will be run on pcs step four make pc even more conscious of auditor and place him somewhat at cause with arc the mechanical steps of this are cch 3 and cch 4 but these steps are only valid if they heighten arc and make the pc decide he did it step five establish pc as cause over mest by establishing pcs ideas as cause over mest here running these we again emphasize you do it the basic process of this isconnectedness with the pc doing the connecting control trio trio look around here and tell what part of the environment you would be willing to be responsible for you look you connect you make alter the old commands to put pc at cause point in doing these step six establish pcs control over mest subjective creative processes recall unwanted and lost objects then and now solids first step on this in some cases is conquering black field and invisible field this is done by repair of havingness over black masses and then invisible masses run even if pc goes unconscious when field is cleared up start on gradient scale of mockups and get pc able to mock things up then run keep it from going away until flat on mockups then run hold it still on mockups then run make it more solid on mockups all this until pc really has fine solid mockups typical command mock up and keep it from going away thank you rule pcs facsimiles are not stored they are made in the instant and unmade by the pc therefore remedy of mockups and their persistence is actually direct route to clear and winds up with obsessive mockup making which we call bank valuable side process here decide to make mockup decide that will ruin the game decide not to do it also this one decide to make mockup everyone can see decide that would ruin the game decide not to do it total remedy of mockups would make book one clear step seven establish pcs control over his bank mock up facsimile and keep it from going away and when that is flat hold it still and when that is flat make it little more solid run this alternately with mock up that wall keep it from going away hold it still make it little more solid run the keep it from going away on facsimile one command then the wall one command until flat then shift to hold it still same way then shift to make it more solid same way step eight make some time auditing truths arc breaks must all be repaired thoroughly arc must be maintained there is real liability to pc in this universe except one becoming total subject of mest life versus life liability life via mest versus life some liability life versus mest total liability pc must be kept at cause as much as possible an intensive in brief for practical use begin by carefully easing the pc into session with cch 0 but dont talk too much or permit him to talk too much as you will asis his havingness establish control of room object with you make that chair sit on the floor get wheeling with scs and run it up to stopcs run connectedness inside the auditing room and then outside with you make that connect with you or you look around here and tell something you could have or you look around here and tell something you could be responsible for run an engram or do then and now solids and put pc at cause with regard to facsimiles if you have any time left do it all over againdefinitions goals there are three possible goals in processing preclear the first of these is mest clear the second is theta clear the third is operating thetan by mest clear is meant book one clear here we defined clear in terms of facsimiles this is rather simple mechanical definition it said in effect that so far as human beings were concerned our preclear finally arrived at point where he had full colorvisio sonic had psychoses or neuroses and could recall what had happened to him in this lifetime this is almost babytalk sort of clear it pays heed at all to identification with body and it has nothing to do with ability today by running creative processes four years old we can turn on visible facsimiles and weed out the bottom spots of operations and what not this is actually rather easy goal somehow ive never given real tight procedure for achieving it even though the essence of the processes has been around for very long time completing step six of clear procedure in full gives us mest clear by theta clear is meant clear obtained by clear procedure as is being delineated in this regimen the main trouble is amusingly trying to reach mest clear without running into theta clear i personally dont believe now that it can be done without actually shoving the pc back in his head every time he pops out thus the goal of this procedure is actually theta clear this is what we mean then when we say clear we mean theta clear by operating thetan we mean theta clear plus ability to operate functionally against or with mest and other life forms for the first time we have here the matter of ability an operating thetan is not an absolute term theta clear is more absolute term than operating thetan an operating thetan is theta clear not mystical mystic out on an inversion who can also do something thus we have two goals which contain ambition to accomplish anything and one goal which contains much ambition now here is another puzzle in definitions which is highest the theta clear or the operating thetan well the answer to that is not what we used to think as doingness is not really at the top we find that we will probably make an operating thetan before we achieve theta clear for theta clear would probably not be much interested in operating therefore we see the actual goal we are trying to reach matter in which limited sense is operating thetan operating thetan is then highly variable goal thetan who can move in and out of body is actually operating somewhat but he is not really theta clear since theta clear in its highest sense means further dependency upon bodies the goals of the auditor therefore do not rack up one two three mest clear theta clear operating thetan they actually stack up on very gradient scale between thetan inoperative and thetan who can operate the auditor is therefore seeking to reach with the pc state wherein the pc can function at time does the auditor suddenly arrive with pc in startling new shiny state all of sudden that can be called certain thing in that pcs often expect this suddenly bursting into the light the auditor is subject to disappointment when he has actually achieved an enormous gain for the pc in other words pcs gain on smooth gradient scale and do not suddenly become something there is only one point on the road up where something does happen and that is exteriorization when the pc exteriorizes for the first time he feels there must be cause for rejoicing and has the idea he has gotten somewhere well in fact you could achieve the same result by hitting him over the head with club he would exteriorize the point is not exteriorizing the pc but cutting down his dependency upon body pc who exteriorizes and is not carried right on with the same process that sprang him out of his head until it is flat will go back into his head in an hour or week and will be harder to dig out the next timein other words this point of exteriorization does happen and does mean to the pc that he is himself but it shouldnt mean very much to an auditor beyond his noticing that this phase has been entered in the case for in truth thetans dont stay out of their bodies very long if they are not in good shape thus exteriorization means less than ability to act to live to be and do the attention of the auditor should be upon the increasing ability of the pc to handle life not upon the distance the pc gets from his body is that clear well it tells us that arriving at state of clear is easy if that means stable outside and that any state of betterment on the road to operating thetan is an honest achievement thus an auditor should at all times go toward the state of operating thetan and should not be mixed up in the oddities of exteriorization for day hgc clear procedure goes straight toward exteriorization and achieves it but it also goes straight toward increasing ability to handle life the latter is the auditors best goal the auditing goal should go in the same direction as this new definition for operating thetan an operating thetan can be at cause knowingly and at will over life matter energy space and time subjectively and objectively this action definition of operating thetan is the true goal of the auditor and if followed with complete understanding will achieve the best possible results in this discussion of goals and definitions i am telling you cleanly that the goals of mest clear and theta clear are not worth following from the auditors standpoint you can let pcs think what they will about them the only goal worthy of the auditors time whatever the state of case of the pc is operating thetan to achieve one on any subject it is only necessary to place the pc to some degree at willing and knowing cause point with regard to that subject all the steps of hgc clear procedure are leveled at operating thetan but you need not tell your pc that you can use the words release mest clear theta clear or any other if you like just remember there is only one payoff goal and that is operating thetan mest clear can see facsimiles with sonic present lifetime has psychoses or neuroses upper part of apa in uk oca graph above 13 5 iq theta clear can exist knowingly independent of bodies release average third of graph higher than first test above 115 iq operating thetan can be at cause knowingly and at will over life matter energy space and time subjectively and objectively step one participation in session by the pc we have long known that arc was important just how important it is was established by some tests i made in london in 1956 wherein every time the pc showed any restlessness or other signs of loss of havingness instead of remedying havingness i carefully searched out any fancied break of arc and patched it up the loss of havingness vanished in other words loss of arc is even more important than loss of havingness since repair of arc restores havingness lack of havingness is only one symptom of lack of communication there are two ways an auditor according to long practice can err one of these is to permit twoway communication to point where the pcs havingness is injured the other is to chop communication to such degree that havingness is injured there is point past which communication is bad and short of which lack of communication is bad here we have auditor judgment at play because the pc will fidget or go downscale in tone when his havingnessdrops an auditor can see when the pcs havingness is being lowered because pc will go anaten or start to grind into the process an auditor can tell whether or not the pc feels his communication has been chopped when either happens the auditor should take actionin the first instance by shutting off the pcs outflow and getting to work and in the second instance by making the pc talk out any fancied communication severance participation in session by the pc is not something the auditor sees to at the beginning of the session and then forgets for the rest of the intensive this step is continued throughout the intensive and is given as much attention as any process being run at the time the auditors attention is always therefore upon two thingsfirst the continued participation in session and second the action of the process grouped under this head we would also have ways and means of getting the pc into session in the first place an unconscious pc used to be an apparent roadblock downtone antagonistic youcanthelpme pc was also rough one these two things are countered by always carefully starting session and following through on standard cch 0 it is as important to open session with baby or an unconscious person as it is with any other preclear it doesnt matter whether the pc is answering up or not it is only necessary to assume that the pc would answer if he could answer and that the mechanics of voice and gesture are simply absent from the answer therefore one always carefully starts every session paying attention to what is happening where it is happening who is there help goals and problems obviously anaten or inability to control the body are the present time problem of the unconscious person or the child one can actually audit this with plain question and simply assume after bit it has been answered then give the acknowledgment and ask another question just as though the pc were in full vocal action auditors still fall for the belief very current that unconscious people are unable to think or be aware in any way thetan is seldom unconscious regardless of what the body is doing or not doing present time problem is highly vital point of preclear participation if preclear is being nagged too thoroughly by pt problem auditing can actually send him downhill if done without addressing the problem whole intensive even seventyfive hours can be wasted if the auditor does not clear the pt problem the preclear generally doesnt know he has one which is nagging him for the rough pt problems go into the apathy band and below into forgetfulness rather rapidly therefore the auditor should ferret out the pt problem with an emeter adroit use of an emeter does not include evaluating for the preclear but it certainly does include ferreting out pt problems the emeter is also used for valences and sometimes psychophysical difficulties auditor use the word psychophysical rather than psychosomatic and stay out of medical field the running of pt problem today is the most pt problem valences psychophysical ailments all run beautifully with mock up something worse than terminal or invent something worse than terminal to run this it is necessary to isolate the terminal most intimately connected with the pt problem or the valence or psychophysical difficulty one then clears the command and you always better do that with any command and lets go the whole idea of worse than is the whole of the dwindling spiral people who are trying to get better and be more perfect and think the right thought lose all control of getting worse being imperfect and thinking the wrong thought all these worse thans are then left on automatic and we arrive at something less than optimum in fact we arrive with the dwindling spiral we also arrive with the point of return we also arrive with the declining ability to heal or get well and we also arrive with old age after running worse than on the pt problem we proceed with other parts of cch 0 clearing help will be found quite beneficial but to get pc to participate who is downright ugly about it running help is usually only partial solution when these only ones get goingthey really snarl on the subject of getting audited here cch 1 is of benefit questions asked but this of course defeats the purpose of step one participation of the pc in the session is necessary in order to place the pc somewhat at the cause point in the actual fact of auditing this fits the definition you can always change body or recover it from some illness by auditing without much helping the pc himself therefore the pc while under auditor control is still somewhat at cause what with comm bridges and clearing commands etc but he is made to feel bad effects from being at effect if ample arc is used in other words the pc cant be entirely at cause in session or he would be selfauditing which isnt good but he can be salvaged from being total effect by good arc when the arc drops out that does leave the pc at more or less total effect thing you have probably noticed the things to be done in cch 0 should be done thoroughly at intensives beginning and should be glanced at whenever new session starts and should get bow when new command is used but all cch 0 is is collection of mechanical aids to assist the pcs participation in the session and to assist the auditor in arc although cch 0 must be used always it is not total substitute for arc the sum of cch 0 is find the auditor find the auditing room find the pc knock out any existing pt problem establish goals clear help get agreement on session length and get up to the first real auditing command cch 0 isnt necessarily run in that order and this isnt necessarily all of cch 0 but if any of these are seriously scamped the session will somewhere get into trouble when the participation of the pc ceases in session he must be gotten back into session by any means and then participation is reestablished pc is never permitted to end session on his own choice he seeks to end them when his participation drops out of sight the trick question what did i do wrong reestablishes arc the problem of handling pc who is not cooperative who does not wish to participate is highly special problem in the first place it is the pcs engrams that do not want to continue in the second place it is the engrams which are doing the talking one ordinarily tackles this case with formal opening of session brief but positive and then sails in with cch 0 just as though the person were unconscious which of course the person is participation by an unconscious person while covered above requires the additional refinement of technique one must always find something the preclear can do and then better that ability an unconscious person is usually lying in bed if not the command must be varied to fit the environment but the best command is something like you make that body lie in that bed slightly upper grade process to person sitting in chair is you seat that body in that chair in such cases grip on the pcs hand and the use of slight squeeze each time the auditor acknowledges considerably speeds the process there is another special caseor maybe it isnt so special there are many people who cannot tackle present time problem with process if the auditor sought out pt problem and then ran something worse than related terminal or problem of comparable or incomparable magnitude he would find the pc digging in hard unable to handle the process thus some judgment must be used in such cases dont run pt problem on somebody in very bad shape casewise there is an awful lot to know about starting sessions the badoff case and the case in very good condition alike require special handling for the case just mentioned who cannot handle pt problem with process there is always locational tr ten tr ten will run pt problem or anything else if slowly thus many person with pt problem can only participate in session to the extent of tr ten you notice that object wall floor chair etc by introducing in the auditors and pcs bodies as couple of the items being spottedalong with everything else we eventually wind up with find the auditor find the auditing room find the pc and we get there without pt problem being in full bloom in running you notice that object there are some things that must be observed most important of these is this one any process which turns on somatic must be continued until it longer turns on somatics this is true particularly of tr ten 8c and trio the case hangs right there until the process is flat whether in one day one year or six another thing which must be stressed is the inclusion of the auditors and pcs bodies because some pcs when exteriorized snap back in when they see the body is reason to avoid it in tr ten another thing is to make the pc use his eyes to view the objects and if he doesnt turn his eyes toward them then it is up to the auditor to use manual direction of the head and even pry the eyes open balks are ever permitted in auditing if tr ten is being run at problem every now and then the auditor pauses and discusses the problem again with the pc in order to keep it in restimulation until tr ten can run it out the high case is worse problem than auditors commonly believe in the first place high case can blow situation out of the bank with considerable ease and if the auditor insists on sledgehammering it out with process then pc participation blows rather than facsimile high case participation can also be misunderstood in that there are lot of cases that think they are high which arent heres how you tell real high case from bogus i can do everything case thetan in good shape can be cause when he looks at something in the bank it becomes the effect bogus high case can think anything he wants without anything having an effect on the bank you want to watch this point because here is the definition of ot thoroughly at work pc at cause case that has pictures and everything and is impatient to get on with it but does not markedly alter the bank with thinking alone is not high case but an old wide open case of dianetic days twoway communication as process is the key to all this if you put pc on an meter and locate present time charge you can if the pc can somewhat handle his bank get him to twoway comm the incident flat very quicklyin five or ten minutes at the most this is all the process used it would take an actual emeter run to give you full reality on this here we are looking at the basic differences amongst cases that difference lies in the ability to knowingly cause bodies are the same they all react alike banks differ only vaguely and only in content and significance engrams are engrams and they all behave alike there is only one difference amongst pcs we called this basic personality in book one we can be lot more simple about it now that i have my teeth into the subject few more feet the difference is degree of knowing causability what do we mean by cause the basic old scientology definition is still at work causedistance effect joe knowingly shoots bill joe is at cause bill is at effect mary gives john present mary is at cause john is at effect bill says boo to joe bill is at cause joe is at effect but when we introduce knowing cause and cause at will into this cause distanceeffect idea we see we have something else added the person at cause is there because he knows he is there and because he is willingly there the person at cause is not at cause because he does not dare be at effect he must be able to be at effect if he is afraid to be at effect then he is unwilling cause and is at cause only because he is very afraid of being at effect education can show person he can be at effect without liability then he can be at cause without having to be because he doesnt dare be at effect auditing in its whole operation is teaching the pc this pc slides from terrified effect to tolerated effect to knowing cause with regard to any incident he contacts if he is audited properly the pc who has to get rid of all his engrams because he has to get rid of them because its all too horrible winds up with good auditing into tolerance of the pictures since he has learned he can tolerate them and so can swing around to cause so we have this great difference in pcs degree of knowing causability is the extent that he is willing to be at cause and the extent he is willing to know he is at cause plus the ability to cause thingsyou will see this on an emeter in pt problem handling bill has pt problem it drops dial when first contacted the auditor using his understanding of scientology two way comms on it the incident discharges and longer registers after few minutes mary has pt problem it drops steeply on the emeter the auditor tries to twoway comm on it the charge remains the same or mary begins to disperse she doesnt hold to the subject the auditor at length finds that twoway comm only serves to run down her havingness the charge remains on the meter dial what is the difference between bill and mary bill can be at knowing cause mary is either obsessive cause or heavy effect bill can blow facsimiles mary cannot on mary the auditor is very wise to enter upon tr ten one version of tr ten is called short spotting you notice that nearby object so long as the pc can see with his eyes the object or feel the auditors hand on it the process works it is spotting right up close if run with mediumly near and far objects such as the room wall it is very effective in getting case going it has given some cases their first reality on auditing but the rule still holds here about somatics when somatic is turned on with process turn it off with that process see auditors code 13 this is entirely true of short spotting in that it almost always turns on somatics when you start it you have to flatten it and thats often lengthy remember this about pc participation low case cant handle the bank therefore you keep high arc and kidglove him through session very high case doesnt need dynamite therefore you retain his participation by going as rapidly as you can medium average case needs arc something of dynamite something of kid gloves something of twoway comm and in all good auditing cases improve just because you start pc low doesnt mean hell always stay low check the case often see if his causability is rising if it isnt he isnt improving and you better go easier or heavier probably when case doesnt improve you didnt handle pt problem that is the only thing which can keep case from gaining so check every session for one there are probably thousands of ways to gain the participation of the pc there are probably thousands of ways to open session there are probably an infinite number of tricky things you can do however this breadth of choice should not obscure the following 1 pc who is not participating in the session is not at cause 2 an auditor who isnt able to maintain arc who isnt able to freeze process for short time even tone 400 process and reestablish arc will not get results 3 the endall of processing is the attainment of goal the goal of ot one always processes the problems and difficulties of the pc he does not process the process processes only assist in processing the pc they will not do anything by themselves processes are road map to the goal of ot they are nothing in themselves the target is the condition the disabilities of the pc how one achieves the eradication of these difficulties is secondary to the fact of their eradication scientology is route attained after several thousand years of attainment by man and the route is important and valuable and must be traveled correctly but the concern is the pc not the route 4 new auditor can be adrift with his tools he is uncertain as to what he is attacking he should have reality on engrams locks keyins secondaries the time track the key buttons of scientology such as communication control and havingness given an understanding of all these and the theory of scientology itself he can almost pilot his way through case with twoway comm but twoway comm will not work if one doesnt understand all the above so twoway comm is not conversation the pc has had few trillion years of that and it hasnt made him well so twoway comm is highly specialized thing done with full understanding of the thetan bank and body good twoway comm means participation by the pc5 scientology is precise commodity something like engineering pc is precise thing part animal part pictures and part god we want the ability to handle things and the god and the less unthinking responses in the pc the better off he will be therefore pc who isnt cogniting regularly is being processed beyond his ability to do and it is necessary to drop back downscale to find something he can do 6 the golden rule of processing is to find something the preclear can do and then to improve his ability to do it at once you will have participation the highest ability one pc had was to get drunk resolution of his case was entered upon by having him invent ways to get drunk 7 the attention span of children and psychos is not necessarily factor since it is only the phenomena of dispersal against mental blocks keying in of incidents the auditor can pay attention to it or not as he likes short regular sessions on people with limited attention span get more gain per week than steady grind since the participation is maintained 8 the auditor remains at cause in all sessions without forbidding the pc to be at cause see the rules in dianetics the original thesis step two placing the preclear at cause establish obedience of some part of the auditing room to the pc here he must begin at some level of knowingness he must know that he himself when ordered to do so can gain some compliance on the part of the auditing room this includes his own body the basic rule of auditing is to start with something the preclear can do and then get him to do it better this is the basic difference between high level and low level process this is also the difference between process which is real to the preclear and process which is unreal to the preclear preclear can do process without doing it at all actually the body and bank are obeying the auditor now here we had in dianetics one of the more interesting phenomena of an auditor being able to make preclear physically well without the preclear once finding out about it this was source of great grief and upset to auditors they could not see how this could possibly be the man priorly could not walk apparently and after auditing he could walk and yet he did not attribute to dianetics or to the auditor any of this renewed ability the auditor could monitor the preclears bank and body shift around the engrams asis them and do various things with them without the preclear finding out about it all of this was so far above the preclears ability to do that it was totally unreal to him we also get the phenomenon of an individual doing great many spotting processes and feeling better but not being able to understand what this has to do with sanity or insanity in the first place the individual could not himself spot the auditor more or less did the spotting for him the preclear then never connected it in any way with his own capabilities test an auditor should make to ascertain the sense of this is as follows look around here and tell something you could do the preclear will get many odd and peculiar sensations as he fishes around and finally decides that he could do some minor thing this is not really good process but it is good test process for an auditor this preclear who has been walking and talking and working and going around the world and apparently behaving in fairly sane and rational fashion actually could do none of these things he was supported entirely by his machinery by the social responsibilities which were demonstrated toward him by his education by the basic agreement of what goes on in the world he was walking around in dream and life felt to him much like dream now the auditor starts to audit him on the basis that this individual is capable well now the individual himself is the thetan andwhereas the bank might have been capable and would have broken down some day the thetan himself was not he was going along for the ride we often see this phenomenon in the third dynamic it could be said that government is the aggregate irresponsibility of people they are not taking responsibility for the course of justice or protection of the state from foreign aggression and they shove all this responsibility over on to government and they themselves are quite irresponsible for it after while the government doesnt look to the people at all to furnish any responsibility the government takes all the initiative and we eventually wind up with some sort of dictatorship the people then longer count they are slaves they are totally irresponsible in similar wise thetan can be totally irresponsible for everything that goes on in relationship to his workaday world and we see people dramatizing this on every hand wherever thetan refuses to take responsibility and is participating in action he is being unreal this is the unreality of situation let us say you were part of crowd which was surging downtown to third street and you yourself wanted to go uptown to tenth street the crowd swept you along toward third street and after while things would become pretty unreal that is because you were being carried in direction opposite to your basic intent thus your own intention is overwhelmed this intention overwhelmed becomes what we know as unreality it is very easy for an auditor to overwhelm the preclears intention the preclear is actually going to tenth street the auditor is trying to push him to third street we get the most remarkable subdivision of this in survive and succumb the auditor is going on the basis that the preclear wants to survive and the preclear is going on the basis that he wants to succumb the auditor is then thrusting him in an opposite direction hence it is really necessary to clear goals in an auditing session there must be some goal which the preclear considers obtainable the goal of just being able to sit there for the next two or three hours is goal you would be surprised to find that in some preclears this is tremendously high goal but even preclears goals can be unreal to him they are the social goals actually the preclear privately thinks hed like to get rid of every man woman and child on earth and the goal he gives you is to save everyone now the question actually confronts uswhat can the preclear really do of course in case of tremendous doubt you could run the above processlook around here and find something you could do but there are certain things that an auditor can take for granted which undercut any other thing the body is sitting in the chair the preclear can be brought up to realization that he can make the body sit in the chair and thus we get the first really worthwhile process on preclear who is conscious and that process is you seat that body in that chair thank you and in the case of somebody who is lying in bed even unconscious we get this basic process you make that body continue to lie in that bed thank you all we are asking anybody to do when we ask for these two processes is to take responsibility for what is actually occurring in the first place we raise his responsibility level in other words and thus raise his doingness level preclear who does not come through eventually with cognition that he can make the body sit in the chair of course isnt worth bothering with in that his doingness level is even below this this preclear ought to be lying in bed he must consider himself completely helpless and completely ill thus if we ran you seat that body in that chair thank you for several hours without any realization on the part of the preclear that he could do this and without turning on any somatics or without getting any effect at all we would consider that we had overshot this actually it shouldnt take several hours to find this out we would go back to the basic position of dianetic auditing this preclear probably thinks of himself as being dead or probably thinks of himself as being very ill or thinks of himself as being totally unconscious thus we would run him as an unconscious person putting him down on couch we would run you make that body continue to lie in that bed thank you also on much higher level we get cch 1you give that hand is actually the old cat process where we got the cat to reach for the auditor plus an obedience process the preclear after while should decide that he can do this sometimes we run cch 1 then cch 2 cch 3 and then cch 4 and going back discover that cch 1 is now unflat and the preclear is unable to perform this action which he previously could perform now what has happened here is we have broadened the scope of the preclears responsibility his bank at first was perfectly capable of giving that hand but once we have invited further responsibility and gotten him to find the auditor as in cch 3 and cch 4 we discover that the preclear himself is now trying to do it and in trying to do it is having difficulties but he wins through with this difficulty and eventually comes out much better unless these particular goals and theories behind these processes are understood they very often do not work at all in the cch bands thus cch 1 to 4 while tremendously successful when run by very excellent auditor understanding his job may not be successful in the hands of somebody who is simply going through some mechanical motions basically we are trying to get the preclear to do something and know that he himself can do it thus we are improving his ability on this fundamental we can go forward and establish many processes all of which are fundamental doingness or obedience processes we can do such process as you make that chair sit on the floor this process at first seems little incredible to the preclear but after while he gets the idea that he can do it then this unflattens and he gets the idea that its gravity thats doing it and therefore he cant do it and he goes through various cognitions of one sort or another simply about having chair which is already sitting there sit there unless we can cross this particular stage of case and get the preclear up to an idea that he does have some sort of an ability of some kind we might as well do nothing else about the case at all therefore this step two is quite important and actually is the basic entrance into auditing step three establish control of pcs body by pc although we could continue onward with the cchs simply rotating them from cch 1 through to 4 and back to 1 and to 4 and back to 1 and to 4 again and again and again and win there is faster way of going about this which has been known to us for very long time this way starts really with 8c it does not matter particularly which brand of 8c is run we have had now three or four varieties of 8c the first one was rather permissive and indirect and did not demand very much compliance and possibly had its own place in the firmament since use of it has resolved very very great many cases the first command of this is do you see that wall then walk over to it then touch it and that was all there was to the process later 8cs particularly tone 40 8cs were highly precise very directive and had great deal of control stress to them it does not matter particularly which 8c is used so long as the auditor feels that it is biting if the particular 8c he is using isnt biting maybe he needs more permissive one maybe he needs more exacting control one there are great many factors surrounding the control of the pcs body by pc most pcs feel their body if tampered with in any way would fly out of control and flipflop all over the floor would suddenly freeze or would get ill and they have anxieties about their bodies and the control of their bodies which must be solved otherwise we dont get very far control of bodies can actually be assisted by oldtime flipflopping flipflopping was process by which the preclears excess motion was taken off the creative processes of earlier times did not require of the preclear any great cognition of what was going on thus flipflopping could be used at very early stage of case we would say mock up man and make him flipflop and then make him insist that the body flipflop even further and even more wildly until he himself knew that he was making the body flipflop we would do this with womans body and would eventually take the motion off the case that wasinhibiting the preclear from controlling the body this is actually motionectomy it is really case of the auditor controlling the bank and body of the preclear when we did not do this we found that in running 8c and in doing some other processes the preclear all of sudden would convulse and start to fly apart these flyaparts were simply the flipflop manifestation of bodies it is extremely interesting that preclear exteriorizing from his own body which is out of control flipflopping writhing convulsing and going into epileptiform seizures was at distance from flipflopping body one day while in his own body he causes some other body to go out of control he shoots somebody or hits somebody and has this person go into flip flop he himself gets restimulated and he feels that his body in the future is liable to go out of control at any time if you draw little picture of this you will see that thetan exteriorized from his own body and thetan in his body knocking about some other body is to the thetan the same point of view in other words if you make somebodys body flipflop your own body may flipflop it looks the same to thetan some guarantee or security of body control is therefore necessary there is very fine set of processes which have been used for more than year at this writing and which produced excellent results these we call the scs processes after running 8c and if it turned on somatics remember to flatten the process entirely even though it takes 50 hours before going on to another process we go into these control processes grouped under scs there have been several varieties of process all entirely in the control bracket but with different severities of control the commands of scs processes are almost all the same except that some are made more severe than others the first of these processes is the start process this is very simple we have preclear out in the middle of the room standing up while we stand up alongside of him touching him and we explain to him and we explain this every command that when we say start we want him to start his body in that direction and we point out some direction then we take our hands off of him and we say start we do not say stop halt or anything else but after he has moved forward we then say did you start your body and he says he guesses he did or he did and we thenand only then acknowledge we do this many times until the process apparently has charge on it or is flat we then go into the next of this series which is change to run change the auditor marks four points out on the floor these points can be imaginary or they can be actually chalkmarked on the floor one of these points we label one b one c and one d we explain the meanings of these symbols to the preclear and we give him this auditing command now when i ask you to change the body i want you to change the bodys position from to b do you understand that the preclear says he does and the auditor stepping back from the preclear says change the preclear then changes the bodys position similarly in using the various points and combinations of the points b c and d the auditor drills the preclear on change until that particular process seems to be flat the auditor then goes to stop the auditor takes the preclear by the arm and explains explains every time that when he says stop he wants the preclear to stop the body the actual wording of the auditor is now i want you to get the body moving in that direction and when i say stop i want you to stop the body do you understand when the preclear says that he does the auditor lets go of him lets him move down the room distance never the same distance twice and says stop when the preclear has stopped the auditor says did you stop the body and the preclear says yes or maybe and the auditor then acknowledges the auditor does this many times until the preclear understands that he himself can stop the body or he has regained an ability or the process appears to be flat and has charge on itthese three steps done in that order are then repeated and it will be discovered that once stop has been flattened start is now unflattened and can be flattened all over again by running it anew similarly change will be found to be unflat and again stop will be found to be unflat thus one runs start and one runs change and then one runs stop in that order over and over and over again until all three appear to be flat variation of this particular process has been called stop supreme stop supreme is heavy emphasis on stop and it will be found that after the three processes of start change and stop are flat one can move rather easily into stop supreme and concentrate heavily upon it in other words one runs start change and stop start change and stop start change and stop until they are relatively flat he should not then suppose that the whole of scs is flat since he still has stop supreme in all of its variations the idea behind stop supreme is that stop or motionlessness is probably the most thetan ability thetan has thus the rehabilitation of this particular ability is worth while and does produce considerable results but dont be surprised if the preclear falls apart in the process of doing it the commands of stop supreme are roughly these every time one runs one of these s cs processes he of course explains the thing in full at the beginning of every command he does not let any explanation hang over from the last time the command was executed it will be found that the preclear cannot hold in his mind these explanations therefore it has to be all explained anew every time thus we say to the preclear in stop supreme now i want you to get your body moving down the room when i so indicate and when i say stop i want you to stop your body absolutely still then the auditor gives the preclear slight shove and the preclear moves the body down the room and the auditor says stop and the preclear tries to stop his body absolutely still in that instant it will be found that faster and faster responses are achieved by the preclear and he can actually stop the body in more and more peculiar positions the auditor then says did you stop your body absolutely still the preclear answers this and then the auditor acknowledges there are even more severe versions of this but they are left to the imagination of the auditor these scs processes produced the greatest control changes that have been produced with any control process they were consistently used with great success by great many auditors this is not really true of cch 1 2 3 and 4 cch 1 2 3 and 4 depend in very large measure not only upon the excellence of the auditor but upon how the auditor himself is feeling while he is running them and we can get an auditor who is not feeling up to par that day not doing well with cch 1 2 3 and 4 this difficulty was never encountered with the s cs processes and therefore the scs processes are to be recommended an apparent drop of havingness is occasionally experienced by the preclear as he does these processes this is because of compulsive exteriorization if preclear is about to fly out of his head hell fly out of his head on scs if he does fly out of his head on scs or any other process you of course continue the process you do not suddenly change and do some other process once upon time we felt at liberty to change because of the severity of the change but we have learned in long experience that one never changes the process just because somebody compulsively exteriorizes scs is probably more susceptible to compulsive exteriorization than any other single process and as it is run preclears fly into their heads and out of them at great rate and eventually get to state quite ordinarily where they can move into the head or out of the head at will the reason the preclear is holding on to the body is 1 fear of loss of control and 2 havingness if the havingness of the preclear is low he is apt to close in tight to the body because this gives him more havingness and if the preclear fears that the body is going to go out of control he will also move in closer to the body thus we get interiorization as more complicated than fear of loss of control and drops in havingnesswhen loss of havingness is experienced preclear will agitate or go anaten and tend to be upset in general actually any loss of havingness in an auditing session can be repaired by an excellent auditor by repair of the arc of the session one uses the trick what did i do wrong and twoway comm in general to patch up state of affairs loss of havingness is first manifested on loss of havingness of the session or loss of goals rather than on actual loss of mass in running scs however the preclear flying in and out of his head will experience various changes of havingness which are quite upsetting the very best handling of this situation is to restore the arc of the session in every way possible it is actually not allowed to stop scs and go into trio concentration upon the body is one of the frailties of scs and we have long since discovered that those preclears who had difficulty in exteriorization would very often re interiorize the moment they glanced at the body well keeping body there and looking at it are apparently two different things entirely thus if preclear cant put his attention upon the body without bad things happening we should run process which prevents the preclear from being upset simply because he is concentrating upon his body and scs certainly does this and does it well dont be surprised in running scs if the preclear suddenly flies to pieces goes into flipflopping has to be picked up off the floor and put over on the couch and left aghast but do be very surprised at yourself if you fail to get the preclear back up on his feet and into session again at once this is time for you to be changing processes simply because preclear collapses now if this did happen that the preclear went entirely out of session while running scs and you could not get him in any way to do any more of the scs and get it flat then you had better start the entire intensive all over again and go right back to the beginning and carry on from the beginning and bring him right straight on through to scs you would do this rapidly of course but you would nevertheless have other choice it would not be good enough to change processes simply because the preclear found himself incapable of running this body control process of scs it has been noticed that scs can be run very sloppily by some auditors who do not have very much experience with it the only way to err is in the direction of imprecision and bad arc it is perfectly easy to be very precise with high arc arc does not mean non confronting one of the elementary processes which can be used after scs and which is very fine process and will have to be done at some time is the keep it from going away hold it still make it more solid series on two objects to do this particular process one takes two disrelated objects that is to say he doesnt take two ashtrays or two bottles he could take one object made out of wood one made out of glass both of them with different purposes but these are usually picked up as nonsignificant objects and the auditor asks the preclear to place the two of them to the right and to the left of the preclear and asks the preclear to pick up one of them and keep it from going away and put it back in exactly the same place pick up the other one and keep it from going away put it back in exactly the same place and keeps up this drill between these two objects actually preclears who are having very hard time require more than two objects even as many as six or seven in this event the auditor places the preclear at table and scatters several objects around and picks them up at random the duplicative feature of the process can be toughened up as the process is continued but on some preclears it will be found to be very arduous to start out basically with two when the preclear can successfully keep the two objects from going away knowing very well that he kept them from going awaywhich the auditor asks him every time did you keep it from going awaythe holditstill phase is run in exactly the same way and when this seems to be flat on the two objects we get into make it more solid one of the principal dividing lines between psychotic state and sane state is the ability to make things solid it will be found that people who are having very bad time indeed have the whole worldin very thin lookstraight throughit state only when they themselves can be at cause in keeping things from going away and making things hold still and making things more solid will it be found that they have solidity in the environment there would be another process which we could run at this particular stage and that is oldtime book and bottle which is also one of the deadlier exteriorization processes oldtime book and bottle was run in this wise the auditor placed book on one table or chair and bottle on the other table or chair and he directed the individual to first one and then the other always with very duplicative command probably the first version of book and bottle was the best it should be understood that book and bottle is an absolute necessity and must be run at some time or another upon scientology auditor but it is not necessarily something which must be run on somebody who is simply trying to attain state of clear thus mention of it is introduced at this time step four find the auditor make pc even more conscious of auditor and place him somewhat at cause with arc there are probably thousand inventive ways that this could be done but it is time when one has been butchering the pc this long for the pc to regain some of his selfrespect with regard to the auditing session one could do this with almost any auditing command which made the pc look at the auditor such question as is there anything i am doing that you could do carried forward to its logical conclusion would find the pc regaining some of his cause with regard to the session simple locational spotting however is probably the best process here one directs the pcs attention with you notice that object all about the room and at first only occasionally includes the pcs body and the auditors body in the spotting then the auditor using the same process concentrates less and less upon the room and more and more upon the auditor and the pc it will be found that the pc will eventually find the auditor with his attention so directed it will be seen then that scs directed the pcs attention very strongly to the auditing of his own body and it will be seen that we have not yet started to get the pcs attention out into the environment but here we have two very pat processes which are cch 3 and cch 4 these are extremely simple processes but require considerable amount of care in their use any validated auditor knows how to run these two processes cch 3 is hand space mimicry and cch 4 is book mimicry both of these processes simply invite the pc to find the auditor more thoroughly the earliest process along the line was look at who am i and it has very far from been disallowed so that in lack of anything else simply this process could be picked up and used at this stage now here we get the preclear to identify or to say who the auditor is and you will find that many preclears go through considerable number of convulsions in trying to establish who the auditor is there is particularly recommended step for this it depends in large measure on what state the pc is in when he arrives at this point but it is necessary for the pc to become somewhat causative with regard to the session at this stage whether by spotting cch 3 and cch 4 or by oldtime look at who am i they all more or less accomplish the same thing cch 3 and 4 accomplish the location of the auditor very mechanically according to the reality scale spotting has the additional advantage of taking pcs attention very thoroughly under control and look at who am i invites the pc to use his identification and thinking capacities if an auditor wanted to be totally sure he would use all of themstep five pc versus mest establish pc as cause over mest by establishing pcs ideas as cause over mest there are several varieties of spotting processes the most basic of these is the most basic process to association and this is connectedness this process is run directively with the following command you get the idea of making that object connect with you did you thank you the reason connectedness works is because it is the basic process on association the most aberrative thing on any case is association with mest this does not mean that the individual is not creating the mest it does not mean that he has relationship with mest but it does mean that theta and mest interconnected too strongly are the components of trap theta is mixed up with mest mest is mixed up with theta they are two different things actually and it is not true that all thought derives from mest nor is it true that all mest derives from thought thetan can create mest by simply creating mest not by telling it to be created but simply by putting it there this is the isness of mest now when he connects his thoughts with the actual mass he gets into trouble and we get association we get compulsive thinking we get identification and the old of dianetic days thus you will see at once that connectedness in any form is very excellent process to run but note carefully that we have him get the idea of making the object connect with him we never command the preclear to get the other idea of connecting with the object this is games condition this is what is wrong with the preclear now there are large variety of processes which stem out of this process of basic association these are control trio trio and responsibility but all of these things are basically connectedness processes the only thing that ever went wrong with connectedness processes was the unreality factor the auditor would tell the preclear to get the idea of making that wall connect with him when as matter of fact the preclear couldnt have gotten much of any kind of an idea of making anything connect with him thus it is mandatory for an auditor to start out preclear on some level of reality and some twoway comm should precede this connectedness process such as do you think there is anything anywhere that you could get to connect with you once this is cleared up it will be found that only those things very close in could be real to the preclear on this line of connectedness thus the auditor is given great power of choice in this matter in the first runnings of the process he will have to run things which are relatively close in to the preclear then proceed to things which are middle distance and then things which are further from the preclear great deal of good common sense is needed here and great deal of twoway comm is necessary to get some idea of whether or not the preclear thought it was real thus the earliest commands of connectedness should probably be the preclears nose and the auditors hand the arm of the preclears chair and the button on the auditors shirt the button on the preclears shirt and his own left hand et cetera further the auditor is only asking him to get the idea of making the thing connect with him not to make the thing connect with him otherwise he will have the preclear being yanked all over the room control trio trio and responsibility are actually only complications on top of connectedness but they themselves have their own particular peculiar virtues and preclear who can actually run straight oldtime trio look around here and find something you could have can get very long way on that process all by itselfcontrol trio is actually threestage process on heavy spotting control it runs in this fashion get the idea that you can have that object and when this is relatively flat get the idea of making that object remain where it is or continue where it is and get the idea of making that object disappear this is actually very fine process and undercuts runs on lower case than trio itself oldtime trio is extremely good however and is not to be underrated in any way you can run whole threeweek intensive on this if the preclear can do it the commands are look around here and find something you could have and when that is somewhat flat look around here and find something you would permit to remain and then look around here and find something you would permit to disappear these are run in relationship to each other in other words all three of them are run in the same session sometimes preclear will run the third command two hundred and fifty times before he can get either of the other two commands with any reality at all responsibility is another process just like trio and actually has its three commands too look around here and find something you could be responsible for look around here and find something you dont have to be responsible for look around here and find something you would permit somebody else to be responsible for the emphasis here is you look you connect you make in any of these processes and the you should be entered into the old commands to make the thing as causative as possible although we cover this rather briefly this is probably the most effective section of clear procedure the whole trick is to get the preclear to actually do it it does good for preclear to run these processes with reality it does good for preclear to run these processes with arc between himself and the auditor but it does lot of good to get these processes run basically tr ten you notice that object is fundamental process on connectedness it will be discovered that unless the preclear is actually able to look at few things he will not be able to get an idea about them too furthermore it will be discovered that there is process called short spotting wherein the auditor has the preclear spot things that are very close to him the only thing wrong with short spotting is that the auditor must give the preclear things to spot which the preclear can actually see with his eyes if the preclear cannot see these things with his eyes there is not much use in having him spot them as it will run down his havingness and add to an uncertainty havingness of an objective variety namely trio is one of the greatest processes ever invented do not lose sight of this fact the process can do things that other process can do there may be some factors kicking around in havingness which are not entirely understood and which are not entirely connected with connectedness however it has been found that connectedness will put preclear in condition where he can eventually run havingness therefore connectedness undercuts and possibly even overpasses havingness in general this process of connectedness can also be run outside it can be run on people it can be run on certain type of object it can be used to familiarize pilot with his airplane and driver with his car it can be used to increase arc between the preclear and the world around him by letting him run it in heavily populated area or upon busy street and using bodies here we have one of the more interesting processes to run in terms of cognition because it undoes so much basic association if your preclear is not cogniting while running connectedness you can be very sure of the fact that somewhere along the line you have not given him reality and you should flatten it off gracefully and start the intensive all over again step sixcreative processing read and understand scientology 88008 and electropsychometric auditing and use an emeter throughout the auditing the first step on this in some cases is conquering black field and invisible field this is done by repair of havingness over black masses and then invisible masses run even if the pc goes unconscious this means that you continue to audit him even if he goes unconscious and you use the same command and pay attention to his unconsciousness you continue just as though he were wide awake when field is cleared up start on gradient scale of mockups and get pc able to mock things up then run keep it from going away until flat on mockups then run hold it still on mockups then run make it more solid on mockups all this until pc really has fine solid mockups typical command mock up and keep it from going away thank you rule pcs facsimiles are not stored they are made in the instant and unmade by the pc therefore remedy of mockups and their persistence is actually direct route to clear and winds up with obsessive mockup making which we call bank valuable side process here decide to make mockup decide that will ruin the game decide not to do it also this one decide to make mockup everyone can see decide that would ruin the game decide not to do it total remedy of mockups would make book one clear step seven optional establish the preclears control over his bank mock up facsimile and keep it from going away and when that is flat hold it still and when that is flat make it little more solid run this alternately with mock up that wall keep it from going away hold it still make it little more solid run the keep it from going away on facsimile one command then the wall one command until flat then shift to hold it still same way then shift to make it more solid same way step eight make some time see dianetics 55 chapter xv an intensive in brief for practical use goal operating thetan definition an operating thetan is one who can be knowingly at cause over life matter energy space and time cch 0 in brief find the auditor find pc find auditing room clear help and goals but in the main handle the pt problem if it exists if it doesnt exist do cch 0 briefly and quickly and get on with the session it will be noted that giving pcs attention to auditing room or environment can turn on somatic after three or four commands after one command of have you got an auditing room this becomes process called locational if locational turns on somatic it must be run until somatic is flat therefore the auditor has business attempting locational or getting the pc involved unless he intends to do something about itpresent time problem the preclear is put on an emeter before pt problem is discussed when the emeter has been adjusted onethird of dial surge when pc squeezes cans the auditor asks if the pc has present time problem after little discussion of this the needle may surge if it does the auditor locates the pt problems most intimate terminal and runs with the pc still holding the cans invent something worse than indicated terminal until the problem flattens out on the dial the auditor can ask for and run another pt problem or even three or four but always flattening down the surge of the needle if the pc is 50 below the center line of the apa it is not safe to run invent instead without scouting around invent but knowing the graph in the first place simply twoway comm the problem and run locational until the problem flattens out on the needle the auditor does not begin with invent and then change his mind and run locational it is an eitheror the auditor starts with invent or he starts with locational and whichever he does he does not change if locational turns on somatic it must be run until locational longer turns on somatics once the pt problem is flat the auditor puts away the emeter scs steps scs begins with 8c of any kind if 8c turns on somatic the auditor runs it until it longer turns on somatics 8c is run formal or tone 40 start is then run as per 1956 change is then run as per 1956 stop is then run as per 1956 if each of these is flattened in turn it does not mean that scs is flat it means only that start is probably unflattened thus one again runs start after stop runs change after start stop after change until none of the three unflatten the others more 8c can be run there is error in liberally running 8c which is after all more complicated locational of short spotting sort spotting steps spotting itself is broad process locational is only one of many spotting processes spotting spots in the past in space in the present short spotting locational done up close are all effective spotting depends for its workability on the dislike of thetan of being located it runs best of course with the thetan at cause doing the spotting connectedness is the basic process on association of theta with mest all forms and kinds of association including being caught in traps are prone to become identifications as in dianetics connectedness puts the thetan at cause in making the mest or people when run outside connect with him the command is get the idea of making indicated object connect with you the auditor points the worse off person is the less reality he has on far objects havingness is complicated connectedness also permissive one thus trio is above connectedness and may be used when connectedness is flatscientology control the mechanics of startchangestop edited from the tape lectures of l ron hubbardcontrol and the mechanics of scs edited from l ron hubbards 18th acc lecture no6 dated july 22 1957 the word control has nasty connotation due to the bad 8c parents and society administers upon its individuals that is because the word control evokes moments when we were beaten down into apathy or given such conflicting commands to obey that we henceforth shudder away from any mention of the word but in scientology we have given it new meaning by adding tone 40 which makes this control exact and allows the completion of cycle of action which bad control never considered also it does not dramatize the lower emotions of the tone scale an individual who has been made to resist control winds up allergic to control and if he is allergic to it he dies because there isnt anything one can do with anything except in one way or another to view or control it if flow flows too long in one direction it has tendency to dam up and fix itself it is only necessary to reverse that to unfix the situation we go back into scientology 880 on twoway flows and we understand what is happening when you get person to get the idea of flowing something out away from him he will suddenly go anaten but it is only necessary for him to make something flow the other way toward him for short while just mental idea of flowing in for him to wake up immediately if you have somebody who is putting mockups out in front of him and he starts to go unconscious you only need to have him put them in back of him and the unconsciousness disappears thetan who is totally devoted to controlling things and who is not himself in any way controlled runs into this phenomena if this is the case one can immediately see why control of preclear is necessary if he has fought outgoing control it is only because it has gone out too long thetan cannot be upset by miscontrol or bad 8c it is just an objection i think he could take it rather easily providing he himself didnt have stuck flow on it if he himself had not done so much controlling of mental image pictures which is to say the mind the body and objects in the environment there would not be stuck outward flow when somebody comes along and controls him well he objects he objects more when it is bad control but bad control that is bad placement and handling naturally gets more on his nerves if he already has worn route which starts to come back to knock him out he doesnt like it and starts to fight flow with flows flow which flows certain time in one direction tends to continue to flow until it is totally jammed or stopped flow flowing long enough in one direction in the mind eventually flows harder and harder and not easier as one might presume this is only true when energy is being employed the more an individual outflows energy the more vacuum he creates on this side of the flow the more he flows out the more hole he leaves in the bank and eventually something is trying to pull the flow back in he has created missingness in the energy masses immediately surrounding him and this vacuum caused by the missingness tends to fill itself by pulling back on the same line its like taking rubber band and stretching it further and further the analogy isnt very good because the flow eventually just sticks his effort to hold it out there is so great that he can only hold it motionlessly out there he has got it stuck somebody comes along and threatens to disturb this stuck flow just little bit and the vacuum behind it tends to fill up too rapidly he resists this and he sticks it out there with more effort the solution to this lies in these two data one you cannot hurt thetan and two the worst that could happen on the snap back is that the bank would disarrange in some fashion and would leave him without some of his pretty pictures that flow is usually undertaken by noncreated energy he himself did not create the energy he collected it one way or the other from sources on misownership basis he packed it around him and used that energythere is an actual series of electrical phenomena which occur in the field of thinkingness connected with this these things have been observed to have sufficient violence that person holding the electrodes of an emeter has had an explosion occur somewhere in the vicinity of his hands big enough to knock hole in his hands and the can an individual once in while gets tremendous explosion in front of his face or above his head and he thinks he is being attacked by something he just got too much potential and had stuck flow out there which somebody came along and disturbed and it resulted in complete electronic display any group of people playing around with such things as electric shocks on people to help them is just being incredibly stupid because they are using the wrong wavelength in the first place very gross wave called action we look at this tremendous electrical phenomena which surrounds the being and we find that mental image pictures are themselves built of energy they are not some imaginary thing imaginary means nonenergy non real not existent couldnt possibly be handled it is bad control operation the use of that word imaginary if that is the case then everything we can see is imaginary the walls floors ceilings and all the bodies one sees walking down the streets you can practically produce the same phenomena as ridge exploding with any electrical current or various electrical gimmicks of one kind or another the electronic engineer can produce this reaction very easily with condensers and resistors but his ideas of condensers are rather strange as well he thinks if you keep pumping electricity into condenser until it fills up it will eventually discharge in some fashion or another well we dont know if it has this capacity or not but we know that thetan does have some strange electrical phenomena which are not any different than the electrical phenomena of life this is not unusual to thetan because he is after all part and parcel to the mest universe and the electrical phenomena we see around us were probably some time or another generated by life the current running in this tape recorder at this moment is converted or generated by some life form or another in the past it is probably running on coal and coal is energy stored by converted by or generated by life forms trees the moment thetan starts to handle energy he runs into all the phenomena of electricity or else he wouldnt have any need of eating or sleeping that this applies to the mind then should not come as shock to anybody that it wouldnt apply to the mind then should be tremendous piece of balderdash if it has anything to do with energy then there are certain laws that energy obeys and flows are exception other electrical phenomena contain engrams each experience in life is represented by mental image picture of one kind or another which contains real energy which has real potential and which is measurable in terms of current meters which measure current measure the potential in these facsimiles furthermore they have mass you can remedy somebodys havingness with these pictures by having an individual mockup things and shoving them in you can increase the bodys weight there are many experiences which in themselves and this is what is confusing contain electrical catastrophes one can have pictures of catastrophes which when run give you repeat of catastrophe one can produce all sorts of electrical phenomena which affect beings people havent begun to dream of the number of ways by which being could be influenced by electrical phenomena one could say that is about the closest thing there is to infinity they are numberless and all obey the same laws if they are so operating and if these laws hold good then you in processing can command the obedience of this phenomena one of the phenomena is the stuck flow of control people usually control other things by energy and do not control by postulate which is the optimum thing to do they obsessively control and then one day they control just little more by energy and they decide they cannot control thingsany more there is other reason to it than electrical phenomena there isnt well i failed too many times to control it so i guess i cannot control it any longer they just had to try too hard and had to outflow too much worked too hard by pushing in one direction too long and they created stuck flow practically all flows are aimed in the direction of control and the anatomy of control is start change and stop starting changing and stopping things then became stuck flows one of the things we do is to back up this stuck flow of control the thetan has been going all the time in the universe controlling things and very few things have ever controlled him he has tendency to snap in on himself those times when he has been controlled whether it was good or bad control hence you get the various phenomena such as the service facsimile which finds its basic residence in just that fact the idea of training people until they develop automatic responses as in the forces has practically saturated the universe they dont ever train the person since they dont even know who the man was the whole idea of training is completely erroneous because they think that if they get some kind of automaticity going in the bank then this person like wound up doll can thereafter drive car and tanks everybody thinks that it works so that is the target of education dont apply it just memorize the data presented to you even though you dont precisely know where to fit it into your frame of reference now an auditor comes along and starts to control him with tone 40 auditing such as give that hand after while the preclear says i wonder if any of that is addressed to could it be that some of it is addressed to in the first place they are not asking to store up any of this in the bank quite the contrary i am supposed to do this every time does the fellow mean because i dont see anything else around here that will give him my hand well maybe if he does this often enough he is going to install machine which will give him my hand then it becomes sheer duplication and duplication can utterly ruin any machine the one thing that mental machinery cannot do is to exactly duplicate only thetan can duplicate he is the only being that can stand the stress and strain of is so duplication enters into this with heavy control and he finds that he must be the one who is being controlled thus he works it out and one gets back flow of control which is all there is to it he finds nut that there is great consequence to this and so becomes willing to control something and that is more or less crude explanation of how control works when used in auditing we examine this very carefully and find that control is senior to energy energy is the servant of control and not the end goal of control although it could be made so energy is energy and if it was just floating about doing nothing there would be chaos that is if there was direction to it if we take this idea of energy flows as the only method by which anything can be controlled we are in trouble that is the makebreak point of lifetime that is the reason why electronic engineers have rough time the using of too much and using it too long to control things with energy which they themselves cannot even see causes this stuck flow which eventually deteriorates into the inability to control and forces them further down to cruder methods yes we have stratum above energy there is such thing as controlling by postulate there is also such thing as mass without energy or mass without fields there can be mass with energy and it is not true that that wall is composed of little things that wiggle it is not composed of space with an idea of little particles lets not make the mistake of saying that mass has mass that is what physics got itself into and is in it so deep that it will never dig itself out when it advanced into higher physics they said that mass has mass and it made mystics out of the lot of them that is reverse postulate it is all right to say that there is nothing there there is something there and behold is but now there is something there and we say that there is nothing there without vanishing it and we are in trouble because we are telling lie lets getthe isness straight the universe is real if you run around saying that it is real it would become less offensive to you but if you go around on the second postulate and while holding firmly in mind that it is and you say it isnt you notis it and become what wall case which is lower than south that which makes something is not the thing it made and because you can make energy is reason that you are energy because the wall next to you can make electrical fields when treated properly is reason that it is an electrical field in other words that wall over there is and dont ever think it isnt if your body runs into it it will go thump we then as result of this have to admit two isnesses the isness of your body and the isness of the wall and some person with more feeling than others would admit third the thump one an vary alter and do all sorts of things such as changing mest and electricity but when you say that it isnt you run into trouble and start going blind this is actually the total reason 8c and other processes are so good you just make the preclear go around and say it is it is it is and everything brightens up and is liable to become more solid stronger and more massive that is the basic control of this universe it is one controls something by holding it in existence just by holding something in existence one is controlling it control then even enters into creation create and control are next door to each other if an individual cannot suffer control himself his ability to create is doomed he may be frantically creating but it doesnt mean that he is going to keep doing this for very long he is going to hit that stuck flow if he is creating with postulates and not with energy flows he can go on forever the number one trick of control used in this universe on thetan is to make the thetan postulate that he himself can be damaged one has to make him conceive that he is energy and that energy can be damaged by which he then has it proven to him that he can be damaged one can only damage person thoroughly and enormously by making this identification between spirit and energy or mass any psychotherapy or practice of religion and philosophy or activity concerning the mind is doomed to failure and will not and cannot work if it is based on the premise that man is mass the only reason scientology works is because it disabuses him of this fact it addresses the being and if we were going around fixing up bodies thinking that man is body made up of neurons automaticities etc we have said at once that it cannot work because it is using and confirming this identification that is the basic misidentification necessary to damage thetan or put him downscale one just has to convince him that he is mass energy and can be damaged and you have foundation for slave society the thetan who is convinced that he is chair can provenly be damaged but thetan cannot be damaged all you really have to do is disassociate the idea that thetan was energy and you have 99 per cent of his case right there people control so much energy that they eventually come to believe that they had better obey the laws of energy and so get stuck in energy he then thinks he is energy and if he produces something he is the thing this situation eventually gets into stuck flow and the moment you process him not an energy mass he starts to disconnect from all this energy without really wrecking his havingness one cannot hurt his havingness it is just another idea he found havingness works because it exercises his connection with energy it makes him responsible until he wears out whole flock of postulates and then feels better this then is direct ratio one would have to convince thetan that he was energy before one could damage him he often sets up postulate that he could be damaged so as to damage another thetan by example somebody said hell was paved with good intentions but it is actually paved with setting an example you say look what you have done to meyou brute you have slaughtered and he says what living being can be slaughtered thats new thought and he goes off worrying about this you pick yourself up and say guess i got that guy then one day you do it so often that you forget to get the guy or you run into too many others that convinced you that is just the method of going into agreement hence down scale cases difficulty in processing all these things actually stem from these rather stratospheric postulates and activities which may or may not be reached directly by an auditor they certainly can be attacked on gradient scale if they could be reached just like that one would have one instant clear the whole matter of i am energy energy can be damaged i can be damaged is actually necessary channel to create good solid slave society fellow who is energy cannot get out of skull and must to some degree be conceiving himself to be the content of the skull when you tell him to exteriorize he is trying to push his brains outside the skull or something of the sort when you say be three feet back of your head it is painful and it gives him headaches thetan couldnt be damaged his abilities couldnt be less we have already demonstrated that it is impossible to reduce an ability about the only thing you can do is reduce its exercise or the willingness to exercise it the answer to all this is to remember and be cognizant all the time that one is processing the thetan and not an energy mass or something solid only then can change occur thetan has plotted out orders of seniority and top amongst them is surprise i can make anybody go out of control and actually make his body just start flip flopping madly just by making him run process that isnt process but which is addressed to surprise mock up somebody and have him be surprised just have him do that for few times and he says i am feeling nervous now and the next thing you as an auditor see is that he has got all of his clamps about surprise off and all of the surprise which was more or less on automatic goes into full restimulation and he will just flip flop all over the place surprise is one of the methods by which energy could be damaged because thetan gets that associated with blow and he has all sorts of interesting mechanisms figured out but we have to have these basic mechanisms first one that one can be damaged and two that he is energy christianity for instance had this failure although they were addressing the spirit very broadly they actually brought in this mechanism called hell there were seven hells originally and these various hells were all places where thetans could be damaged they did this very interestingly they said your soul which of course made the operation you are energy punishment and damage were entered in that wasnt anywhere near as bad an operation as this dialectic materialism psychology mess that we have inherited in our modern times science is going straight ahead on the rocks of man is energy man is mass at least christian practices gave via on it they still have some spirit present in their conception of man i am more or less prone to believe some of the miracles which occurred in the early days of christianity in spite of the several christian churches which now offer large prizes to anyone who can prove that any miracle ever occurred if you were just to convince somebody that he is spirit that he did not have soul but is soul and nothing else you are liable to get miracle he would slip all the way out of being energy and being damaged into being himselfwe thus have control of the spirit as being the highest button of control or processing control of spirit would be rather direct without mumbo jumbo and lots of vias such as witch doctoring we have come to point where we can do this quite directly we can control spirit the moment that the preclear himself sees that he is control and that he is not energy sees that he can receive control communicate and respond to it he certainly will pull out of the morass tone 40 works well for some people and rather poorly for others it has lot to do with the goals of the auditor and his understanding of what he is trying to do with that process but we are probably the first and this doesnt even include buddhism to overtly address this problem very directly and without superstition and mumbo jumbo direct control of the spirit is our direct goal and when person can be controlled then he can control and when he sees that there is two way flow involved he has the situation well in hand the arc triangle and cch edited from l ron hubbards lecture 2 of the 18th acc washington dc the arc triangle is our next to the oldest property in scientology the oldest is the bank the engram and the mental image picture quite recently this almost forgotten triangle did terrific resurrection only this time we have it as control havingness and communication affinity reality and communication are an excellent description of the three basic things on which the universe is built without which in balance life could not exist affinity that is some emotional or felt consideration of proximity is basically consideration of distance but it is that consideration which says that one likes or doesnt like it in other words without some liking or disliking having some things to avoid or to go close to there would be game at all reality is that sequence which begins with postulates and ends with mass which we originally defined as an agreed upon thing reality is the agreed upon apparency of existence as per the axioms communication is an interchange of ideas between two beings who are aware that the other person is present we had to introduce with this new simplicity the radical idea that one being could talk to another being and that an interchange of ideas could take place as defined in axiom 28 and described in dianetics 1955 the manual of communication if you notice an interchange of ideas it is not very feasible unless there is an agreement of some sort or another the agreement can take the form of having mass to talk to and we thus get communication via at least we know what we are talking to if there is something there and that is reality of course we can simply postulate that something is there and talk to it talking to something is better than talking to nothing when two beings are talking to each other here on earth one normally sees the oddity of two beings standing there not confronting each other and not talking but lot of words go back and forth the reality part of that interchange would be the mass the platform whether it be earth or sidewalk that the two bodies are standing on the space so far as location is concerned enters into this those are located somewhere and therefore we know where the communication goes to and whoever receives it knows where to send the answer back to very necessary part of communication then we get the affinity factor how far away does fellow have to be to talk to you there is more than that to affinity affinity is liking and disliking understanding requires affinity reality and communication and if any corner of the arc triangle is lowered the other two corners lower accordingly we know that reality is basically an agreement and we have today the reality scale we have always known that all we had to do was introduce some agreement into the situation one had to agree at least on what one was talking about in order to talk there is communication in progress if there is agreement on anything one should have had to establish the existence of one of the other people before communication could have occurred communication occurs simply by r and little when two people are together affinity necessitates control of attention we have had lot of processes founded on arc and they have not in themselves produced tremendous results they have produced good results but we havent seen anybody step out of the graveyard and dust his hatthere must be some counterparts to arc which are more workable than arc since if we know arc is true then how do we and those are basic considerations make it work in this universe on this planet at this time we know that the three things add up to understanding how do we get this into processing level in the first place one has to realize blindness when one sees it one has to realize that south is an awful long way south and the basic entrance of the arc triangle breaks down to control for to which bodies and the ge beautifully respond any preclear therefore would respond to it regardless of his tone level if you were processing him via body because this is the bodys understanding it is solid therefore is control somebody comes along and says stand up straighter got your heels together suck in your guts and he will say the guy loves you might phrase it in some other way you might say damn the sergeant i could kill him which means at the ge level i love him dearly thus we have havingness or solid mass in the place of reality and verbalization in place of communication so understanding takes place in terms of control mass and communication understanding mestwise always takes place in the framework of mass and location thereof verbalized or electrical or vibratory interchanges and for affinity control if one disliked somebody on mass level one would simply refuse to control him the choice i am talking about is to control or not to control unfortunately where there are people firmly connected with mass this then is the level of interchange if people are going around in bodies then this is the level to which cases respond dont get wrong i am not trying to rephrase or redo the arc triangle i am simply telling you the action level of the arc triangle when it is in action or you are going to work on mest level becomes control or lack of it the r becomes mass and its location or lack of it since the complaint is about mass and c is some sort of vibratory electrical particle interchange symbols flying back and so forth solid if you start adding too much directness at this very low level you are liable to blow the mass up thetan learns that every once in while he loses favorite piece of bank or service facsimile he said exactly what he meant to the fellow directly with vias and got himself fired he was trying to communicate directly on mest level and threw some particles straight out without the slightest via on them and caused an explosion one has to have intention with it there has to be some livingness connected with it in other words one has to go upscale in order to make it function optimumly people who are at the lower end of control dont want mass cant have communication which becomes it will be said for at this level when coaxed to put out control communication which is absolutely direct and straight people discover something fantastic in order to accomplish this they have to go upscale or shatter themselves in the process of doing so after they have been shattered few times they hit higher tone range they say i belong up here what am i doing grubbing around here in the mest that is basically what an individual understands when he starts doing recent training drills arc to become extremely workable has to be coached where you are dealing with masses in terms of control havingness and communication we have said cch by which we mean control communication havingness or communication control and havingness and we have lined them up so that it is instantly discernible that this is the other side to the arc coinfollow arc down scale as per the hubbard chart of human evaluation in science of survival and as you go down you will find an area below the bottom line of the chart that has to do with mass in other words to wrap up this whole subject the only responses still extant at the bottom of the chart can still be phrased in terms of control havingness and communication those responses do not entirely disappear as mentioned on the chart but become very coarse and massive and dont entirely disappear if life can be awakened into present it will be awakened into presence or location by control havingness and communication handled in one way or another the first cch process is very old and hardly anybody has recognized its antecedent i processed cat until he ate an editor i processed this cat up to point where he would strike at my fingers he was very timid cat and i got him to reach for my fingers and then each time he would reach i would withdraw my fingers slightly he would reach further and he got more and more ferocious so i invited an editor and he ate the editor up thats an exaggeration but he really ate the editors thetan by scaring the man with his ferocity just by inviting the cat to reach out matter how timidly and strike out at our fingers gradually so as not to startle or surprise the cat we make our fingers retreat we get the cat to put out communication line lines are solid at the bottom of the reality scale so we are right there at the cats reality the cat cant have mass is below mass and is actually trying to connect antagonistically with solid communication line so the cat does reach give that hand is just processing the cat you say give that hand the preclear doesnt and you reach over and take hold of his wrist take his hand and thank him for having given it to you after while of this he says you know there is some dim vague possibility that i might have had something to do with that i wonder if i could possibly reach that far over to your lap when he finds out that he can do it you have achieved goal for you have got him reaching for the environment in an 8c style when this is done you as an auditor better have him reach for the mest environment in terms of barriers you have just got lines recognized and he has to be moved up and out of barriers so we have 8c on walls when we get him above that the auditor puts him back on lines again and we have hand space mimicry we get him to locate the mass of the auditor the preclear cannot disobey these commands there is thinkingness involved in it because there isnt any thinkingness at that level and if you are processing any it is figure figure that is what arc becomes after long time an individual becomes body he agrees that he isnt anything but body people are never anything but bodies and bodies are dead too body is mass and therefore the realest thing there could be to body is outright control if person had body then control would be affinity if he could control something he would like it an individual who finds out control isnt killing him turns out to like his auditor that is an establishment of reality level and the affinity level at that reality level is control it goes up and not down the scale we use good tone 40 control on him and he will come upscale to having mass lets look at what this does to communication the individual of course is willing to talk he is also willing to receive objects and give objects away and so interchanges can occur we are looking at the arc where understanding takes place only in the presence of control havingness and communication on mest level this is the level at which machines of mest nature automobiles and so forth have to be run an individual cannot adequately control his car and he doesnt like his car what does he mean by like does he mean an emotion he means an ability to control it it is as solid and mesty as thatone wonders why some married couples dont get along although she apparently does everything he says when an auditor decides that he will get her out from under her husband or vice versa or bush up this closure of terminals he will find out that there seems to be some feeling for each other it is just control going on all the time one is looking here at where control is affinity they express their affinity for each other by kicking each other trying to gain control over each other by fighting below that level is love making one can understand lot by just looking at what understanding is at the level of mass it is control controlling and being controlled that is understanding psychosis is something mocked up so that it cannot be handled psychos try to make nothing out of their mass all the time they have mocked up nonhandlability people who are below 20 on the tone scale mock up things that cannot be handled and individuals above 20 mock up things when they do that can be handled or they simply try to handle anything there is thus dividing line on this control people below 20 mock up things routinely which cannot be handled and then brag about it those people are much further down scale than one thinks they are we say it is above or below 20 which seems to be precise line it is almost as if we are talking about two different universes when individuals go around mocking up things that cannot be handled and bragging about it all the time they give an auditor pretty bad time they are just daring the auditor to handle them you start sawing through with give that hand and they say this cant be handled they keep offering things that cant be handled these people are never really successful at anything they are terribly destructive they q and with mest and they have become mest they do what mest does here we enter our understanding of life in realizing that there are people around who havent the slightest desire to handle anything everybodys got something in his life that he doesnt think can be handled or thinks that he cannot handle but these people just mock it up all the time people or preclears that have given you hard time have done only that you cure them of one thing and they mock up something else that you cannot handle their whole game is the avoidance of control but they know how to control other people that is the service facsimile which is unhandlable and you handle these people by not permitting them to handle the service facsimile which is reactive enough for any reactive bank one can thus roughly divide mankind above or below 20 on the tone scale some of them mock up things which can be handled and try to handle other things these are the people that keep the world running they dont build clocks that cannot be fixed the rest of the people simply keep on mocking up things that cannot be handled and every doctor every practitioner of any kind is confronted by these people all the time because this is the dare arc becomes control havingness and communication you recognize that control havingness and communication are not the bottom because they invert and become control possible of any kind this is the cant handle it mass is admissible or viewable and communication of any kind acceptable therefore understanding is possible we have discovered that rung which solves the inversion just as we can raise any persons communication by raising his affinity and reality as we can raise affinity by raising their reality and communication so we can do these things at the bottom we can remedy control inability to handle and so forth in his life and vicinity simply by remedying his havingness we can do this by talking to him or by using straight control and we can raise his lack of mass by control and communication we will find that his havingness will increase some odd and very complicated consideration about havingness are in the way of all this but it will blow in cognitions which he probably will never mention but he will come up to cch if person has got to be identified and connected with mass he is in terribly good condition when he is at cch therefore cch is pretty high but it handles all the inversions ofcch and this whole mysterious stratum the bottom substratum of the arc triangle is revealed to view and becomes workable in the hands of the auditor control all by itself will level out all lower inversions of the subject of control havingness and communication the right kind of communication all by itself will do something for havingness and control hand space mimicry is solid line they will eventually have an auditor cant have on others and have on self or the three steps of trio or control trio run one way or another on somebody is also communication process if you run tell something your mother cant have and get straight answer the preclears havingness comes up so does his ability to control and his ability to communicate you can hit cch at one of its corners and get the other two to some degree because it permits the auditor to directly address the body and have something happen to the person cch then should be viewed simply as the workable factors at the lower end of the mass scale cch is pretty high level procedure but it is description also of all lower levels the harmonics of which are processed by straight cch startchangestop refer to clear procedure by l ron hubbard start change and stop is the anatomy of control this is cycle of action create survive destroy there is continue persist on the middle of the curve and other cycles within cycles of action but the important factors are start change and stop running start change and stop on an individual brings about greater self determinism selfdeterminism in the field of motion consists of by own power of choice permitting the object or body to be still or not to be still permitting thing to be changed or not to be changed permitting thing to be started or not to be started and it must be rehabilitated in the preclear in other words selfdeterminism consists here of returning the preclears power of choice over controlling or not controlling at will the preclear who is obsessively controlling will sooner or later fail to control and then will be controlled by something the obsession to control to start to change to stop will be found to enter into the arc triangle and is what depresses the preclear down scale on the tone scale these three parts of control are run flat individually in this order we run change flat and then run start again very flat and then we run stop flat it would be mistake at this point to say that this process is finished for the excellent reason that if you run change again you would find further considerations shifting in the preclear and then if you run start you would find it unflattened so you would run it again and then run and flatten stop it would not be possible to say how long you would have to run the process altogether on somebody who was total machinery and who never had been in session this would be rough process on case that is in good condition this would run easier the preclear would consider it interesting and would exteriorize quite easily the end result of this process is exteriorization for someone who is compulsively exteriorized this would be excellent as he would slide into his head and eventually come out of it again but not on compulsive basis one meets with three conditions in auditing the preclear who is compulsively interiorized the preclear who is compulsively exteriorized and the preclear who is buttered all over the universe the latter case run on csc would greatly accumulate the ability to collect himself this might not occur until you have run him for five or more hours on it if this process is continued long enough the preclear will be moving his body by postulate ie from the outside not by beams stimulus response etc this process does not go all the way up because of the preclears attention span most preclears cannot stay on process for more than few moments so you would vary the process little to keep him interested his actual response however is not important as long as he does it there is such thing as bad control only nonpositive control good control is positive control and positive control is not bad control we get lower level there than moving the body this would be scs on objects it is always safest to run this on someone you are trying out or person who cannot move about lot such as an invalid to somebody who has reality on his body one would run scs using an object instead of his body when running this process the auditor and the preclear should both stand up this gives reality and the auditor duplicating the preclear mimicry will bring about greater arc the session always fails when the auditor sits down while running scsit runs this way the auditor points out spot on the floor to the preclear and says do you see that spot good we will call that spot now you stand here ok the auditor now indicates another spot and says now do you see that other spot good well call that spot b all right now when i tell you to change the bodys position i want you to move it from spot to spot b all right good change the bodys position fine then the auditor says do you see that spot well well call that spot c we use three spots so that we dont run duplication process on him now when i tell you to change the bodys position i want you to move the body from spot b to spot c do you understand that fine change the bodys position you can ask him did you change the bodys position if his case is not too low for it is not advisable on low case at first then go back to spot it does not have to be the same spot each time as it makes the process too much like duplication brings the preclear to predict the process too easily and he will do it machinewise each time you make contact with the preclear you give the command in new interval of time you dont depend on any former understanding of the command you clear it each time and give the whole command every time you use it we make each move in time new move he doesnt have to depend on his memory so the auditor repeats the whole wording as given this is most important aspect of running any part of scs on start we emphasize start the auditor says do you see that wall over there good now when i give you this command i want you to move the body in the direction towards that wall when i say start i want you to start the body all right start fine the preclear may protest that he had to stop the body and change it as well what is happening here is that the word control is beginning to ungroup and as you get start change and stop apart and distinct from each other the individuals ability to control the body increases and he gains more confidence in being able to control it from greater and greater distance the next command would be all right when i tell you to start the body you start the body ok start the body the third command is for stop and the auditor says i am going to ask you to get the body moving towards that indicated wall and somewhere along the line i am going to tell you to stop the body is that all right he agrees and you say get the body moving you dont say start he does so and you say stop and did you stop the body you dont say your body but the body indicating the body you emphasize him as thetan doing it for it increases the preclears selfdeterminism you give the commands for each process newly each time from scs which is the three processes given above there are two other processes called startcs and stopcs startcs has the exact commands as for start in scs we emphasize start here and use change and stop only to unflatten start the purpose here is to rehabilitate the preclears ability to get things starting since he has been immobilized lot in his life when the opposing valences or conditions exercised bad control over him and prevented him from starting after preclear has been run on startcs which would flatten to some degree each one of the points of control we run stopcsthis is distinctly different process the commands are the same as used for stop in s cs but here one specializes in stopping the body one has the preclear stop the body over and over and as the preclear becomes more accustomed to doing this one then changes the process on him to this extent the auditor asks the preclear in running stopcs to stop the body absolutely still this imposes new discipline on the preclear and makes the process extremely difficult for him it is only done when scs and ordinary stopcs have to some degree been flattened following up this stop the body absolutely still one can introduce change into the process for few commands in order to unflatten the stopcs that has flattened in other words when the stop of stopcs on an object or the body seems to be flat one can run few change the body or change the object and unflatten stop once more with resultant alteration in the preclears ability to perform when stopcs seems flat then it should be unflattened at first by running changess with the emphasis on change when change longer upsets his ability to stop it starting it should be run as an alternate to stopcs in order to unflatten it again stop is the most important part of scs the preclear has been told all along the line to stop he was made effect all the time how you bring him to just this under his own control and selfdeterminism and he takes over the automaticity the same is true for change psychotic is compulsively changing all the time and changess will take over the automaticity of compulsive changing and make the person more sane pab 127 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 3537 fitzroy street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 1 january 1958 the threat to havingness prepared from the research material of l ron hubbard the first step to processing preclear is to find out if he has present time problem and to handle it adequately enough to proceed with auditing often we have preclear who comes to us basically just to get more able and as we process him we find that we are making particular progress with this case he seems to be doing everything just as we expect it to be done with apparent gain the reason for this occurrence is the fact that the preclear is not doing the process in present time and has present time problem that is interfering of which he did not tell us the fact about the matter is that the preclear himself does not really know is not cognizant of the fact that he has present time problem and is consequently very south case i have found that preclear who isnt processing real fast on procedure cch isnt doing the process because he has something which threatens his havingness since processing and havingness go hand in hand it isnt surprising that the preclear will make sure that he doesnt change since he cannot afford to expend more havingness in cognitions so this threat to his havingness is his present time problem of which he may or may not be aware and if you as an auditor didnt handle it at the beginning of the session it is certain that the preclear is not consciously aware that he has such problem or is deliberately lying to you for reason of shame embarrassmentor that arc is not fully present this threat to havingness is that which most prevents the preclear from having things it is that which stands in his way to having and is thus problem to him which he hasnt under control what the auditor has to do is to find this problem for the preclear and then to handle it properly this case is so low on problems that he doesnt even recognize that he has one and his level of problems has to be increased otherwise he will create problem out of auditing which is what happens when he doesnt change auditing itself then becomes problem to the preclear one handles this matter simply by going into good twoway communication with the preclear oneway communication asises havingness twoway doesnt and actually raises the tone of the preclear one asks him if there is something that worries him presents difficulty which he would like to handle or which is making life bit troublesome or if he is about to lose anything pending court case wife business deal etc or if there is anything that he wouldlike to change as it produces some pressure on him and so forth but the important question here is what most prevents you from having things the moment anything arises go straight ahead and ask him pointed but not evaluating questions about it so that he can define it into more definite form ask him to tell you about it again how it worries him exactly what it is that has this effect until he can articulate it clearly and precisely one can even play stupid so as to make him more lucid until one actually finds the terminal if it is condition that is worrying himfor we handle terminals and masses only and not conditions or effects after this one can state the problem to the preclear in practically his own words asking him to listen carefully and correct one if one hasnt repeated it accurately and then ask him to tell one if it is problem to him and if he recognizes it as such it is surprising that the preclear will look quite pleased to have this problem and will naturally want to hold on to it in spite of his protestations that he wouldnt if you questioned him further about it it would thus be wrong to suggest to him that it should be solved or taken away from him for problem is game and threat to havingness does and can reveal the hidden game the preclear is compulsively playing taking that problem would be robbing him of game and the preclear would react violently or by not changing since he thinks you are going to keep on taking all his games from him one thus tells the preclear that since he now has problem it would be better if he had more problems which would be directly under his own control one then handles this threat to his havingness by taking the terminal to the problem and running invent problem of comparableincomparable magnitude to the terminal the new problems he invents if it is done with reality and it is the auditors job to see that he does so will not be aberrative since he has created both the intention and counter intention that constitutes the problem and is therefore pandetermined in relation to these problems which he then can control these problems will serve to move his fixed attention from the problem which he doesnt have under control and the auditor can then proceed with procedure cch there is however note of warning here the twoway communication must remain twoway and also this process can come dangerously near evaluation which must not occur it therefore needs clever auditing to have the preclear discover this problem without breaking the auditors code the auditor can ask pointed questions which will reveal it more easily and even restate the problem in clearer and concise language but he must not evaluate under any circumstance this type of case by the way is low toned case and needs great amount of good control and the first four steps of cch must be thoroughly flattened before any attention and thinkingness processes are used it can be seen from the above that it is important at all times to look out for the things that threaten the preclears havingness and to handle them with problems of comparableincomparable magnitude so that auditing doesnt have to become present time problem to you and the preclearhubbard communications office washington dc 11 january 1958 hgc procedure 1 cch 0 with pt problem on emeter 2 scs and connectedness to get pc under control

next is below that body etc the next is to the right of that body etc the next is to the left of that body etc then one begins the series again with in front of that body etc this is continued until emeter longer registers surge when pc does it now pick larger object test it for surge on the meter if meter surges dont use it pick another etc now go through same series one runs this on at least 6 objects each one larger until he goes on to next hold it still keep it from going away when flat on many objects is followed by the same command substituting hold it still this is done before behind above below to the right to the left the same way around and around when hold it still is flat one goes to make it little more solid same command otherwise as before if this all flattens start all over again now with more significant objects read step 6 clear procedure l ron hubbard lrhbtrd copyright 1958 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedpab 128 professional auditors bulletin the oldest

_____________________________________________________________________ 15 january 1958 the factors behind the handling of iq edited from l ron hubbards 16th lecture to the 18th american acc in washington dc on s august 1957 this past week has been an eventful one in research it has culminated fouryear search for the factors which lay behind what is called iq or intelligence quotient we have been taking tests here for many years and these tests were mainly used to establish change in preclears we care nothing about the significance of the test we do care however that these tests mirror change someone may say that test taken twice will of course get better answer than one taken once this is not true since everybody in the mest universe is on mustnt happen again and we automatically figure that test taken twice would get worse grade the second time we have two different tests marked and b which are supposed to give identical results i have been waiting for the people who devised this test originally to say well you can throw the results in any direction you want to with these tests but we have given considerable amount of testing to many many people and we do find that test will hold constant on given person in the absence of processing if person is not processed the variability in the profile and iq is very slight somebody who is not getting any results from any treatment or processing will register the same test after test which is quite unusual testing is very old subject it is not newly developed in modern times one of the first examples of testing that we find is in the early chaldean times testing of all kinds sorts and descriptions as to honesty intent reliability ability and so forth have been with man almost as long as he has been on earth in modern times these tests have been more standardized and reduced to writing here for example is test i heard about from the 18th century down in georgia it was guilt test somebody had stolen something so they would have all the negroes on the plantation line up and put rooster underneath big black kettle this was witch rooster or something of the sort and they would say the man who stole it when he touches the black kettle will make the rooster crow all the negroes on the plantation would go by the kettle and then the overseer merely had to go by and look at their hands the negro who didnt have any soot on his hands was of course guilty all tests however have had an end goal and they of modern times are more or less as covert as this rooster under the black kettle modern tests were originally devised in the total belief that man could not be changed from year to year people would get changes of one kind or another from childhood on which would demonstrate the years iq which might be higher or lower than another years iq theymaintained that people advanced in iq because of age yet at the same time said that iq could not change would never change and could not be influenced by any particular factor i am rather astounded to discover that when person is happy and takes the test and when this same person is unhappy and takes the test he practically gets the same curve on his personality profile with the same iq it does have constancy it was this constancy and an inability to understand the mind prior to 1950 which made people say that it was not possible to change man or his iq stupid man was stupid and bright man bright and that was it people knew however that personality and iq were not the same thing and were distinct from one another so there are tests to measure personality and tests to measure intelligence one of the ways one would observe this would be to take three or four men who had more or less an equal personality the result of testing would show that they had more or less similar personalities but that their iqs differed or one could take men of the same iq and test them only to find that their personalities were completely different from each other i have known this ever since 1950 when the first testing was done we either changed their personality or changed their iq very often with very successful case we changed and improved both this created mystery and we wondered why it was that when we ran an intensive on joe his iq changed and when we ran the same intensive on bill his personality changed but not his iq in view of the fact that all of our processes were mixed to large degree including such things as havingness 8c thinkingness and significance processes and in view of the fact that auditors were different from one another we had sufficient number of factors in each one of these test representations to make it impossible to sort out i could not sort it out then i started on project with the hgc auditors last week and wound up with the answer to this problem when i had intention of doing so at all it was just accidental that i found the answer here is what happened we wanted process that we could write up in book and send to ministers so that they could counsel easily and well since the minister is doing tremendous amount of personal counseling if he could just sit down according to these rules as he read them and get some sort of result we would have been very happy we called this project process july we knew one thing about process july it was slanted in the direction of getting people to unburden their souls we wanted to get the overt actmotivator sequence off the case so we would have the minister write down the names of everybody the person knew and then pick out the most likely candidates and ask just one question about each one of those until we got this person straightened out it would have been straight wire question on present time basis such as tell something you could do or say to valence we do know that an overt actmotivator sequence is reachwithdraw situation therefore we had to test withhold since we obviously had this withhold situation to consider now earlier processes already indicated this and particularly recall secret dont confuse this with withhold because they are not the same process at all we merely wanted the person to open up and talk to the auditor when we were recalling secrets and if we did anything with it it was totally accidental but we did learn here about withhold so the first question the minister would ask would be think of something you could withhold from now one of the discoveries that led to this question is that divulgence and confessions had nothing to do with raising anybodys iq or improving his case it wasnt the fact that he confessed it or divulged it but the fact that he erased it we started running this withhold command for couple of days and then went over to what could you say or do to ____ varied that question around for couple of daysand returned to think of something you could withhold from valence and found that the latter was the question that was producing the results withhold is games condition on communication and is partner to the process mock up somebody denying communication people are in an obsessive games condition which they have to play although they are not aware of it and on the subject of communication they are naturally going to be withholding obsessively we tested this process carefully and found minimal personality changes but found that the iqs of the preclears changed remarkably an old ladys iq went up from 84 to 105 and everybody knew that her brains were atrophied it was an impossible jump for person of her age another person quite advanced in years between 70 and 80 years old got an iq raise from 109 to 133 an invalids iq went up from 98 to 121 and students from 101 to 126 there was an iq change on every case on which this process was run the theory behind it seems to be this the individual gets his mind so involved with the problems of some game with some valence or person that his computers are all tied up on that particular subject when you restore selfdeterminism on this level you free the individuals ability to think an obsessive games condition is to withhold communication from somebody when we take that off automatic and put it under the control of the preclear so that he is doing it all of the involved mechanisms start working out that is why psychotherapy never worked you have never seen before and after tests whether iq or personality on freudian analysis it is the ability to withhold communication which advances iq and makes person feel better not the ability to divulge it weve been told all our lives that all we had to do was go to somebody and confess if we were to confess to our mothers and fathers that we did those dirty nasty little things we would feel so much better it isnt true you probably only felt better to the end of getting your pants spanked this is an enforced communication and as an enforced communication would break through games condition in which person found himself it would demand that one communicate with the enemy and would depress one accordingly obviously then it is not true that divulging or confessing did anything for anybody because the only improvement he got would be if he regained the ability to withhold that information without being upset about withholding it the only disturbing element in secrets is the guilt which accompanies them for example you took your old mans car and it got wobbly wheel you put it back in the garage and he came out the next day and looked at it and said i wonder how that happened you stood there innocently saying nothing but you felt guilt at length you felt as though you were going out of communication with him when these incidents piled up too high psychotherapys whole answer to this is that you had to throw yourself at your fathers chest and confess all whereupon all would be well it wouldnt have done thing for you what the bent wheel did was to overcome your ability to withhold communication by making you feel you ought to communicate it interrupted your selfdeterminism on the subject of communication this is the reach and withdraw mechanism of must reach cant reach must withdraw cant withdraw and these are the two pairs which create the sensation of insanity as an example you must run away from the bogey man thats chasing you through the treacle he is coming like mad express train and there you are stuck that is nightmare you must withdraw and cannot withdraw the glee of insanity is only composed of this people in asylums are stuck in this so they must withdraw and cant withdraw must reach and cannot reach all of the past psychotherapies are aimed at getting person to outflow and what do we find here we find that intelligence increases and neurotic personality traits get better when we run withhold communication from valences it is fantastic reversal we found this to be the case that people from whom one felt that one could not withhold anything were the most aberrative valences on the case we thus have new definition for aberrative valences namelythe cannot withhold from valence who is the most aberrative valence on the case as you run it the preclear will say well unreality unreality i dont seem to be able to withhold anything from aunt grace at all ask criminal what he could withhold from jail and he will find that he cannot withhold anything from jail he will see facsimiles and other electronic phenomena sweeping towards some spot he considers jail since he is unable to withhold anything from jail we are looking at the basic anatomy of the track and the basic process by which one would run track you could be sitting in the middle of the trap and just dream it up for while and say how did i get in here i dont know the only way anybody could keep you in trap would be to give you the idea that you had to surrender to the trap and the way to undo this would simply be to think of something you could withhold from the trapor track the other side takes care of itself i dont know how thetan can keep from communicating with everything unless he feels he should withhold everything from everything remember you are not trying to erase lot of things it is the regaining of the ability to withhold that you are working toward it is certainty process the preclear selectively withholding things from canvas typewriter or aberrative valence with certainty because an individual has been in games condition with the canvas typewriter drill press or the valence it has absorbed all of his ideas and thinkingness and everything else and they are all stuck and bunched up on the track he is trying to think how can i communicate since communication is composed of selective withholding one thus gets this kind of activity one has individuals in games condition with their highest common denominator of games condition and that action is communicate and they are trying to withhold communication from their opponents wherever they have considered an opponent to exist they have withheld communication from the opponent having decided to withhold communication from the opponent they now decide to communicate with the opponent because they have to and you get denial of self which is of course the basic aberrative pattern we take this circumstance look it over and discover that the individual has been made to break his own postulatei am withholding itbecause he considered this person an opponent and then he said i have to talk when you can longer withhold from valence you become it and we have the basic mechanism of valence closure because what is the one thing that you dont withhold from something you have become yourself so here is gradient scale of withholding one would run withhold this way you would take an inventory of valences their professions and habitats habitat is place where the preclear has lived and couldnt pay rent in other words the old homestead his childhood home there are number of tricks by which one can isolate these valences without asking the direct question on the basis of comm lag or the fact that he didnt mention at all in five people the two most aberrative people or valences on the case one would then establish session with thoroughness and with questioning find out if there was present time valence with which the person was very deeply involved and run that out with problems of comparable magnitude one would then move into the session and sandwich valences with locational processing the command here is think of something you could withhold from valence not recall something the preclear would say oh yes i can think of lots of things now beware of an automaticity he might strike games condition on an automaticity that says i can withhold something from valence that has to be flattened get to the point where he can withhold rather ordinary and routine things at his own discretion one at time and that would be the ability to withhold regained the only thing you are interested in when the preclear finally decides that he can withhold things from the valence go into locational processing to orient your preclear in present time and to command his attentionthen run the next aberrative valence this one should be little more difficult than the last one and so on to the next valence which should be stiffer than the last one should then pick up the preclears professional tools and run these on similar gradient scalethe easier ones first and gradiently to the difficult onesuntil he can withhold anything from his childhood home flatten cch 0 1 2 3 and 4 fairly well before you embark on this and then use ample locational processing for the remainder of the intensive and lord knows what his iq will be if you went for broke to this degree but remember that the process will not do anything unless you have some goals as to where the process is going and the goal is to restore the preclears ability to withhold this will bring the preclear out of all traps and is quite evidently iq and it changes valences only to the degree that it totally snaps the preclear out of that valence i hope this information is as valuable to you as it has proven itself to and the hgc auditors who assisted with this project l ron hubbardhubbard communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 18 january 1958 control the reason the auditor is having trouble getting off control and onto step 6 is that the auditor expects technique to take control of pc auditing depends on the auditor taking control of the pc when this is learned well not have 20 hrs devoted to control processes and 5 to step 6 we will have 5 hrs to control and 20 hrs to step 6 control consists of the pc being aware of who and what is controlling him so find the auditor is therefore part of control l ron hubbard

he mocked it up change the location of the mockup on each successive command by commanding behind that body above that body below that body to that bodys right to that bodys left when the first object has been run from nul to nul locate somewhat larger nul object with the meter run it nul to nul on the same command you will then go on to 3rd 4th 5th and 6th object each larger than the last and each run nul to nul on keep it from going away when all 6 objects have been flattened on keep it from going away run each one again in the original order on hold it still when this is flat run the same 6 objects with make it little more solidnotes if mockup disappears or flies out of control dont red herring after it just have him mock up the same item again if pc becomes extremely introverted during session of creative processing connectedness may be used to end session if pc should remain introverted for entire day go back to connectedness if needle consistently out of pace with supposed command

dc operation until midfebruary 3 in midfebruary i am going to london for 3 weeks to get london going on clearing because it communicates easily to rest of world this for sure consolidates sa nz and aust which man may need 4 returning to dc end of 1st week in march 5 i will write our next book one bringing us up to date and giving us book for the book stores that advertises as the solution to bohdi the clear everybodys wanted for 2500 years 6 that done ill be in dc in late april 7 the book will be published in june by vantage press it will also be published in uk and france through vantage contacts pamphlet about bodhi will be written at once for reply to ads in mystic magazines which announces the goal of 2500 years has been reached it will be printed like 1 or 5s book heres what scientology organizations should do 1 put announcements at once in all mystic magazines announcing state attainable steves has the ad copy 2 get pamphlet on clears published as soon as i complete it 3 get whole staff cleared by coaudit and hgc where necessary i want all staff everywhere clear by june easy to do and the results are startling 4 get groomed up for the summer rush and see to it that it is rush well in ad 8 weve got kickoff for much more rapid game the scope of that game will be apparent to everyone when you start getting clear and making clears my game in research is not at end by long way for instance in research for ot actions i wrote 15 things the us govt should do five weeks ago it has now done 6 of them whentheyve done all 15 i know were sailing for the 6 may have been my telepathy or coincidence and organization knowhow and expansion is long way from ended map comm center for the nearest ten stars for instance well be on deck to welcome the space ships when they get

communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 1 february 1958 clearing of fields definition field is any thing interposing between pc thetan and something he wishes to see whether mest or mockup fields are black grey purple any substance or invisible to run step 6 of clear procedure it is necessary to clear up field rules of fields we take thetans ability to see for granted his willingness to see may be poor but we increase it by increasing his confidence decreasing his fear of objects fear of seeing is fear of mass pc can keep himself from seeing by destroying all mass this is one way mockups fail to appear he has an automaticity which destroys them before they visibly appear short duration mockups are similarly caused pc that cant see is reacting from failure or failures of having tried to destroy something he then tries to destroy mockups failing this he tries to destroy self this is scale of survival persistence of mockups is therefore dependent upon pcs willingness to let one survive one of the phenomena most in the road of clearing is called field it is self protective or destructive device for our purposes however the question of field is simple common example pc was held in dark room the room kept him from going away it is an incident the blackness he always sees is the blackness of the room which kept him from going away this incident or many like it piled up is field it is only necessary to have him mock up black rooms shove them into his body and keep them from going away pc is cause here where the room was cause before and the field will change this is rule in any field pc was effect in an incident where he was being kept from going away to clear that field it is only necessary to have him create the incident shove it into the body and have pc keep it from going away the main rule of fields is that pc must be made to reverse cause on the field from field at cause to pc at cause as all fields are incidents and as pc is the one who mocks up these incidents all fields can be cleared by attaining knowing cause another rule is that pc will confront anything to the degree that he is made familiar with it merely making him find and recognize fields will rid him of them merely making him confront objects will rid him of fieldstesting for fields basic method of testing for field aud close your eyes what do you see pc nothing aud look at the room pc eyes still closed what do you see pc nothing aud then something must be between you and room what is it etc until pc sees field or eyelids or room now repeat the same with simple mockup shape egg ballbearing or sugar cube have him mock it up look at it if he cant see it ask whats between him and it keep this up until he sees field you can also test for partial fields in areas clearing fields basic methods of clearing field field is one or more incidents identify and locate the incident making field have pc mock up the incident shove it into the body and keep it from going away b mock up terminal same shade as the field and keep it from going away c mock up terminal same shade as field and shove it into body d run destroy mockup in front of that body did you thanks behind below to the right of to the left of above below take pc outside as in waterloo station and have him get the idea of destroying that indicated body or object f move pc on time track automaticity of form solution pc must know he is creating what he is creating he is creating any mental pictures he sees but he must know that he is creating automaticity of form keeps him from believing he is making facsimiles he has buried the ability to form complex objects he mocks up man the mockup is his the form is an automaticity therefore he feels the mockup isnt his simplicity of form will conquer this and regain knowingness of mocking up an entire clearing including the handling of fields could be accomplished on pc by having him do agradient scale of forms in mockups always using only mockups he is confident are his own and recovering his ability to destroy these mockups what is clearing but regaining awareness that one is himself mocking up all his facsimiles and regaining confidence he can destroy them as well as create them l ron hubbard lrhrd copyright 1958 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedpab 129 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 3537 fitzroy street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 1 february 1958 confronting i want to speak to you about phenomenon having to do with enough and not enough this adds up to meaning insatiable the thetan is insatiable as far as enough is concerned just what is enough that limit has never been agreed upon for instance the governments of populations have long since exceeded enough with internal revenues but the fact of the matter is that if you object to taxes it is probably because there are not enough taxes i was fascinated to study and i examined several hundred governments to discover what made them persevere what people considered good government to be there are certain requisites to good government people seem to buy governments of tremendous duress and govemments which are very sweet and polite and constructive are all lost but governments which call in leading citizens incarcerate them and tear off their toenails with pincers seem to be very well liked on the track they persevere not because the police and governments do good job but probably only because they cant be confronted justinian the first great christian emperor used to call in the foremost citizens or members of government that had happened to make his wife little mad and throw them into the nearest dungeon torture them to death and sell their wives off to the arabs for slaves the leading general of this emperor was actually one of the great generals of all time but every time he won victory justinian would issue some kind of cross mandate depriving the victory of all significance at the end belisarius was rewarded by having his eyes put out the more people justinian illegally taxed burned and tortured the happier everybody seemed about the whole thing there was smell of revolt but the same people just few years before justinian and just short while afterwards had perfectly good emperors with equitable taxes just courts and these emperors lasted only short period before the populace was in revolt all over the place well what causes this the answer is enough government the populace had an idea of how much government there ought to be and if you didnt give them that much government they exploded but they would have exploded to much higher level if somebody could have caught them but nobody ever did and as they came up on the upbound they just got new tyrant who pushed them down harder the only reason i am talking about government is that i want you to see preclear take somebodys wife he is mean to her and as long as he continues to be mean she doesnt explode one day he decides to be kinder and she explodes here is husband he hardly puts his foot in the door and she jerks his pay envelope out of his hand counts it very rapidly tells him his supper is on the tableand it is cold mutton we get tremendous amount of duress and then one day she is feeling poorly and doesnt furnish this much duress and he explodes what does this prove unless one applies tremendous duress and bad 8c people explodea preclear explodes under mediumly mild 8c which has regularity rather than tremendous number of surprises he has never been given orders he can follow before and all his effort to be orderly goes into restimulation his efforts to be orderly were manifest at those times when disorder was in his vicinity you start to handle him well and the disorder to his view goes into automatic and he blows up this restimulates his efforts to keep chaotic duress which he first used long time ago to have an orderly duress against such chaos you actually start running out the tremendous duress which he has had to apply to keep chaos from exploding when that runs out you get an explosion of the chaos he has been holding down you run out by command the duress which he has applied to chaotic times of his lives as consequence you get an explosion it looks as though this individual thrives on nothing but chaos but that is not true he doesnt want it and he doesnt want anything to do with it short period of application of very good 8c that is positive and wont let him get away with thing will run this out an individual will apparently sit around in sort of mucky apathy and be abused for years without anything happening because the abuse he is getting is sort of running out former chaotic periods of his life it is in restimulation it convinces him that he cannot handle the wife and that there is nothing one can do about government person who is subjected to chaotic duress year after year is not getting any place but and this seems to be the criteria by which this is judged he did not revolt there is nothing confused about the auditor in tone 40 session if you want fast blow that will run this all out you must be very didactic positive and totally unconfused he will pull out tricks like origins then sly tricks and then somatics none of them interrupt positive control you just continue to run out all the times when he has tried to control things and has had them blow up in his face it is very interesting to watch child move up into his teens his parents have been giving him 8c family styledid you wash your face why dont you get glass of milk there isnt any milk go to bed dont go to bed get up go to bed dont stand up when he gets into the teens all of sudden his parents arent applying very much duress on him and he revolts it is not really feeling sentient knowing revolt at all it is restimulation of his own effort to take care of the chaos which happened to him years ago so actually bad control breeds periods of chaos which will someday explode the actual appearances that come out of this are quite fascinating one of them is that the individual needs lot of dramas you might say well if the thetan can stand up to that much drama he must like it he does not like it but it is at least something to do and that is his misconception of what is worth confronting for example man had nice art collection lived an orderly existence was an interesting conversationalist and lived in his maryland village he never had caller one day he died and the whole environment went to his funeral obviously funeral is worth confronting but live being isnt just add this up to what we used to have to say about acceptance level now we have confronting level another man hardly had anybody to talk to him in the office he did good job and there wasnt anybody who ever talked to him particularly one day he got sick and everybody in the office came to see him clear down at the hospital if he had got sick from leprosy they all would have come in the first five minutes an individual has concept of what is worth confronting and all of the chaos which he has been handed has got him so confused that he doesnt understand that things dont have to be horrible terrible miserable or dramatic in order to be confronted he falls this way straight away from confronting the universe around him and he confronts only the horribleness and nastiness and so onlately the book review tells us that book called andersonville by mckinley cantor is supposed to be and is advertised as the greatest civil war novel ever written i took look at it it isnt about the civil war at all it is about prison camp erected in georgia by southerners in which they incarcerated damn yankees every nasty foul condition of humanity is delineated painfully and unartfully at exceeding length this low tone level is something that is worth confronting have you watched tv lately some of the 15ing and high toned tv actors acting at 15 that is evidently worth confronting if you could just figure out what lot of people consider to be worth confronting and then give it to them you would probably come up with much greater popularity than anything else the same thing goes for the circus and screen hollywood got the idea and i imagine laid tremendous multibillion dollar egg with their vista vision and wide screen they are getting actors bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger screens and finally you sit down and begin to feel like an ant crawling on one of the actors knees there is another side of the manifestation we have the anxiety to be confronted we get these two things in conflict with each other and those two things in their adjustment make the drama of life where do we find preclears stuck they are stuck in drama and one gets the idea that that is something worth confronting they go off on gradient scale to things nobody could possibly confront and which they never did confront and then go anaten first he starts facing these things which are he considers worth confronting and if he considers enormous drama the only thing worth confronting then he easily falls into enormous chaos when he goes over into enormous chaos he gets caught up in the fact that nobody could possibly confront the thing but he is already stuck on an earlier postulate that there was nothing worth confronting and so he gets havingness in the physical universe people run such tricks on other peoples havingness they tell him nothing around here is worth looking at this is dull town i think america invented the small town just to convince people there was nothing worth confronting these small communities with their small minds work one way or the other on making nothing out of things that child was willing to confront so they bred as the child grew older contempt for anything in his vicinity and he started looking for things that were worth confronting here is sample process which could go mock up something that isnt worth confronting make it little more solid thank you the person gets streets in his immediate vicinity he gets havingness and the only things that he could ever get havingness from yet his total idea is that none of this is worth confronting and he never sees it thus you get your standard homo sapiens vacant eyed walking down the street as an example on lovely cool day people were riding and walking down the street one lady pushed little boy in cart and they were all going along vacant eyed all of sudden the woman pulled the tongue of the little cart up and catapulted the little boy out onto the pavement with crash instantly traffic jammed up the kid wasnt even hurt he just cried little but all the cars stopped and their passengers popeyed onto this terrifying scene people stopped walking and crowded around the spectacle that was worth confronting the ingredients of bloodcurdling drama were added but when the little boy wasnt hurt and he shut up looks of disappointment were on all faces and the crowd dispersed quietly to the vacancy of other blocks another process on this line mock up something that nobody can confront and we discover the favorite games of psychos not productive process at all by the way when you get something that nobody could confront you get black minds with ridges shooting stars and space opera flying around them that they could not make head or tail ofif you said invent something to confront mock it up and make it little more solid you would probably get the best process that can be worked out of this morass the individual would gradually change his mind concerning things there were to be confronted there are such things as cant be confronted at all there are only things which are difficult to confront mock up something youve got to confront and you get the standard run of the mill homo sapiens nonsense such as alarm fires funerals etc we also get work work is considered to be about the last thing that anybody should ever be expected to confront the angloamerican view is to put tremendous amount of kick in the pants on this thing called work the way you work out work as something that is impossible for anybody to confront is to discourage child when you see him perform any work you say oh get out of my way its too much trouble to show you youre in my road and by the time he is six or seven hes thoroughly educated that he will not be permitted to work and then the laws of state keep him from getting jobs and earning money so that he can escape from the tremendous dependency of family further up in his teens they realize the police have vested interest in crime and they have here good quality juvenile delinquent then he is not permitted to work either we get him in his early twenties and insist he get married and then we show him that hes got to work here youve got one of these super duress gottoconfronts wonder people get tired because every time you put them into got to confront you run them into all the emergencies what is an emergency it is something that requires necessity level what is necessity level it is heightened willingnessa sudden heightened willingness which untaps tremendous amount of ability and you get these tremendous feats now this cycle of super energy and application winding up with super tiredness gets applied to the workaday world of turning lathe or driving truck or keeping set of books hes got to get the work done and he finally goes into total exhaustion this is because he has orientation on whats worth while confronting this adds up to the fact that man goes into an emergency level of activity when he has got to confront and his whole lifetime is one long activity at an emergency height this tells us the reason for the hectic anxiety to get the work done the human body has its limitations and cannot stand that since it is built on number of now i am supposed tos and every time you have the problem handled you go out in the middle of the sahara desert and now i am supposed to have drink of water keys in and you havent got it licked at all mock up something you have got to confront brings to the guy the tools of his trade run it bit further and youll get women if it is man and vice versa it is got to confront you can ask what the solution of confrontingness in the preclear would mean in terms of exteriorization things that are impossible to confront that are not worth confronting each play their role in exteriorization person who is dead in the head knows that he couldnt possibly confront skull of body but he has got to confront one i would say that it would take lot of preparation with the early steps of cch before one started soaring into those rarefied realms of confrontingness there is one process called locational processing which works out tremendous amount of confrontingness and controls attention at the same time it is run tone 40 with great accuracy and precision by the auditor who then controls the preclears attention which was previously controlled by facsimiles and steady control like that runs out the preclears attempts to control locational processing happens to make the thetan make the body confront the wall this is an objective confrontingness process as subjective one invent something to confront mock it up and make it little more solid is very good and they are at present the two standard confrontingness processes in scientology l ron hubbardhubbard communications office 1812 19th street nw washington 9 dc hco

death edited from l ron hubbards 12th lecture to the 18th american advanced clinical course in washington dc on 30 july 1957 the whole subject of death has been one of the more mysterious subjects to man and it has only been in scientology itself and not in dianetics that the mechanisms of death have been thoroughly understood when i say thoroughly understood i mean of course only the mechanisms we know great deal about death and we are actually the first people on this planet that do this is one of the larger wins of scientology it is very easy to forget about death because that is what death is forgettingness however we do have considerable amount of information on this subject and you are entitled to that information man is composed of body mind and what we refer to as the thetan exteriorization processes give person considerable subjective reality on the idea that he himself is being that is independent of mind or body and that there actually is separateness between them one doesnt even have to be carried along to point of where one exteriorizes in processing in order to get reality on this this subject has been fully covered by since 1952 when i defined the thetan as in axiom 1 and devised techniques to separate any preclear from his body this was the first scientific evidence that man has had on the subject of the human spirit man thought he had human spirit that is totally incorrect man is human spirit which is enwrapped more or less in mind which is in bodyand that is man homo sapiens he is spirit and his usual residence is in his head and he looks at pictures and his body carries him around when we look at the fact that man is spirit which has mind and body and when we describe man in that fashion then it becomes extremely simple to understand what his difficulties would be his difficulties would be basically with his body or with his mind and we can understand that there obviously would be difficulties with him as spiritual being he has to think that he can get into trap has to get the idea that he can be in danger before he can get into danger in other words the thetan has to give permission to be trapped before he can be trapped and is therefore easily untrapped the moment he is untrapped he gives birth to all sorts of interesting phenomena which we know as the exteriorization phenomena all of which are quite easily demonstrated i actually constructed meter once that could measure and prove thetan to have an electrical field around himindependent of energy ridges bodies and such combinations as thatwhat happens to man when he dies basically all that happens is that separation occurs between the thetan and the body however he takes old facsimiles energy phenomena and bricabrac that he feels he cannot do without with him and attaches this to the next body he picks up he does not build body in this lazy time of manufactured items and frigidaires and so on he picks one up off the genetic line and the genetic line is series of mockedup automaticities which produce according to certain blueprint from the earliest times of life on this planet through until now everybodypeople even in biology know that there is definite succession of steps that life takes today as they announce in their theory of natural selection and evolution we understand it rather thoroughly that something goes through these steps there is the cycle of action in scientology which is create survive persist destroy at the shoulder of the curve an individual is mostly interested in surviving early on the curve he is interested in creating and at the end of the curve he is interested in the disposition of the remains when we apply this cycle of action to the various parts i described we get death of the body partial death of the mind and forgettingness on the part of the spiritual being which is in itself again type of death actually bodies stay around for quite while after death since it takes some time for them to decomposecertain parts before other partsand the cells in the cuticle and hair evidently live longest the first thing one learns about death is that it is not anything of which to be very frightened if you are frightened of losing your pocketbook your money your memory boy or girl friend well thats how frightened you ought to be of dying because its all the same order of magnitude here we strike the first observable phenomenon when we find out that the mind in spite of mechanisms which seek to decay and wipe it out does maintain and preserve mentalimage pictures of earlier experiences with the proper technology and an understanding of this one can be again in possession of the mentalimage pictures of earlier existences in order to understand what was going on in view of the fact that we have not restored remembrance to the being the mentalimage pictures usually just continue to be pictures we send somebody into past life and he looks at mental image picture and you might as well have sent him to the art gallery he himself has connection with this because the mentalimage picture may be the minds or the bodys the body carries around mentalimage pictures and the thetan does the same and these two combine to form the mind the mind then is bridge between the spirit and the body and the mentalimage pictures formed by thetan added to and confused with the mentalimage pictures formed by the body is usually how thetan stays in head he confuses the two and therefore demonstration of past existences by running somebody back down on the time track and having him look at picture is not very convincing he has always had some unreality about it has recognition of having ever been anything else before the restoration of memory to one of these beings is of great interest to us since all that is really wrong with him is that things have happened to him which he knows all about but wont let himself in on therefore the restoration of memory is done as matter of course in almost any processing and in view of the fact that it is part of any processing it is impossible today to process somebody well and expertly without having him sooner or later get some sort of recall on past existence with some small reality an individuals own will has great deal to do with this one should not look for outside sources as to why his memory is shut off just as he must grant permission to be trapped so must he grant permission to be made to remember he is more or less convinced that memory would cause him to reexperience the pain he already feels has been too much for him he is very reluctant to face up again to this mechanism and facing death he almost always goes into bit of amnesiathe fact that one has lived before is so restrained that it itself is the reason why it is forgotten the unpopularity of it in other ages and this one brought about forgetter mechanism which causes an occlusion on the subject of death the fact that one cannot talk about it is enough all by itself to continue to cause the forgetter mechanism way to plot this would be to ask somebody as an auditing question to whom can you tell the fact that you have been dead it works something like this tell the one person in the world who does not believe that you are insane it has fantastically cataclysmic effect upon person he sort of believes he is going wog and spinning and so forth and when you ask him that question you have broken the agreement chain you could ask similar question tell one person in the world who believes you live more than once and you would get similar reaction i have plumbed into this subject very deeply with lie detectors and emeters checking up with grownups and children from all walks of life you can with the aid of one of these meters put person in such an incident there is peculiar behavior of the needle it is little hunt of the needle and it just hunts back and forth over small area quite frantically it indicates that person is still sitting in one of these exteriorization incidents we know great deal about havingness and that if person suddenly ran out of havingness he would die and we would expect so much loss of his possessions and so forth to wipe him out it doesnt wipe him out this is what ordinarily occurs he backs out at the moment of death with full memory at that moment he knows who he is where he has been and so forth youd expect total occlusion but it does not occur at this point it is not true that thetan in excellent condition gets some distance from the body and then doesnt care about it any more that is simply phenomenon of havingness when we first found that we thought this was always the case but we were striking at thetans ordinarily low on the tone scale those who forget about it immediately and do not care have actually gone into the subzero tone scale in support of this you can pick up on the track times when fellow backed out of his head and was mad and just kicked the stuffing out of the person who killed him at certain level person who had to have tremendously would get just so far from body and say well i dont care ive had very unhappy time during that life and im awfully glad i dont care but that person was so little alive when he was alive that his aliveness after he has died is also negligible person little higher up when somebody knocks off his body would have an interesting reaction to this ill show them they cant put out of the game and hell dive halfway across the country see maternity hospital and grab the body of baby somebody higher than this would not have been in contact with bodies in the first place we get very fascinating exteriorization here because it is totally cognizant the person knows who he is and usually has very good perception he knows where his friends are and for somebody to come around and point out this fantastic spiritual phenomena that somebody has appeared to them after he had died several thousand miles away is something like being terribly surprised because waitress came to the table in restaurant if person is killed with sudden violence and he is very surprised about the whole thing he is sufficiently upset and unphilosophical about it that he is liable to go around and see his next of kin and the rest of his friends in an awful frenzied hurry trying to reassure himself that he hasnt gone to purgatory purgatory and hell is total myth an invention just to make people very unhappy and is vicious lie he has suffered the loss of mass that is just about the frame of mind the thetan is usually in when he finds his body dead if he is below 20 on the tone scale his major thought is to get another body this he can do by finding young child that he could bring back to life thetans are very good at this but the ordinary entrance is some time around what we call the assumption and the assumption occurs within few minutes after birth in most cases that is the usual procedure but the thetan can hang around for some timetheyll hang around people theyll see somebody who is pregnant and they will follow them down the street theyll hang around the entrance to an accident ward and find somebodysome bodythat is all banged up and pick up this body and pretend to be somebody elses husband or something of the sort it isnt necessarily true that all of this is taped measured i am telling you what is standard about this behavior and what is not it is case of how fast you can pick up body before somebody else gets it so there is certain anxiety connected with this thetans often say very interesting prayers at the moment they pick up body they dedicate themselves to its continued growing and they are so pleased with the whole thing that they dedicate themselves to the family and go through all kinds of odd rituals of one kind or another the odd part of it is they dont shut their memory off until they pick up another new body and the shutoff of memory actually occurs with the pickup of the new body there is phenomena series known as the betweenlives series and people have some sort of thing mocked up whereby somebody goes back through betweenlives area this can be plotted it is not unusual but it is certainly not constant until thirteen or fourteen hundred the betweenlives area operations werent thriving at all then they started to pick it up more and more they had to knock witchcraft totally out of europe before the betweenlives area clubs started thriving they had to knock out any idea about demons and spirits in other words they had to make one feel guilty for hanging around and admiring the trees with body to look through they succeeded in doing this you can make little child sick by just talking to him about this sort of thing by mentioning ghosts and spirits and how bad they are and how fearful they are he gets upset because 1 you are restimulating times when he exteriorized and 2 you are invalidating him and throwing him down tone like mad he is ghost spirit demon he is all these bad things they have mocked up in view of the fact that two exteriorizations take place it could get very complicated as one looked at it because the ge exteriorizes i dont know much about that except that there is something that mocks up bodies that we call the genetic entity and it skips from life to life in other words even body doesnt live only once it is so obvious once you look at it that if body lived only once it would never have learned how the intricacy of body itself is something that is developed over long period of time when you realize that you have the capability of endowing things with life then we dont even know that the genetic entity is alive it might just be machinery or computation of one kind or another that goes on and that you continue to endow with life to some degree until you separate from it another interesting phenomenon about death is that thetan will stay around body until it is disposed of properly you can take an emeter and any preclear and you can find times when he has been left out on cliff and nobody even put lid on the coffin and there it was exposed to the wind and rain and he will stay around there until that body is totally dust bodies left out in the open decompose bodies buried in the ground go to pieces in hurry the rate of decay of body is not really point in question except that thetan will try to accelerate it if the body isnt cared for thetan doesnt much care concerning the actual disposition of the body as long as it isnt given any more indignity than it suffered in the lifetime he is apt to be very upset about indignities rendered to dead body even while he is in body alive when the body is apparently alive and he is taking one around he gets upset if he is in any shape at all about bodies being abused and mistreated much lower on the scale he is still upset about indignities to dead bodies and dead things he associates the body with his own identity to the degree that every time an indignity is rendered to the body he thinks it is to some degree being rendered to him therefore he hangs around body until it is properly disposed of when people make wills in which they declare acertain disposition of the body it is very wise thing to do if you want him to live happy life elsewhere to carry out those wishes because that is his idea of what proper care is the egyptians had the idea of living forever and so they wanted their bodies to live forever but dont think that thetan hung around just because his body had been mummified as far as he was concerned he was on some other genetic line and he would not particularly be upset about his body if it had been hauled out of tomb and been put up in the metropolitan museum he already would have been too far away from it to worry about it one very worrisome case was that of thetan whose skull was used by carnival who put motor in the jaws to make them keep on opening and the thetan just couldnt take it i actually had to unwrap preclear from that particular skull he still had finger on it even though he had another body people actually become curators of museums just to keep finger on body they might have once had mary sue is the sweetest tempered girl you ever saw we went into the british museum saw whole bunch of jewels lying there and she went completely 15 she just got so mad that even i couldnt talk her out of it finally i took her home put her on an emeter and her total conviction was they were still safe in tomb someplace every once in while some fellow will go into some area and go completely berserk and not know quite what is wrong with him well he probably got killed there or something of that nature the subject of death is never very serious one to scientologist beyond the fact that he feels kind of sorry for himself sometimes there was somebody of such terrific elan who made him real happy and this person was thoughtless enough to dispose of the mockup and go out of communication and the scientologist feels unhappy about it for it is thoughtless thing for friend to do this by the way is very early concept of death you now more or less progress back to death as it was regarded very early on this particular track in this universe people didnt regard it very seriously death is in itself technical subject you can with considerable confidence reassure some husband whose wife is dying or has just died that she got out all right and she is going someplace else to pick up mockup if you got there while the person could still talk still communicate with you mestwise in the last moments they usually have something spotted something planned now sometimes thetan gets so furious that he gets hallucinatory he goes around killing all his enemies in all directions and they dont even exist motto have your reality in good condition before you die there are many processes which exteriorize people and give them high reality on this amongst those processes the key process that produces the phenomena without any great shock is old stop change and startit produces exteriorization rather easily thetans do not become body cells walls and can get out of any trap they are in but sometimes it is better to be in trap than nowhere and that is true of most people thetan very often carries with him theta body which he mocked up on the past track and which is number of facsimiles of old bodies he has misowned and is carrying along with him as control mechanisms which he uses to control the body he is using he eventually develops quite heavy thick automaticcontrol theta body they are quite interesting many have electronic claws and all sorts of things usually the theta body structure has an electronic beam that goes down each of the fingers and he opens and closes his hand with beams this is going off into structure but he sometimes pulls out this theta body complete and simply takes it alonglosing your pocketbook some treasured possession or your body are all alike and because of the forgetter mechanism great mystery is made out of this but that is death phenomena of and i hope sometime or another you may have use for this whatsoever l ron hubbardhubbard

_____________________________________________________________________ 1 march 1958 the scale of withhold edited from l ron hubbards 17th lecture to the 18th american advanced clinical course in washington dc on 6 august 1957 cch 9 tone 40 keep it from going away is withhold process we know it to have considerable workability the road to solids toleration of solids lies through withhold only we never had straight wire version on this before or anything that clipped it directly and immediately but we have it here with tone 40 keep it from going away cch 9 proves that we are dealing with the automaticity which goes as follows everything that comes along is used by thetan to keep things from going away he gets cannonball in the stomach and says ah that moment of impact kept the body from going away so ill make picture of the impacthence the necessity for picturesand have it keep the body from going away from here on out that is why people hang on to impact engrams it is fear of lossfear that they will lose body they do other things they fill the atmosphere around the body with machinery so that other thetans will be afraid to come into it and take it over take it away keeping things from going away is basic mechanism which guards against loss as you know the mind runs on gradient scale from thought through effort to solids actually the mind is already graphed on the tone scale that is the gradient scale of approach between something that is nothing and total solids at the other end it isnt that the person himself becomes total solid but his approach to solids is on gradient scale through less solids and misemotions and plain emotions and energies like aesthetics to just thought when an individual gets hold of something like cannonball in the stomach he says that certainly got there in hurry that i can directly handle because it handled so well he keeps things from going away he guards against loss with impacts he also does other things with impacts he uses them as control mechanisms it would not be put beyond thetan to take cannonball engram on the right to move his body to the left and vice versa it is handy and requires effort he just puts slight thought into the line and says move to the right the cannonball goes into restimulation and he moves over to the right this could be good system he uses these keepitfromgoingaways as control in other words he lets the body be shoved around by things and he keeps those things there and thus he can control the body rather easilybut he deteriorates at the same time an individual can also very easily take cannonball engram and hang it on somebody elses head to make him bow very often you start to audit preclear and you find out that youare auditing stomach out of his right arm or head off his left foot this is the interchange of facsimiles and thetans do use facsimiles on others way back on the track there is thing called the engram police it is quite amusing to get thetan into some kind of condition where he can be policedto be confined for thirty days in the space opera trap facsimiles have use and then they have the lovely attraction of also being mass fellow who keeps money for its own sake is the type of person who would keep facsimiles for their own sake you as an auditor start to look for the significance of why this preclear has this thing stuck in front of his face and you may find that he is merely keeping it for its own sake facsimiles either keep you where you are or the body where it is they are control mechanisms sometimes thetan will get series of engrams all hooked togethershoulder with an arrow stomach with crossbow through it leg with spear in it and few slinging stones that are back of the left eye that is nice combination and moves the body rapidly you start to shift the engram little and the body jumps and you move this at somebody else and he jumps as well the service facsimile is series of facsimiles which you call facsimile which can be applied to the control of others very nicely but after the individual has been on the track for few billion years using one of these combinations he sooner or later flops if an individual is to have anything to do with facsimiles he is going to be somewhere between solids and thought by gradient scales of concatenation and by lots of postulates about association which gets into identification finally this scale can become relatively solid he can think thought and turn on the solid at the other end of the scale we look this over and we see that the movement and the motionlessness of people can easily be handled by facsimile patterns throwing things away or dispensing with them is much inferior to holding on to them i near killed some preclears trying to find this out which side of the reachand withdraw mechanism is the one which can be audited i have found that the reach one is good and high tonednot games condition activity that is communication unless you have an opponent situation you would certainly run reach in view of the fact that everybody has some games condition on almost everything we can run withdraw and withdraw is the side we can run rather endlessly by withdraw we mean withdraw something from because this builds up and increases havingness withdraw it from or hold to yourself the object holds good anywhere up to couple of hundred hours of processing man will communicate outward to the degree that he can hold inward and the monitoring thing is the hold inward every time psycho comes into the foundation we find that they cannot separate anything from them i used to try to process them on getting them to throw away single scrap of paper and with very good results that is an extreme case of hold hold in to self and withdraw it from others you will find out that as person heads on down the scale it gets that badbut what complicates it is that it has inversions and right above this clutch it to the chest this tight would be an inversion of throw it away which one solved itthe throw it away or the clutch people cannot throw away ad infinitum they run out of havingness we are really only concerned with persons holdingness to himself that gives us an engram bank puts the bank in restimulation and upsets things endlesslynow hold it in solves both hold it in and throw it away an individuals communication is raised by holding things in here is nothing that couldnt duplicate any mass busy holding mass in to himself he comes to harm because of it his abilities go to pieces and his penalties and that sort of thing all accumulate on him everything thetan has done wrong he carries around in little pictures to remind himself how guilty he is it is probably the result of number of considerations peculiar only to this universe we have to increase thetans ability to hold when this ability to hold is emphatically good and he himself can do it he will abandon all these cannonballs in the stomach in other words he abandons all this lower scale automaticity of having things held for him holding on to when it becomes automatic goes out and beyond ones power of choice which automatically can start by power of choice but after that it has to violate it all the way to be automatic one doesnt stop an automaticity an automaticity when and if it stops wears out if we have everything holding on to things for us such as gravity body holding on to you and all kinds of things holding on for us we eventually get to frame of mind where we feel we are being totally cared for but at the same time we dont dare reject anything because it might be some of our holdonto mechanism and thetan doesnt reject for thetan to reacquire the ability to hold on to things is not necessarily the same as thetan having to destroy all automaticities automaticities quite incidentally fold up when the thetan starts to reacquire the powers and abilities contained in an automaticity we do not take over automaticities to destroy automaticities we take over automaticities only to rehabilitate the ability of thetan we just take them over because they are robbing the thetan of his ability to perform the inflow principle of the universe is being used to hold on to things rather than the thetans ability to hold on to them power is contained in the ability to maintain position in space if you cant maintain position in space you will never have any power if everything is holding things in to you they will eventually start moving you around and the moment this happens you longer have power an individuals ability to withhold his ability to hold and his ability to keep something from going away are part and parcel of his ability to maintain his own position situation or location some people start confronting and immediately fly out of their heads eventually they get so that they can sit there and confront and hold their position this is necessary point in confronting you have to be able to hold the position in the face of something higher than this or lower down since it goes either way we realize that to keep something from going away is sort of confrontingness keeping things from going away is an ability which gradually cultivates the ability of the thetan to remain where he is if you can keep wall from going away the ability to hold still in general is regained one then is able to confront things and can then recognize solids first you have to acquire this ability to keep things from going away then finally discover that you yourself can be stationarywhich gives you the idea of confrontingand as soon as you are willing to confront then you can make things more solid and that is why these three processes cch 9 10 and 11 are run in this manner the solids and the solidity that you are willing to confront have an awful lot to do with your ability to hold still or hold things still and your ability to hold things still has lot to do with your ability to keep things from going away but here is basic ability in the keeping of secretbeing able to withhold things from others we have whole span of keeping things from going away all of which simply begin with the withheld thought which is what secret is and it scales on further to withheld objectwhen an individual has regained his ability to keep certain things from going away he could then start in on the basis of holding things still but he will never hold himself still for the excellent reason that he isnt there to be held still he can only suppose he is in place and this depends upon his ability to hold other things still now keep it from going away solves both outflow and inflow hold it still solves motion and motion we have motion and motion and you really dont solve motion with motion you solve motion with hold stillness and the ability to confront and confound solids solves alike something and nothing to be able to confront solid then makes person capable of confronting nothing here we have six items and their gradient scale the first two of these items are pair called reach and withdraw or throw it away and hold it to you and that bracket is solved only by running keep it from going away the next one up is motion and motionaction and stillnessand those are solved by running hold it still the last bracket we have somebody who is terribly fascinated with vaporous nothingness to solve nothingness we run solids the person will graduate rather rapidly up to being able to confront nothing if we run solids but we dont run nothingsconceiving statics we run solids and what we do is pick him out of those places where he is totally convinced of solids and you walk him back to the world of thought the gradient scale goes from nothing through emotions through effort and facsimiles into solids and you get him back up to where he can handle it on the effort band and up above into thought these processes can be run by formal auditing and are not necessarily tone 40 if you have

_____________________________________________________________________ 15 march 1958 report on two cases that have received psychiatric and eurorussian therapy from the government recently two cases came to the attention of the hgc which had received former mental therapy of the eurorussian variety one of these 32yearold shipworker had been four years in prison for having committed crime of violence the other was 46yearold man who had received dishonorable discharge from the army both cases were picked up at random from the general run of workers it was found that both had received mental treatment the first had been given considerable attention in prison from clinical psychologists the second had had psychiatric interviews in the army neither case had been in any way improved both had been antagonized the first committed grand theft after release from prison and was in sense safe factor in society the other case even though courtmartialed and discharged for drunkenness was still getting drunk and losing jobs these two cases had one thing in commonthey had been made contemptuous of mental treatments they had to be forced into session due to their former experiences both were improved by processing and could have been completed as cases as soon as this was established they were let go as this was all that we cared to discover we can assume that eurorussian mental treatment is liability in that it destroys any faintest hope of recovery we can also notice that money spent by the prison and the army was wasted it is noticeable that neither the prison nor the army paid any attention to public safety in these cases two men were released in worsened state and permitted to victimize the public thus all measures taken were apparently detrimental to public wellbeing we can further notice that our task in scientology is being made harder by the presence and practice of eurorussian psychotherapy and the handling of criminals in government areasa time has come for reform of these matters the correction of prison and army systems of punishment and the introduction of mental methods which do not make cases less approachable are both needful in national disaster the presence of large number of criminals and insane in our midst unreformed and loosed upon us could well mean the fact that gives us defeat the time to start is now not when man brings chaos to the

cancel the need for training l ron hubbard to answer the important question does clearing cancel training all you need to do as an auditor is clear someone without training him and then say to him all right go out and clear people youll get blank stare why because auditing skill is discipline in living and knowhow of the parts of life which is in itself something new in the universe even ots dont have auditing skill since there have never been any auditors behind them there is such thing as learning there are such things as data the fact is that cleared zulu is cleared zulu cleared advertising man is cleared advertising man cleared zulu is not cleared advertising man now zulu uncleared has scant chance of becoming an advertising man but cleared zulu would probably be able to become one rapidly and theres the difference being clear gives one the potential of being and makes the being rather easy and fun further being cleared makes it possible to continue to be something theres nothing wrong with being clear person ought to be the state is so valuable several hundreds of millions of people in the past 2500 years have concentrated on nothing else but how about getting clear and staying clear forever the auditor alone with his data well learned could manage that remember you were clear oncetrillions of years ago why didnt you stay that way because the traps were well designed and you had anatomy of traps well scientology does have the anatomy of the traps the axioms the discipline and knowhow necessary to handle and control the laws of the universe scientology is the data necessary to liveif everyone were now to concentrate only on how to get clear and forget all about how to stay clear wed be back in the soup in century oddly enough the best time to study auditing is when youre aberratedwhen the thing looks impossible when you can achieve subjective reality on the grimness of it the best things person can do are to 1 get trained and 2 get cleared auditors will always be senior to clears always that became very obvious in the 19th acc people who werent clear created clears if person gets cleared first he can of course learn very rapidly how to be good scientologist if he is to be very good being he will be both good auditor and clear that combination cannot be beaten if we had only clears and auditors wed have another slump ahead scientology is not in the experience of anyones back track it is itself it is the one thing senior to life because it handles all factors of life scientology could not have happened earlier because there was not enough livingness to study we have arrived near bottom there are people getting cleared now all over the world just remember that you share the agreement of the society in which you live youll have to be able to audit to skillfully handle aberrated persons and it will take lot of auditors to have cleared society right now its all right to keep your eye on that first dynamic and get clear you should but when suddenly you find youve achieved clear remember when i tell you this one thing there are eight dynamics you cannot stay clear unless you solve things by the equation of the optimum solution the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics failing to so solve things dug you in to where you were in the first place scientology got you out stay out by knowing scientology well i look forward to seeing your bright smiling face clear or not in the academy or an acc or both in dc or london new zealand australia south africa clear world to be needs you as good and skilled scientologist and thats how youre going to help okay l ron hubbard ps when i solve case i always ask the pc for one unnamed favor ive never called these favors in the favor i tell you now

research writings and taped lectures of l ron hubbard the following series of pabs are devoted to an elucidation of procedure cch and should by means be taken as complete exposition of that procedure this course of information will be fully covered in the newly completed but as yet unpublished basic handbook for all auditors the student manual by l ron hubbard which is the most comprehensive book ever issued from the pen of lrh on auditing procedure and all that scientologist should know about how to audit and practice further the numbers of the cchs dont necessarily agree with the student manual except from cch0 to 5 since these pabs are based on workable procedure called procedure cch long form given by lrh to the hgc staff auditors here in washington dc in 1957 cch zero cch 0 is firstly establishing the rudiments of the session discussing the goals of the preclear for the intensivealso established at the beginning of each separate sessionhandling the present time problem and clearing the auditor for the preclear the latter has become very important in modern auditing one establishes the session by calling the preclears attention to the room the auditing environment to let him know that he has arrived for session this can be done by light locational processing at this point one doesnt have to belabor the rudiments following this there is discussion of the preclears goals for the session and intensive and making sure that these goals are not wild or completely outside the preclears reality he may for instance want to be an operating thetan while hiding in mystery and he will thus not achieve that goal unless he has full reality on it in other words the auditor makes sure that the goals which the preclear has set for himself are goals which the preclear can work towards and attain without much difficulty the auditor then defines for himselfbut does not inform the preclear ofhis own goals and intentions for this session so that he does not grope blindly with techniques without knowing which way and why he is guiding the preclear often auditors work in the dark without setting goals for themselves toward which to guide the preclear best of all is when the auditor can align the preclears and his own goals for the intensive after this the auditor must inquire if the preclear has any pressing present time problem which needs immediate attention it is fairly safe to say that every preclear on earth today has present time problem the more the preclear has the easier they can be handled if the problem is not pressing and will not interfere with the processing then the auditor can continue furthershould there be scarcity of problems the preclear will hold on to and dramatize that problem and the situation has to be remedied either with problems of comparable or incomparable magnitude or by locational processing lot here depends upon auditor judgment of the case and it is of course best to have preclears tested at the london or washington academies to aid the auditor but should the preclear be too low to handle the present time problem the auditor should only run locational processing to bring the preclear up to present time preclears who are very low toned do not even vaguely have their thinkingness under control and to run problems would be waste of time since many preclears do not know much about their condition or what they are working towards lrh has found very good way to clear this matter this process is rudiment called clear the auditor and known as help it is surprising after running this process for an hour or so to find that many preclears do not believe that they can be helped by anybody and are unclear as to what the auditor can do for them this is the best way of clearing the auditor and making the fact that they can be helped to help themselves clear to them the commands for this process are as follows could i help you how could you help how can i help anybody else who how could you help anybody else who how do other people ever help other people how do men ever help women how and the auditor just does this on big long bracket of course it is necessary to see that the preclear does not give machine answers and that he is fairly sure that this can be done twoway communication here is important and lot of it could be used this process becomes fantastic way of dealing with the preclear and is valuable in many ways for example you can take father and mother valences which are usually aberrative and run them on help in brackets running help is necessary on case that is hung up because the only reason he is sitting there is to waste help you can run such case on any process matter how excellent on basis of wasting help until the case simply cannot find enough ways to waste help and he goes down the tone scale one has to understand that the case which isnt changing is trying to waste help it isnt case of finding the auditor in the rudiments nowadays but of clearing the auditor the only point on which he can be cleared is help can i help you or can you help and asking how each time to keep the command real to the preclear and applicable conditional answers are accepted and the preclear has to find real answers the whole purpose of cch 0 to quote from the student manual is to make known the beginning of session to preclear and the auditor so that error as to its beginning is made to put the preclear in condition to be audited cch 1 cch 1 is known as give that hand and is one of the most effective entrances to cases yet devised apart from having great beneficial effects it is also used as rudiment forexample soon the preclear finds that there is mass sitting in front of him the body of the auditor and that he is occupying mass in the chairand thus the environment takes on more real shape to illustrate this better here is brief description from an lrh lecture to the washington dc hgc staff auditors most preclears are completely unaware of their own body or that of the auditor gmth brings the preclear back onto the scale of reality which runs this way from the top of scale down postulates agreements solids masses terminals communication lines but terminals which dwindles into confused and complex communication lines and eventually into linesand youve got mystery applying the scale of reality to gmth you have preclear who is in mystery you take his hand often enough with an acknowledgment thank you at the execution of the command and he slowly through some dopeoff becomes aware of solid line of communicationyour arm grasping his hand to his armand that becomes more solid until he goes through the complexities and confusions of communication lines and gets them straight enough to recognize solid terminal sitting in front of him the auditors body sitting there mass terminal he thus gets into communication with solid terminal as he comes upscale he does not have to use solid comm lines to communicate but can do so by agreements symbols words and higher upscale just by postulate as opening procedure by duplication demonstrated the accuracy of the know to mystery scale so give that hand proves the accuracy of the subzero tone scale and the reality scale preclears will go into dopeoff and state of confusion engrams will fly off as the complexities and confusions of comm lines fade into where his and your hands will become real to him he will most likely recognize you as the first real terminal he has ever had this is tone 40 process tone 40 has been defined as giving command and just knowing that it will be executed despite any contrary appearances this is not the 18th acc definition in other words tone 40 is positive postulating the student manual has the following to say about the procedure and the running of this unique process physical action of taking hand when not given and then replacing it in the preclears lap and thank you ending the cycle it is tone 40 with clear intention one command in one unit of time originations of preclear acknowledged in any way verbally or physically however one can freeze the process after cycle of action has been completed if one is sure that something is occurring which needs further fishing for cognition this is the first step to the control of the preclears body which is the basic element of controlch cch we first have to bring the preclears body under your and then his control before we can attempt to bring his attention or thinkingness under control and processing follows that basic pattern all the timecontrol of body attention and thinkingness this is very precise process being tone 40 and tone 40 demands accurate precision into which one has to be trained to be efficient further information will be found in the student manual which will be published shortly or in the validation courses run in washington london or by gold seal certificate holders as last note on this process there is negative side to this if your preclear is withholding communication from you and it simply runs in smooth tone 40 as follows dont give that hand thank you the preclear will get frantic after while and want to give you his hand by telling him to withhold his hand and acknowledging it so that he receives the acknowledgment you are telling him to do what he has been doing all his life and consequently ruin that mechanism which has been withholding all the while when you take over the automaticityhubbard communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 2 april 1958 arc in comm course there are two types of auditing both include control they are called formal auditing and tone 40 auditing the first is control by arc the second is control by direct tone 40 command the first control by arc is taught in comm course the second control by tone 40 is taught in upper indoc the two are never mixed in teaching tone 40 is never taught in comm course and is not even permitted arc is not taught in upper indoc the most widespread weakness in auditors prior to this date is an inability to use step one of clear procedure participation by the pc this is only good arc in the training drills of comm course auditors are now too prone to let cch ob help do the work auditors fail to make the pc feel they are interested in the pc when they handle him with poor arc we care nothing about arc in upper indoc we want command we want tone 40 we do not even handle pc origins in upper indoc students must understand that there are two types of auditing they should realize that tone 40 is for the unconscious the psycho the noncommunicative the electric shock case pc the student should realize that arc formal auditing is not chatty or yapyap but it is itself it has warmth humanity understanding and interest in it academy dir of tr comm course and upper indoc instructors should keep this in their hats as needful technical data since we must turn out auditors capable of handling pcs with arc lrh lrhbtcden copyright 1958 by l ron hubbard all

others only support these two and make it possible to run these two these processes are 1 help cch ob 2 step 6 mockups keep it from going away hold it still make it more solid first in auditing we have to get pc to sit there and be willing to be audited we have for this many processes best is tr 5 you make that body sit in that chair thank you next we are continually confronted with keeping pc in session this is done with good arc process can supplant good auditor arc pc must know auditor is interested in him this does not mean auditor does not control pc or let him gabble but it does mean that pc and auditor have arc the next condition which must be met is the eradication of present time problems this is done by what part of that problem could you be responsible for psychosomatics may come under head of pt problem one runs hellos and okays on the terminal to improve reality on it say hello to that body parthave it say okay to you have it say hello to you you say okay to it one can also run what part of that body part can you be responsible for one can also have pc mock up unknown body part one can also clear help on that body part as psychosomatic is concentration of attention it fulfills the condition of pt problem which is any worry that keeps pc out of session which worry must exist in present time in the real universe one can run all of these on resistant psychosomatic one should clear help on objects and terminals connected with the pcs job one should clear help on the terminals of the various dynamics with an emeter needle nul and free on help one can go to step 6 this doesnt mean that one should not later return to help it may be step 6 must be approached with scs and connectedness the needle will tell heavily stuck needle is worse than wildly surging one connectedness clears stuck needles step 6 can be run just as in the book clear procedure see page 172 if it is too tough for pc run help and responsibility on pictures then complete step 6 with great thoroughness rising scale processing modern version is very good however even though it works low scale it is in reality an ot process not clear process rising scale can be run on any consideration the basic is get the idea it is impossible to reach anything now postulate that you can reach everything there is fancier version there are other buttons besides reach the basic command is get the idea negative postulate the positivethis is clearing it works as well as one directly approaches the task of clearing with the above but clearing cannot happen in the presence of 1 present time problem not flat 2 poor auditorpc arc 3 putting the pc at the effect end of life in or out of session during an intensive 4 detouring into contributory processes in the belief they will clear rather

dichotomy maxine kozak suggests that duplication is admiration from this i looked over critical on the apa oca profile and saw that the low critical might be influenced by op pro by dup test should be made of this the other process is less nebulous in action the specific for bad memory is forgetting run in brackets you will ordinarily find an automaticity of forgetting when you ask recall something you wouldnt mind other people forgetting this is bad memory nothing like good conscience to retain good memory the commands of forgetting would be 6way bracket recall or think of something you wouldnt mind 1 forgetting yourself 2 another person forgetting 3 forgetting about another 4 another forgetting about you 5 other people forgetting 6 another person forgetting about another person each command is cleared the commands are run in sequence rather than repetition this is low scale process goes lower than not know but graduates into it this is basic on unknowns and fields of whatever kind l ron

relatively flat on an auditor or instructor he may run it on hgc pcs and teach it as part of curriculum to students but it must be somewhat flat on auditors and instructors before use or taught publicly the command is repetitive command it is used with some 2way comm to punch cognitions the name of the process is enforced nothingness number cch 88 the command is mock up some people who made you want to make nothing of things this increases havingness all the way the person the auditor wants mocked up will be invisible to the pc and pc should keep on trying to mock the person up eyes open until he can do so i developed this process to vanquish fields and thus speed clearing it belongs anywhere prior to step 6 of clear procedure in creative processing we knew good results were achieved when we used gradient scale to get the pc to improve an ability to mock up someone the above command gives the reason this was necessary considerable relief and calmness follows run on this process high critical is cured by this process failure to help is the basis of the collapse of desire to make nothing of things and the process therefore ranks in importance near to help subjective reality on the process is necessary for skilled use the process can in pinch be selfaudited by reading the command off sheet the process is unlimited i think i have discovered in enforced nothingness direct route to bringing any pc who is under some control up to the ability to conceive static and therefore the key to all exteriorization havingness and perception the process cures colds tiredness and

hubbard via hubbard communications office 3537 fitzroy street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 15 april 1958 procedure cch continued compiled from the research writings and taped lectures of l ron hubbard cch 2 cch 2 is tone 40 8c which has the following commands with that bodys eyes look at that wall thank you walk that body over to that wall thank you with that right hand touch that wall thank you turn that body around thank you one doesnt acknowledge any of the preclears originations and can only freeze the command after cycle of action has been completed as with all tone 40 processes this is precision process and needs validation training for execution on an optimum level the intention or goal of this process is to bring the preclears body further under control and to insure that he does precisely what you tell him to do and it is basic step for getting his thinkingness under your command as well by showing the preclear you can control his body you are actually inviting him to control it and to take some responsibility for it dont be surprised if the preclear exteriorizes quickly on this technique by taking control of the body he will go in and out of it and eventually feel that the best way to handle it is from few feet behind his head as an auditor one must beware of notising this phenomenon and should communicate about it when one freezes the session and make sure that the preclear understands this and that it is to be expected this is an ambulatory process and the auditor should be next to or with his preclear at all times during the running of this technique dont avoid this process or not administer enough since 8c tone 40 or otherwise has been stable processing datum for over three years and will continue to remain as such for considerable period of time cch 3 this is the process that produces some of those fantastic iq changes for it deals directly with the preclears learning rate and his ability to duplicate communications bringing up his nonlanguage factor in the iq has the effect of bringing the preclear into better control of his environment and into handling the people and objects in his immediate surroundings its purpose according to the student manual is to bring up preclears communication with control and duplication control duplication communicationbook mimicry as this process is called is run in the following manner auditor tells the preclear that he is going to make motion with the book and that he wants the preclear to duplicate the auditors motion mirrorimagewise he hands the book to the preclear and then waits for the preclear to execute that motion he acknowledges the execution of that command and then asks the preclear if he is satisfied that he duplicated that command if the preclear says he is satisfied and the auditor is sure he did not do it satisfactorily the auditor does the same command until the preclear and the auditor are both satisfied there is gradient scale of simplicities and complexities here one first starts with fairly simple commands graduating into complexities lrh found that straight lines and angles are simplicities whereas circles and arcs are complexities preclears who like complexities will be able to do the difficult ones with great ease while finding the simple motions burdensome one keeps on doing both until the preclear can do each with relative ease in order to do this process properly the preclear has to be in present time and that will unstick him from the rest points on the track and it has been noted by many auditors that engrams and valences turn on also lot of dopeoff and anaten which must naturally be run flat for the preclear who is in manic motion small very slow movements will cause panic and should be done until he can tolerate the nomotion with ease and vice versa one must be sure however to remember the commands one has given in case the preclear cannot execute them and one has to do it again also we are interested in giving our preclears only wins and one should work closely within that framework give the preclear only the commands on gradient scale towards difficulties that he can execute it does not mean that one cannot make it complex but one mustnt give impossible commands and so confuse and invalidate the certainty that he can duplicate communication between himself and another terminal this is not tone 40 process but the auditor does not talk until the motion he has made is executed unless the preclear has asised the command before he started the motion or finds himself unable to complete it since engrams do appear and odd sensations and somatics turn on communicate with the preclear about them but remember the intention of the process and do not go chasing after facsimiles cch 4 cch 4 is hand space mimicry and the purpose of this process as per the student manual is to develop reality on the auditor using the reality scale solid comm line and to get the preclear into communication by control duplication it is run as follows auditor and preclear sit straight opposite each other the auditor then raises his two hands with his palms facing the preclear and says put those hands against mine follow them and contribute to their motion he then makes simple motion with his right and then left hand and asks the preclear did you contribute to the motion good put those hands in your lap after this has been run flat increase the space between the palms of the auditors and preclears hands by half an inch when this is flat gradiently increase the space between the auditors and preclears palms until the preclear can follow the motion yards away there is lot of twoway communication during the running of this process and the auditor must allow the communication which is born from the duplication and control to come forth without restraining the preclears desires to do sothe distance factor here affinity in the communication formula will affect various preclears in different ways and it is of interest that the preclear will communicate lot about love and the second dynamic to the auditor which can then be viewed there seems to be certain distance factor here for each preclear and once the auditor moves out of it suddenly without that gradient increase in space the preclear will go out of communication with the auditor and the process should therefore be kept to small increases only the strained feeling in the preclears and sometimes auditors wrists is not tiredness as one may suppose but will disappear as he gets into communication with the auditor he will go through lot of anaten and dopeoff but should come out very bright and in present time and in much better shape than when the session started he will be able to communicate and recognize your body as solid terminal opposite his and will really find the auditor during the process if he has not done so already his reality level will increase to the point where he can communicate by agreement only and know that he is doing so see the last pab on the scale of reality this is not tone 40 process and should not be run as such cch 0 1 2 3 and 4 are the essential basics to the running of every case and where these are neglected where control in these facets has been neglected there will only be failure it is therefore remunerative in the long run to really flatten each process the workability of these processes is astonishing and is delight in the hands of validated auditor who has been coached on them himself if ever processes demanded that one knows how to run them these do for the untrained auditor might just confuse both himself and the preclear if he doesnt know what to expect and how to handle that which is sure to arise from such processes as cch one can run these processes over and over again run 0 1 2 and either 3 or 4 then back to cch iright hand through the other steps left hand through the other steps both hands and up again or instead of using give that hand the auditor can run dont give that hand right left and those hands and so forth somewhere along the line one of these processes is going to bite and then each and every one of them will do the same if nothing happens it means that there is threat to the preclears havingness and that the present time problem should be cleared while help is run again after which one of the four cchs should open up the preclears bank as an example here is case history from one of the washington hgc staff auditors preclear business man age 48 who had numerous pressing present time problems in the home environment his profile proved that he was totally unable to handle his numerous present time problems as his ability to communicate was on the very low minus side whats more his profile showed that he should really be threeweek preclear but was accepted on the understanding that since he couldnt possibly afford more time he would be given this week as an exception to the rule since he came very long way the hgc doesnt accept for processing 25hour case who really needs 75 hours lrh looked at this profile and suggested quite calmly to the auditor that cch steps 0 to 5 should do it the preclear was out of communication he did not volunteer any information and seemed to get nothing out of the first 712 hours when the first 5 steps were covered his present time problems were handled by locational processing since this preclear was withholding information the auditor ran him on dont give that hand which started biting slightly few minor somatics shot through various areas of his body and facsimiles darted in and out of his field but the preclear still felt that this meant nothing his critical level was high and he was making nothing out of the auditing but when the auditor arrived at hand space mimicry the preclear burst open for he couldnt tolerate the close contact with theauditor and volunteered information about second dynamic restimulation which blew the aberration out of the way and opened the case after that the preclear exteriorized with full visio and sonic when run on tone 40 8c felt that he could control both his body and his environment much more ably and with greater certainty as to what he was doing further up the line on control trio and trio the preclear ran each one of the six commands flat in approximately half an hour with cognitions ranging from the first to eighth dynamic each intimately related to his own life and livingness and the preclear is clear this preclear still has his present time problems at home but feels much more confident about handling them and the auditor reports that he is moving heaven and earth to return for the outstanding two weeks this might not have been possible on older technologies since the factor of control wasnt so neatly and exactly organized by lrh as it is now but the fact remains much against some peoples better wishes that one has to be coached into knowing through experience to fully comprehend the power of procedure cchhubbard communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 23 april 1958 to all training activities vital

chance believing in luck and irresponsibility needs direction if it cannot receive that direction from its elected leaders it is soon drowned in confusion this is particularly true of barbarian societies by barbarian we mean of course lacking in social graces nation may have huge machines projectiles of great violence and stoves that do all the cooking and yet be complete barbarism socially the activities of barbarism one against another are punishment revilement contest for first dynamic supremacy with thought of the rights of others the barbarism solves political problems with brutality crime with punishment and social ills with degradation it is fairly obvious then that the united states of americaand the western worldis barbarism wearing nylon shirts instead of bearskins lip rouge rather than tattoo tabu marks but subscribing to the code of hammurabi just the same the social code used identifies the barbarism and an eye for an eye is little better than law for the sake of sadism mere animalism you can know barbarism by its witch doctors its concept of the other mans mind in this society the mental witch doctor comfortably enfranchised by the apa believes sincerely man is an animal without soul or hope and following pavlov and other russian teachings that man works only for reward like any other dog these are the brands of barbarism hate is deified above love deterrent to an action is better than communication the delusion is more palatable than the truth if we place the govemment on our chart of human evaluation we find craven psychotic what

women and children what would you think of someone who solved all his problems with threats of violence youd be right such person would be insane just add up the characteristics of government today apply them as if done by anindividual and make up your mind governments are insane it is big thought and one necessary to digest if you are not going to go around all your life snarling impotently against government stupidity the insane arent always stupid but they are certainly insane of course you could define government as that body created by the aggregate irresponsibility of people the insane are irresponsible that is why they are insane if you lump all the irresponsibility in nation into one body you would then have an insane body thus the government temper now it is fact that help and destroy are opposite ends of the same string when person can longer help he seeks to destroy destroy is the same as help to psychiatrist total identification but more of this elsewhere it is enough here to demonstrate that if you try to help an insane body it responds by seeking to destroy you this is nothing to be afraid of since the ability to direct in an insane body is very poor thus the blows usually go awry one sees it in government when the police arrest and question the man who was attacked by thug the police forget the thug and arrest the innocent now all this comes about only when you have barbarism where the social training of each person is so poor as to amount to collective insanity to cure barbarism one must make men socially grow up and that is done with individuals one works with individual people not with groups we in scientology have done power of growing up and you both we are strong in that we have the ability to make other people grow up our target is the individual if we wish to increase the group level of responsibility to properly hit the target each of us needs to be 1 good example in our own case and 2 well trained and secure in our scientology skills all we really have to do to win is to get clear and clear others the while keeping on with the routine demands of life as startling as clearing is today as impressive as it is to learn scientology well at the academy yet these things can be done rather easily clear is now esoteric goal it can be reached in few weeks of highly skilled auditing getting to be an excellent auditor is must if one merely wishes to live but one dynamic isnt enough it takes all the dynamics to make freedom therefore to be clear is not enough to be cleared auditor and to handle and audit people is must if we wish to be totally free face it we live in barbarism the shiny cars are driven by degraded men you wont be free unless they are it has taken ten hard years to make clearing everyone an accomplished fact that i could do it was not enough that you could do it was part of the major plan my purpose is to bring barbarism out of the mud it thinks conceived it and to form here on earth civilization based on human understanding not violence thats big purpose broad field starhigh goal but i think its your purpose too best l ron hubbardhubbard communications office washington dc hco

hubbard via hubbard communications office 3537 fitzroy street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 1 may 1958 procedure cch continued compiled from the research writings and taped lectures of l ron hubbard cch 5 this is tone 40 locational processing and the purpose of this process is to bring the preclears attention under control and unfix it from the facsimiles which usually control his attention it is also most valuable process to run when the preclears communication is too poor to run the present time problems with problems of comparableincomparable magnitude it brings the preclear from the problem in which he is interiorized into recognition of the environment which gives him havingness and he can consequently unfix his attention from the problem it brings him into present timethe 6th dynamicand he can have mass again since this is tone 40 process the auditor does not acknowledge idle chatter from the preclear but should he say something the process may be frozen after few more commands have been executed and the auditor can discuss or fish the cognition the auditor must point to and clearly indicate the object which he wants the preclear to see and must make sure that his thank you stops the preclear from getting stuck on the object at which he looks the commands are with that bodys eyes notice that indicated object wall etc when the preclear has done so the auditor says thank you with such intention as to stop the cycle of action completely and to start new command in present time if the acknowledgment really reached the preclear he will immediately look away from the object at which he was looking and look at you smile and seem pleased incidentally the auditor points to both that body and that object while using this process in cch 0 the handling of the present time problem it can be used as either ordinary or tone 40 locational cch 6 to bring the preclears attention further and fully under control of the auditor opening procedure by duplication 1957 with the following commands is used auditor takes book and bottle placing them some distance apart on tables so that the preclear doesnt have to bend with that bodys eyes look at that book thank you walk that body over to that book thank you auditor each time with the commands points to that body and that book with that hand pick up that book thank you put that book down in exactly the same place thank you turn that body round thank you with that bodys eyes look at that bottle etcit is tone 40 process and should be run precisely making sure that the preclear does not anticipate or distort the command duplication control communication is formula which is well worth remembering during the running of all tone 40 processes this does not mean that if the preclear seems to be communicating he is for lot of his machinery will go into restimulation during this process and one must be able to differentiate between the preclears originations and those of his bank this being one of the most arduous processes in scientology should be run in one session until flat otherwise the preclear will be hung up at the point where the process was ended and it will unnecessarily retard the progress which procedure cch brings about these two processes when well run will bring the preclears attention under the direction of the auditor since duplication will straighten out all the vias and twists the preclear might have in receiving the exact intention of the command which originated from the auditor the auditor may then proceed to bring the preclears thinkingness under his control with cch 7 tone 40 8ckeep it from going away cch 8 tone 40 8chold it still and cch 9 tone 40 8cmake it little more solid which should be run as combo combination of processes one after the other until each one is flat as with most processes make sure that the command is cleared before embarked upon and then after while if the preclear doesnt cognite or have any facsimiles find out how and what he is doing for there might still be possibility that due to semantic difficulties he misunderstood the command and is really running another keep it from going away and hold it still apart from the fundamental value in cognitions are to exercise the preclears ability to control facsimilesto keep them from going away and to hold them still when he later is going to run then and now solids which demands just that preclears who have been involved in eastern teachings will cognite during running hold it still and find out lot about serenity and the eighth dynamic all the things which the preclear has been keeping from going away will come to view these are good exteriorizing processes refer to earlier pabs for further information regarding these processes make it little more solid is the first exercise in making mest and facsimiles little more solid and must be done before the preclear can progress to then and now solids his abilities to keep things from going away hold them still and make them little more solid must be thoroughly checked and rechecked and the auditor must be sure in his own mind that the preclear has acquired these abilities making things little more solid is just what it says the preclear does not have to make things very massive but he should be aware of an increase in the mass weight and density of the structure of that which he is making more solid this process will increase his reality on the prelogics and reverse the flow of solids it will remedy the preclears havingness and push him further up the scale of reality the commands for the three tone 40 8cs are with that bodys eyes look at that indicated object thank you walk that body over to that indicated object with those hands touch that indicated object thank you keep it from going away hold it still make it little more solid run each one flat individually since these are tone 40 processes precision of execution of commands is closely observed by the auditorthese processes include control of thinkingness of the preclear and therefore should be run with tremendous amount of auditor trust of the preclear and should not be run until the lower levels of cch are to some degree flat as they will give the preclear losses lrh from the student manual cch 12 and cch 13 cch 12 is known as limited subjective havingness the commands for this set of processes are what can you mock up preclear answers and the auditor says ok to the preclears answer and then tells him mock up whatever the preclear said he could mock up ok shove it into yourself run this flat then proceed in the same way except for then having the preclear let it remain where it is when this is flat enter on the third part which is throw it away have the preclear shove the mockups into himself and not the body remember it is have for the thetan and cant have for the body it is important here to remedy the havingness of the preclears bank before going on to then and now solids should the preclears field be black then run the following process until it clears up remedy the field with blackness have him mock it up let it remain and throw it away this preclear is holding on to blackness since he does not have enough blackness this is remedying the havingness with blackness of which he has scarcity if the preclears field is invisibility put glass objects of all sorts and sizes on table next to him and one after another have him keep it from going away until his field returns as with all other processes in scientology we are only interested in giving our preclears wins and it is therefore necessary to see that he completes each step successfully before continuing with the next process should none of these processes do what is required cch has not been properly applied and steps 0 to 5 should be run once more and the auditor can then run control trio which is being spoken about in later pab cch 13 is subjective solids and the first exercise to make things solid subjectively the commands for this process are what can you mock up which is asked every time one changes the type of mockups ok mock up whatever the preclear said he could mock up ok now make it little more solid when this is done the auditor checks with did you do it for preclears often say they have when they didnt execute the command start this on gradient scale as long as he makes only few atoms of the mockup little more solid the auditor should be satisfied the preclear here will break through effort on the know to mystery scale and as he proceeds use less and less effort until he just postulates the solidity it is most important to ask the preclear what he is doing how he is doing it to insure that he is doing it properly smoothness of auditing is essential one does not desire to break arc with the preclear but certain amount of policing is necessary and this is certainty process it is important that the preclear find the process real otherwise he is not under control and will not be able to do then and now solids to which all these other processes leadhubbard communications office 1812 19th street nw washington 9 dc hco bulletin of 2 may 1958 beingness again the best solution to valences is beingness processing help on valences is excellent even phenomenal and should not be ignored problems of comparable magnitude to selected person cannot be ignored but an understanding of valences gives us new look at processes in the first place valence is beingness bad crazy or superb valence is still beingness thetan has basic personality but if this is too thoroughly invalidated thetan assumes some invented valence and if this is invalidated he then eventually completes the dei scale on beingness the things wrong with thetan are the lower harmonics of the characteristics of thetan you could say carelessly that the only thing wrong with person is himself let us say more accurately that the only thing wrong with person is his abandonment of self and the assumption of other selves because there is self the assumption of selves is possible we find that the apa or oca is picture of self what self is another matter all selves other than true self are less honest and ethical since the thetan has poorer opinion of others than he does of himself in the basic state to change an apa or oca it is necessary to shift selves it is fascinating that theft of objects is really an effort to steal self objects represent selves to others thieves and what they steal cannot be understood by the logic of their material needs they steal tokens of selves and hope to assume thereby another self it is sometimes not amusing to to be missing my lecture notes or book from my shelf this is covert theft of beingness people sometimes get anxious to be mei know not why they wind up stealing my things the theft is irrational the articles were not later cherished and all were put away or thrown away when the beingness did not materialize perhaps it is bad taste to mention this from my personal viewpoint but from where else should i look and it has all happened to you too the senselessness of the items selected probably puzzled you when they were stolen but they were identified with you you couldnt be stolen so you lost your wife your husband or your little trinket meaningless perhaps to anyone but you person has to discover he cant be you before he steals your things without credit when he discovers he still isnt you he damns you to all he finally cannot be you so he wastes you and thus the dei scale of beingness is completed one answer to this is never be desirable you and never get famous far better answer is to understand it for by understanding alone you can prevent it thus the major tears of the world are based on beingness insanity heartbreak bitter lives all stem from the same sourcethere is also an acceptance level of beingness based on viewpoint of an already alloyed beingness some people can only have the beingness of the criminal or the insane thus there is yet another door to cracking cases another latchstring to the problem of man there is also the problem of acceptable beingness probably more important than acceptance level what beingness is acceptable to various people in the pcs life there is also such thing as taking on anothers unwanted beingness to help him or her such as taking psychosomatic we have had many beingness processes like we did at first with help we missed point the preclear does not know what help means and he does not know what beingness means he is below cognition level on them all help or beingness actions he undertakes are reactive not analytical to overcome this one enters the case of the pc at the inhibit end of the dei scale he has the pc waste the item in brackets he asks the pc to waste help to waste the help of another to have another waste help for himself and so on thus it is with beingness have the pc waste it man tears his idols apart trying to get bit of desirable beingness every thetan wants to heal at sight so they crucified christ and sold pieces of the cross pc who assumes the aches of another wishes to be that other he is short on beingness he accepts it obsessively wearing empress eugenies hats is understandable what woman wouldnt be an empress but wearing the crooked back of the hunchback of notre dame isnt quite so comprehensibleif you dont know scientology one follows knowing assumptions of beingness with unknowing assumptions the thief knows not why he steals the bishop knows little of why he cherishes the bit of the true cross and none of them know so invalidated has it become that each has basic beingness complete and that beingness is important to you it is the best beingness there is and it is important to how important can only be viewed through these eyes that see the magnitude of the job why should anyone steal when he can have the best there is for the asking and why steal from and thee for we alone in all mans history can give him the priceless gift of himself just as the thief knows not why he steals so does the archbishop fail to know why he dons robe to abandon life is to waste all beingness there is the preclear who sits at succumb try it on pc youll be surprised this is one of the ot steps on which i am working for the 20th acc l ron hubbard lrhmdrd copyright 1958 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedissue 73 1958 ca early may the magazine of dianetics and scientology from washington dc assists in scientology l ron hubbard definition an assist an action undertaken by minister to assist the spirit to confront physical difficulties which can then be cared for with medical methodology by medical doctor as needful an assist is not normally done in formal auditing session the way the term has been used is very simple processing activity to relieve an immediate troublesome difficulty an assist is much more specifically and definitely anything which is done to alleviate presenttime discomfort it is differentiated from auditing at large by defining auditing as an activity directed toward the rehabilitation of the entire individual the first moments of every formal session are an assist before you undertake further auditing you usually perform an assist if you are very clever auditor you do it by scouting what has happened between sessions or if the person has present time problem for the handling of present time problem in an auditing session is really not auditing because it is addressed to surface difficulty you handle the difficulty which is uppermost and foremost in the preclears mind preclear may say well my wife and i had fight last night she threatened to commit suicide and now she has violent headache the wrong way to look at what he is saying is to think that it is her headache that is causing the trouble in the session and that you cannot cure her headache as she isnt present the actual trouble in the session is his concern about her headache so you run problems of comparable magnitude to relieve his mind to point where he is quite comfortable and you can get on with the auditing and that is actually what an assist is since you really do not have the preclear under good control nor well orientated in the environment you have to answer this technical question when does an auditing session begin the answer to that question is an auditing session begins when you have preclear and when he knows he has an auditing environment and an auditor there is auditing which is done on relatively loose basis which might be out in the street in the kitchen or anywhere an assist could happen almost anywhere but at the beginning of the session matter how formally this session is constituted you are running an assistyou have an auditing room you have preclear and you are the auditor you know all these things but the preclear doesnt as far as he is concerned there isnt formal session taking place dont call it formal session call it an assist tell the preclear that it is an assist and that you are not intending anything very strenuous in rendering an assist you should tell the preclear that this is just an assist to try and ease the pain in his hand little after which you are going to stop the handling of an assist as an auditor is different than the handling of formal session since the factor of control is notably slackened sometimes almost completely missing one of the factors in assists is that an assist has as large part of its anatomy trying to help just remember that you are only trying to help and dont get your heart broken by the fact that the fellows broken spine doesnt heal instantly another factor is that an assist is differentiated and defined as addressing the game someone knows he is playing what techniques would comprise an assist anything that would help and what are these one of the easiest ones to render is locational processing you tell the person look at that chair look at that ceiling look at that floor look at that hand the auditor pointing to the objects when he has an injured hand and the pain will diminish this is very easy assist for example person has bad shoulder you touch his hand of the same arm and say close your eyes and look at my fingers make sure that he keeps his eyes closed you then touch him on the elbow and say look at my fingers do this anywhere on his body just touch him and say look at my fingers this is communication process which eases his attention over from concentration upon the injury to something else which is quite near the injury and thus doesnt result in too much of shock it reduces havingness but it is positive and gets positive results it can be done by an untrained person you can teach this assist to anybody you say if somebody has bruise injury burn cut the way to handle this is to tell the person to close his eyes and then you touch the area near and distant from the vicinity of the injured area asking them with their eyes closed to look at your fingers you contact them this way many times they will experience sudden pains in the area and you will discover that the psychic trauma has been discharged you will find that people do not have any upset about physical contact most people think that this is the thing to do say you wanted to render an assist on somebody who had very indefinite difficulty that is the hardest one to render an assist on the person has pain but he cannot say where he doesnt know what has happened to him he just feels bad use locational processing as such you will find out that this process will work when other processes fail an assist carries with it certain responsibility if you give an assist casually to somebody out in the public and do not shove professional calling card in his pocket you are making an error the reason for this is that he will not know from whom and where help came therefore an auditor walking around without pack of cards is doing foolish thing an auditor goes through life and he casts his shadow upon many people and they have really cognizance of what has happened at all if he is rendering an assist he says do this do thatmaybe he wins or maybe he loses because this is the type of session least calculated to procure orderly results but in the main these people have been helped they dont know really by what except some word that the auditor kept saying they dont even know that he is an auditor they dont know anything about it at all show person where he can obtain further assistance and by whom the assistance was given be yourself be positive be professional and definite have card and make sure the card is easily enough understood dont ask them for permission just do it reason towander around and give them funny notions if you are going to help some stranger out help him out dont explain to him or any bystander otherwise you are likely to stand there explaining waiting for somebodys permission dont bother with that you act as though you are the one in charge and you will be in charge and this is part and parcel of the knowledge of how to do an assist you have got to be the person in charge this has to be so good as far as you are concerned that you overcome the informality of the session to very marked degree if you do it extremely well the assist will amount to auditing say for example there is big accident and crowd of people are pressing around the police are trying to push the people back well push the people back and then push the policeman back say officer keep these people at distance then you lean over the victim and snap him back to rights if you are enough there everybody else will realize that you are the one that is there therefore such things as panic worry wonder upset looking dreamily into the far distance wondering what is wrong or what should be done are part of your makeup if you are rendering an assist cool calm and collected should be the keynote of your attitude realize that to take control of any given situation it is only necessary to be there more than anybody else there is necromancy involved just be there the others arent and if you are there enough then somebody else will pull himself out of it and go on living understand that an auditor when rendering an assist must make up with presence what he lacks in surroundings and agreements it all comes under the heading of willingness to be there and willingness to control people one of the ways of convincing people of beingness and of being there is to exercise controlpositive undeniable tone 40 exercise of control start to control the situation with high enough arc enough presence and factualitythere wont be anybody present that wont step back and let you control the situation you are entitled to it in the first place because of senior knowhow the control of body attention or thought comprises the majority of your knowledge the majority in scientology simply points in this direction the observable thing is control of attention objects and thoughts when you have good confidence of being able to handle these and when you positively know how to do these then you can make sure that everybody else knows you can do this and you make them realize this by doing it you have all of these things available in rendering an assist you might never think of riot as being situation which necessitated an assist or an assist as applicable to riot but riot is simply psychosomatic momentary injury or traumatic condition on the third dynamic could you settle riot well if you can settle riot you can certainly settle one person who is in riot the antithesis of any pain disturbance or tumult is order the thing which controls tumult is order and conversely the thing which controls order is tumult you need only bring order into confused situation and bring confusion into an orderly situation to control everything in the field of motion action and objects this is fantastic simplicity and one which takes some grasping conceive as order merely fixed position idea and attitude policeman knows what he is supposed to do maybe he will put on tourniquet or maybe he wont keep the people away and stop everything is his idea of how it should be now you can aid or abet the order he is creating or cancel the order by creating confusion which he cannot handle of the two the first is the best in that situation you aid and abet and cap the order he is creating if you were to accuse him of having confused accident scene which is by now not at all confused and ask him to straighten it out you would channel his attention in the direction it is already gone and so you control his attention remember those people are still moving little bit they are still breathing there is still tiny bit of motion going on if you were to ask him something on the order of cant we have it little quieter and more orderly here he would at once perceive that there was far too much confusion and motion and he would simply come under your direction because you have simply channeled his attention in the direction it was already going therefore you have taken controlif you ever want to overset fixed order create confusion if you want to overset confusion create fixed order pick out of the scene those beings in the scene whose attention is channeled in the direction you want attention to go and you aid and abet that attention which already exists or where you have too many fixed positions and fixed ideas to overcome you simply take those turbulent individuals in the scene who are creating the confusion against those fixed ideas and channels and you make their confusion much more confused at the same time yourself imposing another order in another direction the mechanics of taking over any confused scene are simply the mechanics of trying to get preclear to see through the morass of crosspurposes commands ideas and environments in which he has lived and whether that applies to the third dynamic or otherwise the laws are still there and it tells you then that the imposition of order on preclear comes foremost in an assist in an assist you always count on the fact that the thetan himself would if he could do the right thing if you work on that postulate you will never be wrong get the idea that it is something else trying to do the wrong thing the keynote of thetan is order where you are giving an assist to one person you put things in the environment into an orderly state as the first step unless you are trying to stop pumping artery but here you would use first aid you should understand that first aid always precedes an assist you should look the situation over from the standpoint of how much first aid is required maybe you will find somebody with temperature of 106 degrees it may very well be that he needs to lie down and be covered up and though antibiotics are much overrated he might be better off with shot of one of these than with an assist at that time auditing will not shut off pumping artery but tourniquet will if you are going into the zone of accidents you are going to be in the vicinity of great deal of destruction and chaos and you are very foolish not to have your red cross first aid certificate you may often have to find some method of controlling handling and directing personnel who get in your way before you can render an assist you might just as well realize that an assist requires that you control the entire environment and personnel associated with the assist if necessary an assist is auditing on several dynamics it is therefore much harder to do than auditing in formal room as it requires presence you must bring yourself to face the fact that you have to give enough presence and enough control to enough dynamics to bring the environment into compliance with your postulate if you postulate that somebody is going to pick up his bed and walk then you have to be willing to move and be capable of moving around the people who are going to watch him pick up his bed and walk good example of an assist would be when somebody is washing dishes in the kitchen there is horrendous crash and the person comes down all over the sink hits the floor and as she is going down she grabs the butcher knife as it falls you go in and say well let fix that up one of the first things you would have to do is to wind some bandage around the hand to stop the bleeding part of the first aid would be to pick up the dishes and put them back on the sink sweep the pieces together into more orderly semblance this is the first symptom of control she becomes introverted into the cut to the point that she wouldnt particularly notice what you were doing but you relieve the anxiety that all her blood is pouring out your first attention to the case is attention to the environment next you would make her sit down to remove her from the scene of the accident is not as desirable as auditing her there that is directly contrary perhaps to what you believe but it is true that is why you bring little order into the environment you position her and then you are ready for techniques it is quite remarkable for you have manifested order in much wider sphere than cut hand in order to bring about healing of the cut hand if you understand that your responsibility always extends much wider than the immediate zone of commotion you never miss if you bring order to the wider environment you also bring it to the narrowerenvironment if you bring it into the narrow environment you also bring it to the wider environment it is gradient scale of how much order you can bring in processing you have to control or direct attention objects person or thoughts of the injured person if you are really good on the subject of assists you will direct an additional thing his knowingness you can control mans knowingness rather easily but it is hard to see it about the first thing that you can observe about somebody is his person you are trying to straighten it out dont think that even though you have this person sitting down you have straightened it out because it is still messed up but there is something that you can straighten out easilyand that is his attention if you could heighten his attention and his knowingness at the same time you would really be in wonderful circumstances you always shift and direct his attention hence locational processing if he was scientologist with his case in pretty good shape you could run trio with considerable success by directing his attention but you wouldnt run trio with the command look around the room and find something you could have you should say you look at that chair now decide you can have it that is very low order of the terrible trio you could run the injury out in this fashion look at that chair decide the injury cannot have it this is directed attention positively controlled there is permissiveness connected with this in any way whatsoever because he is injured you are not going to move his person around you have got his attention dont try to shift his thoughts around at first because they are dispersed and chaotic this leaves you his attention only the above assist is quite satisfactory but later development in the line of assists which included the significance of keep it from going away is much more powerful in one case bruise turned utterly black and covering this persons entire hip passed away in 45 minutes of good auditing by keeping the right hip from going away and then keeping the left hip from going away if you run the right eye you run the left eye as well if you run one thing you run another if you run his head run his knees as well the master of all these is the direction of attention keep it from going away is tremendously workable you dont run keep it from going away first because you are partially controlling his thoughts and this is not possible in the early stages of an assist if someone is in terrible condition and he is really writhing around and you want to render an assist you dont wait until he stops writhing he is liable to stop writhing dead what you do with him is to direct his attention you tell him shut your eyes and look at my fingers you press your fingers hard enough so that he cant help but put his attention on them if you want it to come out with bruise then you would get him to point where you can control his thoughts which are chaotic enough have him keep the left ankle from going away the right ankle from going away etc if the process doesnt seem to be flattening direct his attention somewhere else because he is not keeping it from going away in this wise you can always have successful assist because assists all come under the heading of control the beingness of the person and his presence makes the control possible so part of control is always presence identity person the one who takes charge and has things under control when you are able to control his attention his body and thoughts then he will be in session and you are longer doing an assist assists dominantly require that you direct the attention of the preclear and dispose his person one way or the other and eventually take over control of his thoughts on the subject but by the time you have all these three in line you are longer doing an assist so what you really do is do an assist up to the time the person can handle the incident or pain put him in more favorable environment and give him auditing so the assist is what youdo on the street and auditing is what you do in the auditing room when he comes to you after your assist has been successful an assist is not substitute for medical attention and does not attempt to cure injuries requiring medical aid first call the doctor then assist the person as you can l ron hubbardpab 136 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard

taped lectures of l ron hubbard then and now solids cchs 0 to 13 are steps in exercising the preclears ability to be able to do cch 14 which is then and now solids they are gradient scale of exercises to eliminate all his wrong conceptions and to clear out of the way those considerations which aberrated him into having that unknown hidden and compulsive game of which he was at the mercy the preclear must be in control of his body and environment he must be able to keep things from going away especially mockups and facsimiles hold them still and most important of all make them little more solid we say more solid for it invalidates the present solidity of whatever the preclear mocked up or touched if we say make it solid the process is run in the following manner with these commands get pictureand make it little more solid thank you look at that auditor indicates objectand make it little more solid thank you the commands are given with tiny pause between the first and second phrase as it will be found that the glance of the preclear at the object tends to give him the impression that he has already made it little more solid before the auditor gives the command if this auditing command is broken into two commands the student manual by l ron hubbard the command says get picture and the auditor must explain to the preclear if he doesnt already know the difference between facsimiles dubins and mockups we must make sure that he gets picture facsimile this process combines subjectivity and objectivity introversion and extroversion in the preclears universe and the mest universe it handles time he will have to go into the past in order to get the picture and then come up into the present by making specific indicated object little more solid its whole goal is to straighten out the preclears time track to clear up his reactive bank and disclose his service facsimile and life computation and even whole track computations which make him act in certain manner life after life it will enable the preclear to handle time and get rid of all the unwanted facsimiles for by viewing them and making these little more solid he will get the restimulative facsimiles under his control he will then be able to handle in its totality the whole reactive mind to impress its importance here is direct quotation from the student manual history developed from over and under solids which was developed by l ron hubbard in late 1955 and improved by him in 1956 the process more or less completes thework begun on the reactive mind in 1947 it will be noted that many earlier processes and effects are woven into then and now solids the auditor running this process must be capable of handling any emotional situation however startling and unexpected it might be with great smoothness and ease facsimiles will stand out unexpectedly the preclear will get sudden somatics and past life enemies will be there in front of his body in metrocolor and three dimensions he will run up and down that tone scale dramatize anger or pain to such degree that the auditor who has not been run on high school indoc or hi hi indoc might get the scare of his life and take off leaving the preclear in spin then and now solids demonstrates in its application all that is written in dianetics the modern science of mental health and history of man it takes into account the basic theory and elements of both scientology and dianetics and only the expert can handle this process well nowhere along the line is the auditor allowed to move from the commands of the process since it is tone 40 it does not mean that the auditor must not communicate with the preclear indeed it is most necessary at times but he must keep the original intention of the process in mind at all times and gently but firmly steer the preclear back on to the route he is leading the process must be run exactly as given it is not advised that any book auditor or beginner use this process for the session will most certainly go out of control if tone 40 and the trainings see the student manual are not clearly understood and applied this process acts quickly if it is real to the preclear if these facsimiles do not sometimes stand out with alarming clarity he is not running the process it should not be run for hours and hours without break one can always run it to flat point and then return to the beginning of procedure cch and flatten each command which by now will take comparatively short period it is not necessary for the preclear to tell the auditor each time what the facsimile was that he found but it is advisable that the auditor check now and again to see that the preclear is doing it properly it should be run nonspecifically the auditor will notice that the preclear will go further and further into the past and then come up nearer and nearer to present time and eventually after many of the cycles are completed come wholly into present time there are few developments from then and now solids which can be used on valences for example if the preclear has trouble with mother have him get picture of motherand make it little more solid then have him notice an indicated object or walland make it little more solid it must remain then and now solids alternately throughout the whole session should the auditor suspect that the preclear is stuck in past life or has recurring facsimiles of past lives during processing have him get the pictures make them little more solid and then make something in present time little more solid it will blow the same procedure applies for any troubles the preclear has regarding men women children or other parts of the dynamics lrh told an hgc auditor to clear the valences with then and now solids then the preclears own body and after that to return to general nonspecific then and now cch 14 is the fastest and most effective process in scientology if the earlier steps are well accomplished but it stirs up so much motion and emotion that the auditor better be fully trained before he attempts to run it on an innocent preclearprocedure cch long form the cch numbers in the preceding pabs and on this chart do not

bulletin of 24 may 1958 all staff field offices comment on beingness processing i recently received the following from an hgc auditor dear ron i am writing to congratulate you on the development of the beingness processes outlined in hco bulletin of may 2 ad 8 these are wonderful processes and i thank you for them not as report but purely as clinical data i want you to know what happened in seven and half hours of using them nine major valences came off the case including the weak one and the strong one all the important ones stripped off clean plus the fact that the service facsimile keyed out this person is not clear yet but is brand new person hco bulletin of 2 may 1958 beingness again the best solution to valences is beingness processing help on valences is excellent even phenomenal and should not be ignored problems of comparable magnitude to selected person cannot be ignored but an understanding of valences gives us new look at processes in the first place valence is beingness bad crazy or superb valence is still beingness thetan has basic personality but if this is too thoroughly invalidated thetan assumes some invented valence and if this is invalidated he then eventually completes the dei scale on beingness the things wrong with thetan are the lower harmonics of the characteristics of thetan you could say carelessly that the only thing wrong with person is himself let us say more accurately that the only thing wrong with person is his abandonment of self and the assumption of other selves because there is self the assumption of selves is possible we find that the apa or oca is picture of self what self is another matter all selves other than true self are less honest and ethical since the thetan has poorer opinion of others than he does of himself in the basic state to change an apa or oca it is necessary to shift selvesit is fascinating that theft of objects is really an effort to steal self objects represent selves to others thieves and what they steal cannot be understood by the logic of their material needs they steal tokens of selves and hope to assume thereby another self it is sometimes not amusing to to be missing my lecture notes or book from my shelf this is covert theft of beingness people sometimes get anxious to be mei know not why they wind up stealing my things the theft is irrational the articles were not later cherished and all were put away or thrown away when the beingness did not materialize perhaps it is bad taste to mention this from my personal viewpoint but from where else should i look and it has all happened to you too the senselessness of the items selected probably puzzled you when they were stolen but they were identified with you you couldnt be stolen so you lost your wife your husband or your little trinket meaningless perhaps to anyone but you person has to discover he cant be you before he steals your things without credit when he discovers he still isnt you he damns you to all he finally cannot be you so he wastes you and thus the dei scale of beingness is completed one answer to this is never be desirable you and never get famous far better answer is to understand it for by understanding alone you can prevent it thus the major tears of the world are based on beingness insanity heartbreak bitter lives all stem from the same source there is also an acceptance level of beingness based on viewpoint of an already alloyed beingness some people can only have the beingness of the criminal or the insane thus there is yet another door to cracking cases another latchstring to the problem of man there is also the problem of acceptable beingness probably more important than acceptance level what beingness is acceptable to various people in the pcs life there is also such thing as taking on anothers unwanted beingness to help him or her such as taking psychosomatic we have had many beingness processes like we did at first with help we missed point the preclear does not know what help means and he does not know what beingness means he is below cognition level on them all help or beingness actions he undertakes are reactive not analytical to overcome this one enters the case of the pc at the inhibit end of the dei scale he has the pc waste the item in brackets he asks the pc to waste help to waste the help of another to have another waste help for himself and so on thus it is with beingness have the pc waste it man tears his idols apart trying to get bit of desirable beingness every thetan wants to heal at sight so they crucified christ and sold pieces of the cross pc who assumes the aches of another wishes to be that other he is short on beingness he accepts it obsessively wearing empress eugenies hats is understandable what woman wouldnt be an empress but wearing the crooked back of the hunchback of notre dame isnt quite so comprehensibleif you dont know scientology one follows knowing assumptions of beingness with unknowing assumptions the thief knows not why he steals the bishop knows little of why he cherishes the bit of the true crossand none of them know so invalidated has it become that each has basic beingness complete and that beingness is important to you it is the best beingness there is and it is important to how important can only be viewed through these eyes that see the magnitude of the job why should anyone steal when he can have the best there is for the asking and why steal from and thee for we alone in all mans history can give him the priceless gift of himself just as the thief knows not why he steals so does the archbishop fail to know why he dons robe to abandon life is to waste all beingness there is the preclear who sits at succumb try it on pc youll be surprised this is one of the ot steps on which i am working for the 20th acc l ron hubbard lrhrsms rd copyright 1958 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 29 may 1958 special bulletin standard clear procedure and an experimental road clearing by valences there have been many roads to clear the first was the most simple in description but the most difficult to audit i never succeeded in teaching it to anyone all one did was renew the pcs confidence in being able to face sonic visio tactile etc in the bank by gradient scale and at long last he would be able to confront bank wholly when that happened he didnt have reactive bank he was clear it required very gentle touch that was the way i made all the early clears in 1947 to 1949 then i had to explain it all to the scientists and the fact of clear was lost in the mire of the roadway for some years ive been accused of wanting it that way to tell the sheep from the goats the point remains that this route was the first successful route we did not know how much there was to bank or its anatomy we had to know the worst before the sun came up again it came up in december of 1957 with my development of help and step 6 suddenly we were making clears making them out of both high and low profile cases out of occluded cases and wide open cases clearing is now an accomplished fact for any welltrained validated auditor using central organization emeter the further in miles from the central organization the attempt to clear is tried the more difficulty is being experienced first the word goes out that clearing is being done then the howtodoit by the time it gets to alaska or the bronx or some distant place the auditor is uncertain as to the right way and even the fact of clearing he tries it or thinks he does his version anyway and laying an egg or two gives up or thinks it isnt real for such an auditor an haa clearing course is indicated 1 hell learn right and 2 hell see some clears around and begin to understand what one is and hell know there is at least one valid road to clear that he can take and do therefore we do not really need right now more roads to clear and certainly we need roads to ot while the path to clear is still thin blazed trail good heavens whats happened is wonderful enoughand nobody far away has any reality on that yet however i am still on the job looking for 1 alternate clear roads and 2 roads to ot standard clearing procedure the procedure that is making clears in skilled hands is very set scp indeed it alone has made all clears to date by persons other than myself scp is aided here and there by other techniques used to cross block or two faster but all older techniques only assist the steps of scp and sometimes impede scp of course there are some people who would rather walk in the swamp alongside the causeway just built thats up to them if they know theres causeway and still walk in swamp its power ofchoice if they havent seen the big causeway beside them and walk in the swamp thats stupidity standard clearing procedure works as follows requisite for auditor validated certificate tools quiet room and clearing emeter from dc or london not some tin quivering together on the hopes of some tinker nor yet an old model t emeter made in california publications clear procedure available from the hco first action start session cch 0 second action search out by meter pt problem and run it by finding what part of it pc can be responsible for as repetitive command formal auditing third action cch 0 b clear help in brackets with meter running meter toward freer needle dont overrun leg of the bracket and get the pc stuck or anaten fourth action run step 6 of the book clear procedure and run it flat fifth action reclear help sixth action step 6 until flat flat flat and needle free thats scp it is assisted by scs and connectedness on some pcs scp is an accomplished fact only if the auditor has good training and validation he doesnt have to be clear but he has to be accurate the haabscn course teaches validation and clearing hcahpa teach the basics of scientologyyou have to know those first thus an experimental road to clear is today luxury but you know meim always cutting corners so here is an alternate still in theoretical stage which promises to be the 3rd successful road however it requires even greater auditing skill and understanding than scp but may be faster for lower cases it is called clearing by valences its theory is simple one can assume that thetan has all the attributes of clear in his basic personality see book i dianetics the modern science of mental health for discussion of basic personality the action of clearing gives person back to himself therefore the bulldozing of rubble from the basic personality would give us clear i have known for some time that an apa or oca profile was picture of valence or of valencesartificial overlays i have also known that there is basic personality when you clear someone you dont get ghost or godyou get distinct personality men are not equal even if the highest courts in the us so insist and neither are clears it is commiepsychiatric thinking that each is equal to the next like grains of mush you can generalize by saying clears are good and able but some are gooder than others and some are distinctly differently able so people are different but valences borrowed artificial personalities overlay the real self and weaken it valences are the sum of overwhelmings of the pc whenever he lost he got onehis basic personality was invalidated so he sought new ones these were invalidated so he sought even newer ones like standing between two mirrors facing each other we achieve the multiple pc but where is the clear we find him when we scoop away the thousands of others he is being the first straight wire run at elizabeth nj in 1950 succeeded when it knocked off sick valence well we can knock them off wholesale todaywith skilled auditing the clue is the curiositydesireenforceinhibit scale run on valences that which the pc erases with difficulty is misowned by him therefore it is valence in the presence of valences he cannot change his mind easily when he misowns the consideration therefore all fixed harmful ideas or aberrations stem from valences the process on this would be tell how you could waste male female other valence this would have to be cleared as command thoroughly and often thats the skill an auditor can ask pc about an aberration and spot valence possibility and then run it by waste etc people usually have to waste before they can have person who can have valence isnt subject to it this type of command is rounded off with what part of that valence could you be responsible for the general rules of auditing must be observed the basics of scientology must be understood and great skill and understanding are required of the auditor tell how you could waste fathers valence fat valence defeated valence etc the list is enormous well there it is in the rough when its made some clears it will be an alternate probably and have highly polished form like scp right now it is used as an assist to scp on difficult case as per the next hco b l ron hubbard lrh jh copyright 1958 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office washington dc hco

started session by attempting to clear pt problem first he had to clear the command the pc very restless defined problem as something that cant be solved you can keep trying but of course you cant solve it i tried in vain to get pc to asis that computation it would not change i was faced by this one cannot audit successfully up against pt problem if one tries to do so without clearing the problem the whole case hangs fire every unchanged profile or case after auditing is unchanged because the auditor left present time problem partly or wholly unflat and in restimulation pc whose definition of problem is something that cant be solved and who yet has pt problem could not be audited successfully unless the computation altered trying what is problem as repetitive question for half an hour only made the pc nervous restless and tearful obviously the consideration would not change therefore obviously the consideration was misowned it was valence another person the pc was being with complete tenacity and total error process abandoned decided to strip the valence off discussion of what was valence finally bore fruit pc understood term as meaning mental package of ideas and considerations really belonging to another person and unknowingly borrowed by pc started in to run process to at once give greater reality on valences and to hit at the computation if pc would fight help so hard then the valence had four considerations that were known to 1 it couldnt be assisted 2 it considered problem as something that could not be solved 3 it was steeped in defeatism and 4 the pc thought of the valence as self just to ease into valences i ran process as follows can you get an idea of somebody that cannot be helped pc could describe the person pc did thus getting detached idea of personality in the mind now what would you say that persons definition of problem would be the first dozen people so imagined all had definitions of problems identical with pcs own but then there began to be change in the definition possibly this process would have gotten further but pc was looking brighter and flat place was reached and i was really trying to clear by valencestherefore i bridged started in on valences directly i called the valence in which pc was stuck that valence pc thought of it as self i used the repetitive command tell how you could waste that valence now and then i asked where it was pc didnt know sometimes sometimes did at first it was just back of pcs eyes and was pcs thinkingness terrible somatics cut in after fifteen minutes all chronic with pc i went right on with process for some time over one hour when pc suddenly began to cognite on problems the somatics had ceased entirely fifteen minutes before as process can be left when an ability is regained or b three responses are given with equal comm lag or c pc truly cognites in line with process i could then leave it and bridge i bridged over to what part of that valence could you be responsible for for twelve minutes to round process off and keep pc from making that valence an enemy if any bit of it remained and to check out somatics pc felt very dazed for moment or two typical of separating somatic but came out of it very bright process flat bridged into earlier commands for few commands each to flatten them and bridged out to begin clearing of session pc could not now consider any of the five initial problems listed as problems now they all seemed simple and routine parts of life ended session time of auditing 2 12 hours approximately including one short

street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 1 june 1958 some more cch processes compiled from l ron hubbards research writings and taped lectures to the 18th american advanced clinical course control trio after one has run cch 0 to 5 and has brought the preclears body and attention under control there are various ways of handling the case from there on here is series of processes which undercuts trio and is called control trio the commands for control trio are 1 notice that auditor indicates object and get idea of having it 2 notice mat auditor indicates object and get the idea of permitting it to continue 3 notice that auditor indicates object and get idea of making it disappear the processes should be run in that order and each one must be run flat before the next one is attempted it is very necessary to clear the command before embarking upon the process preclears simply understand that having means that they must possess something carry it with them wherever they gowithout just leaving the mountain chair or whatever it is in its own spacetime continuum he gets it confused with ownership and so forth in fundamentals of thought there is an excellent definition of havingness the essential definition of having is to be able to touch or permeate or to direct the disposition of during the running of the first command the preclear will come up with cognitions regarding the necessity of having or not having things its goodness or badness and will in general run out his earlier training regarding this point it will change his conceptions which earlier religions may have implanted such as it is bad to have and run out the compulsions of must must not got to cant have etc find out what the preclear is doing and how he is doing this for he should get havingness from this process and his tone should rise considerably change should take place within very short period otherwise his body and attention are not under control or b he doesnt understand the command and is running different process than that which you intendedthere should be qualifications or conditions such as if i had the money i could buy that object and then have it or i dont like it and thus dont want it or what shall i do with it once i have got it it is just the ability to have without other considerations of goodness badness ownership or beauty going with it and the auditor and preclear should clear such conceptions through good but nonevaluating twoway communication the second part of this trio brings the preclears sense of active participation of creativity and responsibility out for he must grant that particular object sufficient life and beingness to allow it to continue within its own space and time preclears come up with the considerations that they have either tried to notis objects andor people or withheld something from them or tried to push them out of their environments because they didnt like them or agree with them this is an interesting process to put their ideas about what they should have around them back into proper perspective they will find that there is harm in permitting the sixth dynamic to continue in present time right where it is the third part of the trio is the most effective and more will be said about it in following pab it is very good exteriorizing process and the preclear will come up with many cognitions on his own and the rest of the dynamics here the idea is just to get the idea of making the object disappear instead of to dispense with it or notknow or notis it this cycle can be run over and over again until it is flat within few minutes after the command has again given the preclear some gains after this trio oldtime terrible trio can then be run with great advantage on case who couldnt do it before control trio which undercuts trio will bring out its reality level goals with every preclear it is most necessary to establish goals that are real for the preclear you want him to have some goals which are his and not what grandma father or schoolteacher desires for him preclears who have real goals are working on other peoples determinism and we have to establish the certainty of future for the preclear and b get him to put things in that future that he wants so that he can have future there is gradient scale of processes which will establish goals which are real to the preclear by casual twoway communication using the following questions 1 what are you absolutely sure will happen in the next two minutes one hour three days one week three months one year etc complete certainty on each time span is necessary before the auditor continues to the next time span this is done by twoway communication and the auditor must all the time be sure that the preclear is certain that these things are going to happen in the next two minutes or whatever the time span is to ensure that the process really bites 2 tell something that you would like to do in the next two minutes one hour etc is the next process that would put doingness and more time into that future on some preclears the following questions may be realer and bite faster this is putting the accent on have instead of do since we work from the bottom up on the be do have triangle they are 3 tell something you are sure will be there in two minutes etc and 4 tell something you would like to have in two minutes etcthe last two processes really undercut the above and are thus lower level processes and it is advisable to run them on preclears whose ability to communicate and reality level are low watch out for the preclear attaching all sorts of conditions to his answers also work towards positive goals of things and not conditions such as i want to get rid of my fears and somatics the latter type of preclear is working towards nothing rather than towards something more positive goal of something would be i want stick of candy or glass of water check for certainty at all times for certainty strengthens reality and the reality of future for the preclear is most essential if auditing is to succeed all the way losses why doesnt preclear exteriorize easily and stay exteriorized and why does he get sick when one asks him to conceive static is the accompanying question the answer to this is losses the preclear associates static with loss and he says all right if there is nothing there ive lost it conceiving static is therefore painful and whenever he lost anything something disappeared an individual cannot conceive static if he associates static with lossif it is painful so we have to cure him of the painfulness of loss consideration of before we can exteriorize him easily we do this by going back to automaticity the universe has been taking things away from the preclear it has become an automaticity known as time time itself is consecutive series of losses so we have to cure this preclear of losses before we can get him to appreciate time otherwise he would be so afraid of losing it that hed park himself on the track and this is the stuck on the track phenomenon this is done with the process recall moment of loss sandwiched with havingness control trio trio or locational processing this gets the preclear to take over the automaticity of all of the losses which he has experienced unwillingly when an individual has visio has never seen anything couldnt see anything the only thing that he is looking at is stuck loss recall moment of loss and goals are lower harmonic of running then and now solids and are at the moment making bid for our chief exteriorization processes recall moment of loss should be run with twoway communication but not too much outflow of the preclear communication must at all times remain twoway ask the preclear when this happened now and again unless of course he told you when he recalled the loss control trio goals and recall moment of loss are combination of processes and should be run as combination to secure the best gain for the precleara scientologist is one who controls persons environments and situations scientology means knowing in the fullest sense of the word scientology is used on life and its forms and products scientologist operates within the boundaries of the auditors code and the code of scientologist the chief uses of scientology are in the fields of education organization mental disability and religion scientology is the first to give scientific meaning to these scientologist is considered professional if he uses scientology in any of these fields and has been thoroughly trained in scientology scientologist is first cousin of the buddhist distant relative to the taoist feudal enemy to the enslaving priest and bitter foe of the german viennese and russian defamers of man the religion of the scientologist is freedom for all things spiritual on all dynamics which means adequate discipline and knowledge to keep that freedom guaranteed we are the

1958 ca early june the magazine of dianetics and scientology from washington dc offbeat processing l ron hubbard experimental auditing has its place indeed we got where we are because of experimental processes every process was once experimental but when you want results you had better use standard techniques and procedures after all i have sweated through their testing for years and we now know what will ease or clear preclear most clearing failures are caused by use of nonstandard techniques and procedures also such failures can be caused by ignorance an auditor thinks he is using standard material he isnt sufficiently trained to know such an auditor who has had failure should take leaf from new zealand frank turnbull wasnt getting the results he wanted way down under so he grabbed plane and came halfway around the world for twoday briefing frank was right they werent using techniques properlyand their oldstyle emeters werent even working and they didnt know it now if smart clever auditor like turnbull can doubt his command of the subject i am sure other auditors would experience disgrace in following through and getting squared around for clearing is easy if you know how such stories as an auditor who clears his pcs each week are more tragic than funny and rather costly to luckless pcs some auditors dont understand what is clear and get confused with their own casesbut that doesnt mean clear doesnt have precise definition an exact and distinct beingnessand very worthwhile as any clear can assure you perhaps the saddest case of experimental auditing to come to my attention was the case of young man whose wife was depressed she was making such difficulty in the family that he could not work he had had training as an auditor but felt he could not help her he had money for auditing from professional i reviewed the case and asked him why he did not at least try to help her and recommended he use standard auditing and procedures this he did with adequate results andhis efforts succeeded very well so that he was able to resume his work his wife sharing his responsibilities and then it seemed to him that he might go bit further faster that is the usual stumbling blockanxiety to do it all at once but preclears cannot do it all at once and the thoroughly experimental approach he used born out of his own basic lack of reality was not successful he audited his wife downward into condition almost as low as she had been in before thus canceling over twothirds of his gain now none denies his right to undo what he had done to help her but his intention was to help her swiftly and spectacularly had he read his pabs he would have found as of three years ago mention of his discovery as an unworkable approach in defiance of the principles which make scientology function once more he had to quit his job and his wife has lost confidence in his willingness to assist her fortunately another auditor has now volunteered to assistand he will use standard proven tested techniques and procedures you see there is thing called scientology it has axioms it has principles it has the goal of empowering thetan to overcome his own problems this standard scientology we dont change every day the uninformed not knowing that standard exists see in each new release new subject so they say why dont i experiment on my pcs and they experiment with the standard background not with further reach of old tried principles without guiding central organization scientology would fall into an anarchy of opinions in week for there are too many who can go through the motions of auditing who do not know their basics they think new thing scientology is an experimental thing it is not the basics are inflexible and have been for years we know now just exactly what clears people and we know exactly what clear is and we know exactly how to train and process these are hard won riches dont waste them and your time too this is the way out are some

use hgc auditors may find of interest 20th acc training procedure the first day on auditing the student checks out as many other students for clear as possible with clear check out sheets and emeter text ability and hco bulletins purpose to learn to check out clears the way to learn clear checkout is to check out many nonclears how to clear command clear each word once only so that the word means something to pc only repeat if the pc says he doesnt understand never ask twice what does help mean to you clearing command is not repetitive process there is other right way to clear command in any case clear the command for all sides of bracket before running one all auditing and checkouts are actual there is student coaching except on trs 1 cch 0 with emphasis on goals and pt problem done thoroughly at start of every session 2 arc straight wire using following type command onlyrecall time when you communicated with something run as complete 9 way bracket one command each side use communicate only run until needle of meter is relatively free pay attention to cyclic aspect of answers purpose to loosen up bank and screens and to teach student use of bracket and give him practice this permits student to ease into rather strict and exacting auditing activity without an instruction to him from an instructor upsetting preclear as it would if help were being used instead avoid beefy processes where correction supervision and general instruction are involved auditor requires verbal answer from pc only head nod but checks now and then as to when the communication being recalled took place 3 startcs oldest version emphasis on start and stop run change when the start or stop seem flat and only to unflatten them purpose smoothness of auditor control accomplishment by pc of really controlling body you start that body etc is emphasized 4 connectedness control version sole command you get the idea of making that object connect with you other side of bracket purpose havingness unsticking needle directing pcs attention 4b student should scout pcs track looking for the rock spot it or something like it in minimal time stick it good and free with connectedness purpose giving student and pc confidence that some sticky business can be plowed into and gotten out of readily by use of connectedness 5help 5 or 9 way bracket in general to groove pc in how could help you on sticky item run one side of bracket after another never repeat any one side twice use whole track type commands never localized this lifetime 5arun auditors and preclears as subjects for help 5 way bracket first run auditors then pcs then auditors then pcs etc purpose clean up all past auditing 5bisolate whole track rock and run 5 or 9 way bracket on it this is an adroit matter it requires that one know the pc and audit this particular pc it doesnt mean forcing onesown rock on the pc it requires judgment and knowledge of valences it may be necessary to unburden the rock with several items before it appears free the needle on the rock command must be phrased to include whole track version of pcs rock purpose to locate largest reality of pc and to hit squarely on what he is always mocking up obsessively 5c scout help with general bracket to see if it is freer 6 step 6 as in clear procedure use simple forms repeat 5 5a 5b 5c and step 6 alternately until clear l ron

begin the session now the session is started goals what goal might you have for this session be certain to end session with have we gained anything of your goal at the sessions beginning pt problem caution problem itself not just its terminals must exist in pt do you have anything worrying you so much that you will have difficult time keeping your attention on auditing if pc has describe the problem to pc does does that problem exist in present time now if pc thinks it does what part of that problem could you be responsible foror invent problem of comparable magnitude to that problem repetitive questions further descriptive name is allowed auditor in this command auditor frequently asks describe that problem to nowdoes that problem now exist in present time arc break have i done something you feel is wrong in this session describe it to plenty of acknowledgement to pc further apology and certainly explanation object is to get pcs attention on auditor in present time not earlier in session goal of tr 2 of goals pt problem and auditing is to get pcs attention into present time so dont stack commands on the track or park pc somewhere in session or leave him in an outofsession problem scs note all formal auditing except for final acknowledgement of cycle which is tone 40 commandsstart i am going to tell you to start and when i tell you to start you start the body in that direction do you understand that good start did you start that body thank you stop i am going to tell you to get the body moving in that direction somewhere along the line i will tell you to stop then you stop the body do you understand that good get the body moving stop did you stop the body thank you change do you see that spot good we will call that spot now you stand here ok auditor indicates another spot now do you see that other spot good well call that spot b all right now when i tell you to change the bodys position you move it from spot to spot b all right good change the bodys position did you change the bodys position thank you do you see that spot well well call that spot c now when i tell you to change the bodys position you move the body from spot b to spot c do you understand that fine change the bodys position did you change the bodys position thank you note change is run only to unflatten start and stop when both are flat connectedness use only to unstick pc on meter when meter cant be read well or when auditor desires to clear an object wrongly chosen as rock in order to look for another you get the idea of making that object connect with you auditor points b if pc isnt looking at object with mest bodys eyes use following look at that object you get the idea of making that object connect with you c on blind humans feel that object you get the idea of making that object connect with you help 1 scouting this is 2way comm activity how do you feel about vary any object that sticks by asking about specialized form if specialized form frees go back to object that stuck gradually sort object that consistently sticks from objects that stick by association with it only b if pc reads high on tone arm gets inconsistent lie reaction use following what have you had to be responsible for to be sure pc is reacting turn sensitivity knob very high guide him carefully around his life until he gets on sticky point then sort it out attempting to get parts of it to clear up do not let pc linger on matters which do not stick responsibility sorts the matter out his realization cognition of various zones is what does him good this is not necessarily repetitive command it can be varied with what part of that discovered area or item have you had to be responsible for large area of current lifetime can be freed up and with clues from what he has stuck on repeatedly and using what would not free return to standard scout as above by using part b pc can be brought down on the tone arm and can be made to react more normally on meter2 running help in general use generalized items not specific people or objects dont pin pc in current life general help bracket 9way how could you help yourself how could you help how could i help you how could i help myself how could you help another person how could i help another person how could another person help you how could another person help how could another person help another person running help on an item how could you help how could help you how could another person help how could help another person how could help itself how could you help yourself how could i help you how could you help run in sequence as above do not give same command twice clearing commands clear each word and the full phrase once each with the following what is the usual definition of the english or other language word do not ask for definitions over and over as repetitive command if pcs definition is poor clear command every few commands clear only each different word in bracket dont clear each line in bracket step six select simple nonsignificant objects run in front of that body you mock up and keep it from going away did you thank you then use all directions from the bodybehind that body to the left of that body to the right of that body above that body below that body run 6 objects each on six sides of the body on keep it from going away then proceed to in front of that body you mock up and hold it still same procedure then in front of that body you mock up aand make it little more solid there is acknowledgement by auditor after pc mocks it up and keeps it from going away etc or the did youthere is acknowledgement only after full command is executed otherwise acks will thin pcs mock upsnote the objects should be simple at first leading on up to complexity but at first keep them simple and nonsignificant lrhmdrd l ron hubbard copyright 1958 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 29 july 1958 distribution all staff field offices the rock the rock is reachwithdraw mechanism and the phenomenon of stuck needle is the ridge so created the rock is that which person has used to reach people or things with and is determined in value by its creativeness or destructiveness it is simply the reach and withdraw mechanism which makes ridge and this causes the stuck of the needle the rock is an objectit is not significance and you determine scout by what the pc shies away from as well as what he sticks onand theta bop always winds up in stuck needle if pursued in scout cycle of the rock object person i failed to communicate himself 2 started using something to communicate with 3 put the last item on automatic and it created for him 4 it failed the rock itself when first located will be solution to many earlier cycles as described above and so rock is peeled off cycle by cycle as above the rule is to find the last cycle that is real enough to the pc to stick needle and this is true of locating and running any lock of the rock be careful during scout not to choose an object which makes the needle rise slowly as this is an addition to the rock which is being done gratuitously by the pc this factor is an indicator but it must not be run the rock stick does not riseit just sticks lrhrd l ron hubbard copyright 1958 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 5 august ad 8 issue 2 revised the basic locating question of the rock primary aberrative object is what is people pleaser it can also be run just like this how could you help people pleaser as an item bracket do not kid around with or invalidate this rock the new item bracket is as follows it has been designed to preserve arc and to be used in this exact order one command at time the rock bracket how could help itself how could you help how could help you how could i help how could help how could another person help how could help another person how could others help how could help others how could you help yourself how could i help myself how could you help how could i help you command words but not as whole phrase are cleared often every three brackets and the pc is asked for his opinion only of the word help and the item his answer is not challenged only arc breaks can hide rock again after foundclear them well clear also environmental arc breaks on the rock between sessions l ron hubbard lrhbrd copyright 1958 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 10 august ad 8 acc auxiliary procedure for optional use this is rough draft 1 start session 2 clear auditor with pcwho should i be to audit you what is it all right for to do look at who am i 3 get pc into session establish goals for session what question shouldnt i ask you handle resultant answers with straightwire as indicated do you have anything worrying you so much that you will have difficult time keeping your attention on auditing handle pt problem by responsibility or problems of comparable magnitude invent problem of comparable magnitude to that problem describe that problem to does that problem exist in present time now run twoway bracket on help how could you help how could i help you flatten for the session every time you audit somebody this should be touched on and flattened so that it will stay flat at least for that session to flatten it for all time or for all sessions would be impossible check for arc breaks if they exist take them up twoway comm and also reflatten above twoway bracket on help when auditor and pc are cleared for session only then begin on case this is true of all sessions and all cases keep pc in session with above steps used whenever pc wanders off in session of course do not interrupt unflattened process too suddenly to get pc back into session always use comm bridges whenever you change the course of the session clear all commands ask for opinion of key words but not in such way as to make this asking process the pcs idea of what the key words are is the pcs idea and repetitive asking for opinion is not process but an invalidation 4 where pcs idea of the following words is obviously impossible to make any process move do the following on the words change problem help create responsibility pleased misdefinition on these words can keep whole case from moving it is not necessarily true that clearing these words clears person to reorient thesewords run the following process invent person and when pc has do not acknowledge but add tell his idea of key word this is repetitive question 5 clear up psychosomatics as feasible with what sort of limb organ body would please people tell person that that would please this is actually one command with two questions which are used repetitively until psychosomatic or illness is markedly alleviated this is done to give pc confidence in the auditor and certainty that something can happen in processing it will only work if the first four steps are complete and in good working order 6 clear up desires about new or different states of mind with what sort of mind personality as needful with those who cannot understand what mind is would please people tell person that that would please this is actually one auditing command with two questions there is acknowledgment after the first question only after the second this is used repetitively 7 isolate basic rock by any method run rock help bracket on it or boost out with what sort of rock as found would please people tell person that that would please see above for running directions 8 run general help and step 6 as given first one then the other until case is clean taking up any of above as needful to keep auditor and pc cleared and in session if you do these things with any case you should wind up with clear the length of time it takes depends upon the auditors skill in getting the auditing done and is much less modified by severity of case l ron hubbard lrhmdrd copyright 1958 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 20 august 1958 present time problemrunning of auditors are occasionally unsuccessful in running present time problems life computations and service facsimiles because they themselves are not alert to the definition of problem problem is twoterminaled single terminal cannot make problem the basic problem is postulatecounter postulate therefore when the preclear says his wife is present time problem and the auditor runs problem of comparable magnitude to wife he is not running problem at all he is running condition for this to be problem the wife would have to include another terminal an auditor should make the preclear define the problem accurately as problem not as condition or situation the problem of my wifes desire for another man is problem the problem of my husbands fooling around with machinery is problem wherever pt problem arises it is up to the auditor to locate an actual problem and get the preclear to describe it he then runs invent problem of comparable magnitude to that problem thereafter frequently he says describe that problem to and makes sure each time he does that the problem is described as problem not single terminal or condition when running pt problem he also asks does that seem to be problem to you now failure to get the preclear to define the problem as problem will result in failure to relieve the pt problem and the auditor and the preclear may proceed into the session believing implicitly that they have run the pt problem when as matter of fact they have not even touched it but have in actuality run the conditions of single terminal probably the biggest holdup in all intensives is this fact of misdefinition of problems and in passing it may be remarked that given clear procedure the biggest delay on clearing is the failure of the auditor to run pt problems and arc breaks it might also be said that the preclear only protests violently about arc breaks under one of the two following conditions i the auditing is actually very bad and 2 the pt problem has not been run as rough rule of thumb it could be said that given wellintentioned auditing preclear only protests about arc breaks when pt problem has not been isolated and run the problems connected with being audited being preclear the auditor have been rather uniformly overlooked by auditors and cases which tend to hang up in processing are usually hung up on these l ron hubbard lrh mdcden copyright 1958 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 20 august 1958 out of sessionness the mechanisms used by the preclear in living to keep his attention off the rock are to get involved with many present time problems and arc breaks we used to believe that thetan had to have problems this is not true thetan thinks he needs problems to keep his attention exteriorized from the rock chain and when the rock is not run out he will continue to dream up problems in present time to keep his attention enforcedly fixed elsewhere than the rock chain thetan will also dream up arc breaks to exteriorize his attention from present time problem the common denominator of all locks on the rock is arc breaks therefore in running the rock expert auditing is necessary since in this case as in other the preclear will dream up arc breaks when his attention flicks back to the rock when he is between sessions he will get himself involved in present time problems and arc breaks obsessively to keep his attention from going back on to the rock chain thus we have the answer to the fact that session will not progress unless the present time problem is run and alleviated and we also have the answer to the arc break difficulties if the preclear is unsuccessful in keeping his attention off the rock by present time problem he will then dramatize the rock chain which is another combination of motives which explains preclear behavior the moral of this story is to run out pt problems and to patch up all arc breaks or you will not find and run any rocks l ron hubbard lrhmdrd copyright 1958 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedaxioms logics by l ron hubbardthe axioms of dianetics by l ron hubbard axiom 1 the source of life is static of peculiar and particular properties axiom 2 at least portion of the static called life is impinged upon the physical universe axiom 3 that portion of the static of life whlch is impinged upon the physical universe has for its dynamic goal survival and only survival axiom 4 the physical universe is reducible to motion of energy operating in space through time axiom 5 that portion of the static of life concerned with the life organisms of the physical universe is concerned wholly with motion axiom 6 the life static has as one of its properties the ability to mobilize and animate matter into living organisms axiom 7 the life static is engaged in conquest of the physical universe axiom 8 the life static conquers the material universe by learning and applying the physical laws of the physical universe symbol the symbol for the life static in use hereafter is the greek letter theta axiom 9 fundamental operation of theta in surviving is bringing order into the chaos of the physical universe axiom 10 theta brings order into chaos by conquering whatever in mest may be prosurvival and destroying whatever in mest may be contrasurvival at least through the medium of life organisms symbol the symbol for the physical universe in use here after is mest from the first letters of the words matter energy space and time or the greek letter phi axiom 11 life organism is composed of matter and energy in space and time animated by theta symbol living organism or organisms will hereafter be represented by the greek letter lambdaaxiom 12 the mest part of the organism follows the laws of the physical sciences all lambda is concerned with motion axiom 13 theta operating through lambda converts the forces of the physical universe into forces to conquer the physical universe axiom 14 theta working upon physical universe motion must maintain harmonious rate of motion the limits of lambda are narrow both as to thermal and mechanical motion axiom 15 lambda is the intermediate step in the conquest of the physical universe axiom 16 the basic food of any organism consists of light and chemicals organisms can exist only as higher levels of complexities because lower levels of converters exist theta evolves organisms from lower to higher forms and supports them by the existence of lower converter forms axom 17 theta via lambda effects an evolution of mest in this we have the waste products of organisms on the one hand as those very complex chemicals which bacteria make and on the other hand we have the physical face of the earth being changed by animals and men such changes as grass holding mountains from eroding or roots causing borders to break buildings being built and rivers being dammed there is obviously an evolution in mest in progress under the incursion of theta axiom 18 lamdba even within species varies in its endowment of theta axiom 19 the effort of lambda is toward survival the goal of lambda is survival the penalty of failure to advanlce toward that goal is to succumb definition persistence is the ability to exert contlnuance of effort toward survlval goals axiom 20 lambda creates conserves maintains requires destroys changes occupies groups and disperses mest lambda survives by animating and mobilizing or destroying matter and energy in space and time axiom 21 lambda is dependent upon optimum motion motion which is too swift and motion which is too slow are equally survival axiom 22 theta and thought are similar orders of static axiom 23 all thought is concerned with motionaxiom 24 the establishment of an optimum motion is basic goal of reason definition lambda is chemical heat engine existing in space and time motivated by the life static and dlrected by thought axiom 25 the basic purpose of reason is the calculation or estimation of effort axiom 26 thought is accomplished by theta facsimiles of physical universe entities or actions axiom 27 theta is satisfied only with harmonious action or optimum motion and rejects or destroys action or motion above or below its tolerance band axiom z8 the mind is concerned wholly with the estimation of effort definition mind is the theta command post of any organ ism or organisms axiom 29 the basic errors of reason are failure to differentiate amongst matter energy space and time axiom 30 rightness is proper calculation of effort axiom 31 wrongness is always miscalculation of effort axiom 32 theta can exert itself directly or extensionally theta can direct physical application of the organism to the environment or through tbe mind can first calculate the action or extend as in language ideas axiom 33 conclusions are directed toward the inhibition maintenance or accelerations of efforts axiom 34 the common denominator of all life organisms is motion axiom 35 effort of an organism to survive or succumb is physical motion of life organism at given moment in time through space definition motion is any change in orientation in space definition force is random effort definition effort is directed force axiom 36 an organisms effort can be to remain at rest or persist in given motion static state has position in time but an organism which is remaining positionally in static state if alive is still continuing highly complex pattern of motion such as the heart beat digestion etcthe efforts of organisms to survive or succumb are assisted compelled or opposed by the efforts of other organisms matter energy space and time definition attention is motion which must remain at an optimum effort attention is aberrated by becoming unfixed and sweeping at randon or becoming too fixed without sweeping unkown threats to survival when sensed cause attention to sweep without fixing known threats to survival when sensed cause attention to fix axiom 37 the ultimate goal of lambda is infinite survival axiom 38 death is abandonment by theta of life organism or race or species where these can longer serve theta in its goals of infinite survival axiom 39 the reward of an organism engaging upon survival activity is pleasure axiom 40 the penalty of an organism failing to engage upon survival activity or engaging on nonsurvival activity is pain axiom 41 the cell and virus are the primary building blocks of life organisms axiom 42 the virus and cell are matter and energy animated and motivated in space and tlme by theta axiom 43 theta mobilizes the virus and cell in colonial aggregations to increase potential motion and accomplish effort axiom 44 the goal of viruses and cells is survival in space through time axiom 45 the total mission of higher organisms viruses and cells the same as that 0f the virus and cell axiom 46 colonial aggregations of viruses and cells be imbued with more theta than they inherently contained life energy joins any group whether group of organisms or group of cells composing an organism here we have personal entity individuation etc axiom 47 effort can be accomplished by lambda only through the coordination of its parts toward goals axiom 48 an organism is equipped to be governed and controlled by mind axiom 49 the purpose of the mind is to pose and resolve problems relating to survival and to direct the effort of the organism according to these solutionsaxiom 50 all problems are posed and resolved through estimations of effort axiom 51 the mind can confuse position in space with position in time counter efforts producing action phrases axiom 52 an organism proceeding toward suryival is directed by the mind of that organism in the accomplishment of survival effort axiom 53 an organism proceeding toward succumb is directed by the mind of that organism in the accomplishment of death axiom 54 survival of an organism is accomplished by the overcomming of efforts opposing its survival note corollary for other dynamics definition dynamic is the ability to translate solutions into action axiom 55 survival effort for an organism includes the dynamic thrust by that organism for the survival of itself its procreations its group its subspecies its species all life organisms material universe the life static and possibly supreme being note list of dynamics axiom 56 the cycle of an organism group of organisms or species is inception growth recreation decay and death axiom 57 the effort of an organism is directed toward the control of the environment for all the dynamics axiom 58 control of an environment is accomplished by the support of pro survival factors along any dynamic axiom 59 any type of higher organism is accomplished by the evolution of viruses and cells into forms capable of better efforts to control or live in an environment axiom 60 the usefulness of an organism is determined its ability to control the environment or to support organisms which control the environment axiom 61 an organism is rejected by theta to the degree that it fails in its goals axiom 62 higher organisms can exist only in the degree that they are supported by the lower organisms axiom 63 the usefulness of an organism is determined the alignment of its efforts toward survival axiom 64 the mind perceives and stores all data of the environment and aligns or fails to align these accordingly to the time they were perceivedaxiom 65 the process of thought is the perception of the present and the comparlson of it to the perceptions and conclusions of the past in order to direct action in the immediate or distant future corollary the attempt of thought is to perceive realities of the past and present in order to predict or postulate realities of the future axiom 66 the process by which life effects its conquest of the material universe consists in the conversion of the potential effort of matter and energy in space and through time to effect with it the conversion of further matter and energy in space and through time axiom 67 theta contains its own theta universe effort which translates into mest effort axiom 68 the single arbitrary in any organism is time axiom 69 physical universe perceptions and efforts are received by an organism as force waves converted by facsimile into theta and are thus stored definition randomity is the alignment through the internal or external efforts by other forms of life or the material universe of the efforts of an organism and is imposed on the physical organism by counter efforts in the environment axiom 70 any cycle of any life organism is from static to motion to static axiom 71 the cycle of randomity is from static through optimum through randomity sufficiently repetitlous or similar to constitute another static axiom 72 there are two subdivisions to randomity data randomity and force randomity axiom 73 the three degrees of randomity consists of minus randomity optimum randomity and plus randomity axiom 74 optimum randomity is necessary to learning axiom 75 the important factors in any area of randomity are effort and counter effort note as distinguished from nearperceptions of effort axiom 76 randomity amongst organisms is vital to continuous survlval of all organisms axiom 77 theta affects the organism other organisms and the physical universe by translating theta facsimilies into physical efforts or randomity of effortsdefinition the degree of randomity is measured by the randomness of effort vectors within the organismisms or between organisms and the physical universe axiom 78 randomity becomes intense in indirect ratio to the time in which it takes place modified by the the effort in the area axiom 79 initial randomity can be reinforced by randomities of greater or lesser magnitude axiom 80 areas of randomity exist in chains of similarity plotted against time this can be true of words and actions contained in randomities each may have its own chain plotted against time axiom 81 sanity consists of optimum randomity axiom 82 aberration exists to the degree that plus of minus randomity exists in the environment or past data of an organism group or species modified by the endowed self determinism of that organism group or species axiom 83 the self determinism of an organism is determined by its theta endowment modified by minus or plus randomity in its enyironment or its existence axiom 84 the selfdeterminism of an organism is increated by optimum rand0mityof counter efforts axiom 85 the selfdeterminism of an organism is reduced by plus or minus randomity of counter efforts in the environment axiom 86 randomity contains both the randomness of efforts and the volume of efforts note an area of randomity can have great deal of confusion but without volume of energy the confusion itself is negligible axiom 87 that counter effort is most acceptable to an organism which most closely appears to assist lts accomplishment of its goal axiiom 88 an area of severe plus or minus randomity can occlude data on any of the subjects of that plus or minus randomity which took place in prior time note shutoff mechanisms of earlier lives perceptics specific incidents etc axiom 89 restimulation of plus mlnus or optimum randomity can produce increased plus minus or optimum randomity respectively in the organismaxiom 90 an area of randomity can assume sufficient magnitude so as to appear to the organism as pain according to its goals axiom 91 past randomity can impose itself upon the present organism as theta facsimiles axiom 92 the engram is severe area of plus or minus randomity of sufficient volume to cause unconsciousness axlom 93 unconsciousness is an excess of randomlty imposed by countereffort of sufficient force to cloud the awareness and direct function of the organism through the minds control center axiom 94 any counter effort which misaligns the organisms command of itself or its environment establishes plus or minus randomity or if of sufficient magnitude is an engram axiom 95 past engrams are restimulated by the control centers perception of circumstances similar to that engram in the present environment axiom 96 an engram is theta facsimile of atoms and molecules in misalighment axiom 97 engrams fix emotional response as that emotional response of the organism during the receipt of the counter effort axiom 98 free emotional response depends on optimum randomity it depends upon absence of or non restim ulation of engrams axiom 99 theta facsimilies can recombine into new symbols axiom 100 language is the symbolization of effort axiom 101 language depends for its force upon the force which accompanied its definition note countereffort not language is aberrative axiom 102 the environment can occlude the central control of any organism and assume control of the motor controls of that organism engram restimulation locks hypnotism axiom 103 intelligence depends on the ability to select aligned or misaligned data from an area of randomity and so discover solution to reduce all randomity in that area axiom 104 persistence obtains in the ability of the mind to put solutions into physical action toward the realization of goalsaxiom 105 an unknown datum can produce data of plus or minus randomity axiom 106 the introduction of an arbitrary factor or force without recourse to natural laws of the body or the area into which the arbitrary is introduced brings about plus or minus randomlty axiom 107 data of plus or minus randomity depends for its confusion on former plus or minus randomity or absent data axiom 108 efforts which are inhibited or compelled by exterior efforts effect plus or minus randomity of efforts axiom109 behavior is modified by counter efforts which have impinged on the organism axiom 110 the component parts of theta are affinity reality and communlcation axiom 111 selfdeterminism consists of maximal affinity reality and communication axiom 112 affinity is the cohesion of theta affinity manifests itself as the recognition of similarity of efforts and goals amongst organisms by those organisms axiom 113 reality is the agreement upon perceptions and data in the physical universe all that we can be sure is real is that on which we have agreed is real agreement is the essence of reality axiom 114 communication is the interchange of perception through the material universe between organisms or the perception of the material unverse by sense channels axiom 115 selfdeterminism is the theta control of the organism axiom 116 self determined effort is that countereffort which has been received into the organism in the past and integrated into the organism for its conscious use axiom 117 the components of selfdeterminism are affinity communication and reality selfdeterminism is manifested along each dynamic axiom 118 an organism cannot become aberrated unles it has agreed upon that aberration has been in comunication with source of aberration and has hal affinity for the aberratoraxiom 119 agreement with any source or prosurvival postulates new reality for the organism axiom 120 nonsurvival courses thoughts and actions require nonoptimum effort axiom 121 every thought has been preceded by physical action axiom i22 the mind does with thought as lt has done with entlties in the physical universe axiom 123 all effort concerned wlth paln ls concerned with loss organisms hold pain and engrams to them as latent effort to prevent loss of some portion of the organism all loss is loss of motion axiom 124 the amount of counter effort the organism can overcome is proportional to the theta endowment of the organism modified by the physique of that organism axiom 125 excessive countereffort to the effort of life organism produces unconsciousness corollary unconsciousness gives the suppression of an organisms control center by countereffort definition the control center of the organism can be defined as the contact point between theta and the physical universe and is that center which is aware of being aware and which has charge of and responsibility for the organism along all its dynamics axiom 126 perceptions are always received in the control center of an organism whether the control center is in control of the organism at the time or not this is an explanation for the assumption of valences axiom 127 all perceptions reaching the organisms sense channels are recorded and stored by theta facsimile definltion perception is the process of recording data from the physical universe and storing it as theta facsimile definition recall is the process of regaining perceptions axiom 128 any organism can recall everything which it has percelved axiom 129 an organism displaced by plus or minus randomity is thereafter remote from the perception recording center increased remoteness brings about occlusions of perceptions one can perceive things in present time and then because they are being recorded after they passed theta perception of the awareness unit they are recorded but cannot be recalledaxiom 130 theta facsimiles of counter effort are all that interpose between the control center and its recalls axiom 131 any counter effort received into control center is always accompanied by all perceptics axiom 132 the random counter efforts to an organism and the intermingled perceptions in the randomity can re exert that force upon an organism when restimulated definition restimulation is the reactivation of past counter effort by appearance in the organisms environment of similarity toward the content of tiie past randomity area axiom 133 selfdeterminism alone brings about the mechanism of restimulation axiom 134 reactivated area of the past randomity impinges the effort and the perceptions upon the organlsm axiom 135 activation of randomity area is accomplished first by the perceptions then by the pain finally by the effort axiom 136 the mind is plastically capable of recording all efforts and counter efforts axiom 137 countereffort accompanied by sufficient enrandomed force impresses the facsimile of the countereffort personality into the mind of an organism axiom 138 aberration is the degree of resldual plus or minus randomity accumulated by compelling inhibiting or unwarrented assisting of efforts on the part of other organisms or the physical material universe aberration is caused by what is done to the individual not what the individual does plus his selfdeterminism about what has been done to him axiom 139 aberrated behaviour consists of destructive effort toward prosurvival data or entities on any dynamic or effort toward the survival of survival data or entities for any dynamic axiom 140 valence is facsimile personality made capable of force by the counter effort of the moment or receipt into the plus or minus randomity of unconsciousness valences are assistive compulsive or inhibitive to the organism control center is not valenceaxiom 141 control center effort is aligned toward goal through definite space as recognized incident in time axiom 142 an organism is as healthy and sane as it is self determined the environmental control of the organism motorcontrol inhibits the organisms ability to change with the changing environment since the organism will attempt to carry forward with one set of responses when it needs by selfdeterminism to create another to survive in another environment axiom 143 all learning is accomplished by random effect axiom 144 countereffort producing sufficient plus or mlnus randomity to record is recorded with an index of space and time as hidden as the remainder of lts content axiom 145 counter effort producing sufficient plus or minus randomity when activated by restimulation exerts itself against the environment or the organism without regard to space and time except reactivated perceptions axiom 146 counterefforts are directed out from the organism until they are further enrandomed by the environment at which time they again activate against the control center axiom 147 an organisms mind employs counter efforts effectively only so long as insufficlent plus or minus randomity exists to hide differentiation of the facsimiles created axiom 148 physical laws are learned by life energy or by impingement of the physical universe producing randomity and withdrawal from that impingement axiom 149 life depends upon an alignment of force vectors in the dlrection of survival and the nullification of force vectors in the direction of succumb in order to survive corollary life depends upon an alignment of force vectors in the direction of succumb and the nullification of force vectors in the direction of survive in order to succumb axiom 150 any area of randomity gathers to it situations similar to it which do not contain actual efforts but only perception axiom 151 whether an organism has the goal of surviving or succumbing depends upon the amount of plus or minus randomity it has reactivated not residualaxiom 152 survival is accomplished only by motion axiom 153 in the physical universe the absence of motion is vanishment axiom 154 death is the equivalent to life of total lack of life motivated motion axiom 155 acquisition of prosurvival matter and energy or organisms in space and time means increased motion axiom 156 loss of prosurvival matter and energy or organisms in space and time means decreased motion axiom 157 acquisition or proximity of matter energy or organisms which assist the survival of an organism increase the survival potentials of an organism axiom 158 acquisition or proximity of matter energy or organisms which inhibit the survival of an organism decrease its survival potential axiom 159 gain of survival energy matter or organislms increace the freedom of an organism axiom 160 receipt or proximity of nonsurvival energy matter or time decrease the freedom of motion of an organism axiom 161 the control center attempts the halting or lengthening of time the expansion or contraction of space and the decrease or increase of energy and matter this is primary source of invalidation and it is also primary source of aberration axiom 162 pain is the balk of effort by countereffort in great intensity whether that effort is to remain rest or in motion axiom 163 perception including pain can be exhausted from an area of plus or minus randomlty still leaving the effort and countereffort of that plus or minus randomity axiom 164 the rationality of the mind depends upon an optimum reaction toward time definition sanity the computatlon of futures definition neurtic the computation of present tlme only definition psychotic computation only of past situations axiom 165 survival pertains only to the future corollary succumb pertains only to the present and pastaxiom 166 an individual is as happy as he can perceive survival potentials in the future axiom 167 as the needs of any organism are met it rises higher and higher in its efforts along the dynamics an organism which achieves arc with itself can better achieve arc with sex in the future having achieved this it can achieve arc with groups having achieved this it can achieve arc with mankind etc axiom 168 affinity reality and communication coexist in an inextricable relationship the co existent relationship between affinity reality and communication is such that none can be increased without increasing theother two and none can be decreased without decreasing the other two axiom 169 any aesthetic product is symbolic facsimile or combnation of facsimiles of theta or physical universes in varied randomities and volumes of randomities with the interplay of tones axiom 170 an aesthetic product is an interpretation of universes by an individual or group mind axiom 171 delusion is the postulation by the imagination occurances in areas of plus or minus randomity axiom 172 dreams are the imaginative reconstruction of areas of randomity or the resymbolization of the efforts of theta axiom 173 motion is created by the degree of optimum randomity introduced by the countereffort to an organisms effort axiom 174 mest which has been mobilized by life forms is in affinity with life forms than non mobilized mest axlom 175 all past perception conclusion and existence moments including those of plusor minus randomity are recoverable to the control center of the organism axiom 176 the ability to produce survival effort on the part of an organism is affected by the degrees of randomity existing in its past this includes learning axiom 177 areas of past plus or minus randomity can be readdressed by the control center of an organism and the plus or minus randomity exhausted axiom 178 the exhaustion of past plus or minus randomities permits the control center of an organism toeffect its own efforts toward survival goalsaxiom 179 the exhaustion of self determined effort from past area of plus or minus randomity nullifies the effectiveness of that area axiom 180 pain is the randomity produced by sudden or strong counter efforts axiom 181 pain is stored as plus or minus randomity axiom 182 pain as an area of plus or minus randomity can re inflict itself upon the organism axiom 183 past pain becomes ineffective upon the organism when the randomity of its area is addressed and aligned axiom 184 the earlier the area of plus or minus randomity the greater selfproduced effort existed to repel it axiom 185 later areas of plus or minus randomity cannot be re aligned easily until earlier areas are re aligned axiom 186 areas of plus or minus randomity become increased in activity when perceptions of similarity are introduced into them axiom 187 past areas of plus or minus randomity can be reduced and aligned by address to them in present time axiom 188 absolute good and absolute evil do not exist in the mest universe axiom 189 that which is good for an organism may be defined as that which promotes the survival of that organism corollary evil may be defined as that which inhibits or brings plus or minus randomity into the organism which is contrary to the survival motives of the organism axiom 190 happiness consists of the act of bringing alignment into hither to resisting plus or minus randomity neither the act or action of attaining survival nor the accomplishment of this act itself brings about happiness axiom 191 construction is an alignment of data corollary destruction is plus or minus randomity of data the effort of construction is the alignrnent toward the survival of the aligning organism destruction is the effort of bringing randomity into an area axiom 192 optimum survival behaviour consists of effort in the maximum survival interest in everything concerned in the dynamicsaxiom 193 the optimum survival solution of any problem would consist of the highest attainable survival for every dynamic concerned axiom 194 the worth of any organism consists of its value to the survival of its own theta along any dynamicthe axioms of scientology by l ron hubbard axiom 1 life is basically static definition life static has mass motion wavelength location in space or in time it has the ability to postulate and to perceive axiom 2 the static is capable of considerations postulates and opinions axiom 3 space energy objects form and time are the result of considerations made andor agreed upon by the static and are perceived solely because the static considers that lt can perceive them axiom 4 space is viewpoint of dimension axiom 5 energy consists of postulated particles in space axiom 6 objects consist of grouped particles axiom 7 time is basically postulate that space and particles will persist axiom 8 the apparency of time is the change of posltion of particles in space axiom 9 change is the primary manifestation of time axiom 10 the highest purpose in the universe is the cre ation of an effect axiom 11 the considerations resulting in conditions of existence are four fold asisness is the condition of immediate creation without persistence and is the condition of existence which exists at the moment of creation and destruction and is different from other considerations in that it does not contain survival b alterisness is the consideration which introduces change and therefore time and persistence into an asisness to obtain persistency c isness is an apparency of existence brought about by the continuous alteration of an asisness this is called when agreed apon realityd notisness is the effort to handle isness by reducing its condition through the use of force it is an apparency and cannot entirely vanquish an isness axiom 12 the primary condition of any universe is that two spaces energies or objects must not occupy the same space when this condition is violated perfect duplicate the apparency of any universe or any part thereof is nulled axiom 13 the cycle of action of the physical universe is create survive persist destroy axiom 14 survival is accomplished by alterisness and notis ness by which is gained the persistency known as time axiom 15 creation is accomplished by the postulation of an as isness axiom 16 complete destruction is accomplished by the postulation of the asisness of any existence and the parts thereof axiom 17 the static having postulated asisness then practices alterisness and so achieves the apparency of isness and so obtains reality axiom 18 the static in practicing notisness brings about the persistence of unwanted existences and so brings about unreality which includes forgetful ness unconsciousness and other undesirable states axiom 19 bringing the static to view asis any condition devaluates that condition axiom 20 bringing the static to create perfect duplicate causes the vanishment of any existence or part thereof perfect duplicate is an additional creation of the object its energy and space in its own space in its own time using its own energy this violates the condition that two objects must not occupy the space and causes vanishment of the object axiom 21 understanding is composed of affinity reality and communication axiom 22 the practice of notisness reduces understanding axiom 23 the static has the capability of total knowingness total knowingness would consist of total arc axiom 24 total arc would bring about the vanishment of all mechanical conditions of existence axiom 25 affinity is scale of attitudes which falls away from the coexistence of static through theinterpositions of distance and energy to create identity down to close proximity but mystery by the practice of isness beingness and notisness refusal to be individuation progresses from the knowingness of complete identification down through the introduction of more and more distance and less and less duplication through lookingness emotingness effortingness thinkingness symbolizingness eatingness sexingness and so through to notknowingness mystery until the point of mystery is reached some commu nication is possible but even at mystery an attempt to communicate continues here we have in the case of an individual gradual falling away from the belief that one can assume complete affinity down to the conviction that all is complete mystery any individual is somewhere in this knowtomystery scale the original chart of human evaluation was the emotion section of this scale axiom 26 reality is the agreedupon apparency of existence axiom 27 an actuality can exist for one individually but when it is agreed with by others it can then be said to be reality the anatomy of reality is contained in isness which is composed of asis ness and alterisness isness is an apparency it is not an actuality the actuality is asisness altered so as to obtain persistency unreality is the consequence and apparency of the practice of notisness axiom 28 communlcation is the consideration and action of impelling an impulse or particle from source point across distance to receipt point with the intention of bringing into being at the receiptpoint duplication of that which emanated from the source point the formula of communication is cause distance effect with attention and duplication the component parts of communication are consideration intention attention cause sourcepoint distance effect receiptpoint duplication the velocity of the impulse or particle nothingness or somethingness noncommunication consists of barriers barriers consist of space interpositions such as walls and screens of fast moving particles and time communication by definition does not need to be twoway when communication is returned the formula is repeated with the receiptpoint now becoming sourcepoint and the former source point now becoming receipt point axiom 29 in order to cause an asisness to persist 0ne must assign other authorshlp to the creation than his own otherwise his view of it would cause its vanish ment any space energy form object individual or physical universe condition can exist only when an alteration has occurred of the original asisness so as to prevent casual view from vanishing it in other words anything which is persisting must contain lie so that the original consideration is not completely duplicatedaxiom 30 the general rule of auditing is that anything which is unwanted and yet persists must be thoroughly viewed at which time it will vanish if only partially viewed its intensity at least will decrease axiom 31 goodness and badness beautifulness and ugliness are alike considerations and haye other basis than opinion axiom 32 anything which is not directly observed tends to persist axiom 33 any asisness which is altered by notisness by force tends to persist axiom 34 any isness when altered by force tends to persist axiom 35 the ultimate truth is static static has mass meaning mobility wavelength time location in space space this has the technical name of basic truth axiom 36 lie is second postulate statement or condition designed to mask primary postulate which is permitted to remain examples neither truth nor lie is motion or alteration of particle from one position to another lie is statement that particle having moved did not move or statement that particle not having moved did move the basic lie is that consideration which was made was not made or that it was different axiom 37 when primary consideration is altered but still exists persistence is achieved for the altering consideration all persistence depends on the basic truth but the persistence is of the altering consideration for the basic truth has neither persistence nor impersistence axiom 38 1 stupidity is the unknowness of consideration 2 mechanical definition stupidity is the knowness of time place form and event thus we see that failure to discover truth brings about stupidity thus we see that the discovery of truth would bring about an asis ness by actual experimentthus we see that an ultimate truth would have time place form or event thus then we perceive that we can achieve persistence only when we mask truth lying is an alteration of time place event or form lying becomes alterisness becomes stupidity the blackness of cases is an accumulation of the cases own or anothers lies anything which persists must avoid asisness thus anything to persist must contain lie axiom 39 life poses problems for its own solution axiom 40 any problem to be problem must contain lie if it were truth it would unmock an unsolvable problem would have the greatest persistence it would also contain the greatest number of altered facts to make problem one must introduce alterisness axiom 41 that into which alterisness is introduced be comes problem axiom 42 mest matter energy space time persists because it is problem it is problem because it contains alterisness axiom 43 time is the primary source of untruth time states the untruth of consecutive considerations axiom 44 theta the static has location in matter energy space or time it is capable of consideratlon axiom 45 theta can consider itself to be placed at which moment it becomes placed and to that degree problem axiom 46 theta can become problem by its considerations but then becomes mest problem is to some degree mest mest is problem axiom 47 theta can resolve problems axiom 48 life is game wherein theta as the static solves the problems of theta as mest axiom 49 to solve any problem it is only necessary to become theta the solver rather than theta the problemaxiom 50 theta as mest must contain considerations which are lies axiom 51 postulates and live communication not being mest and being senior to mest can accomplish change in mest without bringing about persistence of mest thus auditing can occur axiom 52 mest

broad activities of man could be considered to be the resolving of the activities of the mind itself hence the logics carry to this point and then proceed as axioms concerning the human mind such axioms being substantiated as relative truths by much newly discovered phenomena the ensuing axioms from logic 24 apply less to the various ologies than they do to aberrating or improving the operation of the mind it should not be thought that the following axioms are devoted to the construction of anything as limited as therapy which is only incidental to the resolution of human aberration and such things as psychosomatic illnesses these axioms are capable of such solution as has been demonstrated but such narrow application would indicate very narrow scope of view postulate

ability to confront thetans thought time life energy matter and space the theory of auditing the preclear has lost confidence in his ability to face existence and its parts and has difficulty in participation he is trapped in many of those things he has failed to confront or has been prevented from confronting or has prevented others from confronting or didnt exist by gradient scales his confidence in confronting thought time life energy matter and space is improved the rule is find something the preclear can confront and improve that ability this normally begins with some part of an auditor in less able cases it begins with thought of the auditors or the preclears auditing is not erasure erasure dramatizes lost things to confront where an auditor can be confronted and makes corny errors the preclear stops being able to confronthence the graph goes down on arc breaks only therefore the stress on smooth auditing present time problem makes it hard for the preclear to confront the session therefore the stress on handling present time problems auditing has as its sole liability confronting on viait may look to the auditor that he is using the pc preclear to confront things and this can be restimulative if the auditor doesnt know what he is doing if the auditor is actively preventing the pc from confronting anything or has as his goal never permitting the pc to confront theres trouble to hand arc in auditing is the ability to be in or at distance from something r the ability to coexist with something c the ability to transmit thought between two or more points thus we see that the minimum of two anything is needed for the conditions of arc to occur in actuality the thetan incurs liability in confronting or not confronting being in or not being in things and thus total confronting or total nonconfronting are attainable goals the thetan believes things about confronting or necessities to confront or not to confront and so becomes aberrated not straightlined to confront knowing is necessary unknown confronting or not confronting when uncovered gives us the phenomenon of cognition and that is the definition of itauditing is that process which restores confidence in confronting and undoes necessity to confront thought time life energy matter and space theory of auditing it should be realized that an optimum clear procedure should take preclear from the lowest possible levels up to clear earlier procedures 19571958 did not attempt to address every case but were content to handle about 50 of the preclears the remainder had to have special address just as cases therefore auditors adopted the idea that on one hand there was clear procedure and on the other hand low level procedurethey did not place one above the other in gradient scale to clear this particular clear procedure does that in use it should be realized that different cases require different emphasis an easy case would not demand tedious command clearing suspicious probing to break nonexistent occlusions or emphasis on the lower steps indeed these lower steps could be skipped up to cch 0 it is all matter of judgment how long and hard to run which two errors are potential both rest on accurate case estimation the commonest is to overestimate the level of the case and not uncommon to audit high level case with very low level processes the answer is to audit the case one is auditing not some other case or ones own case since estimation and auditorsensitivity are subject to variety and error one cannot cleanly estimate the length of time required to clear anyone only approximations are possible and these are varied by possible environmental difficulties of the preclear during auditing ie daily present time problems of crushing magnitude we are not today in the area of thousands of hours however we are in the area of hundreds of hours in any case sane or insane i cite an example woman suffering from postpartum psychosis was audited 600 hours on cch 1 2 3 4 before she turned sane long enough for the auditor to snap off the case the valence of her dying brother at which moment she turned stably sane only then could she have been audited on less fundamental steps however auditors are not concerned with the insane but often address relatively unconscious people this example is cited as the most extreme time in auditing we have on record with modern technique i would not be surprised that with all variables introduced some case required 800 hours to clear on jigsaw puzzle test such case would have failed to have fitted single piece in the first 30 seconds by our present method of estimation there are several means of establishing an idea of length of time in processing from present state to clear the minimum in any case would be three weeks 75 hours the probable maximum would be 1000 hours between these extremes we have most people the peak of the cure would probably be around 250 hours as estimated by older clearing methods anxieties to attain faster pushbutton clearing defeat most research these speed methods violate the reality of the preclear and too thoroughly evaluate for him in all cases of clearing it is only the reality of the preclear which milestones the gains that reality requires certain speed of advance while being audited also preclear is living and his surroundings require his attention man is somewhat cautious he must adjust himself within his own ideas of security the auditor always knows what is wrong with the preclear long before the preclear finds out one must permit the preclear to find out that discovery is only assisted never blackjacked into being see psychiatry the greatest flub of the russian civilization by tom esterbrook the patient is part of the therapya lesson the russ school never learned therefore clear procedure starts where it should cch 1in running the cchs set procedure is followed not only with the single process but with the series one will discover that only one of the series of cch 1 2 3 4 bites the first time through it is useless to run very long on the ones that dont bite example an auditor does cch 1 for an hourno bite he does cch 2 for an hour or sono bite he does cch 3 and it bites he does it for few hours and cch 3 levels off bit now he returns to cch 1 and finds it bites he flattens it bit does cch 2 for an hour cch 3 for couple of hours and when he starts cch 4 now this one bites he flattens it in few hours goes back to cch 1 etc the processes cch 1 2 3 4 are all of piece they are done in series fashion not as individual items cch 1 2 3

startle preclear who thought he was in session all the time to do this throws pc out of session also you cant end session that was never started 2a establish auditor clear auditor with pc discuss any successful auditing in the past even successful doctoring shake pc loose from heavy arc with past practitioners not by running down practitioners but getting pc to realize he has been helped develop this into process who should i be to help you successfully get it flat then run what am i doing 2b establish preclear put preclear more in session with goalswhat would you like to accomplish through scientology what would you like to accomplish in this session the foregoing two we care little about we now hit this hard what are you willing to have happen in this session we get final clear answer to this even if it takes an hour of twoway comm then we establish what are you absolutely certain will happen in finite period of time such as ten minutes or one hour 2c establish problems if any run is there any place you would like to be more than here when this is threshed out is there any place you should be rather than here this may bring any present time problem to view if it does audit it with what part of that problem could you be responsible for if pc is too agitated to run this or if twoway comm cuts his havingness badly run factual havingness look around here and find something you have when this can be left look around here and find something that you would continue when this can be left look around here and find something you would permit to vanish then return to first again the order may be reversed some cases may run 250 of the third before finding one of the first or second factual havingness can resolve present time problems which are always and only threats of loss if preclear seems hard to audit is in propitiation does obsessive agreement has hypnotic eyelid flutter or in general seems unnatural about talking or not talking you can put pc into session and get present time problem most rapidly by spending real time on this what question shouldnt i ask you and sort it out on meter with twoway comm then ask question again etc until pc is really talking to the auditor the goal of present time problems or problems is to get pc in session the goal of this what question shouldnt i ask you is not to learn the pcs secrets but to get pc to talk freely to auditor accomplishing this one thing on hitherto nonadvancing pc is great thing and will make the pc advance faster than anything else get the pc to talk to you honestly then take up present time problems directly do you have present time problem preclear says he does but needle on meter doesnt move ask question few more timesis there anything worrying you you can say for variation if needle still doesnt drop forget it if needle drops pursue it and run only the problem that drops dont run problems that dont drop keep your eyes on the meter while handling pc with present time problems expand what falls not something else pc cant confront his problems therefore the drop vanishes easily comes back and drops again this can fool an auditor badly if he doesnt watch his meter and take up to run and discuss only the drop note if the meter is stage four idle swing not clear but pc cant affect meter which only swings up sticks falls and so forth on same patterna stage four needle has stick in the top of its oscillation clear needle doesnt or if it is too stuck to show fall on problem play safe run factual havingness or connectedness this exact way to run present time problem can make full intensive command when problem located describe that problem to now make sure pc does accept any version pc gives you but only follow through on version that drops on meter if the version drops run the following for two or five commands what part of that problem could you be responsible for then whether drop onmeter vanishes or not say describe that problem to now if the described problem did not drop buy it but dont run it say again describe that problem to now if you can handle this type of problemhandling if you got pc to really talk to you you can practically clear case on this since it gets out of case the succumb postulates that war against betterment this is the scale of succumb problems from the bottom up how to go unconscious how to feel nothing how to go insane how to escape how to die how to get shed of responsibilities so one can die how not to care how to endure how to get better how to live how to live better there are inner levels the basic problem is whether all problems are whether or how whether to survive or succumb decisions to do either are if obsessive the stable data in the center of the major confusions when pc is sitting there in heavy succumb postulates his goals and the auditors goals are on opposite vectors therefore preclears who dont get better arent trying to get better matter how much they say they are hence whole case can run on this provided some havingness is also run from time to time in brief this is where running present time problem well gets to remember problem is not condition or terminal it is how or whether it is doingness not person my wife is answer to present time problem question how to live with my wife is problem whether or not to live with my wife is problem my wifes illness is not problem how to cure my wifes illness is problem sometimes pc will come right down on an old stable decision about the problem and say it isnt problem to now the auditor must not buy this he wants to know why until pc is off the old solution and can go on describing problems how to be audited how to stay in session whether the auditor has pcs interest at heart such present time problems are very much in order to ask about to completely flatten any problem it is necessary to run not responsible for but invent problem of comparable magnitude to that problem this is run in the same way as above but is given more commands for each version handed out by the pc this is the problem command if you want it flat forever dont lose this process or command from your repertoire 2d getting auditor and pc established take up any arc breaks with pc or any breaks between pc and past auditors always clear away arc breaks dont dodge them as an auditor explaining why the break occurred is an auditors code violationevaluation saying that the arc break didnt occur or was the pcs fault is an auditors code violationinvalidation when an auditor fails to take responsibility for the arc break he loses the responsibility of running the sessionwhich of course causes session to cease to exist the relative destructive value of an arc break is greater than the failure always handle cch 0 in every session well except when giving not session but an assist only tr 11 tr 11 arc straight wire that process best calculated to orient pc in his past is arc straight wire commands recall something that was really real to you thank you recall time when you were in good communication with someone thank you recall time when youreally liked someone thank you the three commands are given in that order and repeated in that order consistently position auditor and preclear seated facing each other at comfortable distance purpose to give the student reality on the existence of bank this is audited on another student and is audited until the other student is in present time it will be found that the process discloses the cycling action of the preclear going deeper and deeper into the past and then more and more shallowly into the past until he is recalling something again close to present time this cyclic action should be studied and understood and the reality on the pictures the preclear gets should be thoroughly understood by the student the fact that another has pictures should be totally real to the student under training history developed by l ron hubbard in 1951 in wichita kansas this was once very important process it has been known to bring people from neurotic to sane level after only short period of application it has been run on group basis with success but it should be noted that the thinkingness of the individuals in the group would have to be well under the control of the auditor in order to have this process broadly beneficial when it was discovered that this process occasionally reduces peoples havingness the process itself was not generally run thereafter it is still however an excellent process with that proviso reduction of havingness in some cases many cases have achieved their first step upward with the process it is process which known gives the pc the comfortable feeling that he at least has stopped getting worse and that there is something that permits him to hold his own in the 20th acc lectures i described how all entheta receives its charge from theta arc in the bank makes arc breaks possible reorientation of arc can be more important than one realizes the way to blow arc breaks can be more arc even psychotic may rise up to merely neurotic on arc straight wire the cyclic aspect of arc straight wire must receive attention you dont want to know what when he recalls something you want to know when ask when was that frequently and you will see pc slide into past and then return to present time as regular cycle dont end the process while pc is still in past dont finish the process with comm bridge that leaves him in the past just warn him that the process will soon end and stop it when pcs recall was of near present time thing you get lots of past lives in view this way buy them lasting and easily obtained results were gained in 1956 by using just two processes with the 1958 theory of auditing above it is easy to see why these are basically confrontingness processes they were scs and connectedness i developed these two for use in combination for standardization of processing for whole firm that was having its employees processed in london in 1956 the results were so good that mary sue hubbard while director of processing london used the same regimen on all preclears with uniformly astonishing results the exact regimen used in that period was as follows simple scs on objects with pc and auditor seated at table then scs on the body then keep it from going away and hold it still on two small objects with pc seated using first one object then the other and always touching them with his hands at command finally subjectively on facsimiles keep it from going away and hold it still throughout connectedness was used to bolster havingness as needed with the command you make that indicated object connect with youthe regimen as given here was superseded because auditors unsupervised tended to complicate the processes and not until short time ago did we learn that the best answer to an auditors desire for more information was repetition of what he was told the first time he didnt understand the original and so wanted new one further in supervised processing there has been frailty in that the auditor sometimes reported i did what you said and it didnt work an unwary supervisor then gives him new process to do wary one says in reply to the above what didnt work and usually discovers that the supervisors directions were neither remembered nor run this set of factors has accounted for many abandonments of sops standard operating procedures which were in actuality working like mad only the people they were given to never used them only said they did and fed bad data back it is the role of supervisor to get the process he gave out run not another version of it cch 3c the rationale behind scs was simple it placed the pc in the auditors control and it placed the pcs body under his own control but there is more to scs than this since it is also confrontingness process cch 3c name scs on person start change and stop on person commands there are three sets of commands each one of which is run until it is relatively flat the commands are as follows now we are going to start the body when i say start you start that body in this indicated direction all right start the commands for change are as follows indicating four positions on the floor one after the other this we are going to call spot this we are going to call spot b this we are going to call spot c and this we are going to call spot d do you have that all right when i say change i want you to change the position of that body from to b all right change the same applies for the other positions the commands for stop are as follows now i want you to get that body moving in indicated direction and when i say stop i want you to stop that body all right move that body stop each one of the commands is followed with the question did you start that body did you change the position of that body did you stop that body position auditor and preclear ambulant auditor accompanies preclear as he walks and occasionally touches him and turns him around manually as needed to assist the preclear purpose to give the preclear good control of his body and to exteriorize him training stress stress is on precision of the motion and command history developed by l ron hubbard in 1955 as an exteriorization process first discovered in 1952 was the fact that person which is to say thetan stays as close to an object as he has confidence in his controlling of it gp3 connectedness the basic form of any havingness process is connectedness after one flattens scs one then runs connectedness on the preclear commands you get the idea of making that object connect with you auditor points b if pc isnt looking at object with mest bodys eyes use following look at that object you get the idea of making that object connect with youc on blind humans feel that object you get the idea of making that object connect with you there is new version of havingness called factual havingness it is used in conjunction with any subjective process such as those subjective processes which follow factual havingness commands look around here and find something you have look around here and find something that you would continue look around here and find something you would permit to vanish confrontingness the earliest clearing process made more workable by repetitive commands and broad understanding achieved in the ensuing 11 years is made part of the most modern 1958 procedure i was clearing people in 1947 by getting them to look at locks secondaries engrams circuits and the physical universe i cleared lot of people in about 100 hours each all i did was renew their confidence in being able to look at their pictures i turned on sonic tactile the works with renewing confidence lessening fear three years later dianetics the modern science of mental health was written its processes are slanted toward teaching people to audit and are the result of people not doing and saying they did dianetics the modern science of mental health processes are good they are the best training processes re banks there are they train an auditor better than they clear pc we now return to earliest clearing with what we now call confrontingness see theory of auditing above in general we persuade the pc to confront things at his own gradient scale of willingness we find an ability to confront and we improve it body confrontingness this is close to specific for chronic somatic auditor what part of that body can you confront pc elbow auditor what part of that elbow can you confront best pc the wrist auditor thank you this is the whole cycle of the command the auditor does not correct the pc when part of becomes some other part of the bodysubjective confrontingness general version what mental view can you confront what part of it can you confront best thank you the above wording allows for dark fields and other phenomena and runs easily on an occluded case for person who has pictures and sensations more specific form using pictures as well as emotions feelings sounds thoughts etc can be used there can be and will be many versions of confrontingness given suffice here that the above work well and can form an entirety of clearing they are refinement simplification of the first version of clearing and should work as well today participation we must not overlook the factor of participation in life participation in session is necessary for processing to work it is achieved by bettering the factor confronting auditing toward the goal of total nonconfront is eventually to achieve total non participation this is highly undesirable destruction as an impulse has as its goal the removal of the need to confront when one can confront he does not need to destroy unwillingness to confront is the source of most have to be processed one is asking the auditor to destroy all these horrible things obsessive confronting is almost as bad cant confront it so ill prove i can by confronting it foreverand ill keep on creating it to prove i can confront it the mechanics of the bank can be worked out on such basis participation is only possible when one can also confront gradient scale of confronting can lead to participation without being overwhelmed survival all processes since the earliest endeavors in this search have aligned on survive continuance in factual havingness expresses this factor the postulate to survive is invalidative of the fact that thetan cannot do otherwise the whole key to brainwashing and punishment is that they make thetan postulate survival which is continuous confronting this is handled by various versions of confronting creating reactive bank comes from obsessive creating thetans answer to being threatened or struck is to create his basic training is all aligned along creating something this factor is used in various ways in processing usually inherent in process help probably the first thing that will have to be taken up in some cases is the subject of help to this degree help is part of cch 0 in establishing an auditorpreclear relationship people who do not volunteer to be audited at all will require help orientation as the first step five hours on help with such person using twoway bracket is often well spent but such bracket must be exceptionally well audited without arc breaks to begin an intensive or to repair arc breaksaside from the above help is of vast importance the first burning question when we approach help as process is what condition would you have to be in to get help this is usually the condition the pc is in the repetitive command for this is mock up or invent somebody in such condition that they would receive help help on the rock the rock is the thing the preclear uses to reach people it is an object far back on the track it is confrontingness on via the emeter is used to locate stuck object this is lock on the rock the stuck can be freed by using connectedness on the room always help bracket on the rock use in this exact order one command at time how could _______ help itself how could you help _______ how could _______ help you how could i help _______ how could help how could another person help _______ how could _______ help another person how could others help _______ how could _______ help others how could you help yourself how could i help myself how could you help how could i help you the command words but not as whole phrase are cleared often every 3 brackets and the pc is asked for his opinion only of the word help and the item his answer is not challenged general help bracket how could you help yourself how could you help how could i help you how could i help myself how could you help another person how could i help another person how could another person help you how could another person help how could another person help another person responsibility the basic clearing process using responsibility is you make picture for which you can be wholly responsible this flattened can make clearit uses the fact that person is making his whole bank anyway and it persuades him to realize it some version of responsibility is required to end all clearing assignment of responsibility is at the bottom of the search for phenomena and magic to clear people answers everyone who does not change in processing is being an answer he has it made therefore there is an opposite side to problems that is answers mock up problem for which you are or your condition is the answer origins originations the original version was what origin of yours has been mishandled recall time when you were pleased with that person shorter version is what origin of yours has been handled properly any creation is an origin in communication line for the purposes of auditing hence the importance of origins the buttons there are certain buttons which depress clearing if the pc has erroneous definitions for them these are change problem help pleased create responsibility confront various processes redefine them in action this is such process invent person who likes the button step 6 cleared person is longer in confusion about help or who makes the mockups help and step 6 were the early 1958 clues to clear these are still used as tests and even when their running is brief they must be run caution it is almost fatal to run step 6 if the rock is not out how to run step 6 select simple nonsignificant objects run in front of that body you mock up _______ and keep it from going away did you thank you then use all directions from the bodybehind that body to the left of that body to the right of that body above that body below that body run 6 objects each on 6 sides of the body on keep it from going away then proceed to in front of that body you mock up and hold it still same procedure then in front of that body you mock up and make it little more solid there is acknowledgment by auditor after pc mocks it up and keeps it from going away etc or the did youthere isacknowledgment only after full command is executed otherwise acknowledgments will thin the pcs mockups note the objects should be simple at first leading on up to complexity but at first keep them simple and nonsignificant read and understand scientology 88008 and use an emeter throughout valuable side process here decide to make mockup decide that will ruin the game decide not to do it also this one decide to make mockup everyone can see decide that would ruin the game decide not to do it in the above there are several roads to clear but there are also several levels of case to be cleared experience tells one what to run auditing skill alone gets the experience across the original 1947 processes were defeated in the hands of others by lack of auditing drills and skill help and step 6 do not work on low level cases to make clears of everyonehence the cchs by doing all of the above on every case you would certainly have clears in all cases as your experience increases you can begin to omit steps you will finally be able to adjust the processes to the exact cases you do get the preclear in session run something youll win lrhrd l ron hubbard

office 37 fitzroy street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 15 october 1958 procedure cch this lecture is final summing up of the previous cch pabs interrupted at pab 138 and should be read after those have been digested it was given by l ron hubbard to the hgc staff auditors in washington dc on 23 august 1957 thinkingness in general should not be suspected to be under anybodys control it is probably more under the auditors control than it is under the preclears when i say or ask is the preclears thinkingness under control i want you to understand that it is less under the preclears control at any time than under the auditors the auditor can certainly control the preclears thinkingness better than the preclear can but before you can do this you must first get the preclears body and attention under control condition to running trio is is the person and attention under your control to assume that the power of choice is also under the preclears controlmuch less his thinkingnessis of course completely wrong this condition then moves trio way up on the present scale of processes in order to give the preclear some havingness after cch 0 to 5 has been flattened i have developed an undercut to trio trio is directive process and should be prefaced by get the idea of having that clock get the idea of having that picture indicated picture on the wall etc thats highly directive and would keep thinkingness of rough case under control the second version is get the idea that it is all right to permit that indicated object to continue it is also just an indicating process the third section of this trio is the clincher get the idea of making that indicated object disappear one runs disappear instead of dispense with or not know small objects are much easier for the preclear to make disappear than large ones you have not told him to make it disappear but only to get the idea of making it disappear preclears usually literally interpret you and try like mad to make it disappearand it usually does for short time i have solved the enigma of exteriorization why doesnt preclear exteriorize easily and stay exteriorized we ask the accompanying question why does preclear get sick when one asks him to conceive static obviously we would have to get somebody to conceive static before he could himself stay comfortably outside his bodys headthe answer to this problem is contained in the process recall moment of loss loss prevents the preclear from conceiving static he associates static with loss he says all right if there is nothing there ive lost it or ive lost something there therefore id better not conceive static conceiving static is therefore painful the truth of the matter is whenever he lost anything something disappeared all right the funny part of it is that he never noticed that he didnt lose totally every time he still had other objects he lost his tie pin but he still has his tie hes still got the floor the room this universe space etc but he never realizes this in these instances and that is why we run this process recall moment of loss to accustom somebody to conceiving static very directly on loss and to get him to exteriorize an individual cannot conceive static if he associates static with lossif the loss is painful so we have to cure him of the painfulness of loss consideration of before we can exteriorize him easily we do this by going back to automaticity the universe has been taking things away from him it has become an automaticity and we find that the universe has an automaticity known as time and time itself is consecutive series of losses so we have to cure the preclear of losses before we can get him to appreciate time otherwise he would be so afraid of losing it that hed stick himself on the track and we get the stuck on the track phenomenon the process recall moment of loss aimed at this but the third command of control trio as this series of processes had better be called get the idea of making that indicated object disappear handles it very well this gets the preclear to take over the automaticity of all of the losses which he has unwillingly experienced the universe has been taking the things away from him and just spotting objects and getting the idea that they are going to disappear or are disappearing takes over the automaticity of losses and he becomes accustomed to it after while all of the invisible masses that preclears have around them are actually simply symptoms of massloss massloss when an individual has visio the only thing that he is looking at is stuck loss he is looking at the nothingness of something that was there so one takes over that automaticity with the third command of control trio and one therefore has very highly directional workable set of processes each part of that trio would be run relatively flat and go on to the next part and i would say that one would run each part certainly not hundred commands each and the auditor should endeavor to stay in that order of magnitude and just run it round and round take somebody with glasses for example his eyesight will do more tricks in less time on this third command of control trio than one can imagine things will go black well why do things go black blackness makes things disappear and one takes over the automaticity of blackness to make things disappear night grabs the way of the universe once in every 24 hours on earth here this is the process we have been looking for to turn on visio if you want to turn on sonic with this you would have to go down to noisy part of town and just run trio on sound but you wouldnt dare run control trio on sound if the preclear did not already have it flat on objects visio turns on before sonic there are many things one could do with this process people who have anaesthetized areas in their bodylike they have chest etcdo weird things during this process i wanted to tell you particularly about this particular process because it is specific and will be found to be very useful to you we had to find out if one version of this would run without killing preclear and that is recall moment of loss actually recall moment ofloss should act as havingness process because it asises all of the lost points on the track and it should be havingness process all by itself but we didnt want to be so bold as to run it with havingness until i find out differently this control trio and recall moment of loss are making bid for our chief exteriorization processes now here is process which is based on our old recall secret the version is entirely straight wire the auditor explains to the preclear that he is not looking for hidden data to evaluate it he is only asking the preclear to look at the data he then makes list of valences paying great attention to those the preclear considers unimportant or is very slow to divulge then the auditor takes this list and runs repetitive straight wire 1951 as follows think of something you might withhold from valence the auditor repeats this question over and over until communication lag is present he never says something else you might withhold from valence because the auditor wants the preclear to think of some of these many times before selecting another valence the auditor runs little locational or trio he then takes the next valence the same way the list is covered once and then the same list is covered again the object is speed cover many people given time the auditor can do the same thing on all dynamics there is variation instead of valence body parts may be used think of something you might withhold from that body part leave sexual parts or obvious psychosomatic difficulties until last dont begin on withered arm for example it is amusing to realize that this process overlords all early psychotherapies but they using this effort to locate secrets thought that divulgence and confession were the therapeutic agents these have bearing on workability further early efforts naively thought there was one secret per case actually there are billions it is easy to get into past lives on this basic secret is that one lived before whenever you run withhold on valence you finish up with cant have on the valence and have for the preclear it flattens off better that way you will often find that it is more advantageous to run locational processing than problems of comparable or incomparable magnitude at times problem of comparable magnitude is all right but it is thinkingness process and on case that is having an awful lot of trouble with it it gives them hell to run locational processing but nevertheless it does run out the present time problem which is most fascinating any one of the rudiments is an excellent process twoway communication is great and does not asis havingness you have to keep the reality of twoway comm very high though and be willing to interrupt obsessive outflows and silences of the preclear it is establishing high level of reality it consists of the auditor feeding experimental data to the preclear to have him look it over and decide about it one way or the other you dont let the preclear in two way comm asis everything he knows thinks or wants to do the latest addition to the rudiments is clearing the auditor actually the crudest way known of clearing the auditor is who do i remind you of tell something you like about the best way of clearing the auditor we know of is in training 15 which is could i help you how could you help how could i help anybody else how could you help anybody else how do other people ever help other people do women ever help women do men ever help men do men ever help women etc you beat it to pieces on big long bracketthis goes so far that it becomes fantastic process in itself you take father and mother valences and they are usually quite hot you can run this on help this is usually quite necessary on case that is going to hang up because the only reason he is sitting there is to waste help one has to understand that this case is trying to waste help and it isnt matter of find the auditor in the rudiments today but clear the auditor and the only point on which he is cleared is helpcan i help you can you help we use handbook for preclears to give the preclear some homework at the hubbard guidance centers and it has been helping out just to the degree that it does some clarification on goals and gets the preclear stirred up it simply stirs up the case so that it will run out i was running over phrenological questionnaire and it said people are never permitted to do anything they want to do and this is the best goal of discipline i got this tangled out in one way or the other i got thinking about it from the standpoint this was about 20 years agoof i wonder if there is anybody around that could articulate with great conciseness what he would like to do and i have found on all hands failure to articulate was the main difficulty person had the feeling that he wanted to do something and that it would be wonderful but it was all in sensory capacity if he could have been made to articulate this it would really have been something and i experimented on it little bit and we see that today in the handbook for preclears if you can get person to articulate in session anything about the future you have won the subject of goals but it must be in the alignment of this persons frame of reference it must be aligned with his lifenot aligned with something we think he ought to live so lets take look at the clearance of goals goals would not be likely to run on high generality in other words they are specific personal and intimate it is what do you think what do you want what is aligned to your life lets look at goals as process one could run goals for 25 hours with the greatest of ease one could run the present time problem for 25 hours and we just had report of terrific win here on preclear who was run on locational for 25 hours so it looks as though the rudiments could be the session we discover preclear in the terrible condition of not wanting any auditing not going any place and all of his goals being somebody elses goals two things can be done immediately clear the auditor and then run goals goals could be run with twoway comm in this manner you ask the preclear what he is absolutely sure would happen in the next couple of minutes the next hour day from now week from now one month from now and one year from now we want something that the preclear is absolutely sure would happen we are running right there the reverse process of atomic bombs which say future futureno future that is basically what is wrong with person why does he get jammed on the track it is because of future he had been denied to point where his loss was so great that he dared not own i had case by the way which was one of the roughest cases i have ever run into he put on the total appearance of being sanedramatized sanityand yet the case would make odd remarks like i really think people are crazy well why do you think people are crazy i would say well because people say they can tell right from wrong and you know theres difference it was fascinating he would make odd remarks like this from time to timeone day he made remark on goals well its really best to tell people that things cannot happen to them because otherwise they might hope they could and then they would be disappointed this person was stark staring mad and had future of any kind five hours just this one question is there anything going to happen in the remainder of this afternoon will anything happen the rest of today is there anything going to occur any place in the world the rest of today was run on him and his confident answer with great certainty was finally we broke through it and i finally got the person to admit that there was some slight possibility that there would be room here for the rest of the day that busted the case it read from total nofuture up this case was an isolated one as we have had occasionally now and then an inspirational sort of process cracked them through well now we see this process of goals on the basis of futures and person without futures cannot have fancy future called goal and all goal is is fancy future determined by the person if he has future at all determined by anybody then he isnt going to go anywhere from that point and any goal he has is totally unreal the best way that i know of to clear up goal is as follows with twoway comm is there anything that is going to happen in the next couple of minutes we get this thrashed out until he has got some great big certainty that there will be something couple of minutes from now then we gradiently move it up and we get certainties at each one of these stages and levelsregardless of on what the person knows there is going to be future there now lets have him put something in this future he has now created he has created future and has certainty on it now lets put some desire in the future and we get goal now what would you like to have happen in the next couple of minutes or what would you like to do in the next couple of minutes tomorrow next week etc we will get weird things which have desire in them they will all be getrid ofs and if you finally plowed him down on it he would get down to the bottom of the ladder which is knock this body off right now and when he says i would like to get over my fear of darkness i would like to get over feeling bad every time my mother screams at these arent desires these are runaways flinches these are lets not confront it lets get out of the universe lets scram and the final result is the basic postulate if i could just get rid of this body right this instant i would be all right so that process doesnt even vaguely get flat unless there is real goal like id like to have stick of candy that is goal real goal preclears will modify their goals in some way or another of course i cant because i have to work and i dont have any money and yak yak yak they are modified goals and as long as they modify them they dont have goal because they are making postulate and the mest universe is kicking the postulate in on them so we do this on gradient scale of time so that goals become real to them l ron hubbardhubbard

course i want to welcome you to the communication course it seems that communication course is necessary as the first step to an auditor and if an auditor doesnt successfully pass the communication course then to the end of any curve he has as an auditor there will be something wrong with his auditing it is very odd that one of the highest levels of indoctrination tone 40 on an object is most often unsuccessfully approached by student at the hpa or hca level when he has flunked the one i am going to talk about right now which is newcomers first look inside the academy at communication and that is dear alice part it would have amused you the other day to have found former director of training of an organization being sent back by the hco board of review coach in his coaching to dear alice so that he could get good enough to pass tone 40 on an object but it was absolutely necessary that this happen because he had for some reason or another being an oldtimer and having been in it for long time never hit dear alice it had been omitted from his training in spite of all the auditing he had done and all the experience he had had at the end of this time we find him sitting up in the coaching room good as gold perfectly comprehensible doing dear alice part aa man who has probably audited two or three thousand hours worth but everywhere he had difficulty with preclear that difficulty stemmed from an inability to do dear alice part which is in effect to deliver an auditing command in unit of time as completed cycle of actionhe delivered an auditing command well now you have to get up to step 2 and even step 3 before you can call it full cycle of action but as far as the auditor is concerned in dear alice part only his job is done when he has delivered an auditing command to preclear he didnt deliver it over the hills and far away or to the window he delivered it to being and he delivered it from where he was to where the preclear wasand its so easy anyone to whom this was described briefly insufficiently out in the street would flunking it at the same time tell you of course i can communicate to people well yes theres nothing to it im salesman you know i run the atomic energy omission im big man of course i communicate to anyone we look in that mans vicinity and nobodys heard anything hes said since the days of noahs ark he never said it to anybody in the first place he sort of throws things out you know and he just hopes they land well thats what passes for communication and it isnt by long wayshe throws out statement of some sort or another and he thinks hes communicating with somebody its great oddity but i must confess to you at this moment that the third dynamic is simply an agreement it is an agreement which people have agreed to and therefore it has an existence and we certainly cannot live in this world without it but its violation of the communication formula violation of it the only thing that you can talk to in the finalanalysis is living being and all third dynamics are composed of individual dynamics and you can summate them and you can say this is third dynamic and that is the agreement on which we go and it is quite factual and they are quite actual unless we stress them with the communication formulaso that you dont talk to all preclears you talk to preclear there was fellow by the name of franklin delano roosevelt that never talked to the nationhe never talked to the nationhe talked to an individual citizen and therefore he communicated there was another fellow who spoke the most beautiful english i have ever heard almost incomprehensibly parsed perfect would have passed any oxford english professors most critical look and that was herbert hoover and i dont think herbert hoover ever said hello to dog i dont think in his whole life he ever said anything to anybody anywhere and when this man uttered pronunciamentos they pronounced nothing to anybody anywhere and therefore he couldnt lead nation out of depression he couldnt lead anything for an excellent reason he had concept in the final analysis of talking to an individual of getting his communication to land right there now this is touchy point that i open up you say well how about you ron you talk to an awful lot of people well thats the whole secret of scientologyi dont talk to an awful lot of peoplei talk to you i havent any concept of large multitude that reads my books or listens to my lectures i can get multiple concept of talking to great many at the same time by talking to every one of them individually therefore i perhaps add little conceit to the line but i do communicate therefore someone wanting to know how to speak to crowd would first begin with dear alice part so it is very very far from an unimportant step it is not just the entrance step that you have to get through to get your communication course over so you can really learn something that is not what it is it is the first door that opens and that door opens when it opens and it opens when you can communicate statement from you to person we wont worry about preclear because really the person in dummy auditing who is sitting there as preclear is really coach you know but youve got to get something across from you to that person and it has to be from you to that personit has to be communication and when you can do that well youre all set i once told somebody that if he had very difficult studentnot youbut if he had very very difficult student the thing to do with this difficult student would be to put him through seven weeks of dummy auditing and then teach him in the last week to remedy havingness and turn him loose with certificate and it would be safe investment we would be perfectly safe in doing that but to give him one week when he needed two or three on dummy auditing and then try to cram him full of data and hope that the processes would carry him through somehow didnt make an auditor it made liabilityboth to himself and to preclears so this first step is not just an easy oneit is the toughest step youll perform in scientology and thats why its right at the beginning its to say something to somebody with the full confidence that they will receive it and thats quite trick all right how exactly is this done we give person book the book is alice in wonderland why alice in wonderland well thats just because it is further significance we give him this book and he is supposed to find any sentence in that book that he cares to find these people who just want to read the book consecutively to the preclear are not doing dummy auditing they again are not in communication with the preclear he is supposed to find line now he doesnt put alice said or the queen said or something like that on the line he just puts the statement itself you see why do they run so fast well the book says why do they run so fast the queen asked well we dont use the queen asked we just say why do they run so fastall right he picks that up out of the book why out of book why not out of his head oh remember remember somethingin using the english language you are not using your own ideas you did not invent the words you only helped invent the words that compose the english language you are already using somebody elses ideas now there is nothing wrong with your composing these into new ideas of your own but remember you are already using somebody elses ideas when youre speaking english all right now lets get it little bit further we are given set pat process oh i know i dreamed it up i found it one way or the other but an awful lot of auditors worked with this its had lot of looking at and its become phrased in certain way and that certain way might very well be taken by you out of the textbook and given to the preclear and it wont ever work if you do do fishes swim is not therapeutic procedureits not the repetition of it can be very good for an auditor but its not therapeutic procedure but the statement do fishes swim is not yours really at the beginning is it you got it from the instructor or off of book and then you used it well when does it become yours well any idea is yours that you make yours we wont go along with dialectic materialism and say that ideas are new because thats not true there can be new ideas but if you get an idea from someone else it is not still their idea its your idea there is nothing wrong with misowning ideas theres mass in them to get you confused you take an idea out of book it becomes your idea and then as your idea you relay it to the preclear and that is all there is to it it is coached this way it is not from the book to the preclear it is from the book to the auditor and then the auditor making it his own idea expresses that idea to the preclear in such way that it arrives at the preclear so its from the auditor to the preclear but we give him the book as the third via because most of the material he is going to handle in communication is from source outside himself youve just got to get used to the idea that there is nothing wrong with using another persons ideas i always know what someones state of learning is in scientology when they speak of scientology as your ideas they say ive been reading your ideas i know at once this person cant communicate its great oddity its quite wonderful because they reveal at once that they cannot take this first basic step of taking an idea and then communicating it to someone else they are standing back looking at the world in some large sense and they are not any part of it because they cant own any of the worlds ideas if they cant own any of the worlds ideas then they wont own any of the world because the easiest thing to own is an idea mass to impede it so we coach just exactly in this way we want the person to find phrase in alice in wonderland and then taking that as his own idea communicate it directly to the preclear and he can say it over and over the same phrase if he wishes in any way he wishes to say it until the preclear who is really coach tells him that he thinks it has arrived now sometimes the preclear the first day feels just little bit strange about these communication lines too and sometimes has his entire criticism based upon the erudition the pronunciation the way the auditor holds his little finger while he announces the phrasethis has nothing to do with it it is the intention that communicates not the words and when you have the intention to communicate to the preclear and that intention goes across it will arrive if you broadcast that intention matter if youre saying it in chinese if youre scientologist it will arrive one of the steps of the much higher indoctrination level tone 40 8c consists entirely and completely of saying things in funny voice tones while one is communicating an intentionusing very odd voice tones well this is not part of dear alice the voice tones are unimportant pronunciation is unimportant its whether or not the person could take that idea out of that book own it and then communicate it and the intention must communicate and it must be communicated in one unit of time that is to say it isnt repeated from the last time it was repeated it is new fresh communicated in present time the fiftyfifth command of do fishes swim is the fiftyfifth not the first repeated so we have one unit of time onecommand and the intention and when we have those things relayed across then he can find another phrase and communicate that and that is the way we do that and i hope you find it

street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 1 december 1958 dummy auditing step two acknowledgment compiled from the research material and taped lectures of l ron hubbard dummy auditing step two acknowledgment is the second part of the communication cycle now the actual fact is when you have gotten thought over to preclear it is customary to prove it the whole stress of acknowledgment is entirely and completely upon making sure that the preclear receives the auditors acknowledgment that is the entire stress now why all this stress on acknowledgment well acknowledgment is control factor ill just let you in on secret right here at the beginning if you acknowledge preclear well you will have the preclear under much better control now why the formula of control is start change and stop and thats just itan acknowledgment is stop if you said to him keep going or keep talking you would not be acknowledging him the perfect acknowledgment communicates only this i have heard your communication thats all there is to iti have heard what you said it signalizes that the preclears or persons since scientology applies to life not just to an auditing room communication to you has been received but when you use it as an auditor you use it also as control factor and it says this your communication has been receivedand that is all there is to it and that is the end of that cycle of action thank you thats what it says and you have to put that whole intention into yes or an okay or anything else you use it isnt the word its the intention that ends it your communication has been received and i have now decided to stop that cycle of communication and your communication is therefore under my control those things which you stop very crudely are things which you control you have to be able to stop things if you control them if you cannot control preclears communication line you cant control the preclear ill give you an example of this lets say were auditing mrs gotrocks the wife of the executive manager of fleabite dustpowder or something and she is bored the only thing wrong with her and shes crazy thats the only other thing wrong with her and she never had anything to do and shes just been lying around and she has ailments she comes into the auditing room and she starts to talk to you she says oh ive been to this specialist and that specialist and it cost this much money and that much money and ive been here and ive been there and whats really wrong with and what you really should take up is so and so rah rah rah its none of your business the longer you let such person talk the less havingness they have you can watch them go straight down the arc tone scale if you keep on letting them talk obsessive communicationobsessive outflow and the first major use that you will make of this the first time you really understand what this acknowledgment is all about is when somebody starts this on you and starts talking talking talking talking and you want to get session started and you get the intention real good and you say to them goodand they stop talking your intention was such that they knew that you had received their communication and if you can do this very well if you can get that acknowledgment just right and if it does exactly what it is supposed to do very often the person will look at you fixedly and say you know i dont think anybody has ever heard before why is this person talking obsessively they are trying to make up in quantity what they lack in audience theres nobody listening to them they are not talking to anyone and you all of sudden come up with an acknowledgment and say hey i heard you i heard that you have communicated to and thats it now and they say wow i dont think ive ever talked to anybody before its quite amazing i have seen an auditor on an obsessive outflow case get down in front of the preclear fix him with an eye move his finger back and forth just in front of the preclears nose and say good i heard that and have the preclear all of sudden say ooooh geeeeee you are there arent you so good acknowledgment can actually wind up the entire goal of the process and find the auditorthats how important it is now that is specialized use stopping compulsive outflow its general use is putting period to the communication cycle it ends the moment of time in which you gave the command you learned how to give we hope in dear alice part you said something the preclear heard it and we understood then that the preclear had heard it and we said good now the exact way dear alice part b which is dummy auditing step two is done is this the coachor person acting as precleartakes alice in wonderland and reads random phrases out of it and reading the phrase in any old way we dont care how were not disciplining the preclear you know we never do that we merely control them within an inch of their lives in this particular case this person says something out of alice in wonderland and the auditor has to say good fine okay i heard that anything in such way as actually to convince the person who is sitting there acting as the preclear that he has heard it now there is specific way to do this that is to intend that the communication cycle ends at that point and to end it there anything that you do to make that come about is of course legitimate unless it utterly destroys arc but it finishes cycle of communication so what could the auditor in this case do you see there sits the auditor book there sits the preclear with book and the preclear is reading and the mad hatter dipped his watch into the teapot and the auditor says good but that ends that you see now in view of the fact that the preclear is reading continued story which goes on sentence after sentence after sentence the auditor will have tendency to treat this as in passing and that is not an acknowledgment the auditor could say well read some more thats not an acknowledgmentit didnt stop it did it continue go aheadno thats not an acknowledgment at all an acknowledgment says stopwhoaair brakes periodendheard youyouve communicatedthats the end of that moment of timefinal cyclethats ityouve had it you get that so the auditor has to say good fine okay in such way as to receive the communication in the preclears eyes the preclear has to know that the auditor has received the communication and thats the only point on which they are coached at first then we could start to bear down and say as an instructor well did you acknowledge that preclears communication did you and the auditor says well uhh did you do perfect acknowledgment wellcertainly and the answer to that would be the preclear is still reading still got the book in his hands still going on with it still sitting in the chair and hes still not in this universe what is this all about what are we actually trying to do well were not trying to reach the ultimate in an acknowledgment because that would be the end of the universe if somebody could say yes good or okay with enough intention behind it all communications of this universe from the moment of its beginning would then be acknowledged totally except that this would violate the communication formula because they werent all addressed to him although lots of people think they were but what does the auditor actually feel called upon to do well he feels called upon to put period to that cycle of communication it actually startedyou see with the auditors phrase to the preclear then the preclear signified with some kind of wince or grunt or something that it had been heard and then the auditor says well thats the end of that good fine that finished that you see but an acknowledgment ends the cycle of the communication which you read about in dianetics 1955 and that is the billjoe cycle good says the auditor this is fantastic if you got good enough at this traffic cop would drive up and say something to you and you would acknowledge the fact that he had spoken and he would simply get back on his bike or go back to the station house and turn in his badge and retire you see that would be the end of that that would be it as matter of fact it actually staggers people to have an acknowledgment come to themit staggers them really to get it through people who are having hard time particularly its good thing and its very therapeutic for person to know that he has been acknowledged i know that you will be around in the local stores maybe stopping pedestrian on the street and suddenly looking at him and saying goodacknowledging him and you will have some fantastic things occur if you do an acknowledgment is very very powerful sixteeninch gun in the communication formula and you shouldnt use it sparingly you should use it to end cycles of communication i hope you learn to do that very very wellhubbard communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 6 december 1958 how to run an engram brief summary for hgc use firstonly graduates of accs including the 5th london october 1958 and after are qualified to run engrams by scientology processes this does not include dianetic processing of engrams which can be done by anyone but is not allowed in hgcs reason scientology processing of engrams is too strong for most untrained personnel and better results are obtained by hgc wholly repetitive processes stable data the hgc has the responsibility of using only the processes which obtain the highest results director of processing must bring about only the use of the best processes for wholly repetitive command clearing processes see other bulletins engram running with scientology processes in unschooled hands does not bring about bettered cases by actual test this is evidently due to the roughness of the auditing and failures to handle arc breaks acc trained personnel therefore are the only ones qualified or permitted to run engrams in an hgc locating the engram finding the engram necessary to resolve the case is done by an emeter and finger snaps the emeter is the final check if an emeter is stuck on the pc or stage four rises sticks falls in repetitive cycle and reacts on nothing else cch processes may be used or preferably the 3 commands of factual havingness 8 of vanish 2 of continue to one of have the experience necessary to resolve the case is the engram asked for it is run back in time and located exactly in time the falls of the needle are the equivalent of yes answer to the auditors question only the time is isolated not the content the time may turn out to be span of years the incident may be even century in length in rough case some current lifetime lock may be the incident in very rough unreality case the engram necessary to resolve the case may be the moment the pc walked into the room in majority of cases however the engram necessary to resolve the case is past death complete with its accompanying overt act its place in time is the concern of the auditor questions such as greater than five hundred years less than five hundred years narrow the time down precisely several incidents may be located in passing run that incident which has the steepest fall dont run the earliest necessarily in case of doubt as to which of two falls most pick later incident closer to pt as it will actually be easier for the pc to confront it with this incident selected dont then change it or let the pc change it dont start to run one incident and then change to another ever what you pick flatten to change is to pretty well lose the whole case we arent interested

_____________________________________________________________________ 15 december 1958 dummy auditing step three duplication compiled from the research material and taped lectures of l ron hubbard this interesting interesting dummy auditing step has villainous and vicious goal it makes somebody duplicate way back in 1950 we found out that auditors in order to be interesting would vary their pattern and every time the pattern was varied every time the auditing command changed the preclear received little jolt there was an upset because of it long time ago we would have considered it fairly legitimate for an auditor using the auditing command do fishes swim to say by the way do finny creatures wiggle in the water and next time to say say does the funny tribe batheand the next time to say what brands of fishes are there that progress from point to point b in liquid habitats that possibly would have been legitimate then but we dont do that today we do horrible thing the auditor says do fishes swim and just to vary it he then says do fishes swim and just for good wild variation he then says do fishes swim this is where we learn why we were so insistent on one command in one moment of time back in dear alice part because we dont repeat the first do fishes swim another thousand times auditing command should ever depend for any of its meaning on any other auditing command ever uttered each one exists theoretically and purely in its own moment of time and is uttered itself in present time with its own intention now this is quite important do you know that the basic auditing process of cch does not work unless each command is in separate unit of time if you run it this way give your handthank you give your handthank you give your handthank you its not very therapeutic and nothing happens to the preclear why well weve got machine which is simply repeating the first give your hand over and over again were not saying it theres intention there do you know that if you told somebody to give you his hand with enough intention behind it his body would respond without any via through the thetan the body doesnt obey the words the body obeys the intention to extend hand therefore when you are asked to express an auditing command with the same words over and over and over each time you must express it in present time as itself with its intention it isnt just long duplication of it just duplicating something over and over and over is sometimes so trying that people wonder how auditors ever arrive at all nobody could sit in chair and say each time with new intention do fishes swim for seventyfive hours its beyond human possibility according to some people but the trick is that if its always uttered in present time it could be said for thousand and seventyfive hours its only when its repeatedonly when the first command is repeated over and over and when new intention arrivesthat it becomes very arduous only when it goes on to machine does it become almost impossible to docommunication is reached by control plus duplication at first you find that to make each utterance of the command different in its own unit of time you use different voice inflections but as you come up the line on this you find out that you actually can pattern the same tone and each time have it entirely new it would be very very incorrect to teach this to have the auditor each time duplicate his own voice tones as they were the last time because that is making an auditing command depend on the last auditing command we couldnt care less and after while you couldnt care less either what voice tone youre uttering but each intention is new and fresh the intention is to ask and get an answer to this question do fishes swim and each time you utter it it is uttered newly and in its own area of time thats really the only stress there is one command per unit of time each command separate and each command containing the words quite incidentally do fishes swim here we learn great deal about the duplicative factors of communication we find out that in having to duplicate we think we actually lose some of the communication at first its utterly idiotichow could you possibly maintain arc and therefore of course interest asking person over and over again this silly question do fishes swim who could do this well interest in communication has everything to do with the intention to be interesting and very little to do with text furthermore it is not the auditors job to be interesting being interesting is part of the communication formula but to an auditor the least possible part as far as the preclear is concerned hes not there to interest and intrigue the preclear right away people think they are place two people in chairs facing each other and each one of these two people feels the compulsion to be interesting to the other thats not auditing thats being interesting thats being social and so on so if person had any difficulty doing step three do fishes swim the instructor would be perfectly in order if he simply told the person to sit in that chair and told some other student who wasnt doing too well or just some other student to sit in the other chair and told them just to sit there and look at each other without saying thing or being embarrassed or anything else interesting drill if you think of it we do have variation and therefore interest in the first and second dummy auditing steps but now we reach this one and it is utterly devoid of interest were saying the same thing over and over and over and over and if person cant do this he probably has compulsion to vary to alter is to be interesting and he wouldnt find it easy just to sit in chair and face another human being and not say word and not do thing but just sit there and look at the other human being and if i were coaching someone that had difficulty in repetition of steps i would do that for an hour or two that day all right it is absolutely necessary that an auditor be able to duplicate but answer this is person who is saying something in present time each time really duplicating the last moment of time he really isnt is he and so this duplication that we do in scientology means only the ability apparently to duplicate while being in present time the greatest motto of experience and the life we have lived is this i won t ever do that again this is the one thing your mama wanted you to promise if you did nothing else if you lived completely sinful life why mama still wanted you to learn by experience which is to say that when you did something wrong or did something you werent ever to do it again she hoped perhaps you would eat enough candy to make you so sick that you wouldnt wolf candy again that you would eat enough ice cream so that ice cream would make you so green that you wouldnt make pig of yourself over ice cream again that you would become so embarrassed and lose so many friends that you would not do that evil thing again whatever it was you did and thus learn by experience never to do it again and this is experience talking one thing you must understandthat experience teaches youis never to do anything the second time this doesnt necessarily mean that all experience is painful but people who are having hard time tend to believe that it is and when they begin to depend upon experience and stand by this lesson of never doing it again they can longer duplicate and what do you knowthey cant communicate also their bank jams all sorts of interesting things occur all moments become one moment one moment becomes all moments identification occurs all over the place and just the action of repeating something like do fishes swim as an auditor with full intention has tendency to unjam the time trackyou should know that this is what this step is up against it is violating all of that hard won experience that you have accumulated in the last seventysix trillion yearsif you believe an emeter youre seventysix trillion years old and all that hardwon experience all that wonderful wonderful lot of mess that you got into added up completely to never do it again and so youve been taught not to live which is what happens when you get experience and when you can duplicate an auditing command over and over again you will find out that auditing does not become painful experience person who can do this well by the way never gets restimulated why should hehes not in the moment of time in which the restimulation took place there is more basic step to this particular one by the way this is to pat the wall five times and then distinguish one of the pats from the rest an instructor can do that on student with some profit pretty soon the student can tell all five pats apart and when the student can tell them all apart even though they sounded all the same he can also duplicate an auditing command in present time all the way ive broken cases with that onehubbard communications office

an attempt to give all the known data concerning pregnancy delivery and child care i will someday summarize all these at this time i wish to give you only the processes and general use first woman should not be processed on engrams after the early months therefore pregnant woman should be processed toward clear early and well in other words she should be gotten into good shape soon in the pregnancy old expanded gita on babies husbands wives bodies is definitely indicated after the sixth month only havingness and general scientology processes can be run without injuring the babyno engrams next the delivery itself should carry as little anaesthetic as possible be as calm and talk as possible and the baby should not be bathed or chilled but should be wrapped somewhat tightly in warm blanket very soft and then left alone for day or so at once after delivery the woman should have simple havingness runlook around here and find something you havepreferably by the husband one hour of this at once one more hour same day two hours following day all havingness and havingness only should be run after two days run the following invent something worse thana delivery flatten it baby flatten it doctor flatten it nurse flatten it delivery room flatten it mother flatten it husband flatten it an abdomen flatten it womb flatten it this should be done in next many days following the delivery this and more factual havingness all 3 commands should straighten up the mother it would be well if the six buttons and inventing were cleared away in early pregnancy so the post pregnancy processes will run easily she shouldnt face new processing idea in the first few days after delivery so if the processes are early prepared all will be well on the baby perhaps the best thing is processing for three days then talk to the baby tell the newcomer he or she is welcome then make friends various things can be donetouch assist is best even the birth engram can be run but thats little adventurous in lot of cases the most to know about the baby is not to tire him or her unduly for week or two feed protein formula if mother not breast feeding this formula is most like human milk i picked it up in roman days and have used it since15 ounces of barley water 10 ounces of homogenized milk 3 ounces karo syrup this can be multiplied by any number according to the number of bottles desired but the ratio remains the same evaporated or condensed milkand heavy sugar make fat not bone protein is the thing that heals and makes strong growth modern hospital formulas and patent mixes for babies are not just bad they are criminal then the next important thing for baby is to know he or she is winning dont expect him or her to do more than baby can do grant beingness to baby you make that body lie in that cradle is wonderful on babies up to six months let the child see mama and daddy both at least once day never quarrel or argue in front of baby or childit destroys security always treat mama and baby with courtesy and respect and theyll thrive after all they have done something theyre keeping the human race going l ron hubbard lrh gnrd copyright 1958 by l ron

magazine there is new process allowed in hgc it is arc break straight wire this process belongs after scs and factual havingness and before what can you confront arc break straight wire is form of tr 5 arc break its processing number however is cch50 any and all rules governing straight wire apply including the pc cycles into past and back to pt therefore ask and pin point when b stop the process only with the pc near pt put in bridge therefore without specified number of more times wrong i am going to ask this question three more times and end the process right i am going to ask this question until your answers are close to present time and then end it if thats all right with you then check when on each reply get pc into present time and say are you near present time all right this is the end of the process the command to scientologist is recall an arc break this is for an unlimited type process recall an arc break between us or in an auditing session or with your mother to limit process to this life the first form is preferred the second form is used on sticky valence that has been isolated the unlimited version rapidly dives for whole track and into engrams this is all right but dont stop and change the process just continue to run recall an arc break when the pc gets into heavy weather be very careful with this process to keep the auditors code otherwise 50 of the time is spent getting rid of arc breaks in the session itselfand with this process these are heavy however two auditors coauditing who are bit clumsy can use this process better than other processes and it and factual havingness should be the total activity of an auditor who is having trouble with pc who is having trouble with arc breaks the pc in diving for whole track gets into and out of heavy incidents so long as he answers the question fine dont let him fail to answer every question reality on the whole track leaps up with this process this is the first process that accomplishes this easily in running it remember that the overt act is as important as the motivator see history of man chap 9 the reason gets mad at b is as often because has done something to b as it is because b has done something to here is fine smooth process that is oneshot clear and can be used by auditors not acctrained to run engramsarc break straight wire is very useful in husbandwife coauditing teams and with factual havingness is the only process that should be used in coauditing relationship that is already intimate to point of easily gathering arc breaks from two standpoints the process is the best we have ever had it handles touchy pcs well and b it is the first to open up whole track in general with as great reality or greater than the r on present life from two other viewpoints the process is vulnerable it requires strict observance of the auditors code if you dont want to waste 50 to 75 of the auditing time b it runs the pc into heavy incidents and the process must be continued until pc is again in ptmaking an uncertainty in session timing however the shortcomings are far outweighed by the value of arc break straight wire there is one bug in the process the nonscientologist does not readily grasp the commandand there is substitute for quick question arc break means the assignment of responsibility for sudden drop in affinity reality or communication thee and have feel for this substitute commands are many none as good recall something you have done to personrecall something that has been done to you is fair but misses by mile history this process is in genus very old i introduced its rudiments at the june 1952 first congress in phoenix arizona arc is even older and goes to july of 1950 the present version in narrower form was first used by mary sue hubbard in 1958 the valuable lesson this gives us is that mary or joe or pete may be mad at us because mary or joe or pete did something to us we may or may not have done anything to mary or joe or pete to make them mad at us in other words the pc who comes back into session furious with the auditor may have committed an overt act against the auditor out of session and not prompted by an action of the auditor the wife may be mad at the husband because of something she did to the husband she talked about him behind his back prompted by some old engram about husbands and now having committed this overt act she becomes furious with the husband etc etc the person mad at scientology may only be motivated by having done something to scientology etc etc whole new view of human behaviour opens when you see this point therefore caution the pc to pick up his overt acts against things too while hes running it if hes only getting overt acts against him the only reason the process wont work is that the pc isnt doing it but only pretending to or he doesnt understand it but all in all weve wonderful weapon here to straighten out lot of lives use it with wild abandon and get the results in its good lrh mdrd l

processing to date has been in the main third dynamic processing for the first time i have worked out purely first dynamic process it is used by the auditor on pc with lots of attention to arc breaks havingness and of course smooth skill the process is invent something worse than you theoretically this is one shot clear process it directly changes the being that is making the bankthe thetan it does not hope for change of the person via change of the bank the hgc and any validated auditor can use this with great profit 2 cautions do not permit pc to escape invent do not let him do something else such as see how he is to find if something is worse than the process does not work unless invent something is workable therefore to run it one makes sure first that the pc knows he can invent something the process does not work if the pc also does something else ask the pc what are you doing exactly now and then and make the pc do only the process patch up any arc breaks with what have i done wrong and follow that with what have you done to to get both motivator and overts in the session this is wonderful processsimple to run and do with good resultsif it is done right it is easier to

general dist for use in any official magazine for use in any hgc short sessioning one of the simplest ways to get case moving is technique known as short sessioning which i developed for the 20th acc the 20th was the last acc to teach clearing without engram running and as such had several lagging cases i studied one of these carefully against the basic auditing rule find something the pc can do and then improve his ability to do it the case under study defied all known processes it was unreality unreality unreality and arc break arc break arc break arc straight wire old style was also unreal imagine that however even when all else was lost i still had the idea that this pc could be run on something and finally had long blue sparkthe pc would start and end sessions probably this was the sole ability scientologywise of this pc so i made the auditor start and end tenminute sessions and it worked it worked even though the auditor never really cognited on the value of it i had to heavy8c the auditor bit to keep the auditor from running something short sessioning was evidently not something to do only process was something anyway everybody won the pc got brighter the auditor got win and we got new technique thats the way with scientology everybody winseven the people who claim im too enthusiastic for their point five the exact way to do short sessioning is as follows one uses old rudiments if he isnt comfortable with cch 0 or he uses cch 0 as given in acc clear procedure it doesnt matter much which since he is depending on starting and ending sessions rather than running something therefore the auditor should use that with which he is the most comfortable the auditor gets the pcs agreement to start very short session and says start then he clears up some small thing like an arc break in the session or pt problem without really getting into anything hot finds auditor and pc the auditor then does something objective with the auditing room such as how does this room differ from an ideal environmentprobably by this time the ten minutes are up so the auditor tapers it off and bridges to session end is it all right with you if we end this session shortly is there anything youd like to say before we do all right end of session the auditor makes the pc get up and take break for few minutes then he gets the pc back and does it all over again more or less as above the idea is not to try to get benefit from process but to get the pc less and less nervous about doing something the pc will begin and end sessions anything between is pure gravy if it works but the inbetween may not work at all it does not matter starting and ending sessions is what is wanted for the pc short sessioning works for many reasons it injects time into the picture for one thing it breaks up habits on the cycle of action it gets the pc used to the auditor you could think of many more reasons but basically whatever the reasons it works try it on that case that arc breaks on you all the time try it on the pc that has it all unrealunrealunreal youll be amazed at what short sessioning smoothly run and without crude auditor flubs can do for almost any case not just bad ones

3537 fitzroy street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 1 january 1959 dummy auditing step four handling originations compiled from the research material and tape lectures of l ron hubbard the fourth thing an auditor has to do in that order is to handle an origin from the preclear it is actually true that when you are handling tone 40 processes you do not handle the preclears originations but if you will look on the hcahpa chart you will find that these tone 40 processes are in the minority amongst processes and in all processes not tone 40 preclears originations are handled remember that dont let anybody talk you out of it if you are handling tone 40 which is just pure positive postulating you of course are not worried about anybodys opinion origin condition or anything elseyou simply want him to do certain things and he finds out that his beingness can be controlled and therefore that he can control it what do we mean by an origin of the preclear he volunteers something all on his own and do you know that is very good index of casewhether the person volunteers anything on his own an oldtime auditor used this as case index he said this fellow isnt getting any better he hasnt offered up anything yet you see he didnt originatehe didnt originate communication do you know that that is the hardest thing to get an organization to do to originate communication you actually could work in the direction of getting preclear to originate communication in spite of the fact that you just previously were running him on tone 40 processes he originated the communication that his arms and legs felt like they were just going to fall off and you said give your handthank you preclear says my heads coming off now i know its going to fall on the floor auditor give your handthank you good tone 40 but on control of person the first two processes are tone 40 but book mimicry and the next process up the line from it hand space mimicry are not tone 40 and originations by the preclear are not only handled but encouraged so remember that we have not lost out of the galaxy of processes the fact that the preclear is as well as he can originate communication that means he can stand at cause on the communication formula and that is desirable point for him to reach you see in controlling people we are really only showing them that they can be controlled that it is possible for their possessions to be controlled and then they eventually decide that these are controllable and that people are controllable and that things are controllable and their bodies are controllable and they say wonderful look ill try and before that they didnt even try so we are controlling persons possessions or body only until this person then himself decides to take hand in it too and then he finds out that control is possible but most peopledont originate circuits originate computers originate compulsive outflows originate and when you first start to use tone 40 on person you will apparently see originationsbut they are not originations they are restimulations being dramatized there is big difference between restimulation being dramatized and an origination its whether or not the thetan said it did he say it or was it just circuit starting up well you can start up circuits and actually throw them into being and you will see that these are not originations but when an origination appears in anything but tone 40 process you handle it and you must handle it well and conclusively there are preclears who have had astonishing things happen to them who have tried to communicate them to the auditor who have failed to do so and have then sunk into apathy and just gone right on out of session because their communication origination was not handled properly by the auditor there are instances of this and many of them tone 40 processes do not particularly violate this an understanding of what they are takes place rather rapidly with the preclear and he doesnt expect you to but if he has graduated into being human being and hes getting up there and he originates something and you answer it now hes liable to say the most astonishing things to you and if you dont handle them hes liable to drop into apathy about the whole thing so you must handle them well because theyre always unexpected i would say that unexpectedness actually should be part of the definition of an origination because they are quite often completely off the subject they take you completely by surprise they are apparently not at all what you expected him to say the fellow says huh im eight feet back of my head well what do you do in the old days we might have gone right onto route one but we dont todaywe handle the origination by the way this used to be an old technical phrase he qandad in other words he did what the preclear did any time the preclear changed the auditor changed that is the deadliest crime in auditing the preclear changes because he is being processed and the auditor changes the process qandathe preclear changed the auditor changed well that isnt what you do he says you know the whole back of my head feels like its on fire once upon time we might have handled this we might have gone right in there and said oh thats very good we had finally gotten somatic on this fellow and we would have handled it in some fashion or other and questioned him about it and audited it and so on but we found out that this stuck people on the time track therefore we do not do that any more so what do we do when he says the back of my head is on firedo we ignore it well if we are running tone 40 processes we ignore it but if we are auditing any other process of which there are many in cch we handle the origin and an auditor who has not been trained to do this will often find himself very embarrassed but how about in the walkaway worldthe world that is ambulant and moving around and spinning quietly or noisily as the case may be do you ever have to handle an origin in it well i dare say that every argument you have ever got into was because you did not handle an origin every time you have ever got into trouble with anybody you can trace it back along the line you didnt handle if person walks in and says whee ive just passed with the highest mark in the whole school and you say im awfully hungry shouldnt we go out and eatyoull find yourself in fight he feels ignored he originated communication to have you prove to him that he was there and he was solid most little kiddies get frantic about their parents when their parents dont handle their originations properly handling an origination merely tells the person all right i heard it youre there you might say it is form of acknowledgment but its not it is the communication formula in reverse but the auditor is still in control if he handles the originotherwise the communication formula goes out of his control and he is at effect point longer at cause point an auditor continues at cause point so lets look this over the handling of an origin has great deal of use and until recently it was the least pat step in scientology how did you handle an origin and we finally found out i finally had cognition myself i tried for long time to communicate this to people and they still blundered on it occasionally and i finally found out something that did seem to communicatethere are three steps in handling an origin here is the setup the preclear is sitting in the chair and the auditor is sitting across from the preclear and the auditor is saying do fishes swim or do birds fly and the preclear says yes here is the factor now entering do fishes swim the preclear doesnt answer do fishes swim the preclear says you know your dress is on fire or im eight feet back of my head or is it true that all cats weigh 18 kilograms you see wog wogwhere did this come from well although it is usually circuitry or something like that at work when its that far off beam it is nevertheless an origin how do you handle it well you dont want the preclear to go out of session and he would if you handled it wrongly so 1 you answer it 2 you maintain arc you dont spend any time at it but you just maintain arc and 3 you get the preclear back on the process one two three and if you spend too much time in 2 youll be doing wrong what is an origin all right he says im eight feet back of my head its an origin what are you supposed to do with it well youre supposed to answer it in this particular case you would say to him something in the order of you are you mean something like ive heard the communicationits made an effect on now in maintaining arc you can skimp that second one if you handle the third one expertly enough the least important one is the second one but the most deadly thing you can do is utterly to neglect the second one of maintaining arc thats deadly but you can skip it if you really punch it into the third one which is to say get him back into session so he says im eight feet back of my head and you say you are what he said really hit you know hes kind of wogwog about thishes not sure what this is all about you say you are and the fellow says yes well you say what did i say that made that happen oh you said do birds fly and i thought of myself as bird and i guess thats the way it is but i am eight feet back of my head well thats pretty routine you sayreassure him maintain the arc now what was that auditing question oh you asked do birds fly and you say thats right do birds fly back in session you see you cant do this you cant put it into can and put label on it and say this is how you do it always because its always something peculiar but you can say these three steps are followed i will give you another example you say do birds fly and he says i have blinding headache you do you say is it bothering you thats the arc too much to carry on with the session and youve reached number three at once oh noits pretty bad though well lets go on with this shall we you say maybe itll do something with it maintaining arc he says well all right and youre right back onto it again do birds fly one of the trickiest of these is what in my question reminded you of that the fellow says well so and so and he explains it to you and you say well good do birds fly and youre right back in session againthree parts andthat is the important thingyou have to learn how to handle these things at the same time that we are doing this we can get much more complicated particularly toward the end of the session by just trying out communication bridge communication bridge from do birds fly to do fishes swim and from do fishes swim back to do birds fly communication bridge is very easy thing it simply closes off the process you were running maintains arc and opens up the new process on which you are about to embark if you could look at it as two vs the points facing each other with line between the bottoms of the two vs you would see that one process which you have been running is closed on down to nothing easily by gradients you say how about running this just three or four more times and then well quitokay we give him warning you see that were closing the process off and we do run it three or four more times then we say how are you doing we never ask people by the way how do you feelthis asises havingness we say how are you doing and he says oh not too badly and so on well did anything happen there while we were running do fishes swim and he says i dont know i got little bit of realityi felt like fish for couple of moments there auditor says how do you feel about that and so on is it okay are you doing all right now the preclear says not too badly you say well lets go over onto do birds fly its an interesting process and it just goes like thisi ask you do birds fly and you answer how about running that and he says well all right okay you establish agreement again and away we go actually it is three contracts in row the first contract is to stop the process we are running the next contract is we are in an auditing session binding this as continuing auditing session and the third contract is simply we have new process we would like to run and i want your signature on this dotted line that you will run it that actually is communication bridge the reason we do this is so preclear will not be startled by change for if we change too rapidly in session we stick the preclear in the session every time we give him some warning and that is what communication bridge is for the handling of origins however is most important learn how to handle origins and youll never be taken by surprise by preclear youll be right in there pitching and the session will keep on i have seen an auditor sit with his mouth open for twenty or thirty seconds after some preclear said something fantastic he just didnt know what to make of it well you answer it you maintain arc and you get him back in sessionissue 87 1959 ca early january the magazine of dianetics and scientology from washington dc what are clears l ron hubbard there are three known grades of clear the first is the book one clear this is called mest clear an adequate description of this is to be found in book one the second is theta clear this has been known for years but has only recently been obtained through engram running as taught in the 5th london and 21st american accs and is done in the processing department of the central organization the third is called ot or operating thetan and is rather esoteric level hard to reach hard to describe in full any confusion about the state of clear is confusion of these three terms mest clear theta clear and ot an uninformed public thinks mest clear should act like an ot with magical attributes it is not enough that the general auditor can now approximate book one clear the public striving for unattainable attributes wants an ot who eats buildings the two states if on the same scale are not the same states mest clear knows he has reached the bottom rung of the ladder on his way up he also knows the rest of humanity uncleared is below this state but that they dont know that they are mest clear still thinks of himself more or less as body and is more or less subject to one all engrams are effectually keyed out without being examined for practical purposes they are erased he has excellent recalls they may or may not be eidetic book one clears are bit below the mest clear standard of today if the person making the picture required in eidetic recall makes the picture he has to know first what is in it so why make picture picture is memory on via so the argument about eidetic recall is rather dull one at best it is not my purpose thank god to prove i was right it is my purpose to blaze trail into zones and heights man has not known before i can tell you only what is as i know it nowand i know that eidetic tests of recall do not prove mest clear only freedom from keyedin engrams proves mest clear theta clear is another thingmuch higher than book one or mest clear this is real triumph and im proud of it the fact of real theta clear is only few months old theta clear has obsessive engrams whatever they arent but he can put back at will his reactive bank or any engram in it and blow it off again at glance now that is news theta clear does not have to depend on the body line for his survival he does not have engrams of any kind unless he creates them he does not have to be in head and the state can be obtained in at least 80 of all cases in about 350 hours of auditing or more depending on the auditors skill only the processing department of the central organization or the graduates of the 5th london acc or the 21st american acc are doing this one mest clear however is way station on the road to theta clear or ot so it doesnt much matter what auditor starts you on the wayyour has coauditor professional hca an hcs or bscn or new acc graduate youll win with them all toward the same goal lately i even developed coauditing formula that reaches near mest clear ot of course remains theoretical and is reached through lower clear states so here we go we built bridge and built it better than we hoped its time to start if youve been hanging back the best way to see this elephant is from inside clearing is wonderful conversational material it is better experience l ron hubbardhubbard communications office washington hco bulletin of 6 january 1959 field activities to all scientologists for scientology to go well in any area it is only necessary for the trained auditor in that area to follow the following steps 1 get good results on every pc processed individually 2 operate group and do pe and group processing 3 keep the group recruited it is not necessary that field auditor has great sums of money to finance his activity all successful scientology activities have financed themselves in extreme an auditor with pcs to keep him going can get job and run group evenings until the income of the group activity makes the job unnecessary the keynote of handling any area is to bring order every time you put some order into pc or group or society little confusion blows off ignore the confusion it is transitory order is not it stays therefore the more order not necessarily the more activity you put into things the more continuance you have this is new data extremely important and should be carefully gone over again and again and applied it is data that brings big wins in society group or pc bring little order get the pc to see that he can bring order into his affairs ask him bluntly what order could you bring into your life and his case will start resolving the highest ability of thetan is to bring order therefore orderly processing brings results disorderly processing does not all an arc break is is disorder what order then can trained auditor bring into his area into his own life into his pcs into his group that is the question worth answering the confusion that flies off when the order is entered in seems so important to many auditors that they q and with it they stop pursuing order and start pursuing confusion never change from order to disorder just because confusion blows off let the confusion go if you want it all gone just put more order into it thats why cch works when properly used an auditor who just starts group blows some disorder out of society the disorder flies into view ignore it just put some more wellrun exactly scheduled group there more disorder discharges order put in too suddenly always discharges disorder too fast thats an explosion you dont want that leave explosions to the government its highest level of entering order is to blow everything up heres program get hold of all the people you have processed in the area you are in give them an interview in it ask each one what order are you trying to bring into your life what part of your life tell them thats what scientology is trying to help them do youll have more pcs weld them into group give them some group processing tone 40 bring order into their livestake responsibility for every pcs whole life take responsibility for all the reactive banks in your area clear them up by bringing more order money cannot flow back to you on disorderly lines auditor confidence every field auditor has had some loses these cut down his confidence he should rebuild his confidence he should rebuild his confidence as his first step he failed where he failed to bring order into lives therefore he had better now discipline himself to use one simple process and use it right and without change until he has won with it dont change the process because it blows off disorder to the devil with the disorderput the order in regardless of how much disorder it blows off key rehabilitation process 1 start session 2 find out if the pc has an auditor 3 find out if the pc has an auditing room 4 ask pc goals what part of your life would you like to bring some order into twoway comm on it for more than five minutes get into session then 5 for one hour at the beginning of each session every session run look around here and find something you have only that command if pc originates understand and acknowledge dont do anything else about it 6 for remainder of session run recall something you have done when he says he has acknowledge only session after session run nothing else but this and youll bring order to pc believe and hell have great case changes and hell be moving forward toward clear this process will give you wins unless you do something else to vary it the only people it doesnt work well on are nearly unconscious on these only cch 1 2 3 and 4 work if the process doesnt bite at all use cch 1 2 3 and 4 but dont worry it will biteif you keep your mouth shut and dont flub now you want some wins dont talk to the pc much during session use tr 4 whenever he talks keep him reassured happy comfortable and dont let him out of session until you end it and youll win if you lose its because you got fancy or chopped the pc up factual havingness will ease off pt problems and arc breaks thats why you use it for an hour always if process regimen comes along thats simpler or better than the above ill let you know right away until then this is the very best you can do group recruiting groups fall apart on sloppy scheduling they need one night week at the minimum always the same night same hours thats order always one hour lecture and one hourgroup processing tone 40 we have new phonograph records of lectures for you theyre cheap buy them when you have group processed while get people into an has course teach them trs 0 to 9 and then let them coaudit on exactly the above regimen by permitting coauditing the trained auditor actually gets more pcs charge for co auditing consultations keep them at it were taking the lid off the country is full of people they should be in groups and co auditing in that way well bring enough order to the country to make even it survive by the way hco washington dc will issue hubbard apprentice scientologist certificate to anybody you guarantee has passed trs 0 to 9 without charge to you we trust you to make sure theyre good in recruiting group keep explaining scientology as something that helps people bring order into their lives youd be amazed how little order they believe they can inject call on new people run an ad for your group tired of being human scientology group clears people or does life seem disorderly join the scientology group and begin to win for change we need action in an all but leaderless world somebody has to make some people lets begin lrhjh l ron hubbard copyright 1959 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office washington hco bulletin of 10 january 1959 supersedes all earlier directives for hgc processes hgc allowed processes the director of processing of an hgc is the person who indicates the processes to be used by auditors on pcs the following plan is furnished for the information and guidance of the d of p and hgc auditors low pcs all pcs who lie markedly below the center line of an apaoca graph should be run on cch 1 2 3 and 4 not all auditors even when they know these can get results with them therefore use an auditor who does get results with the cchs medium pcs pcs who lie on either side of the center line respond easily to fac havingness and benefit well from it fac hav with all three commands as per acc clear procedure should be run solely and only with good case gain flatten each command on such case about an hour at time in rotation if comm lag develops run 8 vanish 2 continue 1 have in that order until case changes for the better then run an hour each on each of the three in rotation these can also be run on recall something you have done high pcs pcs who lie mostly or entirely above the center line can be run on recall something you have done however if you have auditors trained to run engrams by all means start this pc on engrams at once and run according to 5th london or 21st american procedure other processes for all any help process runs on almost any pc except the very low pc therefore particularly to get sessions started help on auditor and pc is valuable arc break straight wire works well on medium level pcs but only an auditor who is expert with an emeter and in locating in time incidents can be trusted with itgeneral notes hgc auditors have to be checked out on cch 0 before being permitted to run it the process is great invitation to spend half an intensive talking fac hav or tr 10 also run problems and should be used if auditor doesnt check out on cch 0 auditors must not be permitted to use tr 13 fishing cognition use tr 4 instead or the acc tr accepting pcs answers tr 4 and the acc tr are quite similar use tr 5n handling arc breaks only when auditor is checked out on it and handles it well the most trouble you get in an hgc is same as field auditors wont use tr 4 they always have to do something about what pc volunteers after while pc gets afraid of volunteering data and goes out of session in general auditors talk too much cut it down unless auditor really knows when to talk auditors who are always dragging pcs attention to auditor are liability in an hgc on new auditor in hgc you can ask what process has gotten you best results and whatever he says youll win better until hes grooved in by letting him run it otherwise give him fac hav and comments to pc and you will get fair showing result retarders arc breaks mostly retard results the less talk from auditor the less breaks good tr 4 avoids them pt problem stalls cases handle it with good cch 0 as per acc clear procedure or if auditor not checked outwith fac hav or in extreme low cases tr 10 clearing procedures it is fruitless to embark on straight clearing until the case is up so all the above applies to clearing when case is well up after using the above processes use confront and help as per acc clear procedure or better run engrams summary to get gains use processes gauged to case handle pt problems and prevent arc breaks by checking auditor comments to clear run engrams and make theta clears where you can if not all your auditors can run engrams have lower cases set up by them and when in shape pass to an engram running auditor to finish off if you have engram running auditor clear by this bulletin plus acc clear

fitzroy street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 15 january 1959 the five levels of indoctrination compiled from the research material and taped lectures of l ron hubbard i am now going to give you the five levels of indoctrination very rapidly we already have the five dummy processes which form the first levelthe five dummy auditing processes the second one up the line is 8cplain 8c it is given without stress on control or anything of the sort you dont touch or handle the person it is an old process done this way the auditing commands of 8c in this particular instance have suffered change recently because auditing command must depend upon any other auditing command or it wont be in present time so each auditing command depends upon itself and the commands of 8c are look at that wall thank you walk over to that wall thank you with your right hand touch that wall thank you turn around thank you there is let go there or other direction if we have not directed him to do something and he does it if the way he does something is little different from what we expected we really have basis for objection and the training stress is only this to get person to walk another body than his own around the room there is nothing to this it is not high school indoctrination at this level he must be able to duplicate the command and it is run to point where person does not make mistake on the commands and stops feeling nervous about walking persons body around that is the training stress now we move up to the next level of indoctrination which might look like 8c at the first glance but is not this is high school indoctrination the commands of high school indoctrination are the same as those for plain 8c but this is entirely and completely training process and it is only run for this reason to keep an auditor from being stopped by preclear by devious and diverse statements and actions the preclear we cant really call him preclear at all for he is actually the coach runs on this auditor anything he can think of to stop him and the auditor must at time permit himself even to be halted or falter in any way he must be able to continue clear freeflowing 8c on this person who is getting down on the floor and barking like dog he mustnt be permitted to go down on the floor you let man get below the level of your shoulders and he is going to get down on the floorthats for sure you have to catch him before that he is going to try not to walk across the room he is going to try and run across the room he is going to try and do anything you told him to walk walking fast is allowable but running is definitely not allowable the training stress is entirely upon getting an auditor to persevere against any trick mechanism anybody could think of or react to or any circuitry or dramatization in 8c it is total uditor persistence we dont ask the auditor to do it smoothlywe only ask him to do it constantly and consistentlythat is high school indoctrination one of the great steps of scientology if we had had this few years ago it would have made the world of difference in several cases i can think of fellow would sit down in the middle of the floor and he wouldnt do anything we depended totally on our voices and these people werent in communication the coach in this case has role to play he is the preclear he has two signals one flunk and the other thats it which are effective anything else he says does not count of course he says start and they go on with it but when the coach who is the final judge considers that the auditor has blundered has been stopped and has waited too long then the coach says flunk what happens when the coach says flunk they go back to the beginning of the nearest cycle of action of 8c they do not take it from where they were but go back to the beginning they leave that cycle incomplete the auditor in this case is not permitted to override flunk when the coach says thats it he means we are through we are going to take breather what i say now counts and that ends it it doesnt begin again until the coach says start this is 8c done on very heavy body contact the coach being lugged around and doing anything he can think of to stop this fellow it is interesting what will stop some auditors if you understand your business as coach you will understand that it is the soft ones and the unexpected ones that count it isnt the heavy ones it isnt the preclear just lying down on the floor and refusing to budge and exerting every muscle and having to be dragged from there on this is perfectly allowable but it isnt the one that catches the auditor it is the subtle unexpected actions that flunk an auditor high school indoctrination is marvelous training process several hours should be spent on this and one shouldnt run it just with one coach but with two or three others as well because everybody develops his own abreactive pattern it is wonderful opportunity to abreact your insanities an auditor will very swiftly learn how to stop one preclear but take two or three more swapping teams around and he eventually gets smooth look at the whole thing there isnt such thing as being too tiny to handle too big preclear the next level of indoctrination is tone 40 on an object actually all these are groups and number of techniques of indoctrination could be evolved from each one of these i am simply giving you those that have to be passed in this tone 40 on an object you can have number of commands and variations of one kind or another but the one we use is this you take an objecta small doll ashtray coke bottleand the auditor tells it to sit down in that chair or sit on the table and thanks it then he tells it to stand up and thanks it sit down on the chair or sit on the table then the auditor moves it with his own hands he does all this while the coach is just standing there heckling him and he has to do it so that his intention is so good that he gets perpetually surprised that the thing the object didnt sit down in the chair or sit on the table or didnt stand up the furthermost extremity of this would be that the object would do so without any further contact with the auditor than his intention that point may be reachablei must tell you that person does this until his tone in giving the commands is tone 40 there are many little drills that come into this one is to make him put the intention into it and squeak and not say word at the same time but put the intention into it and alter his voice all over the place until he finds out that his intention doesnt have anything to do with his voice or tone he will eventually discover what tone 40 is tone 40 is positive postulate with counterthought expected anticipated or anything else that is total control actually today we use the word control very loosely what we really mean is positive postulation what the world means by control is if he doesnt do it shoot him not tone 40 but tone 4 in order to get tone 40 on person going you can continue tone 40 on an object but whether this belongs to tone 40 on person or belongs to the last end of tone 40 on an object doesnt much matter it is not separate level but it is separate command you give the 8ccommands to an object and lug it around for little whileie having the object move over and touch the wall etcbut that is only getting the person used to these commands in that tone that is the only reason there is for it we dont use the 8c commands to get his drill in because he is going to get heckled what does the coach do on tone 40 on an object at first he is really helpful and tries to get the auditor to get the intention in there until he can put the intention in without speaking when the fellow is getting too good the coach must remember that this tone 40 on person is going to be up against somebody with counterthought countereffort and counteraction of one kind or another and the coach furnishes it he doesnt do it loudly or obstreperously but he does furnish it is that tone 40 are you absolutely sure that was tone 40 what do you mean by tone 40 etcthis is when the coach isnt being helpful the coach is supposed to furnish randomity as substitute for the randomity of the environment the person can do this in spite of the fact that something or somebody is resisting him heckling him and messing him up you could go much further with this as i say one can go much further with each one of the five levels of indoctrination but i dont advise it on tone 40 on person we do 8c at tone 40 and that is total accurate estimation of effort with halts or jagged motionsthat is smooth your estimation of effort must be absolutely perfect your estimation of intention must also be perfectwhich is sometimes rather hard on coach because somebody can get so good that coachs body starts to walk around and obey the commands rather easily and you find almost all coaches on tone 40 on person are much more docile than on high school indoc they really want to be rougher but the technique is rather overweighing this is too strong those are the five levels of indoctrination and they are only doing this placing an auditor into frame of mind and an ability where his postulates can be positive and his command is longer diffident where he can control and handle somebody where he can assume the attitude that is necessary to an auditor and person is all through with these when the instructor is sure that the auditor in training can do thishubbard communications office washington dc

find person you feel you have failed to help by twoway comm not repetitive several persons may be located select one that is real to the pc not wholly unreal and run the following process recall something you have done to selected person this is repetitive command the auditing is done muzzled the auditor is not permitted to say anything to pc except the command and to acknowledge that commands answer once the process is started if the pc originates the auditor is permitted to nod only if pc seems to have lost the command or originates the auditor nods and says ill repeat the auditing command and does so discussions or rudiments beyond start and end of session are employed when several persons so selected in the pcs life are apparently flat the process may be considered flat some reality should have been gained by both auditor and pc overt act straight wire when several selected persons pc could not help have been run with the above the auditor broadens the process to the command recall something you have done to somebody this is also run muzzled when pc originates the auditor does not speak he only nods his reply when the preclear seems to be without command the auditor repeats it as above further twoway comm is allowed arc break straight wire when the pc shows signs of being easy with the above process the process used becomes arc break straight wire run in the following fashion for the first time meters are employed the sole use of the emeter is to locate incident in time bcad dates to be used only is it greater than is it less than is it such and such date forbidden question is how many years ago as this is the sole criteria used in betweenlife implants where they say things are thousands of years ago trillions of years ago etc the question when is the only thing the auditor solves and only when needed and he tells the pc about the drop he gets the command is recall an arc break the pc does the auditor says when any time statement by the pc is accepted except i dont know if pc says this the auditor resolves it with the emeter to the best of his ability tells the pc the date or character of drops and then continues the process any other origin by pc is met with nod only the auditor may make comments this process goes very easily into whole track if whole track incident is located in time it deintensifies or goes back on the track by locating the incident in time the pc is not made toplow through an engram with this command only which is poor stuff therefore departure is allowed from the above regimen and twoway comm is permitted beyond locating the incident in time the process will be found to open up track into greater and greater reality as arc break straight wire will give pc 3d spots on the track it can be followed by what can you confront or regular engram running lrhrd l ron hubbardhubbard communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 22 january 1959 full distribution notis straight wire those persons on whom process works once and those who have either dubin or occlusion process easily if dramatically on notis straight wire see axioms 11d 18 and 22 pcs divide into three general classes 1 those who have 3d pictures and good time sense 2 those who are occluded with black colored or invisible fields and poor time sense 3 those who dubin and have time sense the scale of deterioration of case is as above first there are 3d copies of the real universe then there is the action of notising these pictures while theyre still there and finally while notising substituting false pictures this process is aimed at case types 2 and 3 above arc break straight wire also handles type 2 but not so well as type 3 types 2 and 3 press into invisibility pictures by making them unimportant this is the clue word to unreality stupidity occlusion and dubin see the logics the cycle which occurs is that the person gets overwhelmed with other peoples declared importance they counter by notising the importance of others the reverse cycle of others reducing the pcs own importances is not run in notis straight wire as it reduces havingness the commands of notis straight wire are only these and other recall time you implied something was unimportant pc does when pc says or auditor assists him by pegging it on an emeter this is run for about an hour then second command only is run recall time when somebody else thought something was important pc does when pc says or auditor assists him by locating on emeter acknowledgement is used tr 4 is reduced to nod an hour of one is followed by an hour of the other theres dynamite in this process it is good clean and unlimited but dont chicken on it and pull out and dont quit because the pc gets uncomfortable here may be the qed for all occlusion and dubin cases lrhgnrd l ron hubbard5901c22 21acc1 how process works the auditor has to find out what the pc did with the auditing command and what he did when he executed the command in the absence of communication nothing ever happens which is why people who are out the bottom dont communicate hoping to be safe this doesnt work if you are trying to do other things you must get the process communicated across to the pc and you must get the pc to communicate the first thing to know about pictures is that anything the pc is looking at is picture bank doesnt do anything except be there and whatever strange thing is happening in the bank is picture of whatever strange thing is happening in the bank thats all you have to know to unocclude an occluded case black fives look sane sometimes because they havent got anything to dramatize except looking at blackness not that they wouldnt dramatize if they were looking at something else when pc is stuck in too heavy picture it is impossible to turn on other pictures on the track the basic process for occlusion is come up to present time if that doesnt work there are seven other processes 1 there are several things person can do with pictures he may use notisness to make them disappear as soon as they show up other obsessive doingnesses can be used to get rid of ones pictures solution to pictures this case can be approached using ow selected people because if hes notising pictures hes notising people too in so doing he finds himself surrounded by ghosts first run what have you done to withheld from _______ using the person youve selected 2 then run general ow to catch some more of the automaticity of this outflow 3 arc break straightwire is used to knock out the cause of notisness all locks on the rock are arc breaks 4 next we would use notis straightwire recall time you thought something was unimportant recall time someone else thought something was important if you run it reversewise it takes away the pcs havingness and spins him in this works on notising others importances ie it asises times he did this 5 factual havingness also called third rail the vanish command of this this also handles notisness 6 what can you confront this because at this stage the person doesnt wipe something out before he looks at it 7 you make mockup for which you can be totally responsible this is top of the line process any of these processes turn on pictures these processes plus cchs handle all occluded casesissue 88 m 1959 ca late january the magazine of dianetics and scientology from washington dc campaign for ethical auditing l ron hubbard general ethical standards in america are at their lowlow ebb when we see what the peers of healing do to make dishonest dollar when we see mental healing relegated to mental torture and destruction we find at the same time that the local and the national governments enforce the vicious practitioners the antibiotic quack and the electric shock witch doctor if scientology is to make any progress whatever its own ethical standards must be without reproach why q and with cavedin society one of my hats is ethical standards hco is hubbard communications office it is the office that helps wear my hats therefore one of the three principal hats of hco is ethical standards the keeping of the codes the other two are technology and awards there are many hco offices throughout the world but nowhere do they have the problems of magnitude in the field of ethics that they have in america succumbing to the general low tone of the society there are persons about who 1 do not care to have the actual skill necessary to get results 2 do not scruple in their promises to pcs and 3 work against the best interests of the central organization and other auditors heretofore i have been relatively unaided in this problem i have tried many ways to solve it all failed in america these solutions worked elsewhere but not in america fortunately hco has come of age i am getting help an hco secretary is welltrained scientologist after that she is my own secretary in the area she has motto bring orderthe motto of hco hco staff are dedicated scientologists the best carefully selected today any unethical practitioner in scientology is beginning to feel uneasy and rightly hco to say nothing of central organizations is breathing down his neck today ethical auditors doing their jobs and well are feeling easier hco is backing up their activity and making them secure in their gains by for instance keeping roving auditors out of ethical areas and the squirrels gasping their last an ethical auditor does the following1 he helps the good repute of scientology 2 he keeps dissemination up with healthy part of his income 3 he gets results when he processes somebody 4 he charges standard fees cutrate 5 he stands in well with his fellow auditors 6 he makes wild promises to pcs he cant back up 7 he never tells pc the pc is now clear 8 he uses standard processes 9 he keeps his own case improving toward clear on higher levels an unethical auditor is earmarked by the following 1 he lives on the good repute of scientology but downgrades it 2 he profits by the dissemination of others or the central organization and pockets what he should contribute as profit 3 he processes people without caring about results only profit 4 he cutrates his processing or grossly overcharges 5 he is despised by other auditors 6 he makes any promise he has to to get pc to buy processing 7 he tells pcs they are clear matter what they think 8 he uses any process that happens to occur to him and avoids standard proven processes 9 he shuns personal auditing on himself and there you have whats holding us back when the new year of year nine came i made resolution i had the administrative machinery set up the needful comm lines and i resolved to take steps to take full responsibility for field auditors in america i dont care whether this resolution is popular or unpopular its got to be done heres how it is i tell people about recent results and about clears some creep already in bad with yet finds ways of profiting by cashing in trouble is these couldnt audit out sore finger on clear what do they know about my goals or ethics yet they use the name and rake in cashand spoil areas with their stupid blundering they fail to help cases they are parasitic upon the dissemination done by others they take money that should go into sound future and waste it hco is vitally interested in this campaign the hco goal is get the field auditor to get results in america and get the show on the road and hco can spend thousands to do it any area that is being victimized by an unethical auditor will soon feel the influence of hco we mean business and america has been asking for it hard scientology is the greatest movement on earth today the only honest movement with real hope for mans future it must not be stalled by the prevailing low of american ethics it is shameful that i can only guarantee scientology results in america where hco or myself can directly supervise the processing this must change professional auditors certificate must continue to mean honesty results and adherence to the codes this is sudden campaign that will be forgotten there are hco offices all over the world more than in america im winning hco is winning its about time the field won too for scientology is winning new life for man the world around l ron hubbardpab 153 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and

pab 152 of 15 january 1959 on the five levels of indoctrination compiled from the research material and taped lectures of l ron hubbard we go now into cch cch could not even vaguely be attempted without the five levels of indoctrination having been run nevertheless early in the hpa or hca course you will discover that an individual hasnt yet had tone 40 so although cch starts with tone 40 the training continuity of cch does not training starts with dummy auditing in the communication course and then goes to the second level of indoctrination which is simple 8 c and they coincide at that point the order of learning these processes is therefore different from the order in which they are given to pc you dont have to remember the order of learning but you do have to remember the order of giving them to pc however i am going to give them to you in the order of training we have simple 8c which i have already given you at the second level the commands of simple 8c are very simple and they do not depend on any other command in simple 8c the commands are look at that wall thank you walk over to that wall thank you with your right hand touch that wall thank you turn around thank you the second process we deal with in training is locational processing and this as you can see at once is command of attention process the commands are notice that thank you this is very simple locational processing and by the way an interestingly therapeutic process the training stress is simply this the direction of attention must not be disturbed by other mechanisms of attention direction the auditor must do this smoothly we are trying to get the auditor to get the preclears attention to go smoothly to the object indicated what we have here is one person handling another persons attentionthis is quite unusual and must be done very smoothly we dont care how well the commands are getting across beyond of course that they should get across as well as person learned to get across command in dummy auditing the auditor picks out objects and says notice that he normally points and the preclear merely turns his head there are cautions to be used with this except that if the preclear gets very restimulated flatten it the third is called locational body and room and here we have the first example of extraversionintroversion the commands are look at that ____thank you look at your foot hand or knee thank you there is an alternative set of commands on this notice the chair notice your hand notice the wall notice the floor they actually have difference person who is pretty dead in his head had better be told to notice because the strain and stress which will come on him through trying to get out of his body and look at his head is so great he will start pulling ridges to pieces so of the two thesafest is notice the other will exteriorize somebody they are two different sets of commands two different objects look at that wall look at your hand etc is liable to find person out there five feet outside his head but if person would not normally exteriorize by his build bank behavior etc you would use notice in training we use notice but we must remember that the process works fabulously well with look thats an extraversionintroversion process we have the sequence of it as look in on yourself look at yourself look at the environment look at yourself look at the environmentalternating it this is what is known as an alternate command it is necessary to call your attention to that bit of terminology because in give your hand tone 40 we run it on the right hand and we run it on the left hand but it is not an alternate we dont say give your right hand give your left hand the next one of these is objective show here the preclear does little demonstrating the reason this is put in here is because it is one of the more miraculous therapeutic processes it is the reason why persons bank is invisible to other people it is the reason why people have secrets they pull banks in on themselves and the reason why they dont dare show it to anybody else the commands are show that thank you the auditor points to the object he wishes to be shown only when that is running fairly well will you run it on an extrovertintrovert basis and the next series of commands on it could be show that show your ie show that table show your foot show that ceiling show your hand this by the way opens the door to mockups and facsimiles anybody could see if there is some method of achieving that this is the process to do it person overcomes his unwillingness to show things and he realizes that he is not still on arcturus and you are not the space police from saturn he is being made unwilling by life to show anybody anything actually i would omit this process under training i wouldnt show person how to do this early in his training i would let him find this one up the track somewhere that is why i have not given it out in training earlier but you must know that it exists because it is very important process and has to be handled very delicatelythat is why at this level of training it isnt used instead we use mild one called attention by duplication 9 number 4 this is very old process but we dont run it in the old manner we place book in one location and bottle in another location never more than five feet apart and we say look at that book walk over to that book pick up that book put the book down in exactly the same place the same goes for the bottle you could add turn around in there but you have then graduated this to tone 40 book and bottle tone 40 book and bottle is not opening procedure by duplication you have to be ready to assume total control of the preclear to run tone 40 book and bottle the commands are the same except that you never acknowledge anything but the execution of the auditing commands then we would only have to add the command turn around he is really not supposed to do anything else we have not told him to do in training we use opening procedure by duplication and later on will have to show somebody what we mean by tone 40 book and bottle the training stress on this is precision the auditor must not make any mistakes or omissions on this command it is one of the most arduous processes to run known to man if an auditor adds into it the randomity of getting his commands mixed up he can practically finish preclear it is one of the number one exteriorization processes if opening procedure by duplication 1957 will exteriorize somebody and it will tone 40 book and bottle is likely to send him on his way you have latitude for mistakes here the training stress is the exact duplication of the commands one of the cautions that must be observed in running this is that it is not left unflattened and mustnt be faltered if it begins to run if the process is biting it must not be stopped simply because there is class schedule involved if you were unfortunate enough to begin opening procedure by duplication 1957 at 3 pm and it was running on the preclear you have choice if it is still running at 2 am in the morning auditors code or not you are still going to be there running it i couldnt possibly tell you thatemphatically enough we remember this from way back when the most fatal thing that can happen is to be interrupted during this process which may never bite again and if it isnt flattened it is liable to leave somebody hung right there it is major auditing error to start opening procedure by duplication 1957 and not flatten it when you start that one dont have any other dates most of these processes under training sooner or later will be left unflattened on somebody but that one must never behubbard communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 3 february 1959

on case that is motivator hungry overt acts must be owned up to thoroughly on the lower processes before you can get arc break straightwire to run properly bad auditing is much easier to do with arc break straightwire than the other two processes bad auditing is the limitation of arc break straightwire it gives the auditor much more chance to make mistakes than either selected persons overts or notis straightwire the two biggest single auditor crimes are 1 rough and choppy auditing 2 overestimating the level of case when either of these two crimes is committed you get reduced profile readings if profile reduces the answer is in either one or two above the remedy for rough auditing is muzzled auditing this gives the auditor wins thus improving his judgement and gives the preclear wins muzzled auditing is best run on 1 selected person overts straightwire 2 general overts straightwire 3 notis straightwire arc break straightwire belongs between general overts straightwire and notis straightwire in the scale of things but is generally omitted because it requires smooth auditing however it produces the best results if case reality is up to it gradual scale of processes the lowest is 1 selected person overts straightwire recall time you did something to 2 general overts straightwire recall time you did something to somebody 3 arc break straightwire recall an arc break when4 notis straightwire recall time you implied something was unimportant alternated with recall time somebody thought something was important 5 factual havingness look around here and find something you would permit to vanish look around here and find something you would continue look around here and find something you have the results to be achieved by the above scale compare favourably to the cchs and are faster when part of the profile gain lags on the oca or apa the person is found to have dropped havingness thus factual havingness third railrun 821 can be combined with the above using the third command vanish first in any event the fifth process in the above order is third rail run 821 of factual havingness i would like to see this run extensively by hgcs i would like to see this gradient scale run in full after every engram is flat and before starting new engram this will keep auditors from being fooled by dubin dubin can occur in different lifetime even when it was not present in the lifetime just run dubin is continuous characteristic of person in single lifetime and may not be present in the ensuing lifetime l ron hubbard lrhrd copyright 1959 by l ron hubbard all

1959 originally issued from london op pro by dup use two objectsa book and bottle have the pc look them over and handle them to his satisfaction then have him place them at some walking distance apart in the room on couple of tables or similar locations the commands look at that book walk over to it pick it up what is its colour what is its temperature what is its weight put it down in exactly the same place repeat with the bottle do not vary the commands in any way use tone 40 thank you acknowledgment the basic commands should never be departed from and never never trick the preclear by using the book again when you knew he was just about to start toward the bottle the purpose of the process is duplication good control should be used accept the pcs answers whether they are logical silly imaginative dull or unlawful in starting the process you can discuss with him what you are about to do and make sure you have got the rudiments established run the process until the comm lags are flat this process is an hpahca requisite l ron hubbard lrhmcrd copyright 1959 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedpab 154 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 37 fitzroy street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 15 february 1959 c c h concluded compiled from the research material and taped lectures of l ron hubbard the next process in training order is subjective havingness one way to run this is to ask the preclear what he can mock up then have him mock up what he can and shove it into his body that is the most elementary way of running this remedy of havingness and havingness in general are the most therapeutic levels of processing when they work you run cch so the fellow can have and here you are directly doing it quite important you can always get black case to mock things up and you can always get somebody to throw something away this is not even problem today the way you crack up black case is to have him mock up something in the blackness and push it in until the blackness cracks up he will go anaten but because he goes unconscious is reason to stop auditing him there is way to crack up the invisible case who cannot see mockups they have field and do not see anything when they close their eyes everything is invisible they have facsimiles mockups the most spectacular crackup of an invisible case was occasioned by putting number of glass objects on table and one after the other just repetitively round and round the preclear was asked to keep each one from going away and when he succeeded in doing this for few rounds he longer had an invisible field that invisible field of his had been impervious to all other attacks by auditors for five years or longer the next one is book mimicry its commands being totally motion all the processes up to this moment we have mentioned book and bottle tone 40 but it is not taught or run at this level of training are simply communicative we could talk to the preclear this is also true of book mimicry and hand space mimicry dont get this mixed up because your first process in cch is tone 40 give your hand and this is followed by tone 40 8c and then followed by book mimicry and then followed by hand space mimicry you are liable to believe that book mimicry and hand space mimicry are tone 40 they are not they are just common ordinary runofthemill routinebe good fellow pick up the arc remember your dummy auditing sort of processes you can talk to the preclear it is necessary that you do so book mimicry is run this way you sit facing the preclear rather close together your knees few inches from his knees you take in your hands booknot another objectand you make motion with this book preferably not the most complicated motion in the world and preferably not the simplest motion and remember you the auditor have to be able to remember any motion that you make with that book so that you can do it again so it is sometimes necessary for an instructor to make somebody take the book and wave it around in certain patterns and make him wave itaround again before he lets him run this on anybody just check him out so that he can wave the book the same way twice because if he cant he cant run this process you make the motion with the book and give the book to the preclear and he with mirror image takes the book and makes as near as he can the same motion with it if you are not satisfied with it you take the book back and make the same motion that you made before with the book newly and in present time and give him the book once more and he makes the same motion back you do the motion until you and he but particularly he are satisfied that duplication has occurred the auditing commands of this process arent commandsthey are patter there is comment there is talk and one of the lines that undoubtedly should be part of your patter should be well did you do it are you satisfied if he isnt you do it again and ask him again it is the preclear that has to be satisfied that duplication took place not the auditor it is completely different from dummy auditing remember we are not dummy auditing now we are auditing for keeps you can talk all you want to acknowledge what he says but dont you dare let that looseness in conversation interfere with the tremendous precision of the motions of the process itself in other words the motions are the commands and these must not be interfered with by the speech but the speech can and should take place number seven is hand space mimicry and again it is the motion that is the command the training stress on hand space mimicry is to do good useful hand space mimicry the auditor sits in the same position as in the last process and puts one or two palms up against the preclears hands and he says i am going to make motion with my hands and i want you to contribute to that motion and we make some simple little motion to which he contributes we do this for while until it is more or less flat or we can leave it for the moment then we bring the auditors and preclears hands half an inch apart and we do the same thing and we say the same thing you may lead him out to four or five feet away by these tiny gradients another inch at time without his ever becoming aware of the fact that you have left him and he is definitely aware of his auditor this is modern look at who am i it finds the auditor the scale of reality is employed here and this is why it is done scale of reality at the bottom there is nothing above that there is communication line the line becomes more solid then above that terminals begin to materialize lightly and the line becomes less solid then above that you have the terminals and you dont have any lines and above that the terminals are there mostly by agreement above that there is agreement and above agreement there is consideration individual consideration and above that there is postulate that is the scale of reality you will see this scale of reality take place for what are these hands against these hands but communication lines to the preclear so we play it in this fashion we begin to break it down and we become less line and more terminal next one is trio famous old process which is included here because it is too good to miss the commands of trio were originally look around the room and find something you could have very noncontrol sort of process but thats the trio it has an opposite look around the room and find something that your body cannot have it is have for the preclear have not for any other object person being valence or anything else than the preclear you do numbers of things with the trio you have to know the trio because it is fast patchup for almost any process there is except op pro by duplication 1957 the only thing that patches up op pro by duplication 1957 is op pro by duplication 1957 tone 40 opening procedure by duplication will run out opening procedure by duplication 1957 and any tone 40 process will run itself out there is deadend street there trio will run out almost anything in the entire bank if it is biting at all if person can have anything or if he can get the idea of something cant have it will run anything out it is slow and reliable and an auditor must always have ithubbard communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 16 february 1959 hgc processes for those trained in engram running or trained in these processes starting case begin every session as follows with these rudiments use rudiments find the auditor find the pc find the auditing room establish goal for the session ask for present time problem present time problem if ptp exists then run it as follows and in other way do not yak around about it just ask if there is one see if one registers on the meter on the pt problem that registers on the meter not some other one do the following ask for and write down all the persons connected with this problem that problem includes the preclear on each of these persons one after the other beginning with the one most real to the pc run this think of something you have done to selected person think of something you have withheld from selected person these commands are run one after the other until the selected person chosen is somewhat flat pc begins to repeat things he has recalled before do this to each person involved in the problem pt problems were cut out of hgc because auditors burned up half an intensive on them pt problem never requires more than couple of hours to flatten when is used with pt problem by selected persons use rudiments and check pt problem each session and handle as above dynamic straight wire do survey one time on the pc not every session to discover any errors in their dynamics this is done with an emeter on pcs not familiar with sci terms use the following words self sex family children groups mankind the animal kingdom birds beasts fish vegetables trees growing things matter energy space time spirits souls gods god assess with this question only tell something that would represent each of the above one after the other when one changes the pattern of the needle action or when it is definitely balmy write it down when list is completed take those items written down and run think of something you have done to selected terminal you wrote down think of something you have withheld from selected terminal same one run these questions on each one after the other until pc seems flatif daffy terminals are found on survey survey it all again if none are found this second time skip this process do this only once per auditor per pc past and future experience this process goes rapidly into engrams but can be continued even if engrams are contacted run these two questions one after the other one time per each what part of your life would you be willing to reexperience what part of the future would you be willing to experience keep an accurate record of any engrams contacted when engrams persist in the pcs view carefully spot them in time for him engram running find the engram necessary to resolve the case once you have chosen it and have begun to run it be sure you have the motivator and the overt and then do not do not do not do not depart from that incident to run another that drops better or comes up in other words once you have found an incident stay on it until it is flat notis straight wire when you have flattened an engram thoroughly with all five commands gone over twice run notis straight wire between incidents in other words flatten an engram then run notis straight wire get that bit flat and locate and run the next incident selected person overt withhold and general overt and withhold can be run on pc only if they are biting this is also true of notis straight wire l ron hubbard lrhrd copyright 1959 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office washington dc staff auditors conference of february 16 1959 regarding hco bulletin of february 16 1959 hgc processes for those trained in engram running or trained in these processes nearly everyone here has been trained in these exact processes and if anyone here hasnt been trained in these processes then everything on this bulletin applies except engram running the whole bulletin applies except engram running there will be staff theta clearing course and those auditors who are on staff who have not been trained by an acc in engram running will have an opportunity to get that training and not too many months will go by before they are up to this too so this will apply at that time maybe it will have shifted slightly by that time but i dont think very much now what you are looking at here is the aggregate knowhow that was gained and assembled on the 21st american acc undercutting cases now the undercuts of cases became vital necessity this whole acc was devoted to the r factor plus engram running it was discovered that the thing that keeps individuals from running engrams adequately was their r factor and when their r factor was very poor they could not run an engram adequately now the funny part of it is that an engram can be contacted and run and if done persistently and well without arc breaks can run the following scale of confront here is the scale of confront just to refresh your minds dubin lowest scale this scale could possibly invert and down below that you might have black dubin once you had run blackness you would find dubin case but the scale we are mostly interested in because that is the one we most commonly see begins at the bottom with dubin runs up turns black runs through blackness turns invisible runs from invisible to elsewherea desire to be elsewhere the way they solve things is elsewhereness runs up from elsewhereness to ability to confront runs from confront to experience or participate and only then are you up to beingness now this is the confront scale and it is the scale of disintegrating reality it is how person handles terminals or situation person handles terminals and situations above all this by not having to participate by not having to confront finding necessity to do anything about it unless he chooses so on his own determination and if he did so could do so with personal liability he could experience or not as the case may be now youll find lower harmonic on this in some philosophic level of somebody saying yap yap well i could or i couldnt and thats my choice etc well he hasnt got any power of choice hes just using this as the final escape mechanisma philosophic escape mechanism if i said bottomthe bottom mechanismit would be the one most commonly contacted but you are apt to get mechanism which is philosophic which is simply figure figure mechanism about situation and the individual feels that if he could just figure it out he would be all right in other words this is thoughtthinkingness figurefigure and he notisesby figurefigure such case notising by figurefigure will turn into dubin case as soon as you start curing his figurefigure would turn into black case would turn into an invisible case would turn into confront case would turn into an experience case which is quite interesting now it is true that an engram could be found started and if the auditor were good and held the individual right on the time period and had the time period well spotted and had the overt and motivator matter how crazy they seemed or sounded contacted he could theoretically just by running that engram run person through the totality of this reality scale see so theres another approach here you get guy who is figurefigure find the engram necessary to resolve the case first he figurefigures about it and hell run it and run it just with the auditing commandsthe five auditing commands to run an engramhe figure figures about it then after while he dubsin about it then after while it all goes black and then after while it eases into an invisibilityits just not theresomatics are and discomfort and other things are but its not thereand its notthereness suddenly turns into little flicks little flicks of confront and boy he goes elsewhere it just starts to turn on and he gets it for the least little flick and he goes elsewhere and then pretty soon he can confront the thing then pretty soon he can participatehe can run it in valence squarely in valence right in its moment of time at which time it becomes pretty damn real and then he goes to being able to put it there or not put it there and its importanceunimportance factor flattens out so that its neither important nor unimportant and that engram is licked theoretically this could happen that is actually the way i run engrams but you will find in auditing in the hgc that the public expects of you different thing than is expected of you by students and thats why i wanted to talk to you for few minutes they expect different thing they expect you to be interested in their case and that is quite amusing because its your job to get them interested in their case but they want you to be interested in their case a11 right any case is interesting so thats pretty easy one but you can get so interested in their case that you do lot of talking to them and burn up an awful lot of auditing time so there is some point where your interest becomes an indulgence and on the happier side of that where the pc is pleased youre interested in his case and thats enough then you get him interested in his case all right now we have for long time not used pt problems ill tell you why very bluntly it was not unusual for an auditor to burn up twelve and half hours on pt problem it was not unusual he did this with two motives one just yak letting the pc go on and on poor control not controlling the pcs comm outflow letting the pc get into nonessentials and the other side of it he was trying to run the whole case with the pt problem well wonderfulyou can run whole case with pt problembut why since its slow freight thats very slow way to go about it so we take pt problem now and handle the session in this fashion we establish the rudiments every time we establish session find the auditor find the pc find the auditing room establish goal for the session do that rapidly we dont care what goal it is so long as he has some kind of goal and then we ask for pt problem and we take an emeter up to that time we didnt care whether the pc was handling the cans or not but we take an emeter and we have this pt problem appear on the emeter or we dont run it got it and we run the pt problem that appears on the emeter so we get him to state this problem and we dont care how he states the problem because all we want to know is did it drop that tells you at once you wont run pt problem on stage4 needle didnt dropsee thats all within the requirementsit didnt drop so skip it it isnt going to be real to the pc anyhow youll have to do something else with this case hes probably got thousands of problems probably all of life is problem probably every time he walks in room he installs an engram you know the furnitures therethats an engram get the idea so why worry about problem but if you got pt problem that drops you should remove yourself at that moment from all temptation as soon as the problem drops and as soon as he states that it is problem tohim and is worrying him in present time you take the cans away from him and put the thing aside just lay the emeter aside youre not interested in an emeter from there on the reason why is because youll increase the drop youll increase more drop and more drop as you ask him about it youre already running it and the problem is going to change you have seen this phenomenon youre not interested in problem changing the fact of your laying aside the emeter will rather convince him that you have found it and thats it and you only want to know this the personnel associated with that problem you dont want to know more about the problem you just want to know the personnel associated with that problem his wife his mother and his wifes boy friend or something of that sort and thats the personnel associated with the problem you just check that off now im going to ask you to take notebook and ballpoint into the auditing room because youve got two or three things to do here that require list i want you to get accustomed to establishing list and then flattening it not trying to run the case all over new again every time the case changes thats one of the ways to waste time you run one terminal and of course the case changes the problems change everything changes on the case if you reassessed it at this time to find new terminal youd for sure find new terminals well the devil with it lets just flatten what we contact and when were contacting and scouting and using cans and the emeter just write down what we find then put the emeter aside and run what weve found until we get rid of all of that now youre going to do something newgive him back the emeter cans got the idea pcs dont much like to hold onto these emeter cans forever furthermore they become restive and they want to scratch their heads and they want to do this and they want to rassle around and most pcs you get are slightly nervous in this direction why should you worry about it because the emeter is only going to give you certain amount of the information that is quite valid now youre going to write down the personnel connected with this pt problem youre going to take selected person overtwithhold on each one of these people and the commands for this are right here think of something you have done to and think of something you have withheld from and you are going to run one of those commands and the next command and then the next commandfirst command again then the second command first command second command in that way youll never lay an egg on an unbalanced flow flow will unbalance on you theyll always stay there more or less stable the case wont suddenly turn black when its not supposed to turn black and so forth you wont ever overrun flow and the pc will never get upset now lets look at this again you have written down wife his mother and his wifes boy friend which one do you run first you have to ask this question to establish that terminal which one of these things do you think is the most real to you the individual says oh mother of course who cares thats what he says all right so thats the first one you take then you take the two remaining ones which one is most real thats the one you knock out that leaves you one more person knock that one out now there is something that is not stated here i just typed this up rapidly for youi didnt have backing sheet so there are typographicals because i couldnt even see what i was typing this has criterion and it is an old criterion of all pt problemsit is they are pt problems by definition pt problem must exist right now in the physical universe by definition so therefore the personnel involved in pt problem must exist right now in the physical universe he will tell you halfway through the run that it was actually my mother who influenced this wayah skip it thats not pt personnel in that problem his mother isnt really part of let us sayit was her mother that was part of the pt problem in other words the people have to be actually associated with the problem and existing at this time in this pcs life influencing that problem for this to be pt problem so therefore we dont dive in any direction to pick up any new personnel we dont care aboutwe get this problem flat it is only flat if it answers this question now what do you have to do about that problem now and the pc says nothing its flat for our purposes its flat the only reason were running it is were trying to get rid of the obsession he has to jump out of the auditing room and go do something about this problem if he doesnt have to do anything about it its flat but if he says oh its flat because i could go and talk to my wifes boy friend now and i could handle him start right back over from the beginningthe first person you wrote downand run that person again for short timenext person for short timenext person for short timeon these exact auditing questions now what do you have to do about the problem hell tell you well i dont have to do anything about it just now thats enough you consider that flat got it all right this will keep you out of all kinds of trouble and it will keep the pc from being all hung up in trying to go elsewhere in an auditing session so much for that this is done at the beginning of every session that first section thereit says starting case and begin every session well you not only start each intensive with this but you start every session with this and you do the same thing if it takes you two hours to flatten the pt problem i will think something is hung up this is rapid one this is not slow one if it takes couple of hours well somethings really haywire here he didnt say the problem or he didnt do something or hes holding something back but notice we have said think of something you have done to and think of something you have withheld from this will also get the pc talking to you because it gets rid of the withhold got that all right so much for that now dynamic straight wire you were taught in the 21st american but the commands for the general public were not given to you and they are given to you here on this sheet this hco bulletin now the only thing you are looking for is represented substitute in other words youre looking for substitutes you ask him for substitute for himself and you ask him for substitute on the basis of tell something that would represent yourself and he says represent myself oh thats very very easya tree get your ballpoint busy at that point and put down tree got it now if he even says toothbrush get your ball point busy the proper answer of course is myself its just as simple as that but the more case is daffy on this line the more attention youre going to pay to it so you just run this whole assessment right straight on through self sex family children groups mankind the animal kingdom birds beasts fish vegetables trees growing things matter energy space time spirits souls gods god just one question each time you say this you just take one of those tell something that would represent for instance souls the individual says running water get the ballpoint busy write it down when you have got this whole list assessed take the list you have written and run think of something you have done to toothbrush think of something you have withheld from toothbrush youll be amazed but they have actually done something to toothbrush and they have actually withheld something from toothbrush this is pretty terrific quite amazing but you are only looking for daffiness on this and sensible answer you dont pay much attention to you say tell something that would represent trees and the fellow says leaves now theres matter of judgment involved here what if he said shadows well i dont know thats matter of judgment try to run it or not try to run it as the case may be if it looks daffy to you run it youre the judge got the idea now dont let it look daffy to you when you say tell something that would represent spirits and he says souls when you say souls he says spirits thats not daffy but how about this guy that gives you the perfect representation all the way down the line like little woundup doll you already in looking him over find out he has sticky needlehes registering at 6 on your emeter when you first put the cans in his hands and he gives you all the answers perfectly that case is giving you an intellectual response which has nothing to do with any reality under the sun moon or stars something he read in book and machine is rattling it off so you do the assessment again the second time you go through youre liable to trip him on something got the idea so if you get perfect assessment run it again i actually dont care how many times you run it but youre apt to be wasting time because by twoway comm and definition alone you may not get anywhere with very badly machined case nevertheless couple of times through he should trip somewhere machine case generally does the rule governing dynamic straight wire is that which doesnt fall out by twoway comm just on assessment he says it and then it looks funny to him and he laughs and he thinks this is for the birds and he says oh that wouldnt be oneactually substitute for tree would be leaf or small tree or something like this thats fine nothing wrong with letting him correct himself because you are actually auditing him just by asking him the question people when they straighten out things in their own categories very often recover very very easily all right lets take up this next one here thats an easy way to run dynamic straight wire isnt it huh i would ask you to do this however in view of the fact that you are doing professional job of auditing for the public mainly and that is id ask you to memorize that listrather than hold bulletin in your hand and read it now the next thing were going to run into here is past and future experience this is bid for two things one the lowest level case there isbecause experience to him is dubin usually or its figurefigure or its something so it compares to the reality scale his definition of experience compares with the reality scale his definition of experience is direct index to the reality scale by the way what does experience mean hell say experiencethats very easy to consider there youve got your figurefigure level what does experience mean well to write about it or make something out of itexperience is that thing which you use to manufacture the future hes dub now what is an experience well experience is that which you try not to have thats probably black or invisible or its the thing you forget would be blackness experience is something you try to forget invisibility level experience is something you have to cope with obsessive confront experience isahwell experiencethats pretty hard to defineexperience i guess its to go through something youre getting fairly sane responseto go through something to have an actual adventure something of this sort youre getting fairly sane reaction to experience so dont think that past and future experience is pegging up at the highest level of the reality scale it isnt this process was found in the 21st american to be the undercut process this was the lowest undercut process and this is killer and it is very trying to an auditor very trying process because it offers so many wonderful temptations and thats whats wrong with this process now you run these two questions one after the other with assessment emeter nothing you just put the emeter down after youve done the dynamic straight wire thing because on dynamic straight wire when you said children the needle was going on gradual shift over here and little theta bop now and then you said children and it fell dial or all of sudden started doing big theta bop in the middle when you got off of children it settled down to the other pattern that told you that you had something to be run on the subject of children that he will also at the same time give you daffy reading he will tell you some daffy terminal to representso you needed the emeter there but you dont need the emeter on past and future experience not even vaguely you can just put the emeter aside and turn it off and just run these two commands just clear them with the pc very bluntly say were going to run something about experience now were going to see how you get along with this little process and here are the commands of it what part of your lifewould you be willing to reexperience and the other command is what part of the future would you be willing to experience now heres the first command what part of your life would you be willing to reexperience the answer actually called for is time isnt it and this is time process but there are very few preclears that will find this out for very long period they wont give you anything but supersignificances and ballup and the pc who is real bad off will give you type of experience you accept all these things you say what part of your life would you be willing to reexperience he says well eating cake thats an answer thats an answer and thats followed with this what part of the future would you be willing to experience he says well more cake thats an answer so you just accept any answer that he gives you on the line it gradually will boil down to time answer and it will gradually go backtrack the longer you run it the more track youre going to cover the more future youre going to cover and there will be periods when the individual is absolutely sure that he is totally predicting the future he gets into implants let us say that tell him what the future is all about hes stuck 8000 years ago but hes telling you about the future all kinds of odd phenomena show up but engrams come up and slap you in the teeth one right after the other you run this for while and the individual says oooh well you know i really wouldnt be willingwell i would be willingi dont knowi wouldoohh welli really dont knowdental operation there i was young boyi dont know if id like to re experience thati guess i could reexperience sitting in theno i could re experiencei could reexperience the next day after it you say thats fine and just mark it down with the ballpoint dental experience as child that one he cant confront now youre never going to run it as an engram but youre going to have some tag of it as an engram see it may show you something as you go along and he runs into hot experiences real real hot experiences one right after the other it is about time you put the emeter back in his paws get the idea you dont have to start it with the emeter but if he starts running into hot experiences or if he gets into an engram and he cant seem to get out of the thing the thing to do is not run the engram but give him an emeter and spot it in time for him get it spotted in time if hes running into them hot and heavy one right after the other just leave him with the emeter but if there is only one you have to spot in time and then in little while he doesnt seem to be running any more take the cans away from him again and put the emeter aside but if he starts running into one that obsessively sticks with him dont let him flounder in the thing for an hour dont let him wallow in this one because he will just wallow in it and this is processthis is not good process to run an engram with so you let him out ok and the way you let him out is to locate it in time with an emeter and you go on running the process now as i say it offers enormous temptations to the auditorbeautiful temptations to run the things contacted as you sit this out you actually are going to change the characteristic of the engram you will ultimately run on the case but you keep listing engrams that he runs into keep listing engrams that he runs into well knowing that he will favor motivators for every one of those motivators there is an overt now an engram that he consistently and persistently keeps hitting and hitting and hitting you are going to find in that engram probably the engram you will run eventually but not until he is in pt out of the engram it seems to have dropped out and so forth and he seems to be all smooth on this thing are you going to reach for that one again you are going to flatten the process and then go to the engram here we go engram running of course that is run all the way through with an emeter give him the cans and start out on this engram that you more or less found with past and future experience now this is going to undercut cases and i dont care how long you run it i dont care if you run it for two weeks because this is very productive process but if you are going to run it over that period of time it isnt noted here but some third rail had better be brought in here some place and hed better be shifted up finally until havingness and you put in pastand future experience right after that line combine with third rail if run more than 8 hours if you run it eight hours this guys havingness is going to start dropping on him and you are going to run into difficulties you could get into difficulties all right engram running well engram running when the case has been prepared this way becomes very simple case will start running like little typewriter if you have got this past and future experience pretty flat once you have picked an engram make sure you get its motivator not only its overt if you have got an overt get the motivator if you have got the motivator get the overt and only when you have got that have you got an incident now an engram that is having one side of the overt or motivator run will get sticky you have got to find the other side and you have got to get both of these things in date normally this will start showing up on past and future experience well we are going to run this engram with an emeter we are going to consider that we have an incident when we have got both motivator and an overt that fit together and if the thing is just awful sticky and dubby and shockingly poor and lot of other things you just started running it too fast that is all we have got several things you can do at this state of the case and so forth probably the best of them is go back to running past and future experience you didnt flatten it now here is this engram running if you notice here it says you run all the commands that run an engram twice run them all twice thats because find something unimportant in that incident is going to stir up stuff that newly has to be confronted once you have chosen an engram and you have begun to run it you have had it thats it thats the engram you are going to run so it has to be chosen with considerable care listen to now if you reassess the case after you have started an engram you will get almost any other incident that is hot to drop more than the engram you started because most of the charge is already dissipated so if you keep reassessing case thinking another engram would be better to run for the case you are of course always going to find another engram you will never find the one you started to run again dropping with as much velocity you see thats something you have to keep in mind if you are going to run an engram thats the engram you are going to run its got to have its overt or motivator suppose you are running the overt side of it you have got to have the motivator side of it so you really havent got an incident until you have got both of these things located and once you have started to run that you have had it because it will discharge its charge and wont register on meter any more the way some other incident will you can get case just stirred all up and run all backwards and upside down and thats the biggest mistake an auditor can make i have given you the reason for the mistakebecause now almost anything will drop better than the one you partially flattened if in doubt run the engram you were running if you are not getting rapid recovery go back to the first engram you ran and considered flat and run it again sometimes it will only take you fifteen minutes to run all five commands you do it very fast but very often something happened that it recharged in some fashion very peculiar if you leave about third of an engram missing and unflat the whole engram has tendency to charge up again it is kind of funny but you have got to flatten the engram you contacted now the rule of the last largest object is the only one i want you to pay any attention to in questioning the pc pc apparently is getting out of it change your auditing command you are running what part of that incident can you confront he says well i dont know its pretty unreal to i dont know whether this happened or not what was the last largestobject if he said anything that was offbeat and showed an unwillingness to run any more of the engram you want to find out at once what was the last largest object that you contacted in there and he says house you are going to shift your auditing command now to what part of that house can you confront and you are going to run that simply until he is back in the incident and then you are going to go off on to what part of that incident can you confront doesnt require any vast bridge you just tell him you are going to shift in that way using that rule you can actually pick up an engram where he was running as abraham lincoln and in the engram he was shot in fords theatreyou knowand the date is obviously correct dropped and everything and then he runs john wilkes boothno he wasnt lincoln he was john wilkes booth and so help god you may find that he was the secret service agent who had couple of drinks that night and wasnt watching you dont care whether he runs it dub or not dont give up because hes running it wrong because itll come out right there was joke on us in the 21st american we had our paws on bowie he was jim bowie and of course everybody doubted this because it is famous historical figure and they tried to do everything under the sun to shake him out of this engram and they finally went back to running it and it was the one that flattened out the trouble was he had dub on it which made bowie die the wrong kind of death under wrong circumstances but as he ran it the more he ran it the more he ran it the more right the circumstances got and it finally all came out in the wash he did run the death of jim bowie historical figures however are usually the yoyo point used the guy went out of his own body at the death there was some current historical figure he said that is the identity necessary to resolve this incident that identity could handle it so i will just be catherine the great and he goes and runs catherine the great the only mistake is to let him escape out of the time period maybe he did yoyo right into the palace maybe he did go right through her skull but the right engram will shake out because the reality scale is run by running an engram theoretically you could clear person just by running one engram well enough so never get off onto quantitative engrams an engram is merely something for him to get used to confronting and creating and mocking up and so forth its just playing field you are using the significance the amount of change he gets in his life none of these things have anything to do with it at all it is just how well he can handle mental image picture and you have chosen honey for him to handle that is about all it amounts to and when he finds out he can handle this thing from to izzard and beginning to end and he can do it well then the next engram to resolve the case will run quite rapidly and you will run on down and finally run his basic earliest shift of identity which is the rock and formerly he said there is beautiful clear spherethats the rock and thats all the rock oh heck when you get several engrams run and get the rock as one of the engrams you find out this beautiful clear sphere was something he customarily clamped around thetans as trap and they sometimes clamped it around him and there were raiding parties and there was all kinds of personnel and there is drama and there is strain and there is scenery and everything else when you contacted the rock first and ran the rock first he was insufficiently able to contact things the date when he was mocking up this thing he was so capable of mocking up that later on this poor little weak ole thetan years and years and centuries and so forth afterwards going back to mock up this rockuhuh its too beefy thats too much engram for him to confront first off so you choose the engramsit doesnt much matter what you choose you will find that every sexual incident you contact is bounce from death little rule for you so dont let catch anybody in the hgc running prenatals birth conception because that is bounce those are all tied in with the death and the death is the engram which is necessary to resolve the case so you keep running past and future experience until you get them down to that ok leave the second dynamic incidents severely alonenow it can be that he died and he died is followed by conception sequence and he goes back to the old body to see if it is still decently buriedyou knowand then he cant find the person that he thought he was going to be get the next body from and he gets all confused and messups of this character can occur but keep him on the incident is this part of the text when you finish death and go through the exteriorization sequence right at the end of it there is conception or prenatal or birth they quite ordinarily bounce into it and you dont want it you want nothing to do with it so you stop him when you have got all of the exteriorization run there is lot to know about engrams you have been taught all this but i am just showing you what you can do to win in the hgc with engram running this would be good clean job then every time you run an engram now is the time to use some notis straight wire with its ordinary commands which you know they are recall something that you implied was unimportant recall something somebody else thought was important dont ever let pc run it in reverse because it discharges havingness in about five commands that is real rough the other way too all right now there we have rundown that will get engrams run that will get ordinary runofthemill cases squared around and that will get lot done but what about people who were not through the american 21st and during that period of time up until they start in with theta clearing course to run actual engrams on pcs how about these people well you have selected person overts with the withhold command added and you will have new bulletin out on these things and so forth we want that auditing to be relatively muzzled it will win and everything will go along just dandy but if you have got some case and this is more for dops than anything elseif you have got some case that was awfully hard to start very low random profile youd better turn it over to graduate of the 21st american and if you have got some case that after he ran along for while and was getting up to point where hed just run engrams beautifully and the whole tracks opening up everything is going along just dandy and it is certain that the engram necessary to resolve the case is just waiting give him an auditor that can run it in other words you can run an hgc this way you can get some auditors that set pcs up to run engrams you got the idea and then you can have some auditors that run engrams this is not any real violation of the auditors code because that will still give him the best processes and the best treatment for the pc that can be given now there is reason why particularly after staff theta clearing course that everybody cant run regimen of this sort but running it in the hgc with all the profiles being submitted to and all the case analysis reportsthe case analysis reports now are more vital than profiles because r changed on case does not necessarily change the profile at all you should know about that you can change the r of the case without changing the profile the person answered the same questions only he answered them with reality this is quite remarkable we need brand new test that test is in development right at this moment it is confront test and that test will be coming up but there is reason to rush it particularly lets just do it by case analysis i will get out bulletin that will take care of auditors who were not trained to run engrams what they will run but you already have data and material on this and it is just as before what you have been running now to start case out with notis straight wire is adventurous thats an adventurous thing to do thats rough thing to do we learned great many things in the 21st american acc learned great many things and that was one of them selected personsovertwithhold is very very superior in undercutting cases to selected persons overts the only main change we have got is that we run selected person overtwithhold commands just as it is given here in pt problem that is wonderful thing to do with case as long as the terminal is real to the pc and there is real reason that running scientologist who knows what the command is why arc break straight wire cannot be run on person by an auditor who has not been through an engram running course thats beautiful process i want to tell you something else can i tell you something here lot of research was done in the 21st american acc and students didnt see as much as they thought they should i suppose but i was around and i never saw so many flips and changes and vagaries in my life as i saw in that particular unit the reports which i got were veryvery helpful to mevery very helpful to scientology at large there was great deal done in that course i spent about three weeks of the coursedid very rapid research just in catching up with some of these undercuts because let assure you the r factor in most of the cases you approach is so low that it poses problem of running greater than we had ever imagined therefore these are the processes that we are handing out now these are notis type of process dynamic straight wire runs straight identification but the rest of these things are notis types of processes to cure somebody from notising when person can confront something he longer has to notis it but there was funny command came up along the line that i dont fully understand yet but it takes care of theta body now this is part of the research that was never given to the 21st american and this is peculiar darned thing you can write it down on the back of this bulletin if you want to it is recall time when you thought something bad was unimportant and that is just about the wildest thing you ever saw now that runs all by itself but can be combined with recall time somebody else thought something bad was important and you will run all the newspapers off the case the second command there is really not essential but you just run this first command repetitively and if it seems to run down or something bad happens flip over to the other command but you will asis theta body this is the doggondest thing you ever saw it is perfectly wild pitch i was just adding up all possible combinations and working in all possible directions and this one fell out of the hamper and it doesnt integrate too well with the rest of your data but this is the goofy one now something else came up in the 21st american that i should tell you in the hgc and that is after nine years we have found out why we had nine years of how and now in the ninth year we find out why why people are aberrated why they are sick why they act the way they do why individuation takes place and that is all wrapped up with withhold i had withhold earlier but didnt shake it all out of the hamper because i didnt have the overts to go with it we find out that an individual gets sick by having the overt impulse to make somebody else sick and then withholds it because it is less social to give people illnesses so he gets them himself this is freudian transference it is whole number of things so when you run these overts run the withhold with it and the case will start finding out why the theta body thing and the masses and ridges why they run out when you ask person to recall time when he thought something bad was unimportant or recallwell that is the best commandrecall time when he thought something bad was unimportant when you run this you evidently run the center pin of the withhold but you will get his tolerance andthis is the first straight ethical process evidently we have it raises persons ethics it asises theta body it takes demon bodies and things like that off cases i tested it two or three times here just monkeying around with this thing and it is one of the wilder ones this is wild pitch that particular process so you could say that when field doesnt immediately disintegrate when you cant get an individual easily in the engram when the field stays persistently black or something like that you have got another string to your bow and i dont care if you use it but if you do use it know this it runs as an automaticity on such demon case he runs brrrrtthe last two thousand years he has been notising and saying it was unimportant that something was bad and he will start coming up with well i should do somethingno i shouldnt do somethingwell what is this i should do something about it i shouldnt do something about it i have been very neglectful but that really isnt bad not really somebody dying from the bullet wound i gave emthat really isnt bad but and he is stuck right with the consideration on all of his overtsconsequences of overts they all must be unimportant and it reduces his ethical level but i have now seen two demon bodies disintegrate just with that one command just disintegrateand this is the first time we ever had something that would disintegrate the astral body so we find out at once that the astral body was an aberration it isnt necessary thing to make thetan stick in the head at all all right now i wanted to give you this rundown because today you were having little bit of rough time doing transition from student to pro auditor and i wanted to talk to you even though it burned up some of your valuable time and mine and ask you to sic semper transit huh now are there any questions yes jean q i have two questions in running of the engram do you ignore what they were running in the acc or do you just go back and run them my preclear has had several engrams started now if we look over this carefully we see in running an incident find the engram necessary to resolve the case once you have chosen it and have begun to run it be sure you have the motivator and the overt and then do not do not do not do not depart from that incident to run another that drops better or comes up now look here the engrams that were run on them in the course are longer going to fall and an engram is not going to show on an emeter and if there were several engrams run on somebody in the course and the first one wasnt flattened then whoever audited them ought to be hit in the head with sledge hammer theres only one or two cases that got by with this that i have checked up on so far and it is about the most serious blunder that could be made now what you do in case thats had an engram already started is get lie reaction checkthats all you wantof some sort or another concerning this particular thing you can put him on the emeter and ask him if it was run and so forth and ask him which one was the first one run you could possibly get an occlusion but usually the pc will tell you theres particular reason to doubt the pc get the first one and get that one flat and then you have choice but to pick up the next one and flatten that one this applies without regard to how many auditors were on the case this also you will find out will sometimes apply to somebody who had an engram audited in 1950 the only trouble with 1950 engram is that it is probably an operation in the current lifetime or prenatal in the current lifetime and it was the wrong engram necessary to resolve the case and you wont get very far running the thing and we have data at this time whether its best to pick that one up and run it or not but i would say for sure that an engram that should have been run to resolve the case such as past death if that was ever entered in all of those years including 1950it may longer drop on the emeter because some of its charge is gone that is the engram necessary to resolve the case yes got another oneq yes the dynamic straight wiredo you keep running this until you have picked up all the daffy terminals then go through it several times and get the daffy ones each time if you get daffy one if you get several daffy ones you take those you got on the first run and run them dont bother to go through again because it will have straightened out enough will have straightened out to admit progress of the case but if you dont get any daffy ones through once then run it again any other questions dale dale i just had comment on that one 1950 engram in which the auditor blew session because it was whole track was the engram necessary to resolve the case and finally showed up the guy had been black since 1950 good picked it up and flattened it well thats good job that tells you that black case then doesnt necessarily require five or six weeks of preparation before you run an engram you pick up an engram as early as you can on case and charge through but it doesnt get you around starting case you have always got to start case or start session yes q on this reexperience process do i run it until i get 3d pictures and track yes oh 3d pictures and back in pt back in pt ill give you an example of one of these heres the pc he is sitting in terror charge in total black freeze at 1500 ad one second later everything went to hell one second before everything had gone to hell and hes sitting in this split second at rest point got it well now what do you think happens when you start asking him about future and past alternately hell move right off that rest point wont he so this is an explosive doggoned process now i say you run it until he gets to pt some time or other you might find it impossible to get him to pt on the process you just might but the experience that has been had with it so far is that it does eventually move him to pt now is the time to take him back at the auditors discretion and have him run that incident in which he was stuck by the way what part of pt are you willing to experience has on several cases exposed the engram necessary to resolve the case it is the engram hes sitting in and it is the one necessary to resolve the case yes q if you leave process very unflat one afternoon and come back in the morning and start questioning the guy and you pick up first of all present time problems now supposing that process is the basic of his present time problem of the morning are he and you the terminals the preclear and auditor the two terminals yes q do you run it that way oh well if he got lot of arc breaks it would be good thing to run it this way that would clean up all the arc breaks wouldnt it now i am going to give you that again on arc breaks this is the hottest one to run arc breaks on just pick up the auditor and pick up the pc as the two people involved in the present time problem i am glad you brought that up joe this idea of throwing him back into session after you have ended session the day before is another point of judgment just how do you smoothly get him into it usually he has piled up something on top of the engram there is process here which is not really very good process but which kicks them out and it was not given in this acc that is problems of comparable magnitude to that engram or that incident it will actually deintensify an engram you should have that as little panaceathat is an interesting one to wind up an intensive on about noon of the last day you all of sudden realize boy this man isnt going to make it and you could run problem of comparable magnitude to that engram and get it keyed out however you are better than that and you will have had it flat by the last day of the last intensive he has thats for sure any other questions don q is recall something preferred over recall time i have heard recall time you did something to somebody and also recall something you did to somebody which is slightly different recall time is always superior process unless the individual is consistently not recalling time at which time he is not obeying the auditing command so you should say recall something you have done to to somebody who cant spot something on time track q whats the difference there you are running really two processes with recall time you did something and you are running only one process recall something you have done q can he continue to do that without recalling time yeah definitely anything else recall time all by itselfyou just sit down and say to pc recall time thank you recall time thank you some interesting things would happen to case time you see is the single aberration joe q in running an engram when you are tagging the engram for the first time is it possible to peg say 2ton motivator and onepound overt and thats the incident yes because until they get some of the overt flat the motivator will come off the right one to run there by the way is the overt you get that overt damn real and all of sudden youll find the 20tons have departed down to about 1 0tons on the motivator now theyll run on comparable lines yes q couldnt you have say 20ton motivator as he was saying and twenty oneton overts tied to the same motivator rather than one large overt you could you could nevertheless youll find somebody getting all loused up on this and best remedy is just to play what overt you find against what motivator you find as the incident and just keep playing them one against the other back and forth back and forth and eventually the thing will come out right there are many remedies and one is selected persons overtwithhold straight wire on the personnel of the incident you could take any incident as pt and run any pt process on the incident thats little rule i dont advise you doing it however but you can do it its very interesting find something unimportant about that executioner is just about the same as find something unimportant about this room if you want to get reality soaring on pc just run find something unimportant about this room and hell start this notis machinery going you know and hell run it out to some degree and all of sudden the room will brighten up very interesting think of something you did to an executioner would be it rather than think of something you did to that executioner and he will come up with the overt and he will find out he was the executioner in the same castle for about three lifetimes before he suddenly came back there and got executed that usually is the way these things compareany other questions there is burning question that you should ask is are we supposed to run these things muzzled now let just say this to do this for lets cut down the unnecessary yak and if the pc seems to be arc breaking at all you voluntarily muzzle your auditing you got it because what hes got is an engram of being talked to or being interrogated in some fashion and everything that he doesnt consider exactly necessary to the auditing session he resents so if you find pc is arc breaking you muzzle your session any other questions before we break this up thank you very much for your time i appreciate very much your coming in i know you had hard day getting on to new routine and you have got auxiliary duties several people in the hgc have been split off of administration and there are other things going on latch on to em get wheeling but lets start making theta clears in this hgc and just make nothing else but theta clears i have given you pattern here that was thoroughly tested out in the 21st american acc and you can make theta clearstheres

hubbardhubbard communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 26 february 1959 engram running on old dianetic cases or restarted cases it has been found that the abandonment of an unflattened engram to start another one can leave the case in an apparent jam starting new engram without flattening the first one contacted may be to the preclear the same as command not to confront the first engram stable data the incident entered by the auditor must be wholly flattened by scientology commands before second incident is approached the end goal of running incidents is the increasing of the ability to confront when incidents are started and not finished in favour of new incident the preclear may feel he is being forbidden to confront the first one an incident consists of an overt engram and motivator engram on the same subject it is evidently necessary to scout the earlier auditing of any incident that was abandoned in order to get the incident run otherwise black detachment may result the blackness and the detachment may exist in the earlier auditing of the same incident rather than in the incident the intention of bad auditor is to prevent confronting therefore bad auditing must be cleared away before contacted engram can be completely entered again the process that most swiftly strips off bad auditing to clean up engrams or otherwise is recall something you have done to auditors name recall something you have withheld from auditors name these questions are run alternately one after the other and are best run muzzled tr 0 1 2 and 3 onlyauditor only nods when preclear originates this mechanism is probably behind most black or invisible cases now extant in scientology l ron hubbard lrhrdissue 90 m 1959 ca late february the magazine of dianetics and scientology from washington dc how to study scientology l ron hubbard the first thing that student has to find out for himself and then recognize is that he is dealing with precision tools here in the courses it isnt up to someone else to force this piece of information on him the whole subject of scientology as far as the student is concerned is as good or bad in direct ratio to his knowledge of it it is up to student to find out how precise these tools are he should before he starts to discuss criticize or attempt to improve on the data presented to him find out for himself whether or not the mechanics of scientology are as stated and whether or not it does what has been proposed for it he should make up his mind about each thing that is taught in the school the procedure techniques mechanics and theory he should ask himself these questions does this piece of data exist is it true does it work will it produce the best possible results in the shortest time there are two ways to answer these questions to his own satisfaction find them in preclear or find them in himself these are fundamentals and every auditor should undertake to discover them himself thus raising scientology above an authoritarian category it is not sufficient that an instructor stand before him and declare the existence of these each and every student must determine for himself whether or not the instructors statements are true as an example of science in an authoritarian category in the field of medicine some instructors declare that multiple sclerosis is the decay of nervous fibers and that it is incurable and that people who contract the disease die in relatively short period of time it must be answered in just this way on the examination paper or the student will find himself with less than passing grade this is not instructionthis is obstruction in the first place one in medical school knows anything about multiple sclerosis good instructor would expect his students to question such statement and to find for themselves what can be done about multiple sclerosis there are two ways man ordinarily accepts things neither of them very good one is to accept statement because authority says it is true and must be accepted and the other is by preponderance of agreement amongst other people preponderance of agreement is all too often the general public test for sanity or insanity suppose someone were to walk into crowded room and suddenly point to ceiling saying oh look theres huge twelvefoot spider on the ceiling everyone would look up but noone else would see the spider finally someone would tell him so oh yes there is he would declare and become very angry when he found that one would agree with him if he continued to declare his belief in the existence of the spider he would very soon find himself institutionalized the basic definition of sanity in this somewhat nebulously learned society is whether or not person agrees with everyone else it is very sloppy manner of accepting evidence but all too often it is the primary measuring stick and then the rule of authority does dr j doe agree with your proposition then of course it cannot be true dr doe is an eminent authority in the field man by the name of galen at one time dominated the field of medicine another man by the name of harvey upset galens cozy position with new theory of blood circulation galen had been agreeing with the people of his day concerning the tides of the blood they knew nothing about heart action they accepted everything they had been taught and did little observing of their own harvey worked at the royal medical academy and found by animal vivisection the actual function of the heart he had the good sense to keep his findings absolutely quiet for while leonardo da vinci had somehow discovered or postulated the same thing but he was crazy artist and one would believe an artist harvey was member of the audience of play by shakespeare in which the playwright made the same observation but again the feeling that artists never contribute anything to society blocked anyone but harvey from considering the statement as anything more than fiction finally harvey made his announcement immediately dead cats rotten fruit and pieces of wine jugs were hurled in his direction he raised quite commotion in medical and social circles until finally in desperation one doctor made the historical statement that i would rather err with galen than be right with harvey man would have made an advance of exactly zero if this had always been the only method of testing evidence but every so often during mans progress there have been rebels who were not satisfied with preponderance of opinion and who tested fact for themselves observing and accepting the data of their observation and then testing again possibly the first man who made flint axe looked over piece of flint and decided that the irregular stone could be chipped certain way when he found that flint would chip easily he must have rushed to his tribe and enthusiastically tried to teach his fellow tribesmen how to make axes in the shape they desired instead of spending months searching for accidental pieces of stone of just the right shape the chances are he was stoned out of camp indulging in further flight of fancy it is not difficult to imagine that he finally managed to convince another fellow that his technique worked and that the two of them tied down third with piece of vine and forced him to watch them chip flint axe from rough stone finally after convincing fifteen or twenty tribesmen by forceful demonstration the followers of the new technique declared war on the rest of the tribe and winning forced the tribe to agree by decree evaluation of data man has never known very much about that with which his mind is chiefly filled data what is data what is the evaluation of data for instance if you have been in scientology very long the chances are that someone has glibly told you that he knew from psychoanalysis that if one could remember childhood experiences one could be relieved of certain psychosomatic pains his conclusion from this tiny scrap of information was that scientology is not new in 1884 when breuer first presented this tiny fact to freud he was unable to convince the eminent doctor but he managed to convince freud in the next ten years then freud convinced hisfriends medicine then fought freud to standstill but eventually psychoanalysis emerged from the imbroglio all these years in which psychoanalysis has taught its tenets to each generation of doctors the authoritarian method was used as can be verified by reading few of the books on the subject within them is found interminably freud said the truly important thing is not that freud said thing but is the data valuable if it is valuable how valuable is it you might say that datum is as valuable as it has been evaluated datum can be proved in ratio to whether it can be evaluated by other data and its magnitude is established by how many other data it clarifies thus the biggest datum possible would be one which would clarify and identify all knowledge known to man in the material universe unfortunately however there is such thing as prime datum there must be not one datum but two data since datum is of use unless it can be evaluated furthermore there must be datum of similar magnitude with which to evaluate any given datum data is your data only so long as you have evaluated it it is your data by authority or it is your data if it is your data by authority somebody has forced it upon you and at best it is little more than light aberration of course if you asked question of man whom you thought knew his business and he gave you his answer that datum was not forced upon you but if you went away from him believing from then on that such datum existed without taking the trouble to investigate the answer for yourselfwithout comparing it to the known universe you were falling short of completing the cycle of learning mechanically the major thing wrong with the mind is of course the turbulence in it but the overburden of information in this society is enforced education that the individual has never been permitted to test literally when you are told not to take anyones word as an absolute datum you are being asked to break habit pattern forced upon you when you were child your instructor in scientology could have told you what he found to be true and invited you to test it for yourself but unless you have tested it you very likely do not have the fundamentals of scientology in mind well enough to be comfortable in the use of any or all of the techniques available to you this is why theory is so heavily stressed in scientology the instructor can tell you what he has found to be true and what others have found to be true but at time should he ask you to accept itplease allow plea otherwise test it for yourself and convince yourself whether or not it exists as truth and if you find that it does exist you will be comfortable thereafter otherwise unrecognized even by yourself you are likely to find down at the bottom of your information and education an unresolved question which will itself undermine your ability to assimilate or practice anything in the line of technique your mind will not be as facile on the subject as it should be it is not through courtesy that you are being asked to check your datayou are being asked to become much better auditors by resolving your basic and fundamental concepts any quarrel you may have with theory is something that only you can resolve is the theory correct or isnt it correct only you can answer that it cannot be answered for you you can be told what other auditors have achieved in the way of results and what other auditors have observed but you cannot become truly educated until you have achieved the results for yourself the moment man opens his mouth and asks where is validation you can be sure you are looking at very stupid man that man is saying bluntly and abruptly i cannot think for myself i have to have authority where could he possibly look for validation except into the physical universe and into his own subjective and objective reality look at the sciences unfortunately scientology is surrounded by world that calls itself world of science but it is world that is in actuality world of authority true that which is science today isfar far in advance of the hindu concept of the world wherein hemisphere rested on the backs of seven elephants which stood on seven pillars that stood on the back of mud turtle below which was mud into infinity the reason engineering and physics have reached out so far in advance of other sciences is the fact that they pose problems which punish man so violently if he doesnt look carefully into the physical universe an engineer is faced with the problem of drilling tunnel through mountain for railroad tracks are laid up to the mountain on either side if he judges space wrongly the two tunnel entrances would fail to meet on the same level in the center it would be so evident to one and all concerned that the engineer made mistake that he takes great care not to make such mistake he observes the physical universe not only to the extent that the tunnel must meet to fraction of an inch but to the extent that if he were to misjudge wrongly the character of the rock through which he drills the tunnel would cave inan incident which would be considered very unlucky and unfortunate occurrence to railroading biology comes closer to being science than some others because in the field of biology if someone makes too big mistake about bug the immediate result can be dramatic and terrifying suppose biologist is charged with the responsibility of injecting plankton into water reservoir plankton are microscopic germs that are very useful to man but if through some mistake the biologist injects typhoid germs into the water supply there would be an immediate and dramatic result suppose biologist is presented with the task of producing culture of yeast which would when placed in white bread dough stain the bread brown this man is up against the necessity of creating yeast which not only behaves as yeast but makes dye as well he has to deal with the practical aspect of the problem because after he announces his success there is the yeast test is the bread edible and the brownbread test is the bread brown anyone could easily make the test and everyone would know very quickly whether or not the biologist had succeeded or failed politics is called science the punishment for mistake in the science of politics is so tremendous that this whole culture is on the verge of being wiped out there are natural laws about politics they could be worked out if someone were to actually apply scientific basis to political research for instance it is foregone conclusion that if all communications lines are cut between the united states and russia russia and the united states are going to understand each other less and less then by demonstrating to everyone how the american way of life and the russian way of life are different and by demonstrating it day after day year after year there is alternative but break of affinity by stating flatly that russia and the united states are not in agreement on any slightest political theory or conduct of man or nations the job is practically complete both nations will go into anger tone and suddenly there is war russia is very very low on the tone scale she is totalitarian slave state and about as safe to have in the family of nations as mad dog at cocktail party we as nation could be very very cleverwe could try to put russia back together again we are nation possessed of the greatest communications networks on the face of the earth with an undreamed of manufacturing potential we have within our borders the best advertising men in the world but instead of selling europe an idea we give machine guns planes and tanks for use in case russia breaks out the more threats imposed against country in russias tone level the more dangerous that country will become when people are asked what they would do about this grave question they shrug and say something to the effect that the politicians know best they hedge and rationalize by saying that after all there is the american way of life and it must be protectedwhat is the american way of life this is question that will stop almost any american what is the american way of life that is different from the human way of life we have tried to gather together economic freedom for the individual freedom of the press and individual freedom and define them as strictly american way of lifewhy hasnt it been called the human way of life in the field of humanities science has been thoroughly adrift unquestioned authoritarian principles have been followed any person who accepts knowledge without questioning it and evaluating it for himself is demonstrating himself to be in apathy toward that sphere of knowledge it demonstrates that the people in the united states today must be in low state of apathy with regard to politics in order to accept without question everything that happens fundamentals when man tries to erect the plans of lifetime or profession on data which he himself has never evaluated he cannot possibly succeed fundamentals are very very important but first of all one must learn how to think in order to be absolutely sure of fundamental thinking is not particularly hard to learn it consists merely of comparing particular datum with the physical universe as it is known and observed how for instance would you find out for your own satisfaction that there exists such thing as mockup find preclear who is also interested in verifying such existence of mockups or have someone run you on them your instructor has done this sufficient number of times and has seen it done to others sufficient number of times to satisfy himself that mockups exist and can be run and bettered on preclear but just because they exist for him and he informs you of his knowledge does not mean that it exists for you unless you have made up your mind through comparison of the information with the known universe you will not be able to handle mockups properly when there is an authoritarian basis for your education you are not truly educated authoritarianism is little more than form of hypnotism learning is forced under threat of some form of punishment student is stuffed with data which has not been individually evaluated just as taxidermist would stuff snake such student will be wellinformed and welleducated according to presentday standards but unfortunately he will not be very successful in his chosen profession indecision underlies an authoritarian statement do not allow your scientology education to lie on the quicksand of indecision unless you have looked into the matter of engrams and unless you have actually run preclear into an engramthe realization that i there is time track and 2 that physical pain can be stored and can be recovered and 3 that all the perceptics are registered during these moments of unconsciousness will not be yours your knowledge concerning the engram depends exclusively upon what you have observed about that engram there have been volumes of articles written about techniques of running engrams there are many techniques in existence which run them make up your mind whether or not they work for you first of all find out to your own satisfaction whether or not there is an engram in existence then determine whether or not the technique in question will discover the engram for you and whether or not the technique really runs the engram having made certain that there is an engram ask yourself what kind of technique you would evolve if you decided to do something about this object the engram how would you go about it unless you have asked yourself this question and tried to come to definite conclusion about it you will never come into agreement on the technique of running engrams you will be performing an authoritarianrote you can learn how to run an engram by rote but unless you decide from your own observation that there is an engram to be run you will be simply performing some ritual in which mistake is very easy to make an auditor who does not understand memory has business attempting to improve preclears memory he could hardly know what the anatomy of memory is it cannot be done well by rote about the worst thing that could happen to preclear is to drop into something and then feel that the auditor is thinking now lets seeit was page 62 or was it 63 and the question was while the preclear sits there suffering and thinking do something say something an auditor who is auditing by rote will make mistakes like that because he does not have the basic fundamentals as part of his background of training truly good auditor doesnt have to think twice he knows instinctively how the auditing session itself should be run when the basic fundamentals are securely the auditors own there is need for him to be told what must be done you are asked to examine the subject of scientology on critical basisa very critical basis it is not to be examined with the attitude that when you were in school you learned that such and such was true and since you learned that first the first learning takes precedence prime example of this is the literary critic who says after reviewing book that the book is not novel because it is not cross section of life his professor in literature gave him passing grade because he answered the question correctly on his examination paper and therefore book is not novel unless it is cross section of life there is yet to appear good definition for aesthetics and art and yet they parrot definition for specific form of art do not make the mistake of criticizing something on the basis of whether or not it concurs with the opinions of someone else the point which is pertinent is whether or not it concurs with your opinion does it agree with what you think nearly everyone has done some manner of observing of the material universe and there is surely one in scientology who has not done some small amount of observation of organisms one has seen all there is to see about an organism but there is certainly dearth of organisms available for further study there is valid reason for accepting the opinion of professor blotz of the blitz university who said in 1933 that schizophrenics were schizophrenics and that made them schizophrenics for all the time if you are interested in the manifestation of insanity there is any and every form of insanity that you could hope to see in lifetime in almost any part of the world study the peculiarities of the people around you and wonder what they would be like if their little peculiarities were magnified hundred fold you may find that by listing all the observable peculiarities you would have complete list of all the insanities in the world this list might well be far more accurate than that which was advanced by kraepelin and used in the united states today if sanity is rationality and insanity is irrationality and you postulated how irrational people would be if certain of their obsessions were magnified hundred fold you might well have in your possession far more accurate and complete list of insanities and their manifestations than is currently in existence if you will take the time and effort then of making complete examination of your subject introspectively and by observation you will find that you have suddenly become an excellent auditor the hard way is to sit down and memorize third of million words contained in science of survival the method all too many educational systems employ in this ageso then we ask you to look at scientology study it question it and use it as we present it and you will have discovered something for yourself and in so doing you might well discover lot more what you will be doing in scientology the techniques and the theories are highly workable but they are not highly workable just because we say so since scientology is very precise science based on proven data axioms and precise procedures it must be used exactly as stated in order to gain the results which have been obtained by using it with understanding the student can observe for himself its workability when you have applied it as it should be and applied as it is taught at the school and still find it unworkable it is your privilege to question it and if you like reject it but it is very funny thing in the history of scientology the only people who have shouted out against scientology are those people who know little or nothing about it or they have been given some erroneous data about it and had used very bad perversion of scientology and said this is the way it is so the only advice we can give to the student is study scientology for itself and use it exactly as stated then form his own opinions study it with the purpose in mind of arriving at his own conclusions as to whether or not the tenets he has assimilated are correct and workable compare what you have learned with the known universe seek for the reasons behind manifestation and postulate the manner and in which direction the manifestation will likely proceed do not allow the authority of any one person or school of thought to create foregone conclusion within your sphere of knowledge only with these principles of education in mind can you become truly educated individual and good scientologist l ron hubbardhubbard

1959 in selected persons overt straightwire there is an element of diagnosis how does one select the selected person every time this process misses on preclear one of three things is at fault either 1 pc has pt problem 2 dynamic straight wire should have been run week or two 3 the wrong person was selected for the process the whole thing is matter of attention units 1950 if the preclear has his attention totally fixed on terminal little else is real to him look at one object only in room how real are the other objects if preclears attention is all bound up in some person how can he find reality elsewhere very wellhow do we find then the selected person the most loaded twoway comm question is who in your life is to blame for the condition youre in others of like ilk produce the selected person you then run on selected persons overt straight wire who was the person who really had it in for you who do you know or did you know that youd really hate to be if the pc to any of the

communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 28 february 1959 analysis of cases primary skill required of an accomplished auditor would be analysis of case the basic error is overestimating the cases ability all failures stem from failure to undercut the reality of case if that reality level is reached the case will improve if not the case remains stagnant results defined case achieves reality on change of case somatic behavior or appearance for the better better defined negative gain things disappear that have been annoying or unwanted ability gain defined pcs recognition that pc can now do things he could not do before intelligence gain defined loss of restimulation of stupidity by reason of attempts to confront or experience the problems of life intelligence appears when stupidity is keyed out or erased intelligence is confronting ability familiarity or familiarization permits intelligence to manifest reaching and withdrawing are more possible when stupidity is keyed out or erased increasing ability to reach and withdraw increases intelligence it can be seen that when attention is fixed the ability to reach and withdraw decreases therefore intelligence decreases therefore the ability to change decreases therefore case gain unfixing attention is done in various ways as hypnotism is done by fixing attention parallel observation is that person wakes up receives less fixed effect when attention becomes unfixed unfixing attention must be done by increasing ability to reach and withdraw from the specific thing or person on which attention is fixed in the bank the bank merely expresses recording of past attention fixations shocks of various kinds can unfix attention but always lead to decrease in ability over period unfixing attention by violence throws case downscale as the case goes upscale the attention refixes on things violence unfixed it from clearing is gradient process of finding places where attention is fixed and restoring the ability of the pc to place and remove attention under his own determinism case analysis consists then of the determination of where pcs attention at current state of case is fixed on the track and restoring pcs determinism over those places this is done by 1 pt problem running 2 dynamic survey and remedy of fixed points3 selected items and persons survey and unfixing otherdetermined attention at those points the auditors skill in locating where attention is now fixed is even greater now than the auditors ability to remedy the fixation of the pcs attention since this latter problem is fairly well in hand there are many ways of doing survey to determine what the pcs attention is fixed upon now the emeter and interrogation of the pc are the main methods what has your attention been fixed on lately or in this life would elicit reply that could then be used in the questions recall time when you did something to item or person so located recall time when you withheld something from item or person so selected if you find the exact item or person on which attention is fixed you achieve immediate case gain which is to say reality which is to say interest insessionness success if any pc you are running has not manifested case gain reality interest insessionness then one of two things is true 1 you havent found the item or person on which pcs attention is otherdeterminedly fixed and havent run it yet or 2 pc is gonemangone i trust this may be of some small assistance in learning how to analyze case l ron hubbard lrhrd copyright 1959 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard

communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 1 march 1959 issue 2 magazine material two rules for happy living 1 be able to experience anything 2 cause only those things which others are able to experience easily man has had many golden rules the buddhist rule of do unto others as you would have these others do unto you has been repeated often in other religions but such golden rules while they served to advance man above the animal resulted in sure sanity success or happiness such golden rule gives only the cause point or at best the reflexive effect point this is selfdonetoself thing and tends to put all on obsessive cause it gives thought to what one does about the things done to one by others not so indoctrinated how does one handle the evil things done to him it is not told in the buddhist rule many random answers resulted amongst them are the answers of christian science effects on self dont exist the answers of early christians become martyr the answers of christian ministers condemn all such answers to effects created on one bring about somewhat less than sane state of mindto say nothing of unhappiness after ones house has burned down and the family cremated it is great consolation to i pretend it didnt happen 2 liken oneself to job or 3 condemn all arsonists so long as one fears or suffers from the effect of violence one will have violence against him when one can experience exactly what is being done to one ah magic it does not happen the most basic proof of this is the earlier tests with problems of comparable magnitude and later tests of selected overts when the problem or terminal is longer restimulative it ceases to have power to harm one how to be happy in this universe is problem few prophets or sages have dared contemplate directly we find them handling the problem of happiness by assuring us that man is doomed to suffering they seek not to tell us how to be happy but how to endure being unhappy such casual assumption of the impossibility of happiness has led us to ignore any real examination of ways to be happy thus we have floundered forward toward negative goalget rid of all the unhappiness on earth and one would have liveable earth if one seeks to get rid of something continually one admits continually he cannot confront itand thus everyone went down hill life became dwindling spiral of more things we could not confront and thus we went towards blindness and unhappiness to be happy one only must be able to confront which is to say experience those things that are unhappiness is only this the inability to confront that which is hence 1 be able to experience anything the effect side of life deserves great consideration the selfcaused side also deserves examinationto create only those effects which others could easily experience gives us clean new rule of living for if one does then what might he do that he must withhold from others there is reason to withhold his own actions or regret them same thing if ones own actions are easily experienced by others this is sweeping test and definition of good conductto do only those things which others can experience if you examine your track you will find you are hung up only in those actions person did which others were not able to receive hence persons track can become hodgepodge of violence withheld which pulls in then the violence others caused the more actions person emanated which could not be experienced by others the worse persons track became recognizing that he was bad cause or that there were too many bad causes already person ceased causing thingsan unhappy state of being pain misemotion unconsciousness insanity all result from causing things others could not experience easily the reachwithhold phenomena is the basis of all these things when one sought to reach in such way as to make it impossible for another to experience one did not reach then did he to reach with gun against person who is unwilling to be shot is not to reach the person but protest all bad reaches never reached so there was communication and the end result was withhold by the person reaching this reachwithhold became at last an inability to reachtherefore low communication low reality low affinity all bad acts then are those acts which cannot be easily experienced at the target end on this definition let us review our own bad acts or overts which ones were bad only those that could not be easily experienced by another were bad thus which of societys favorite bad acts are bad acts of real violence resulting in pain unconsciousness insanity and heavy loss could at this time be considered bad well what other acts of yours do you consider bad the things which you have done which you could not easily yourself experience were bad but the things which you have done which you yourself could have experienced had they been done to you were not bad that certainly changes ones view of things only processing can bring person to point where he or she could experience anything without enduring consequence so it is wonder that philosophy of yesteryear was stopped on happiness as subject but all processes from the beginning of dianetics and scientology until now which improved the ability to confront or experience were gaining toward the goal all processes that eradicated experience only were poor processes the early drop in gains in processing 1950 came about because people dramatized an eradication of all badness the auditors were unwilling to let the pcs experience anything the pcs sought to get rid of things without experiencing things there is need to lead violent life just to prove one can experience the idea is not to prove one can experience but to regain the ability to experience which is only done in processing thus today we have two golden rules for happiness l be able to experience anything and 2 cause only those things which others are able to experience easily your reaction to these tells you how far you have yet to go in processing and that is the first time we knew thatand if we achieve these two golden rules we scientologists would be the happiest and most successful people in this universe for who could rule any of us with evil of course these are the characteristics of godsbut who said we were trying to make anything else l ron hubbard lrhrdpab 155 professional auditors bulletin the oldest continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 37 fitzroy street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 1 march 1959 processes used in 21st acc compiled from the research material and taped lectures of l ron hubbard i want to take up here with great rapidity the processes from bottom to top that we have so far found and that have been effective and some additional data in running them and first is the process dynamic straightwire the way to do survey on dynamic straightwire is this you ask the person to describe the dynamics from one to eight we dont care about them being sequiturchange them round if you wish now you ask person to describe each one of these dynamics you are watching an meter for change in pattern therefore you must carefully isolate the pattern before you can tell whether or not the pattern has changed on the emeter needle reading but more important than that you are looking for dynamic the preclear makes mistakes about while he is trying to describe it dynamic he cannot describe or dynamic he wont even approach and is very leary of and his statement is confirmed by the emeter reading in other words youve got the statement of the preclear in this particular analysis being stacked up against the emeter reading all the way through in an analysis or diagnosis for dynamic straightwire all right we go all the way through asking for terminal on these dynamics and we finally get repeat we will ask him for terminals on these dynamics and we will get the same dynamic to read again now the basic rule which sorts this out is any dynamic which doesnt clear by twoway comm has to be run simple as that any dynamic which doesnt clear by twoway comm has to be run so if you have two or three dynamics jammed up you can hope that two of them will clear up leaving you with the remaining dynamic but this is not the complete criteria of what you run there is another stable datum dont run terminal that is totally unreal to the preclear another stable datum which comes on top of it is never run terminal that is sensible never if terminal belongs on the dynamic you can almost say youll get nowhere running it so youre looking for terminals that the preclear gives you for dynamic which dont belong on the dynamic at all now if that terminal is real to the preclear you will get tremendous change in the case if that terminal is totally unreal to the preclear and if it does belong on the dynamic why youre not going to get any change on the case so why run it might as well run some other process so we have several conditions by which the diagnosis on dynamic straightwire works ive done enough of these now and run enough of them isolated enough of them and gottenconditions of change on enough of them to realize that every time you changed case you had 1 person who couldnt describe the dynamic accurately or who made mistakes while trying to describe it 2 person who gave you non sequitur or erroneous terminal for that dynamicthe terminal was fairly real to the preclear although it didnt belong thereand 3 you ran that and it opened up track like mad what have you got here you have terrific identification you are trying to undo identification that is lying right on the top well this tells you then that it is neither long process nor an invariable process given enough skill you could undoubtedly find one of these on every casegiven enough skill but it is limited by auditor skill furthermore it gives auditors chance to chop up preclears and it gives auditors chance to write some script so this one has liability and auditors have been writing script like mad we had one particular case where the preclear couldnt say any terminal on the seventh dynamic so promptly the auditor jumps in and takes the nearest related thing to the seventh dynamic the thetan he could get this was head and he ran head and the preclear had nothing to do with it and they wondered why the case didnt advance now you have auditors who are letting the preclear choose in other words there are auditors who actually believe that preclear is permitted power of choice in an auditing session and this is the biggest bug i have found existing at this instant on this acc that ones blinker they are probably not telling you this that they think preclear has power of choice they dont know this that it has to be nutty if you are going to run itif it makes sense why run it they are looking for wrongness in the preclear and they believe that the preclear knows all about his own case and could straighten it out all by himself and that the auditor is an unnecessary adjunct now there are several people on this acc who believe this and this is great compliment to their faith in human nature but its certainly of value in an auditor the preclear has power of choice at all the one the preclear would never choose is the one you run an example we had preclear here who gave three terminals on the fifth dynamic one of these was mountain so the preclear was given the power of choice as to which one to run and of course came up with cat so they sat there running cats well cat happens to be right for the fifth dynamic so why straighten it out the process is aimed at straightening out something obviously the mountain was wrong the preclear was totally stuck on the idea that there was mountain in on this we found mountain on the eighth dynamic in another case that hasnt been running this case had been running metal on the sixth dynamic so what metal belongs on the sixth dynamicwhy run it get the idea but this auditor had found mountain on the eighth dynamic and ignored it of course everybody knows god is mountainthats obvious now this was the one to hit and where you find these people out of session it is because nobody has trailed down nutty dynamic when theyre out of session on dynamic straightwire theyre not interested in it at all they are just not running an identification theyre running something reasonable and at once the biggest liability of auditors is that they are reasonable and that they write script and write in reasonable reasons for it all and theyre trying to audit unreasonability out of peopleand these two things just dont go together at all the next process up the line is selected person overts select terminal who is real to the preclear and as you undercut the process it comes closer and closer to present time the person chosen has to be closer and closer to present time the more you try to go downscale on the process but the person must be real thats criteria in there and the next thing about it is you must flatten off several of these people and the basic reason for this is to prepare an individual to own up to some responsibility for his own actions unless he can assume some responsibility for his own actions he wont do anything in an auditing session so this is the one that curesthe auditing command for selected person overts is recall time you did something to the selected persons name but that is undercut by the auditing command think of something you did to or think of something you have done to now the reason you say think is because these people are very chary of owning up to anything or accepting any responsibility out in broad daylight in front of god and everybody so you run think and youve got lot of people who are having rougher time who wont own up to their own lives and who cant take responsibility for them on the third dynamic but can take responsibility for them on the first dynamic and this is the dynamic selection so think undercuts recall the next onegeneral overtsis much less effective when it has not already been undercut by selected person overts the individual just goes on and on with sweetness and light the auditing command for general overts is recall time when you did something to somebody now there are other phrases and so forth which could be used for this sort of process but here we are interested mainly in people we are not very interested in mest and the remaining four dynamics theyd splatter all over the place thats why its to somebody if you said something you would get the remaining four so there is an alternate command in here if you wanted to run the other four dynamics you would say recall time when you did something to something now the next one up the line from this is notis straightwire recall time when you implied something was unimportant and this we find is best run on an alternate basis with the next auditing command recall time when somebody else thought something was important these two commands are alternated one after the other and you get these cases that are in jam this is the direct cure of notisness and where you have case that is running bad not is process can evidently be invalidated or notised when the individual is out of session or overnight this is what notis straightwire cures these are the people on whom process works once and never works again these people are notising so badly that they cant duplicateand notis of course is mechanism to prevent duplication so you cure not duplicate and the cure for it is notis straightwirehubbard communications office washington dc hco

student and coach sit facing each other comfortable distance apart commands the coach makes up his mind there has been an actual specific arc break he doesnt tell the student he then says start then the student says have i done something wrong the coach answers this appropriately and the student says what was it the coach answers and then the student says when was it the student gets it described and then says how is it now then when hes got it more or less stamped out here then he takes it on the other side of the picture and says have you done something wrong in this session the coach answers that appropriately and the student auditor asks what was it when was it and how is it now when all have been handled satisfactorily the coach ends that cycle of action and then starts new one purpose is to train the student to handle arc breaks in session and to get them handled quickly and effectively on both the overt and motivator side since theres always an overt connected with an auditing arc break of one kind or another training stress the training stress is on the reality and actuality of arc breaks and the necessity of handling them it should be pointed out that on an emeter it is the arc break that causes the rising needle and also it must be pointed out that in actual auditing he will be using an emeter since hes not running this with meter in his hand in real auditing he flattens it until his meter shows change on the subject in running this tr he is simply going to flatten it by the seat of his pants and the satisfaction of the coach this is 2way comm formal auditing nonduplicative process and is only used to patch up arc breaks when one occurs it is not repetitive command process which is supposed to do something terrific for the pc it doesnt it is just supposed to keep the session on the road and is not in itself therapeutic the student never answers or explains to the coach about the arc break in other words we must keep the auditors code while running an arc break out probably more strongly than we would ordinarily keep an auditors code evaluating questions invalidating questions explanationsit should be understood that an arc break is the only thing that will depress profile nothing else will depress profile except an arc break handling arc breaks is the only thing which keeps the profile from being depressed so this is pretty important tr and its really got to be smooth and free it is the one thing that can submerge an engram or foul the session it should be understood that in actual auditing if the pc gives the auditor the break as soon as the auditor asks for it the question what is it is dropped lrhrd l ron hubbardhubbard communications office washington dc hco bulletin of 6 march 1959 bpi how to do diagnosis on dynamic straightwire you ask the person to describe the dynamics from one to eight we dont care about them being sequitur any way you want to break it up we dont care now you ask person to describe each one of these dynamics you are watching an meter for change in pattern therefore you have to carefully isolate the change of pattern before you can tell whether or not the patterns changed on the emeter needle reading but more important than that you are looking for dynamic that he makes mistakes on while he is trying to describe it dynamic he cannot describe dynamic that he wont even approach that he is very leary of and his statement is confirmed by the emeter reading in other words you have got the statement of the pc in this particular analysis or diagnosis for dynamic straightwire all right then we go all the way through asking for terminal on these dynamics and we finally get repeat we will ask him for terminals on these dynamics well get the same dynamic to read again now the basic rule which sorts this out isany dynamic which doesnt clear by twoway comm has to be run simple as that any dynamic which doesnt clear by twoway comm has to be run dont run terminal that is totally unreal to the preclear another stable datum which comes on top of it is never run terminal thats sensible never if terminal belongs on the dynamic you can almost say youll get nowhere running it so you are looking for terminals that they give you for dynamic which dont belong on the dynamic at all now if that terminal is real to the pc you will get tremendous change in the case if that terminal is totally unreal to the pc and if it does belong on the dynamic why youre not going to get any change on the case why run it might as well run some other process it is neither long process nor an invariable process given enough skill you could undoubtedly find one of these on every case given enough skill but it is limited by auditor skill furthermore it gives auditors chance to chop up pcs and it gives auditors chance to write some script you do not let the pc choose you have auditors who actually believe that pc is permitted power of choice in an auditing session that ones blinker

hubbard all of these straightwire processes run best with an emeter using the question when about the only reason we came off time was because auditors were using time to harass it is not that it isnt best to run it with timeit is best to run it with time the muzzled fashion of running here is recall time when the guy says he did when all right the next response on the preclears part is i dont know then the auditor goes into action now when you hound them and mix them up and twist them up and mess them up with time questions all thats happening is that the auditor is dramatizing his own confusion about time and he probably wouldnt accept the preclears answer if it was three oclock september 2nd 1959 muzzled auditing is very severely this the auditor utters the auditing command the preclear answers it and the auditor says a11 right the preclear originates the auditor nods lets make this very severe definition of what we call muzzled auditing now when you let the auditor go little bit and give him an emeter and when my experience and observation here in the 21st acc is he just goes for broke its rather as if you cut two strands of threestrand rope and he quickly busts the other strand in other words its muzzled or nothing and where you have somebody who is doing any chopup or is stacking up arc breaks in any way you have as your best answer muzzled and muzzled is muzzled and they cant say when either because evidently if you give them when they can go for broke and they can use when and the answers thereof to chop the preclear up we did try to install muzzled when for my money it hasnt been successful weve had at least one of our people exceed this at once just letting him open his mouth starts the machine its all right for you to say when you can say to this auditorits all right for you to say when right away he says well ive got to do something else and so forth we have even found that muzzled auditing wouldnt go on this one ill repeat the auditing command you cant even let them do that you cant let them say this because it has been used to invalidate the preclear we have an auditor hes not an auditor hes case who every time the preclear answers the question says ill repeat the auditing command thepreclear tries to answer the question again and the auditor just uses this as nonacceptance so this cant go as part of muzzled auditing that so far has been my observation this may be very harsh look but i feel from what i have observed that i am justified _____________________ as i have already mentioned weve got another condition herereasonability people have been writing script on the preclears engrams to some degree that is great evil and those people we have turned loose and those people who are running engrams and are saying this sort of thing are doing pretty well and some of them are writing bit of script and the main thing they are not doing is picking up the overts there are couple of them stalled around here on overts there is rule about this when they cannot easily find or run the overts take them right straight on down to dynamic straightwire these people are not owning up to their own responsibilities and that meansperhaps because the case has changed over to an area of irresponsibilitythat you have situation here in which the individual has dropped out responsibility factors to such degree that he cannot be trusted when person wont own up to his overts you have an irresponsibility of great magnitude this goes handinglove with failing to answer the exact auditing command failing to execute an

week of theory he graduates to comm course lasting two weeks of three nights each and costing 2 gns or 10 per week he receives his has certificate and graduates to coauditing for three nights week for 2 gns or 10 per week and continues on until he reaches the state of release this may take many months but he gains all the way in health on his job in his environment the coauditing is done muzzled and under the heavy supervision of trained professional who knows how to do it it is only successful if so done these new processes and muzzled auditing can be the beginning of new civilization for

continuous publication in dianetics and scientology from l ron hubbard via hubbard communications office 37 fitzroy street london w1 _____________________________________________________________________ 1 april 1959 processes used in 21st acc concluded continued from pab 156 compiled from the research material and taped lectures of l ron hubbard the engram commands we are using are as follows what part of that incident can you confront what part of that incident can you be responsible for and what part of that incident can you confront for how long and when we have sorted these out we run find an unimportant part of that incident by incident we mean both the overt and the motivator an engram is some portion of an incident containing pain unconsciousness and exteriorization but the whole incident would consist of the overtmotivator which belong together therefore we may find them running thousands of years apart but nevertheless bundled up and identified with great thoroughness we are running this simply with kind of understood acknowledgment in most cases and we are trying not to make this sharp tone 40 process because that tends to drive the pictures away some people are still doing this to slight degree their acknowledgments are bit too good and tend to make the engram vanish this is common thing one thing we are faced with in this acc is the inability of the student to accept the fact that case changes this must be stressed why are you auditing case if you dont expect it to change these students go on auditing somebody day after day and actually downgrade the case again by giving it the same careful treatment throughout they are careful as if the preclear is still crazy they havent noticed that the preclear is now doing pretty well this leads to arc breaks one more process which i havent mentioned so far is arc break straightwire we are not using it on the acc not because it isnt good but merely because it is lengthy dynamic straightwire cleverly done takes case apart it starts almost any case selected person straightwire on overts will bring up the responsibility of case to point where he can be trusted to run engrams and arc break straightwire is the one which lays open the track the only trouble is i have seen it run for fifty hours its long process but it is valuable process we have one final process here it is central process which processes anybody and it is the thinking process of scs now to have the thinking process of scs would be very valuable because the assertion of control is your biggest point out the reason auditors cant audit and the reason cases cant run and the reason valences happen and so forth has to do with handling people taking an old old process here and remodeling it we find that we have very fast woundupdoll muzzled auditing process that can kick the living daylights out of case and we are including the process in the 21st accthe process is simply this think of an identity you could handle think of an identity you couldnt handle or think of an identity that could be handled think of an identity that could not be handled this is the scs control process thinking version it is not yet decided which of the auditing commands is the best you can run the preclear either at cause or generally the general process is think of an identity that could not be handled think of an identity that could be handled run alternately one command after the other it probably undercuts the other process which is think of an identity you could handle think of an identity you couldnt handle it sounds very bad to say you couldnt handleit is negative process that is why it has to be sandwiched in with positive process strangely enough it doesnt totally run on the positive process because the preclear has private ambitionnot to be handled he doesnt want to be controlled in any way so you must run the negative process in on the other side of the positive process i cant tell you at this stage how many cases this process can be run on but i do know that it is the anatomy of cases in group one for all my study of them so far shows that their greatest unreality is the unreality of control they demonstrate hectic attitude toward the preclear because of an anxiety about controlling him or an apathetic attitude towards the preclear because they know they cant control him the whole subject of valences finally shook out here on the 21 ts acc i hasten to tell you about it the preclears have been through arduous control on the whole track arslycus where everybody got worked to death produce produce produce work work work space opera where control was nothing if not deadlyin fact at every place on the track where everybody went haywire they had to make total effect on people so the preclear who is having bad time has as his central goal an individuality that cannot be controlled and this is why most of these lower scale people want to be clear they do not want to be notcontrolled they just want to be absent this is also the reason why some people although they say they are willing to clear people are really unwilling to do so because clear is someone you cannot handle the way they think of handling people so they become unwilling to make somebody clear and they will chop it up somewhere along the line so there is reasonable reason underlying this obsessive chopup that some students do to preclear and reasonable reason behind an auditors coming up to you with great unhappiness the moment his preclear starts to make gain he himself wants to be clear so that he cannot be handled but if he knows he cant be clear he adopts an identity that cannot be handled various societies in various times have various things that cannot be handled and they get stuck with these solutions and it is almost rational solution they adopt an identity that cannot be handledand that is what is sitting in the preclears chair and sitting in the auditors chair is somebody who knows only too well that the preclear can never be handled and so it doesnt matter what he does or somebody who is determined to handle the preclear even if it means knocking his block off this results in misemotional responses to handling the preclear this is one of those horrible simplicities we had processes long ago on identity and inventing identities and various types of identities and we also had processes on handling people what could you handle what couldnt you handle what could you change what couldnt you change that sort of thing well that all adds up to this process and this process works much faster than scs however we shall know more about the thinking version of scs later on i just wanted to give you summary of the techniques and processes being used in the 21st acc for your informationhubbard communications office 37 fitzroy street london w1 hco bulletin of 15 april 1959 emotional tone scale expanded cancels bull of april 8

when some old wellworn scientology phenomena such as problems and solutions resolves i noted in 1956 that problems tended to collapse upon one as he solved them if you will recall when you asked someone to invent problem of comparable magnitude his problem went further away in distance when you asked someone for solution to his problem the problem approached closer well i have now found the reason for thisthe penalty of solving it is i might comment not an unimportant discovery for we all become victims of problemcollapse when we solve things this is why people wont solve their problems why they have to have problems failure to make solutions or postulates stick elsewhere makes the thetan believe that solutions collapse problems on him process to demonstrate the first observation is well knownproblems of comparable magnitudeand getting the pc to then solve the problem this last of course is not therapeutic process to overcome this collapsing of problems upon one is what solution

theory it never snows but it avalanches possessing now tremendous processes at lowest levels we need new understanding of processing and assessment the broad tone scale is divided into three general parts highest is pan determinism midrange is selfdeterminism low range is otherdeterminism the fundamental difficulty is that something has so thoroughly overwhelmed the pc that he is it this is otherdeterminism become the person mild locks use this route to further overwhelm him person doesnt really find anything in this lifetime that would have overwhelmed him enough to aberrate him it took great doing things like prenatals and operations and shocks just use the existing overwhelm channel the picture of aberration is this the person causes an effect time and time again usually this is not aberrative but one day he causes an unintended effect he didnt mean to it was wrong this is the true overt actan unintended bad effect it is not deserved by the recipient it is wrong unintended undeserved effect the person now tends to limit his effects or withhold his effects having been wrong once he now becomes cautious next thing he knows he has assisted himself to be overwhelmed he now has an inflow channel over which other things all locks can now overwhelm him eventually he becomes an otherdeterminism this of course can get nothing done doesnt outflow etc etc which adds up to all the faults we find in an aberrated person for example if the pc has been overwhelmed by money he in money matters is now money if you took some money and threw it on the bed it wouldnt do thing it wouldnt stack itself up or add up accounts money doesnt do anything therefore the pc as an otherdeterminism does nothing really about moneyand this we find annoying in him it is his aberration clearly all one need do as an auditor is to reverse this flow and put the pc at cause over the button money to have the otherdeterminism and the overwhelmingness fade away using problems of comparable magnitude or overtwithhold straight wire or simple reaching the effect is turned to cause and the pc comes out of it assessment is only discovering what has overwhelmed the pc auditing is the reversing of otherdetermined flows by gradient scales putting the pc at cause again the basic error the question was asked and fine question it was why does thetan make his postulate fail to stick in the first place why would he say i can get my postulates all messed up and so cause an overt actobviously all aberration is third dynamic the entrance into selfdeterminism requires that thetan conceive the idea of other beings also he must then conceive that there are zones of privacy from which he must not communicate this error leads to obsessive or fixed channels on which one can be overwhelmed since he may not take the position of cause on this channel avoidance of the places he must not communicate from leads into all manner of difficulties since this is inhibited communication person therefore becomes as aberrated as he cannot communicate as aberrated as he is overwhelmed by otherdeterminisms as aberrated as he himself dare not assume cause points new process this leads to new process for use in individual sessions the final phrasing is not established at this time from where could you communicate or find place from which you could communicate or recall place from which you have communicated my first tests show this to be very strong but workable i have not established the depth this reaches nor the complete effectiveness up scale but it does reverse otherdeterminism heavily this of course does not supplant selected person overtwithhold straight wire as fundamental and is not for use in has coauditing where selected persons overtwithhold straight wire is the tested allowed process this new process may open faster route to theta clear even though that route is already very fast note apparently this process locational communication relieves the face

appeared recently in the london city press it may be used by city offices and area offices for information to papers man who invented scientology one bestseller is often the real beginning in the story of publishing house but to come into existence because of another publishers bestseller is unusual this is what happened in the case of the hubbard association of scientologists international the hasi and all its concerns is founded on the work of one man l ron hubbard engineer explorer nuclear physicist and writer holding in his mind knowledge of eastern thought gained in his travels his instruction in psychology from medical doctor who had studied personally under sigmund freud and his training in mathematics and nuclear physics l ron hubbard found himself convalescing in hospital towards the end of the second world war after distinguished career in the united states navy during the year he spent in hospital he reviewed earlier work he had done on the fundamentals of knowledge he was also confronted with the deplorable nervous reactions of his friends who had been through the war he concluded after many experiments that his ideas could help people towards greater ability and greater happiness he coined the word scientology to mean the science of knowing how to know experiment then followed several years of experiment which he supported by writing fiction his ideas like most new things met with complete disbelief in official quarters in spite of the fact that they had by this time been practised proved tested and documented thesis he wrote in 1948 was ignored however people began to hear of his work and to get hold of carbon copies of his thesis and make more copies of it and hand them to friends hubbards correspondence grew to embarrassing proportions as more and more people found out that dianetics the branch of scientology he wrote about at that time the branch which deals with mental anatomy really worked in practice they asked him for lengthy explanations in 1950 l ron hubbard thought of writing popular text book on dianetics to relieve him of the task of writing dozens of long letters every day publisher offered to print the book but demanded the manuscript within three weeks the book was duly written and delivered180000 words of itwithin three weeks this book dianetics the modern science of mental health was expected to sell 6000 copies and sold 100000 almost immediately it went to the top of the bestselling lists and stayed there during the summer of 1950 the book tells the layman how to use dianetics thousands of people began to use it hundreds of people wrote spoke and ranted for and against it interest in dianetics reached hysteria level in the united states and various organizations were set up with and without l ron hubbards approval to deal with the demand for treatment and trainingto combat this confusion of commercial exploitation hubbard went back to the broader subject of scientology and founded the hubbard association of scientologists international as the official organization which would treat people train people and supervise research books and more books were demanded hubbard duly wrote them and the hasi duly published them under its own name or under the name of one of its offices since 1950 more than thirty books by l ron hubbard and many other scientologists have been published by the hasi perhaps the bestknown titles are dianetics the modern science of mental health science of survival self analysis in scientology problems of work and the creation of human ability it is fitting that the main part of hasis publishing output should be written by the man who founded it and that all the books it publishes should be about scientology in its various aspects whether applied to helping the individual and training professional practitioners or to more topical subjects such as those dealt with in all about radiation and how to live though an executive the international at the end of the hasis title is well earned few publishers have offices in and books printed in washington london angeles melbourne auckland johannesburg paris and berlin and this within nine years translations scientology books have been translated into many languages and the london office which is now the central office of the organization receives enquiries from all parts of the world and has on its staff people from australia greece new zealand mauritius rhodesia south africa spain and the united states students come from far and near east and west for training to become professional practitioners in scientology or auditors as they are called an auditor one who listens and computes when trained they qualify to help other people improve their lives and their abilities by doing simple mental exercises under their skilled supervision and many of them go back to their own countries and set up offices groups training centres and clinics of their own large part of their training consists of the study of texts published by the hasi the publication of dianetics the modern science of mental health in 1950 started not just publishing house but world movement the longignored work

brutalities and foolishness of psychology psychoanalysis and psychiatry have made your listener doubtful of mental healing agree they are right about this enlarge on the faults of old 19th century practices then say they are not all bad since they gave us basis on which to start scientology then show how scientology learned that men werent animals learned that shock and surgery on the brain was harmful learned that sex was only minor basis for neurosis and insanity all this without saying what scientology is or describing it then without really ever explaining what scientology is say it has hope for man in kinder better world and that we must outgrow our fear of mental healing and look ahead not backward if you get real insistent even oddly accusative of listener even slightly angry on this point and stress it over and over you should have some people willing to come to pe course and if you also stress this in pe courses in the has course in the coaudit you will start new concept of

fitzroy street london w1 hco bulletin of 23 june 1959 mabpi what is scientology scientology is the science of human ability and intelligence it was developed over third of century by doctor hubbard american nuclear physicist and leading world authority on the subject of life sources and mental energies and structures the hubbard association of scientologists international assists and forwards his work and is charitable nonprofit organization with thousands of professionals who help people to help others the hasi conducts free basic classes in scientology and is authorized to train to higher levels for which however charges are made amounting to about five shillings an hour for personal coaching professional processing in scientology is available from the association and many professional scientologists in private practice scientology is the only full study in the field of the mind developed in the twentieth century older nineteenth century studies such as psychology developed by wundt in 1879 in leipzig germany psychoanalysis developed by freud in 1894 in vienna austria and psychiatry developed through the nineteenth century in russia did not necessarily fail since they provided data which permitted scientology to begin modern kinder methods largely have taken the place of old brutalities such as shock brain surgery and years of pitiless self revelation man longer is thought of as brute animal charged with unconscious and cunning force brighter more modern day has shed greater understanding on the problems of the mind and the nature of life and one need longer shun mental healing practised by modern civilized people scientology in less than decade has become the worlds primary study of man and the mind and has today more offices and practitioners than all other nineteenth century practices combined thus we must learn to bury the past of mental healing and look forward to our better day the day of scientology and new hope the day of help without threat or harm the day of new and better civilization born with the birth of better understanding of man l ron hubbard lrhghrd copyright 1959 by l ron hubbard all rights

information purpose of this work to modify the data and material taught and demonstrated in the hcahpa theory and practice course and to bring uniformity of stable data to students and instructors there are six basic process types one or more processes of each type is included in the theory and practice course listed here are the six basic types the characteristic purpose and stable datum of each these are the general data for each basic type specific data are given with the processes themselves type 1 starting and ending sessions characteristic twoway communication twoway communication is how it is done purpose to compose preclear into and release him from the auditing session stable datum agreement each thing done in starting and ending sessions is the establishment of an agreement type 2 control processes characteristic control by action preclears physical actions are controlled in order to do the processes purpose to place preclears body and actions under the auditors control to invite control of them by the preclear stable datum never let the preclear get out of doing what he is told type 3 duplication characteristic mimicry by action physical actions are duplicated purpose to establish communication stable datum each command in its own unit of time separate from every other command type 4 subjective characteristic thinkingness the preclear must think something to do the process purpose to recover automaticities of thought and asis unwanted thinkingnessstable datum body control comes before control of thinkingness type 5 objective characteristic spotting and finding preclear must spot or find something exterior to himself to carry out the auditing command purpose to orient preclear in present time drop out past and improve havingness stable datum attention of preclear must be under auditors control type 6 straight wire characteristic remembering and forgetting preclear must do these things to carry out auditing command or question purpose to recontrol remembering and forgetting and relate past to present stable datum specific things not generalities definitions of thetan mind and bodythe three parts of man thetan the awareness of

without arms close together outside of auditors right thigh against outside of preclears right thigh this position reversed for left hand in both hands preclears knees are between auditors knees purpose to demonstrate to preclear that control of preclears body is possible despite revolt of circuits and inviting preclear to directly control it absolute control by auditor then passes over toward absolute control of his own body by preclear training never stop process until flat place is reached to process with good tone stress 40 auditor taught to pick up preclears hand by wrist with auditors thumb nearest auditors body to have an exact and invariable place to carry preclears hand to before clasping clasping hand with exactly correct pressure enough to be real to preclear not enough to bruise his hand over long run replacing hand with auditors left hand still holding preclears wrist in preclears lap making every command and cycle separate maintaining tone 40 stress on intention from auditor to preclear with each command to leave an instant for preclear to do it by his own will before auditor does it stress tone 40 precisionthis process puts order into preclears

absolute auditor precision drops from tone 40 flubs total stress present time auditing auditor turns preclear counterclockwise then steps always on preclears right side auditors body acts as block to forward motion when preclear turns auditor gives command gives preclear moment to obey then enforces command with physical contact of exactly correct force to get command executed auditor does not check preclear from executing commands history developed by l ron hubbard in washington dc 1957 for the 17th acc cch 3a type 3duplication process name hand space mimicrycommands auditor raises two hands palms facing preclear and says put your hands against mine follow them and contribute to the motion he then makes simple motion with right hand then left did you contribute to the motion thank you put your hands in your lap when this is flat the auditor does this same thing with half inch of space between his and preclears palms put your hands facing mine about half inch away follow them and contribute to the motion did you contribute to the motion thank you put your hands in your lap when this is flat auditor does it with wider space and so on until preclear is able to follow motions yard away position auditor and preclear seated close together facing each other preclears knees between auditors knees purpose to develop reality on the auditor using the reality scale solid comm line to get preclear into communication by control duplication training that auditor be gentle and accurate in his motions giving preclear wins stress to be free in twoway comm that the essential part of the auditing command is the motion not the verbal patter when it is necessary to physically assist preclear to do commands use onehand commands putting preclears hand through the command with auditors free hand holding preclears hand by the wrist accept preclears answer to the question did you contribute to the motionhis answers are accepted whatever they may be auditor always places his hands up before telling preclear to do so auditor tells preclear to put his hands in his lap and keeps his own up until preclear does so allowing preclear to break the solid comm line history developed by l ron hubbard in washington 1956 as therapeutic version of dummy hand mimicry something was needed to supplant look at who am i and find the auditor part of rudiments cch 4a type 3duplication process name book mimicry commands auditor makes simple or complex motion with book hands book to preclear preclear makes motion duplicating auditors mirror imagewise auditor asks preclear are you satisfied that you duplicated my motion if preclear is and auditor is also fairly satisfied auditor takes book back acknowledges thank you and goes to next command if preclear says he is and auditor fairly sure he isnt auditor takes book back and repeats command and gives book to preclear again for another try if preclear is not sure he duplicated any command auditor repeats it for him and gives him back the book tone 40 only in motions verbal twoway comm quite free position auditor and preclear seated facing each other comfortable distance apart purpose to bring up preclears communication with control and duplication control duplication communication training stress giving preclear wins stress auditors necessity to duplicate his own stress motions circular motions are more complex than straight lines the basic rule on complexity in duplication processes is make the motions as complex as is necessary to get the preclears interest and attention and more history developed by l ron hubbard for the 16th acc in washington dc 1957 based on duplication developed by lrh in london 1952method of running cch 1 2 3 4 cch 1 is run first and run to flat spot then cch 2 is run if cch 2 produces change it is flattened and followed by cch 1 then cch 2 and if it again produces change it is followed by cch 1 this rule is followed throughoutwhen either cch 2 cch 3 cch 4 produces change the process is flattened and followed by cch 1 this series of four processes is left when they can be run one after the other 1 2 3 4 in the same session without producing change the four cch processes are to be run on the following cases insane that is person who is extremely and obsessively unwilling to control his body his attention and his thoughts unconsciousany person who is unaware to great degree hostile person who has appeared for processing but who demonstrates complete unwillingness to accept order and to carry out an auditing command cch 1 dont give that hand version is specific process for case who is dramatizing heavy compulsive withhold condition arc straight wire type 6straight wire process commands recall something that was really real to you thank you recall time when you were in good communication with someone thank you recall time when you really liked someone thank you the three commands are given in that order and repeated in that order consistently position auditor and preclear seated facing each other at comfortable distance purpose to give the student reality on the existence of bank when used as training drill this is audited on another and is audited until the preclear is in present time it will be found that the process discloses the cycling action of the preclear going deeper and deeper into the past and then more and more shallowly into the past until he is recalling something again close to present time this cyclic action should be studied and understood and the reality on the pictures the preclear gets should be thoroughly understood by the student the fact that another has pictures should be totally real to the student under training note it should be thoroughly understood that this is valuable process and an excellent step in preparation for running the heavier recall processes history developed by l ron hubbard in 1951 in wichita kansas this was once very important process it has been known to bring people from neurotic to sane level after only short period of application it has been run on group basis with success but it should be noted that the thinkingness of the individuals in the group would have to be well under the control of the auditor in order to have this process broadly beneficial when it was discovered that this process occasionally reduces peoples havingness the process itself was not generally run thereafter it is still however an excellent process with that proviso reduction of havingness in some cases if this process is policed the auditor asks the preclear when before giving the acknowledgement as often as is necessary to maintain control of thepreclearor as often as is necessary for the auditor to maintain his own confidence that the preclear is under control and doing the process this process can be run muzzled and should be where muzzling is indicated assessment an inventory and evaluation of preclear his body and his case to definition establish processing level and procedure 1 determine processing level 2 determine process to be used 3 always undercut reality level of the case when assessing processing level 4 establish reality level of case by twoway communication using understanding and affinity as guides understanding what can the preclear say and talk about that is easily understandable to the auditor what can the auditor say and talk about that is easily understandable by the preclear affinity what does the preclear like or dislike what does he detest or ignore what is he anxious or otherwise misemotional about 5 never overlook an obvious physical defect or communication difficulty when making an assessment of any kind 6 be alert to preclears comm lags and what produces them 7 observe the preclears response to control 8 find out what the preclear assigns cause towhat he blames what he feels he can do nothing about terminal assessmentfor overtwithhold process in the hcahpa course this is done by twoway communication the student should learn it by observance of the instructor terminal assessment is made to locate the terminals in the case which when run will produce an increase in the responsibility and reality level of the preclear very brief coverage of dynamic and know to mystery scouting 1 discover the terminals the preclear states to represent each part of the expanded know to mystery scale any terminal which is obviously aberrated and wont clear by twoway comm should be run 2 discover what terminals the preclear has identified with the wrong dynamic any terminal wrongly placed that wont blow by twoway comm should be run note twoway comm here does not mean invalidative or evaluative questions or comments by auditor selected persons scout this is the assessment most used it is applied to the persons in the preclears present life there are several loaded questions which can be used and there are several observations to be made by the auditor questions who is to blame for the condition you are inwho do you know or have known that youd really hate to be who really had it in for you who do you know or have known that you dislike thinking about to be observed by auditor comm lag willingness or unwillingness to communicate about specific person physical and emotional effect produced by discussion of specific person agitation voice change blushing dopiness etc note auditor must realize that preclear has power of choice in the selection of terminals the terminal is chosen by the auditor in case where the preclear does not answer up to questions or shows useful to the assessment effects from questions simply select the person who is realest to the preclear and proceed with the process continue running the persons in preclears present life on basis of who is realest until preclear is able to answer up to assessment questions realest person at start may turn out to be the auditor if so run it overtwithhold selected persons straight wire type 6straight wire process commands think of something you have done to thank you think of something you have withheld from thank you or recall something you have done to thank you recall something you have withheld from thank you the use of the think of command rather than the recall allows the preclear to plow through where his track is jammed and incidents are not easily separated to the point where he can recall in either case commands are run alternately one for one position auditor and preclear seated facing each other at comfortable distance purpose to put the preclear at knowing cause toward the people in his current life so that those people can longer restimulate the preclear in livingness training any terminal run with this process is flat when that terminal can stress longer restimulate the preclears reactive bank when the preclear can find new incidents to recall and must repeat old incidents to continue process given terminal can be considered flat make sure he is repeating incidents and not recalling similar incidents before ending the run on that terminal also the first few repeats may be just the preclears way of filling in comm lag student should observe and understand phenomena occurring with this process where assessment has been properly made the preclear will manifest various misemotions ranging from below 00 on the tone scale up to 20 and emotions up to 40 the notisness on the case will show up as attempts to notis the auditor process or anything preclears attention touches the preclear at first will not correctly assign the reasons for his misemotions and discomforts and will blame them on the auditor etc this is an example of corollary 3 of axiom 58 in action this process is run muzzled by the student in training muzzled auditing is done as follows at the beginning of session instructor makes an assessment of the preclears case and chooses the terminal to be run he gets the preclears agreement to run the process and does very brief clearing of the command with the preclear then the student auditor says start of session and gives the firstcommand when preclear has answered the auditor acknowledges and goes on to the next command if the preclear originates anything either as statement comment or question the auditor nods his head as an acknowledgement if the preclear asks to have the command repeated the auditor nods his head and repeats it this is continued until end of session or until process is flat on that terminal if student has any question or thinks terminal is flat he puts his hand behind his chair and wigwags to get instructors attention he does not leave his chair near end of session instructor gives the team notice that the session will end in two minutes at the end of that time when preclear has answered the last command and has been acknowledged the student auditor says end of session this is all there is to muzzled auditing done by students the student auditor uses only tr 0 tr2 tr3 duplicative command and handles originations with nod of his head only rudiments or twoway comm beyond start of session and end of session student should understand that when he runs this process and some others on preclears in the field he should use muzzled auditing whenever he finds himself with any tendency to overcommunicate or with any preclear who arc breaks easily student should also understand that overtwithhold selected persons third rail arc break straight wire and notis straight wire can all restimulate so much automatic notisness that the preclear will at times apparently lose his bank his memory and even the auditing command and its meaning the only action indicated when this occurs is to persist with the process history developed by l ron hubbard in the 21st acc in washington dc in 1959 as means of ensuring wider and more predictable case gains by more auditors even unskilled ones factual havingness type 5objective process commands look around here and find something you have thank you look around here and find something you would continue thank you look around here and find something you would permit to vanish thank you commands are each flattened in turn before going on to next command process can be begun on any of the three commands but the above order should be followed if process is begun on vanish the next command to be run is have position auditor and preclear seated facing each other at comfortable distance and with preclear facing majority of auditing room purpose to remedy havingness objectively to bring about the preclears ability to have or not have his present time environment and to permit him to alter his considerations of what he has what he would continue and what he would permit to vanish training to be run smoothly without invalidative questions one of the most stress effective processes known when thinkingness can be controlled somewhat the student should thoroughly understand that when preclear is set on wasting the vanish command will at first occupy the majority of auditing time spent on this process student should understand that the three commands can be each flattened in order any number of times and that running one of the commands is quite apt to unflatten the other two process should be continued until this longer occurs third rail is special form of factual havingnesscommands are the same as in factual havingness however the commands are position run in special ratio of 8 commands of vanish 2 commands of continue and 1 command of have purpose to remedy extreme conditions of notisness to remedy obsessive waste to permit use of the process without bogging preclear in any one of the commands training student should realize that there is very seldom any reason for altering this stress ratio and should never q and with the preclears complaints about doing the continue or vanish commands student should understand that third rail should be run where auditor is uncertain where to begin with factual havingness history developed by l ron hubbard in washington dc in 1958 as the best form of objective havingness originally developed by l ron hubbard in london in 1955 as terrible trio third rail developed by l ron hubbard in london for the 5th london acc rudiments type 1 processopening and closing sessions commands none as such rudiments is the establishment of the agreements basic to an auditing session and the termination of them at end of session students must understand what the rudiments are and be able to use them with any preclear who is capable of agreeing to them by twoway communication they are 1 auditor 2 preclear 3 auditing room 4 start of session 5 preclears goal for session auditor by twoway comm gets preclears agreement to each of these allowing preclear to state his own goals the above order is not necessarily the order in which they are established there should be enough twoway comm to get the preclears agreement and more the auditor should determine for himself but not tell the preclear what he the auditor intends to do with the session at the end of session auditor makes sure the preclear is released from agreements auditor does not argue with the preclear about the preclears goals note if preclear cannot communicate about the rudiments or be brought to agree with them fairly easily cch 1 2 3 4 should be run with only start of session spoken by the auditor as total rudiments rudiments are not used otherwise with any preclear who needs to be run on cch 1 2 3 4 alternatively for more accessible cases do muzzled auditing as described above mock up picture for which you can be totally responsiblea type 4subjective process command mock up picture for which you can be totally responsible thank you position auditor and preclear seated facing each other comfortable distance apart purpose to put preclear at cause with regard to mental image pictures to the degree that engrams are under his control training that preclear not be run on this process before he is willing to carry out stress subjective process command exactly as given earlier processes should be well flattened before this is attempted otherwise the preclear will be given loses the command means exactly what it says and the preclears thinkingness must be well enough under control for him to view the command that way this process should not be run for ever without an occasional flattening of notis straight wire history developed by l ron hubbard in washington dc in 1958 reexperience and experience process type 4subjective process commands what part of your life would you be willing to reexperience thank you what part of the future would you be willing to experience thank you commands run alternately one for one position auditor and preclear seated facing each other comfortable distance apart purpose to bring about the preclears ability to reexperience his past without enduring consequence and to confront the future without restimulation training that student understand that the process is run until flat and that student be stress aware of what flat is when the preclear can easily get out of any incident he gets into and when he can reexperience those things without enduring consequence where engrams are encountered with the process the auditor should attempt to find out the year of its occurrence by twoway comm and flash answers and should record the dates found the auditor must not go into general twoway comm with the preclear about the incidents preclear contacts never end the process while preclear is sticking in an incident history developed by l ron hubbard in washington dc in 1959 present time problem spart of rudimentstype 1 processes commands auditor by twoway comm discovers the preclears present time problem and discusses it with him if it blows on this basis fine if not we move out of type 1 processes to handle the present time problem other than by two way comm discuss it with the preclear and get the names of the terminals involved ask the preclear which of these is realest run the one he names with selected persons overtwithhold straight wire discuss the problem find which of the remaining terminals is most real to the preclear run it with spowsw discuss the problem and so on until the problem is run out which is when the preclear does not need to do anything about it position auditor and preclear seated facing each other comfortable distance apartpurpose to remove the surface difficulty that is the present time problem so that the auditing session can progress training student should know definition of problem and should know very well stress what happens to auditing sessions where present time problem is unflat problem is the conflict arising from two opposing intentions present time problem is one that exists in present time in real universe it is any set of circumstances that so engages the attention of the preclear that he feels he should be doing something about it instead of being audited auditor uses questions based on definition of present time problem to find present time problems never leave present time problem half run preclears with whom the rudiments cannot be readily established should not be run on present time problems but should be run on cch 1 2 3 4 history developed by l ron hubbard in london in 1952 arc break straight wire type 6 process command recall an arc break when thank you position auditor and preclear seated facing each other comfortable distance apart purpose to asis arc breaks to bring about the preclears ability to confront and as is arc breaks to straighten out the preclears time track which has become collapsed by arc breaks in restimulation to key out and take out of restimulation the rock chain training to not acknowledge the preclears execution of the command until stress the time of the arc break has been established and to acknowledge with good tr 2 when the time is established to accept preclears reality as to when if he says it occurred the year i graduated from high school accept it and go on to next command assist him with twoway comm when he has difficulty locating time flash answers may also be used for this do not leave process until preclear can easily get out of incidents he gets into on the process process is flat when recalling arc breaks longer produces undue amounts of misemotion student should understand that the process has the limitation of being somewhat hard to clear command with person unfamiliar with the term arc history developed by l ron hubbard in washington dc in 1958 note in handling arc breaks with the auditor the auditor should use selected persons overtwithhold with the auditor as the terminal when the break is severe otherwise use tr 5n notis straight wire type

bulletin of 7 august 1959 all hco franchise all staffs the handling of communication processes central orgs all hcos some rapid data the most important research development of recent times is the communication process it has gradually been evolved for nine years beginning in july of 1950 when i isolated communication as one of the three important pivots on which all mental association turned the other two being affinity and reality much could be said about this evolution and the search but the important gain remains that today i have evolved finally single command type process that answers all requirements of all levels of clearing and violates rules of auditing an auditor today could audit with just three packages 1 the cchs 2 scs and connectedness and 3 the communication processes using these he would certainly achieve releases and clears on all cases he could keep on the auditing roster i must call your attention to the facts of this we have achieved our finite goals in auditing and clearing can be done easily and broadly without kickbacks therefore all programs should be geared with these steps 1 make clear or two 2 use communication processes in coaudit toward clearing 3 groove in administratively to clear your area i will shortly write small book on communication processes which will give all meantime the essentials of use are as follows 1 by communication process is meant any process which places the preclear at cause and uses communication as the principal command phrase typical wording now standardised is from where could you communicate to 2 the terminals to which communication processes are addressed must be real terminals never significances only right from etc to husband wrong from etc to thought right from etc to dog wrong from etc to mistake 3 all terminals employed in the command should be generalised dont peg pc to one lifetime with proper name always use generalised name since communication processes span lives too fast to be limited too much right from etc to husband wrong from etc to bill wrong from etc to your husband if you isolate bill as the terminal that needs running find out what bill is to the pc use what the pc describes bill to be or what rises on the meter bill will turn out to be husband or friend or mechanic or some generalised terminal he is never run as bill as that pegs pc to one life and rarely clears bill whereas the generalised terminal does clear bill 4 run communication process more or less muzzled the smoother the more confident the more experienced the auditor the less muzzle is needed the process wins totally muzzled so err in the direction of more muzzle not less 5 communication process is flat when none of that class of terminal produces change or comm lag or cyclic aspect on the time track if the pc longer goes into past on continuous long run the process is flat 6 use meter this alone tells you when terminal is really flat this alone diagnoses terminal properly good electrometer can save you three hours in every five lack of meters means lack of clears only meter keeps the auditor from clearing the auditors buttons out of the preclear only meter keeps processes from being left unflat only meter can show when terminal is clear or preclear is clear use meter if you want to clear people insist on your auditor using meter if you want to get clear 7 know meter behaviour theres lot of data on this but ive recently found new one terminal needs to be run if it drops and then when ignored any further questioning causes needle to rise only the right terminal found again sticks the needle and stops the rise if terminal is left unflat if it is run and then dropped before it is flat the needle in future sessions will only rise steadily rising needle is by definition then the symptom of an abandoned terminal that terminal must be found again if found it will stop the rise of the needle it must then be run and flattened this is why some cases bog down and this is how it is remedied further discovery is that terminal clears on the meter just like pc clears on meter examplean unclear person doesnt read steadily at male or female clear reading but goes above or below that reading and the reading changes similarly terminal found on pc reads above or below male or female clear reading if the terminal is run by communication process it makes the tone arm read higher or lower than male or female clear the running of the terminal changes the tone arm position making it rise and fall rise and fall the rises of the tone arm get easier the falls more rapid until at last the tone arm does not rise or fall but sits on male or female clear depending on the sex of the pc not the terminal the more flexible the tone arm the looser the needle if thats greek to you better grab plane or train to central org and study the emeter because you wont make any clears until you do 8 preclear is mest clear when terminal selected is when run by communication process productive of variation of the tone arm from male or female clear reading preclear is theta clear when he can handle engrams without producing change from clear reading 9 cases do not improve if they are in victim valence as they self invalidate between sessions communication process s2 or s22 must be run to remedy this10 if an assist is done by communication process the terminal chosen usually body part must be flattened fully see 7 above before the case can be expected to move again on new terminal 11 when an auditor finds steadily climbing needle on pc new to him but not auditing he must suspect that terminal has been run but isnt flat he should query past auditing or living until he finds terminal which stops the rise he then runs this flat before he goes on 12 old pcs benefit from communication process using an auditor as terminal to clear off the case this is done when the auditor fails with 11 above 13 old auditors can be smoothed out as cases by running communication process on an auditor and preclear run each flat 14 in general run any terminal selected back down until the tone arm reads male or female clear stably for many commands and pc is longer cycling on track with that terminal 15 process illnesses with communication processes if the illness is in the way of the session assess by finding out what part of body pc considers ill run what he says run it in one or several sessions until that part reads clear on the tone arm these are some of the rules above of communication processes few cautions however should be emphasised dont self audit with communication process use touch assist on body or room instead dont clip terminal into action on case and leave it unflat flatten it in one or many sessions instead or make sure you tell the next auditor that it is unflat communication processes are so simple they are apparently innocent and charming they are in actuality strong enough to move whole bank so they should be handled with accuracy and the same respect youd give 90 dynamite note to hco secs d of ps and assoc secs and heads of organizations it would be well worth your while to study this bulletin thoroughly then

has coaudit course then you have nothing but rising needles left on these cases it is necessary to get the very first terminal that dropped on the pc and convert it to general form and run that terminal with communication process until the terminal is again reading on the tone arm at male or female clear depending on the sex of the pc not the terminal and stays there this is why you dont fill up the coaudit regimen on this is find the first thing that dropped on the pc then state it in general termmake sure it drops example pcs first assessment was on his wife find it again and see if it stops the needle rising if it does run from where could you communicate to wife note that it is wife not his wife if the needle dropped the first time he was ever assessed on bill we have to find out what bill is and run it on new enrollees in the coaudit take body part only body part is then run on the communication process from where could you communicate to name of body part this is only considered flat when matter what or how many questions are asked about that body part it registers on the tone arm of the meter at male or female clear whichever the pc is only then can you go on to new process communication processes look so simple they are in reality terribly tricky and terribly effective pick the right body part on the pc and hell stay in the coaudit until hes clear on that part thats for sure when you see pc getting fouled up by lousy coaudit handling you are losing student and i am willing to confirm gaining victim computation l ron hubbard lrh brbcden copyright 1959

years the problem of processing persons of the catholic faith was thoroughly worked out and the church did not consider itself interested in the matter of auditing roman catholics and did not restrain any from being audited when roman catholics asked permission to be indeed scientology is closer to the faculty psychology of the church in the sixteenth century than modern psychology is modern psychology is not accepted by the church because it considers man to be an animal with soul scientology not only accepts but can prove than man does have soul saint thomas aquinas is an early forerunner of scientology scientology is not an heretic religion and demands belief or faith and thus is not in conflict with faith several monsignors of the church have been interested in scientology and have approved of our activities the late pope pius was an enemy of psychoanalysis but was heard to express neutral attitude toward scientology he once assisted us in handling government matter in the united states all that processing requires is that you obtain better reality on your environment and all its drills are aimed at this thus it has conflict just as your religion would not forbid you to obtain better command over typewriter so it could not be expected to forbid you to obtain better command over your office staff or home there is conflict here it is interesting that in nearly ten years of public presence the materialistic sciences have often rapped at scientology communism is violent foe of ours but never once in any country including ireland has the roman catholic church raised its voice against us l ron hubbard lrh brbcden copyright 1959 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 27 august 1959 bpi growth with competence there is great deal of history to the development and dissemination of dianetics and scientology and it has not been without its severe lessons one of the first vows i made in in the fall of 1950 was based on the assumption that it will go as far as it works and i vowed to make it work not just for the few but for the many and not just in expert hands but for the tyro as well well that vow has been achieved the has coaudit course taught in washington dc by nibs dick jan and nina west has made mest clears using only muzzled coauditing so it is working for the many in the hands of the relatively unskilled group coauditor but there were other things learned in this history and amongst them was the lesson that central org can succeed as far as it can service when central org can longer service it cannot succeed and that goes for any individual or group in the whole of dianetics and scientology and on these the sun never sets our problem then now is to be able to service as far as we go we are in the possession of powerful tools we have relatively good literature and will soon have better we can promise great deal and point proudly to records of things we have done we can say with truth that we have done more than fifty thousand years of thinking man could do in understanding and assisting the human being we can command very wide sphere of credit for first discoveries we can promise great many things on the basis of having delivered them but can we service this well as group i get some very fine reports from has coaudits throughout the world but amongst these reports there are few failures few resistive cases i could audit them great many scientologists could audit them and push them through but the fact remains that there are auditors here and there who cannot why i asked the hco area secretary london the other night on telexlow arc she replied and this apparently explained two case failures by field auditors and not very long ago when we had bad code break with pc in the field the ethics committee suspended the auditor for few days and then told him he could be reinstated but would have to sign paper pledging to obey the auditors code and he refused to sign it why because he had gotten results with invalidating pcs too often but the truth is he hadnt gotten good results and the tests showed it so he was wrong but why wouldnt he sign the auditors code these of course are isolated things but at this present instant they exist low arc the hco area sec london said well whats this low arc doing at this stage of the game how come this late in the business does an auditor get discovered who doesnt believe in the auditors code why do individuals and groups still flub on occasioni know that all these people basically mean well i would stake my life on their humanity and decency and have but were in something thats got to go all the way and the basic lessons contain this one an organisation will succeed as far as it can service and if groups are still flubbing service let alone administration then they arent going to go very far now does this mean there must be more training there will always have to be training but this wont entirely solve this one low arc the hco area secretary london said what did she mean by that she meant basically that these auditors somehow or other werent going to make pc well they didnt care enough about that pc to do the job the button which causes such things is victim this is the central button of the overt actmotivator sequence some auditor perhaps one that is ordinarily quite good gets restim he keys in something not from what the pc said for this couldnt aberrate anyone he gets restim between sessions on the overt actmotivator sequence and he comes back into session with the victim button in full flare and what does he do almost beyond his control he flubs he makes victim out of his pc why because thats the exact action which occurs when an overt actmotivator sequence is triggered low arc the whole answer to it is contained in victim the auditor feels that the pc deserves what he gets for moment he rationalises it all outbut he treated the pc as victim dropped ashtray stupid auditor remark an invalidation of cognition however the auditor flubs he is treating the pc as victim and the pc victimised responds with bared engrams well true enough lot of pcs arc break easily because they are really being fully fledged victims and all the auditor has to do is slightly hint toward victimising in the pcs estimation and bang out goes the session but an auditor who isnt really treating the pc as his victim can pull the pc through the auditor who is keyed in by this victim thing drops all the cans in the rack and flubs but grandly all this has been big mystery previously its understood now and thoroughly and further weve the processes that can do something about it the right way to audit this victim item out from scratch is with comm process handling the whole case it is necessary in most instances to find specific dropping terminal on the pc perhaps even more than one convert it into generalised form and flatten it until it reads as button right at the clear reading of the pcs sex when this has been worked over and done it is usually safe to do plunge into this victim thing given the pc in sessiongiven the pc really answering the auditing question then we can handle the overt actmotivator sequence with the comm process from where could you communicate to victim the process is actually oneshot ot process dont make the mistake of running pc who figurefigures his answers or gives philosophic type answers on comm process without actually making him do it do it do it there are cases around that have been audited for years who have never really done process this can be whipped by comm process done with paper and pencil you locate the terminal with an emeter and then you lay the instrument aside give the pc sheaf of paper and pencil and every time he answers your auditing question you have him or her draw the answer on the paper as the comm process exceeds language it can be easily checked even if the pc seems to be having some success but could succeed faster you can boost it along withthe paper trick as this is called so even the people who couldnt be trusted with thinkingness process can be run on comm process using the paper trick all right thats what makes an auditor not flub and it keeps him from being burden to himself and others as person too its cyclone of process as the experienced person can tell you and it prevents the flubbing of service in an organisation scientologists who cant stand the sight of money or who cant seem to get pcs are just having fine old time being in some way or another victim so lets face this reality and understand clearly that we can guarantee our successes as individuals and organisations by getting bell clear on victim then we can give service and then an organisation can give service then its safe to make promises and we dont get administration chopped up and its safe and successful to have an organisation set up and financed and running on the mission of clearing earth of course we have to go right on with our jobs whether victim is flat or leaping about like texas thermometer of course we have to go right on organising and planning and making the future real we cant just quit and say well when we all get to be clear then well goman go we cant afford that but this time be warned we know that with our organisations and comm lines and plans were going to go successfully or not straight up the line lets see this one coming though and not fly into the thunderhead blind lets understand that staffs and individual scientologists are going to goof just as long as the victim button is not flat and that its going to take quite while to get it all flat people are always preparing for rainy days and failures well lets prepare for success if we get much bigger nobody will be able to handle anything unless we get smooth operation smooth procurement efficient good looking has coaudit units successful case handling everywhere we wont be able to live in climate of 75 success and 25 failure we wont be able to administer with people here and there on our lines who are bound and determined to be victims and to appoint us their executioners were moving right up to the big win and we should be able to handle it without going half round the bend patching up the flubs made by the victim impulse that comes on when were restimmed or exhausted lets win all the way this time and keep it won you see you cant ever get victim valence to win its plain lesson to him and he believes it fallacious though it is that when somebody wins there is always loser and that winning is always an overt act to somebody to prevent losers our victim doesnt win he quits instead thus there can be constant and safe win until we have amongst us whipped our first big hurdle amount of planning writing and care amount of education can overcome this impulse we already know it can only be done by auditing so lets clear up this thing lets get the auditing lets make sure that when we set up something to go none of us will say ohoh thats win mustnt mustnt and start tearing the whole thing down before we get too far along this road lets make sure we stay winners after weve won by making sure that none among us will go victim on us and cut our throats with the best intentions in the world lets define scientologists as people who arent victims and really get the show on the road lrhbrbrd l ron hubbard copyright 1959 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 3 september ad 9 all us franchise holders from ts hill all other franchise holders via central orgs all central orgs why victim works as process we all should have heard of the overt actmotivator sequence if we have not we should review the history of man the highest level of third dynamic activity and the earliest instant of it is and was communication before communication in one form or another there was only native state obviously you are not going to run out native stateleave that to the psychiatrists and politicians therefore the earliest button susceptible of aberration was apparently communication however communication itself is not aberrative only the misuse and withhold of communication is aberrative one received his first communication foulup when he postulated somebody can mess up my postulates when he granted that right then he or she had it thereafter the idea that communication could be harmful apparently came in about this point and the obvious conclusion that one could injure with communication must have followed shortly after that one could be injured and that one could injure was established by example here began the game of victim death is just one of the varied forms of the game of victim that one could be killed by the communication words or missiles of another is just an extreme form of the game that this was game and that it was played out by thetan b pretending that he had been injured so thetan would further withhold his postulates has all been lost in the depths of the reactive mind death isnt game anymore not even injury is game we know how seriously these things are now regarded and how utterly cavedin and lost thetans have been for very very long time only with scientology have we come back to the straight of it and the straight of it is that one cannot be injured until he has postulated that thetans can be injured and by example of thetans pretending to be injured has come to the point of himself not only consenting to be injured but actually getting torn to shreds the basic postulate of injury or death or harmful communication is best summed up by victim to restrain others one sets an example as victim it might be said that this is last ditch way of being cause on that thin idea rests all the disease and death all the agony and travail of man it is almost the bottom point of the reactive mind in any overt actmotivator sequence there is villain and victim if the auditor were to choose and run the villain then he would be violating the basic definition of operating thetan which is to be willing and knowing cause over life matter energy space and time and would be processing the pc at effect point the basic definition of victim must then be as ourhco staff auditor pointed out unwilling and unknowing effect of life matter energy space and time therefore to keep the pc at cause we have choice but to process him in such way as to face him up to victim naturally this process is not going to run on the following cases until they are up to it 1 person who cannot conceive of ever having done anything bad to anybody or anything old sweetness and light 2 person who has heavy present time problem ptp 3 person who has had bad arc break with the auditor who conceives the auditor has made him into victim of bad processing or code breaks 4 person who needs to have several buttons cleared away which are pressing and making his present time very bad and 5 person who simply fogs out hour after hour on general comm processes and needs to have lighter buttons run until he can handle comm processes with these above five things cared for then pc should be able to run easily if lengthily on from where could you communicate to victim during the run on the process all manner of chains come into view monitoring the type of chain or chasing down some sideline should be avoided thoroughly especially while running victim the pc is all too willing to duck and dodge and an auditor who qs and as changes the process just because the pc changed or wandered had better go back to the academy for spell or get his own case gone over at the hgc pcs have gone into convulsions screaming fits and many other manifestations while running victim of course they would since they are dramatizing what they have done to others and are wearing the engram in full but it is easier to run victim on the pc than to run engrams on him as such for he can pull out of victim engrams easily with comm process large percentage of pcs will not recover and stay recovered until victim has been run and flattened this is due to their using auditing to be victims of this is the heart of the old service facsimile this is why they have service facsimiles so they can be victims the pc while running victim goes rapidly back and forth from one valence to another he goes through all the various phenomena of engrams locks and secondaries and in spite of the violence of the process very often would rather run victim than anything else but as above beware of trying to run this on somebody who will not ever admit having done something or anything to anybody this is the figurefigure case the difficulty here is that the person cannot face any terminal subjectively for fear of having ruined it or for fear of ruining it thereforeand watch this carefullyhe does not do the comm process such person needs comm process run on very particularized terminals done in general form from where could you communicate to dog or anything else that drops but if this is very necessary then run the person on the paper trick even with the lighter terminals make him draw each answer cases that have never never moved before in hundreds of hours of auditing get shot down in flames with the paper trick while running victim the auditor should not use how could you communicate as an interjected command its different process if the auditor is having trouble he should have run lighter terminal one of the most effective light terminals and one of the best comm processes particularly for the has coaudit is body part one asks the pc if he has ever had trouble with any part of his or her body and when the answer is given run body part named in generalized form such as from where could you communicate to legfrom all the results ive been looking over lately it would seem that the most broadly workable form of the comm process is body part as above or body after all the pc is in body doing the comm process on mest before body part and the body are run seems to be little rough on the pc this is part of system called universe processes as the pc himself as thetan is generally mest shy auditing body parts however has its lighter moments at the last congress i gave the body part given by the pc as part of the body with which he had had trouble when run didnt do thing for the pc surprised auditors and instructors were not long in finding out whythe pcs body part had been run and flattened years ago by older processes and didnt have twitch left in it this stuffs been working for long time you know well thats the way it is person doesnt get sick or injured unless hes cast himself in the role of victim by reason of the game and his overt acts and if you want somebody to cease to be disease prone new term there and get up and do things and be bright and not flub and to win win win get him up to point where he can run victim with comm process and from there on flatten the living daylights out of it when is victim flat when the tone arm of the hubbard electrometer reads consistently at the clear reading for the pc matter how many more auditing questions are asked about victims every terminal you run should be run until the tone arm reads male clear 12500 ohms for man and female clear 5000 ohms for woman and this is particularly true of victim dont start this going in an has coaudit until the pc being audited has had flattened on him easier terminals and these may take an awful lot of hours to flatten victim itself is very long run the run is shortened by preparing the case well first so preparation time is never lost time on this process there is another button in fact there are many more special buttons it goes on up toward ot and it isnt run at first on comm process but thats another and later story ill still be around when you get ready for it meanwhile

has coaudit here are some hints on how to run comm processes on assessment the instructor asks the preclear if he is sick or well if the pc says he is ill then the instructor says what part of the body would you say is ill whatever the pc answers this is then run on from where could you communicate to generalized terminal body part if the pc answers that he is well the instructor says have you ever been ill the pc will in general say yes the instructor then says what part of your body was ill and runs the comm process on whatever the pc says giving you advance scoop on new research win it seems that the most effective and rapid clearing could take place with what we will call universal processes this means running comm process on universe as follows from where could you communicate to the physical universe from where could you communicate to body from where could you communicate to mind from where could you communicate to thetan this is all experimental at this stage but it would be separation process from all universes the thetan is anxious about and should be quite successful in general use however i give you this not to use but to show you that we would probably win further and better if we began to steam people up on the subject of being clear and then slammed right in on whatever universe they could handle on coaudit i would then run coaudit as follows do the actions described above on body part and when the pc has come through that go at once on to the physical universe and then graduate him on to any body part that bangs on the meter and finally when various parts are flat get him into running the body as general terminal l ron hubbard lrh ietrd copyright 1959 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east

breakdown of parts of life is 1 the thetan 2 the mind 3 the body and 4 the physical universe this division is sort of shorthand of the eight dynamics and gives us the stuck points of the majority as this division is refined it becomes the eight dynamics as used in the old dynamic straight wire almost anything which applied to or was used in dynamic straight wire can also be used in universe processes the most elementary form of universe processes is called universe ow this consists of doing an emeter assessment of the person on the four points above taking the most different needle reaction from the rest thetan mind body and physical universe and running what was found with overtwithhold straight wire example let us say that we found physical universe to be the thing which fell the hardest or looked the most different on the emeter one would then run as an alternate question recall something you have done to the physical universe alternated with recall something you have withheld from the physical universe when the emeter was reading clear on the tone arm for the sex of the pc one would then reassess and use the one of the three remaining terminals thetan mind or body which now fell differently or more than the other two thus all four would eventually be run universe ow is based upon the observable fact that thetan is trapped in thetan mind body and the physical universe if he werent he or she wouldnt be sitting in chair thus we process the extremely obvious scouting out with an emeter only what obviousness is more troublesome to the pc than the other obviousnesses of course it seems strange that thetan could think of himself being trapped in another thetan but you see this all the time in valences ghosts become ghosts by being overwhelmed by thetans they think are ghosts and so on that thetan is trapped in mind and that it is not his own mind that he is trapped in is also obvious if it were his own mind he would soon asis it and you see what hard time he has trying to erase it that hard time comes about because he is misowning the mind in which he is trapped and this is true of all traps thetan is usually quite sure that there is something wrong with the ownership of his own body and sure enough there is and of course hes in the universe without much understanding of it it is far more obscure that thetan gets trapped in the remaining dynamics even though this is equally true he isnt really trapped in an animal if he is sitting there in human body and so forth so universe ow processes the obvious that is the most obviousall four of these terminals are run now there is another way of attacking this problem and it is very successful this is the universe comm process one assesses the pc in exactly the same way but runs the terminal on from where could you communicate to one of the four universes as above it is very notable that comm processes work best on obvious and visible terminals and work much less well on things that are not present and worst on things that are merely ideas or significances you can make great headway with pc with from where could you communicate to body when with the same pc you might get very very slow results with from where could you communicate to brother therefore the easiest to run and make progress with comm process is using an obvious terminal and this of course would be one of the four universes thetan mind body and physical universe however when one runs very obvious terminal with comm process one must carefully avoid pinning the process in present time one cannot successfully run comm process with from where could you communicate to this room this is too specific the pc is balked by the fact that the comm process strongly calls up every room like this room and if he answers anything about these other rooms he is not doing the exact auditing command and so goes rapidly out of session specific terminals that permit large breadth of time span wont run on comm process because the process escapes the time limit imposed all too easily one would have to run from where could you communicate to room in order to wipe out the bad effects of this room on the case universe comm processes are evidently the best version of all comm processes the assessment of the proper terminal can be little tricky the semantics of the terminal get in an auditors way and yet the auditor may be led astray into using version of the terminal that is not really an obvious terminal example the pc does not understand what thetan is and the meter does react to it so the auditor sorts out soul and spirit etc but gets large drop on astral body and decides to run it only to discover that he is running an engram of recent origin in which the words appear spirit dropped less but would have run because it was more general you are probably wondering how we can get away with running conceive static forbidden in the book the creation of human ability we can just barely get away with it because of the nature and power of the comm process by damping out excessive individuation the comm process increases havingness total individual cant have much of anythingyou cant even have car really unless you can be besides self car driver or car passenger totally individuated person cannot be anybody but himself cares for nobody but himself and can share in activity of any other person hence as we flatten out this obsessive individuation we gain in the pc usually enough havingness to run massless identity such as thetan however this terminal usually runs less well than the other three employed in universe processes there are other developments which will be discussed in later bulletins such as think of creation you could make unknown but these in general are not as important to us as the above if you are having trouble keeping your people on coaudit its because the things you are running on them are not real to them i think you will find that by using universe assessment on coaudit as above you will have much more constant attendance try it anyway lrh phrd l ron hubbard copyright 1959 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint

bulletin of 13 october 1959 franchise holders dei expanded scale with note on salesmen the original scale 40 desire 15 enforce 5 inhibit was expanded in 1952 to curiosity desire enforce inhibit in 1959 i have found another vital point on this scale which gives us new case entrance point curiosity desire enforce inhibit unknown i suspect also that wait fits between unknown and inhibit to make these agree in intention they would become interest desire enforce inhibit unknow this scale also inverts i find similar to the dynamics and below sanity on any subject unknow inhibit enforce desire interest these points particularly on the inverted scale going down are lowered by failure each lower step is an explanation to justify having failed with the upper level one seeks to not know something and fails one then seeks to inhibit it and fails therefore one seeks to enforce it and fails thus one explains by desiring it and fails and not really being able to have it shows thereafter an obsessive interest in itthe above inversion is of course all reactive reactive selling of interest to us in salesman campaign would be accomplished thusly and this is the basic scale of selling the salesman refuses to let the customer forget the product the salesman then inhibits all efforts by the customer to refuse the product the salesman enforces the product on the customer the salesman now finds the customer desires the product and the customer will remain interested there is an interplay here whereby the salesman reverses the scale source of sales failure salesman customer interest unknow desire inhibit enforce enforce inhibit desire unknow interest salesmen bringing about an inverted scale can go downscale themselves as they do it they seek to interest and meet forgetfulness they want to sell and meet opposition they high pressure the customer and get pressured back and about the time the customer wants the product the salesman is reactively inhibiting the sale and as the customers interest is at its highest the salesman forgets all about him salesman success all salesman has to do is continue to try to interest the customer and the reactive inversion will take place it is interesting that this scale more importantly gives us new case entrances series of comm processes on any terminal say bodies could be run from where could you communicate to an unknown body an unwanted body necessary body desirable body an interesting body this would pick the case off the bottom and run it to the top on any terminal that has gone totally reactive by the way dont take my remarks on salesmen as being all for the best the basic overt act is making people want useless objects and spaces and unfortunately for him thats often part of the business of the salesman he unlike us sometimes isnt fishing people out of the mud hes often more likely pushing them in therefore he needs our help to get square with the world as his income depends on making people want things and buy things even though sometimes they need them we havent much choice but to show him the mechanics of selling to the end of getting him to help pull others out of the mud making somebody want something they really need is crime but the salesman is on very shaky ground what dopeople really need we had best not try to get involved in the ethics of all this or to persuade them to sell only needed items the whole economic structure needs the salesman he is the key of the whole structure but we can leaven the flow of even useless goods by letting an invitation to freedom trickle in the same channel l ron hubbard lrhddrdh copyright 1959 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 20 october ad9 hco secs

processes that work way down south of the auks comm recall process recall communication know mystery recall processes recall an unconsciousness recall waiting recall mystery recall sex recall eating or variation recall food recall symbol recall thinking recall an effort recall an emotion recall looking recall knowing recall notknowing these are very good especially on bad off cases they all work when the lowest seems flat one can go to one above probably there is an emeter tellingness that denotes flatness im working on this and will have the gen soon the earliest experiments of this were on recall mystery as method of raising iq and the pc was spouting poetry hed forgotten there are many possible versions of these simplicities as one can run them on terminals and significances also remember that these things recall processes take the pc out of pt and put him back in you stop one with the pc back in pt the comm bridge to be used on this process is when you next get an answer close to present time we will end this process if it is all right with you then dont go on for an hour or two catch it with 8 or 10 commands by seeing the pc is doing short cycle at the time and has started back up recall exhaustion is simple very effective version of work process recall creating is good way apparently to mop up step 6 flubs therefore you can use these processes in the hgc or you can when it is okayed use them in training these are individual processes and not coaudit as note on coaudit the process the only basic affinity process what would you like to confront could cut your coaudit attendance losses it is now allowed having been carefully tested man do they get interested in cases and hence into session this is fine individual process for pcs that have reality on

only tech secs create processesdangers advantages just before i leave on extended trips i always take the safety measure of writing down the newest and latest and exactly where we are in proven research the newest and best as now authorized only for staff member use on staff theta clearing and the coaudit and processing of staff members only and not at this time for use in the hgc or on the general public is the create series of processes these are the first effective ot processes and as such when used on persons not yet theta clear they have certain dangers additionally they are the most valuable series of processes which we have they can be used in one form or another on any level of case and will reach pretty much all the way to the top as to dangers i refer you to our experiences with step 6 processes here was series with great promise which in many cases became rather deadly the datum here is that when you improve the ability of pc to make and see picture you also inadvertently improve every picture in the bank including engrams and anybody who has seen totally solid motivator engram will agree that it is not pleasant create processes stem from new study i have made of the cycle of action as given in fundamentals of thought axiom 10 becomes confused by the thetan with the cycle of action draw the two and look at them as each other and you will see what i mean identifying them is chaos we get slip automaticity which whenever person starts to create forces him over into destruction there is enough philosophy in this demonstrable fact to make it the subject of my next large book cancelling any bad effect from this slip automaticity from create to destroy has been solved by using the middle point of the cycle of actionsurvive in scientology the dynamic principle of existence is create as in dianetics it was survive see fundamentals of thought case run toward create is best run on this and the inverted arc triangle what would you like to create this becomes the key process of ot from any level however obsessive creation is in effect the whole engram bank and the reactive mind and lot of other things therefore it is best to beware of beefing up the engrams for too long period of time the most tested way of easing case off from the deadly step 6 phenomena is to change from what would you like to create back to what would you like to confront at routine intervals what would you like to confront cancels out step 6 phenomena by easing down the survive part of the cycle of action confront and survive are of the same order of thing survival could be represented best by continuous confronting at process level too much what would you like to create gets us into too persistent and solid bank on occasion the bank is surviving therefore the pc is made very uncomfortable and should then be run bit on what would you like to confront what would you like to confront should be interspersed with what would you like to create at ratio perhaps of session of each or in severe case an hour of one then an hour of the otherwhat would you like to destroy is under test and apparently should run this would be psycho curer for sure but what would you like to confront would have to be interspersed with what would you like to destroy in order to keep the bank from overwhelming the pc here then we have three processes what would you like to confront what would you like to create what would you like to destroy these are on the cycle of action as create survive destroy they are given above in the order of best tested we know what would you like to confront will make pcs feel wonderful and will straighten out step 6s habit of making the bank more formidable it is good sound well tested process what would you like to create is the key to all cases but to run it you will have to salt it down with periods of running what would you like to confront what would you like to destroy though not much tested at this writing might also have to be interspersed with what would you like to confront we will probably discover that all three of these have to be run and that the last one will be the best case entrance at my guess new child process very successful has already emerged from this rationale this is you do something you think ill like various simplifications of the confront and destroy commands would be something like what would you like to look at and what would you like to tear up the last one is not tested sure kill on pc would be to run what would you like to confront until it has eased off and then to run what would you like to create until it gets grim and then what would you like to confront again and back and forth this is somewhat tested as combo at this writing and it works well under test right now is the way of running all three parts of the cycle of action to obtain the smoothest possible recovery by the pc right now this data is only for staffs of central orgs as it is very dynamite and very experimental but it also gives the best and clearest promise of rapid case gains and we want central org staffs up before we release this stuff more widely this is about as revolutionary in rapid effect as engram running was in its time and place were really into something here with high rapid gain which when it is all smoothed out and sweeping the field will take us right over the top unless we find stops on the part of auditors that we cant easily overcome and i think we can whip all the bugs and get it wheeling i came down to sthil last spring to find the route to ot that almost anybody

preclear in session double acknowledgement occurs when the pc answers up the auditor then acknowledges and the pc then finishes his answer leaving the auditor with another acknowledgement to do and also leaving the auditor with session wrong command what could you say to your father pc i could say hello auditor fine pc father how are you i could say that auditor weakly good what could you say to your father pc i could say are you feeling well auditor desperate by now good pc enough to go fishing auditor well okay all right now pc is not always sure he has answered the question so he often changes his mind if the auditor gives him tone 40 or any acknowledgement at all in between pcs reply the auditor is wrong you just dont encourage pc with lot of agreement oks and yess in the middle of answers the pc answers the pc is sure he has answered and the auditor then acknowledges after all it is the pc that must be satisfied there are many ways to misacknowledge pc but any misacknowledgement is only and always failure to end the cycle of commandauditor asks pc replies and knows he has answered auditor acknowledges pc knows auditor has acknowledged that is full auditing command cycle dont forget it and expect process to work it wont the roughest spot in most auditors is tr 2 not so much how to acknowledge but when an auditor running into this with pc should handle it this way auditor what could you say to your father pc i could say are you feeling well auditor did that answer the question pc well i could say are you feeling well enough to go fishing auditor did that answer the question pc yes i guess it did he always liked fishing and sympathy auditor sure pc is through good what could you say to your father and theres the way of it if the pc is not sure he has answered and that the auditor has accepted the answer the pc will get benefit from the auditing and thats how important that ismood can be expressed by an acknowledgement evaluation can also be accomplished by acknowledgement depending on the tone of voice with which it is uttered there is nothing bad about expressing mood by acknowledgement except when the acknowledgement expresses criticalness ridicule or humour you can always spot bad auditor he does two things he talks too much to the pc and he stops the pc from properly answering l ron hubbard lrh jsrd copyright 1959 by l

terminal to comm lag flat point and then locate another terminal after this terminal has been handled it may be preferable to return to previous terminal but this is matter for the instructors

isnt even related to enthusiasm more coldblooded statement was ever made than my telling you that the situation was definitely corralled it is i am sorry that the gen is sort of complicated and requires knowhow and would much rather have arranged it so all we had to do was push the button and we got clear but as soon as you see and experience this data i think you will be very happy with it it all begins back in wichita when i wrote that extremely unpopular article which is still appearing in advanced procedure and axioms full responsibility it turns out that this is the hottest thought the old man ever thought but it didnt come into view in its full importance for more than eight years the one thing the public doesnt want to have anything to do with is full responsibility they shudder and they run whenever they think of it so thee and will have to shoulder the load and shove them at the sausage machine and all that for the whole story develops around this center pin of responsibility there was so much to the story and so many possible variations of the tale that getting it all in line and trailmarking way through the darkly woods has been very painful jobboth to you and to but we did it and weve got it and if we can just hold still long enough well have the full benefit of it overt acts and withholds are important technology if you can get somebody to take the overts out of any incident the incident will tend to vanish and it would vanish completely except for one thing telling another person about ones overts is not enough it is also necessary to take full responsibility for them thus the old wheeze about confession as advocated by one of the pagan churches pagan to scientology that all one had to do was whisper ones misdeeds and they would go away turns out to be so halfhearted that it becomes very vicious operation ive just been all over this ground and can tell you as technical fact that the simple imparting of ones sins or more comprehensibly ones overts and withholds is as inadequate as using paste to build skyscraperand about as dangerous if the church or somebody then pretended to take responsibility for the confided overts then weve spun our fellow in just like that and weve degraded the person and the society the person who confides must then take responsibility for the action he considered by means of honest processing or its just nogo noshow spindownspinin and there went the coaudits running overtwithhold and there went up the tone arms when the pc told us his crimes the rule is thorough harsh unavoidable rule when we get person to confide crime we must then run on that crime what part of it he could be responsible for until it goes alert ye hgcs if you dont do just that youll have some very unhappy people on your hands therefore be it resolved thatwhenever person has discovered to the auditor crime or discreditable act or discreditable creation that auditor is honor bound on all dynamics to run at once process that will bring about the persons taking responsibility for his action if the auditor does not he will have spinning pcthis gives us the only process we could get away with in pe coaudit that would be process which recovered responsibility the currently indicated process done without assessment would be what part of your life past could you be responsible for do not run anything else in co audit of course doing an overt or withhold is refusal to take responsibility in some sphere but overts and withholds are the offshoot of responsibility or lack of it not vice

magazine of dianetics and scientology from washington dc techniques of child processing l ron hubbard tomorrows cases are child cases today whole civilizations have changed because somebody changed the children in the past the children were usually changed for the worse today lets be different and change them for the better but whatever the benefits and reasons of child processing however much it may do to smooth out home and improve the future the fact remains that it is highly technical subject the processing of children requires more technically perfect auditing and more properly applied sessions and processes than the average adult to achieve the greatest benefit for children one should first achieve the greatest possible command of auditing skill and scientology theory and practice because child is helplessly unable to express his arc breaks violently enough to be listened to is reason he should be given them child processing demands more perfect auditing than adult processing and therefore requires better trained auditor than the average if you would process children be professional auditor first even if the children are your own you will find that it will pay with that reservation in mind here are few very modern developments in the processing of children these are the best processes i know and the only processes that have worked out over long period of time on great many children type of session child must be given very formal session childs case will go downhill generally if the child is processed hit or miss any old time with careless sessioning childs session must be given the full dignity of an adult session it must be opened and closed all the formalities of session must be observedand of course the auditing must be done in place where the session cannot be broken in upon by outside persons or influences the old technique of short sessioning works very well with child all one does is formally open and close session and run within it only minute or two of some simple process as below the attention span of child is short and if the child is even faintly unwilling to be audited you can coax the child into short sessions and then as time goes on lengthen them graduallyassists on children of course one does not open and close session with any formality while doing an assist the preclear is always too tied up with the emergency and the agony to do anything but the process the best assist for child is where did it happen and after asking this where are you now getting the child to point each time he answers the questions look at my fingers while touching around the injured area lightly is also good assist for an injured child routine child processes probably the most worthwhile child process which works as early as first speech is where is the____ using table chair and other room objects but avoiding bodies the child takes this at first as language examination and is very proud of it it occasionally blows grief charges on losses very effective on child that is normal or has physical defect is an alternate touching of the childs arm the auditors arm and using various duplicative body parts first on the auditor then on the child accomplishing in effect from where could you communicate to body with the actual command feel my arm thank you feel your arm thank you and so on using common body parts but warning with thisif it turns on somatic do the same process session after session until the child is very bright and alert all the time this is very fine child psychosomatic process children with

dont try them version of tr 5 you make that body sit in that chair can be run even on babies by substituting bed for chair instilling confidence the worst crime most scientology parents commit is demanding the child be far better and brighter than he or she can manage at once this has the effect of making the child feel that he cant really do anything to please his parents and that he is thus failing them the right thing to do is to acknowledge what the child thinks he can do or is all right otherwise you are evaluating for the preclear and thats code break child seeking the approval of his parents is always inventing new tricks to attract attention this means the child is already feeling neglected without reason but is not in itself any bad sign acknowledge the tricks and spend more

willing cause over all dynamics then we can see at once that responsibility must go hand in hand with making an operating thetan one cannot asis acts for which one is taking responsibility but for which one is really responsible the reason one gets amnesia on his past lives or even denies their existence lies with responsibility he or she is unwilling to take responsibility for having been this or that other identity this keys in in present time and closes one down every time one stops taking responsibility for ones fellows fighting other identities in present time one ceases to be responsible for other identities therefore those he has had in the past become other people and one dramatizes his own past identities because he cannot take responsibility for them when one falls away from responsibility on the various dynamics he can then become less and less able to influence those dynamics and therefore becomes victim of them one must have done to other dynamics those things which other dynamics now seem to have the power to do to him therefore one can be injured one can lose control one can become in fact zero of influence and vacuum for trouble the way one becomes separate from others is by his own overt acts against them these overt acts become withholds and the person then individuates very strongly you have seen this happening in auditing the more overt acts the auditor pulls on the pc the less willing the auditor is to audit that pc further the more overt acts the pc pulls on the auditor the less willing he is to stay in session it only looks as though cause and effect is at work actually all life consists of opposed causes where it is aberrated the way person blows out of session or blows out of an organization or blows out of scientology is simple one he withholds information and hides his overts after while he blows himself off show pc blowing session and i will show you pc who has not levelled with his auditor and who is guilty of undeclared overts against the dynamics and the auditor show staff member who is blowing the organization and i will show you staff member who is guilty of undeclared overts against the organization it is fatal to audit anyone unless full twoway comm is established between the auditor and the pc person who goes on being audited without asserting his responsibility for what he has done is person who will make auditing gains or whose auditing gains will slump as most of the human race has undeclared overts this fact alone assumes gigantic proportions in forwarding scientology and for that reason alone we will have to give it lions share of attention from here on out of course you will see that many people at first will not come near us for fear of what we will find out but as this is better understood you will find that the people who come to us will come with willingness to bare their guilt to us and get it sorted out as this is so much the case we must then therefore have amongst us none with undeclared overts against the dynamics which would prevent their getting gains in processing or who would render persons confidences liable to use for less pure purposesalong with this technical discovery then goes the administrative must that our noses must be clean and our hearts cleared our strength will be the strength of billion if we have nothing to hide this may or may not be popular i dont care about that it is effective i do care about that and remember that whenever person discloses to view discreditable overts and withholds we must run what part of that act or incident could you be responsible for youre going to see more case gains than youve ever seen beforeproviding you have the stamina to get over this first hump so here we change from irresponsible to

to leave for instance man has been frantic about the high divorce rate about the high job turnover in plants about labour unrest and many other items all stemming from the same source sudden departures or gradual departures we have the view of person who has good job who probably wont get better one suddenly deciding to leave and going we have the view of wife with perfectly good husband and family up and leaving it all we see husband with pretty and attractive wife breaking up the affinity and departing in scientology we have the phenomenon of preclears in session or students on courses deciding to leave and never coming back and that gives us more trouble than most other things all combined man explained this to himself by saying that things were done to him which he would not tolerate and therefore he had to leave but if this were the explanation all man would have to do would be to make working conditions marital relationships jobs courses and sessions all very excellent and the problem would be solved but on the contrary close examination of working conditions and marital relationships demonstrates that improvement of conditions often worsens the amount of blowoff as one could call this phenomenon probably the finest working conditions in the world were achieved by mr hershey of chocolate bar fame for his plant workers yet they revolted and even shot at him this in its turn led to an industrial philosophy that the worse workers were treated the more willing they were to stay which in itself is as untrue as the better they are treated the faster they blow off one can treat people so well that they grow ashamed of themselves knowing they dont deserve it that blowoff is precipitated and certainly one can treat people so badly that they have choice but to leave but these are extreme conditions and in between these we have the majority of departures the auditor is doing his best for the preclear and yet the preclear gets meaner and meaner and blows the session the wife is doing her best to make marriage and the husband wanders off on the trail of tart the manager is trying to keep things going and the worker leaves these the unexplained disrupt organizations and lives and its time we understood them people leave because of their own overts and withholds that is the factual fact and the hardbound rule man with clean heart cant be hurt the man or woman who must must must become victim and depart is departing because of his or her own overts and withholdsit doesnt matter whether the person is departing from town or job or session the cause is the same almost anyone matter his position can remedy situation matter whats wrong if he or she really wants to when the person longer wants to remedy it his own overt acts and withholds against the others involved in the situation have lowered his own ability to be responsible for it therefore he or she does not remedy the situation departure is the only answer to justify the departure the person blowing off dreams up things done to him in an effort to minimize the overt by degrading those it was done to the mechanics involved are quite simple it is amazing what trivial overts will cause person to blow i caught staff member one time just before he blew and traced down the original overt act against the organization to his failure to defend the organization when criminal was speaking viciously about it this failure to defend accumulated to itself more and more overts and withholds such as failing to relay messages failure to complete an assignment until it finally utterly degraded the person into stealing something of value this theft caused the person to believe he had better leave it is rather noble commentary on man that when person finds himself as he believes incapable of restraining himself from injuring benefactor he will defend the benefactor by leaving this is the real source of the blowoff if we were to better persons working conditions in this light we would see that we have simply magnified his overt acts and made it certain fact that he would leave if we punish we can bring the value of the benefactor down bit and thus lessen the value of the overt but improvement and punishment are neither one answers the answer lies in scientology and processing the person up to high enough responsibility to take job or position and carry it out without all this weird hocuspocus of ive got to say you are doing things to so i can leave and protect you from all the bad things i am doing to you thats the way it is and it doesnt make sense not to do something about it now that we know recent secretarial executive director to all central organizations states that before person may draw his last pay cheque from an organization he is leaving of his own volition he must write down all his overts and withholds against the organization and its related personnel and have these checked out by the hco secretary on an emeter to do less than this is cruelty itself the person is blowing himself off with his own overts and withholds if these are not removed then anything the organization or its people does to him goes in like javelin and leaves him with dark area in his life and rotten taste in his mouth further he goes around spouting lies about the organization and its related personnel and every lie he utters makes him just that much sicker by permitting blowoff without clearing it we are degrading people for i assure you and with some sorrow people have not often recovered from overts against scientology its organizations and related persons they dont recover because they know in their hearts even while they lie that they are wronging people who have done and are doing enormous amounts of good in the world and who definitely do not deserve libel and slander literally it kills them and if you dont believe it i can show you the long death list the only evil thing we are doing is to be good if that makes sense to you for by being good things done to us out of carelessness or viciousness are all out of proportion to the evil done to others this often applies to people who are not scientologists just this year i had an electrician who robbed hco of money with false bills and bad workmanship one day he woke up to the fact that the organization he was robbing was helping people everywhere far beyond his ability to ever help anyone within few weeks he contracted tb and is now dying in london hospital nobody took off the overts and withholds when he left and its actually killing hima fact which is fancy on my part there is something little terrifying in this sometimes i once told bill collector what and who we were and that he had wronged good person and half hour later he threw hundred grains of veronal down his throat and was lugged off to hospital suicidethis campaign is aimed straightly at cases and getting people cleared it is aimed at preserving staffs and the lives of persons who believe they have failed us uneasy lies the head that has bad conscience clean it up and run responsibility on it and you have another better person and if anybody feels like leaving just examine the record and sit down and list everything done to and withheld from and the organization and send it along well save lot of people that way and on our parts well go along being as good manager as good an organization and as good field as we can be and well get rid of all our overts and withholds too think it will make an interesting new view well scientology specializes in those l

scientologist whether certified or not may participate there are two ways you can participate 1 to get off your own overts and withholds and 2 urge other people to get off theirs to accomplish this and provide an orderly check on this and to prevent any overt being used by anyone the following procedure is recommended that full list of present lifetime overts and withholds be made with or without the assistance of sessions particularly as they apply to scientology or related groups and personnel and signed and sent to hco ww saint hill manor east grinstead sussex england b that second list then be made giving what responsibility one could take for these instead of the second list an auditors report saying it has been done the auditor attesting it may be forwarded that these files exist in my personal possession should make it effectively impossible for anyone to try to use the information in this way we can cover all existing certificates and people and by following this with new people keep an expanding group clean and clear i appreciate any cooperation you can give in forwarding this programme and will doubly appreciate any auditing you do toward this direct goal all

i wrote the first book with the solution to both types of cases that give us trouble and thats good anniversary release of course you saw the first book after january of 1950 but in the cold bitter winter of bay head new jersey i was busy writing down the research of years which would become first best seller and then long term steady seller across the world beating most book records you know dianetics the modern science of mental health and you know its data and you know also that any case could be cleared if you could run all the engrams off the case and you know as well that you have run into cases that resisted all efforts to run engrams or penetrate the bank it was only these cases that kept dianetics and all its goals from being realised by all auditors we have concocted many dodges and much training skill has been perfected all to run just two types of casesfor most of the cases around in the public could still be cleared by straight dianetic processing right out of book one in this and the next bulletin i am going to take up these two types of cases and their solution valuable data you stated it correctly the first of these two types was the case which didnt experience any improvement even after you had run the exact engram necessary to resolve the case the hallmark of this case was unreality it either went through it all with emotional change or it jumped all over the track and derailed at unlikely moments this case also arc broke very easily and was plain hell to keep in session or it was so apathetic it continually slumped when the case did make gain it promptly relapsed and was telling everyone how bad the auditor was well weve actually been talking about this case for several bulletins it is the case which mustnt let anyone find out its earmarks are one or more of the following l runs with reality 2 skids around on the track 3 goes out of communication easily 4 experiences little if any gain in processing 5 criticises the auditor 6 propitiates 7 tries to blowany one of the above and probably several more characteristics may be present in such case but it just cant run engrams whatever else can be said about it and it just doesnt make progress one of the things this case is doing is using auditing to make people guilty of overt acts as an auditor this case wont really get down to auditing and as preclear the case just doesnt ever get up and fly there are various degrees of this case almost anyone has sooner or later run into one or another of these but the whole summary is contained in one fact the person gets little benefit from dianetics or scientology if all the cases in scientology were really wheeling wed get holdups either as auditor or as pc further we wouldnt be tiptoeing around holding on to so many pc secrets that we ourselves get giddy making sure nobody tries to capitalise on them we would be in fact free people the only free people on earth further we can only be harmed by those things we have harmed and if all of usfor you have an influence in this too rememberhad our worst overts and withholds off person or agency on earth would be able to touch scientologist harmfully and thats worth working for isnt it the failed case doesnt move as listed above and doesnt audit very well since it just cant confront overts from another and turns them away well thats the dianetic failed case and its the scientology failed case and knowing this we begin the road to freedom as group as well as individuals the case that does not advance under auditing is the case that has undisclosed overts and withholds the main ones that are harmful to an advance of the case are in the present lifetime and are known to the preclear but sometimes are trifle out of sight and bounce into view quite suddenly and painfully get the overts and withholds off the case and run responsibility on them and you have case that is wheeling at last it can run anything and it can be cleared well thats the main dianetic failed case and why remember that when pc tells you his current lifetime overts and withholds you are code bound to run responsibility on them now lets face up to it and do it do it do it l

against overts include making another person guilty of anything dont overlook these always run responsibility on any major overts discovered 2 only when pc has needle reading at clear reading for his

discreditable creations use wording that best communicates to pc in asking for these starting with his present lifetime run responsibility on these use some such commands as what part of that incident could you admit causingwhat could you withhold from that person those people 4 check well into his goals what goals does he particularly want rehabilitated clean up his earliest present life discreditable creation on this goal line by running responsibility on it you may do well to run several of these this of course may be done much later in session after whole track this is artistic

them do this by clever twoway comm not by repetitive auditing command this is the makebreak point of case get real real about it this step applies ordinarily to the very boggy case that isnt running well any case can benefit from it but it is must on boggy case 6 clean up social atmosphere of present life by getting off 2nd and 3rd dynamic overtwithholds family job etc this step would be more germane to an hgc pc and may be omitted by students however bad tone arm that wont adjust to clear by the above will possibly adjust with this step if you rehabilitate the pcs ability to withhold from such areas general note on above always run some responsibility when pc communicates an overt or withhold of magnitude the tone arm will not come down or go up when pc communicates overt or withhold unless he assumes responsibility for the act always rehabilitate pcs ability to withhold especially when auditor is getting him to spill great deal mindless object reading 15 indicates pcs ability to withhold has been badly shaken good command think of something you could withhold runs well alternated with various forms of what could you admit causing second stage 1 if pc has field somatics malformity or aberration clean it up as follows find out what he is looking at b date it with the meter c run what part of the scene could you admit causing keep on with the same command matter how much the scene changes until pc is in pt when he will most likely come up with the scene of present auditor and auditing environment within the last day or two it is then flat for your purposes 2 disassociation from identities stable datum any identity is misidentification therefore get it off case identity most in restimulation whole trackb identities of the last two or three lives with special attention to the shifts of identity involved c any identities you can get hold of be sure to get his most creative life whole track 3 immediate past lives most cases crack when the last life before this one and perhaps the last few lives are well explored tackle these with the emeter find out all about them the rule is that in stage one you set the pc up to be audited and clean up present life in stage two you clean up immediate past life or lives and then the whole track summary the keynote is increase confidence by increasing ability the gradient scale is confidence in being audited b confidence in present existence immediate time track c confidence in present life d confidence in regaining health by running off chronic somatics confidence in regaining memory of and recovering from past few lives particularly the last one f confidence on the whole track by removing overts and reestablishing withhold ability on the whole track if step is done well and thoroughly the next

mentioned that two case types held us up in dianetics and that i had now solved these ten years after the first books writing the first type was the case that had so many overts and withholds in this lifetime that it could not be gotten into two way communication the remedy for this is to get the overts and withholds confessed and run responsibility on these acts the second type is the black field case the case with field could not run engrams because he could not see them before i started to teach people to audit i never found this case i didnt find it because i merely assumed that the case was stuck on the track and i persuaded the case to get unstuck in may 1950 in teaching class in washington dc i found that at the exact moment of stuck there was sonic visio and the rest after i started teaching people how to audit this case eluded them and after while i found some that eluded too naturally anyone knowing that this was an unauditable case for the fact was quite well advertised used the mechanism to cover up overts and withholds the mechanism i am about to give you relieves however any such case and changes it around considerably this remedy applies not only to black field cases but any kind of constant view including invisible fields and stuck pictures this formula has proven sufficiently good that the only way to get around it is for the pc to run like the dickensand you can keep him from doing that by getting off his overts and withholds whether or not you have relieved his overts and withholds you can use this formula with great profitand just because its simple lets keep it as simple as it is it will work in taking hold of new case the first thing to do is start the session letterperfect with rudiments and goals whether the case has ever been audited before or not then ask the person to close his or her eyes and find out what the person is looking at if it is pt okay to proceed along any process line if not pt but stuck picture field or nothing at once put the pc on the meter where he should have been all along and do time scout pin whatever the person sees in time as exactly as you can right down to the minute of the day this may blow the pc up to pt in some cases but usually it will only change the view slightly now understand this if pc is stuck on the track all the auditing you are doing is around an out of pt area and is not valid for present life so it is very valuable to handle just what it is thats sitting there and not scramble it up with any other process than this one it does not matter for this formula where the pcs tone arm is located for its reading will be more or less for the stuck incident and not as result of present life material so disregardthe tone arm and the injunction never to audit pc with high tone arm when you are doing this attend to the tone arm after youve got the pc in pt all right weve got the time of the incident the pc is still sitting there with his eyes closed his data is very vague perhaps he may be totally uncooperative who cares do this anyway run now what part of that scene youre looking at could you be responsible for he may give you the most strained or vague answers thats all right this will still work keep running it matter how many times he repeats the same answer the picture will start to shift it may shift with slowness or enormous rapidity or both but it will shift well just go on and run the process as above right up to pt and then skip it except for noting where he was stuck when you have the pc in pt get off his overts and withholds and let the tone arm down what would you let know what would you withhold from alternated will do very well to clean it all up providing you run responsibility on any incident of importance the pc comes up with well thats the case that couldnt see pictures thats the psychologist who says they dont exist thats the rough case that wouldnt move on the track despite all the randomity im getting some things

what is going on only about eight people have run for the brush to date because of an unwillingness to reveal their overts against scientology there may be few more but the data is not to hand the overwhelming majority of scientologists have embraced these new techniques and measures with enthusiasm factually those that blew were not in possession of much data on overts i feel that if they had been they would have stood up to it in early november i ordered all organizations to give an emeter check on all staffs preliminary to auditing these on the new overtwithholdresponsibility combination i also forbade central orgs to employ persons with hidden social crimes that might be used to hurt scientology blackmail until expiation could be accomplished and auditing completed this began by suspending one doug moon in hasi melbourne until he had been cleared since he was such social liability almost instantly on receipt of the emeter check order iain thompson in hasi london longtime friend of moon unexpectedly resigned and caused kaye thompson to resign from hco ww all that had happened at saint hill up to that moment was my release of casual non scientology personnel and liquor stealing butler before i left for australia so mary sue could carry on more easily the day i returned to saint hill norma webb peter stumbke and another nonscientologist named dinah day resigned and ran away on november 23rd at the urgings of nina west close friend of webb nibs hubbard deserted his post in washington and left forwarding address it transpires that he had been caught up in the moonwebbwest connections he tried to find nerve to face an emeter the saturday he left but did not report for his scheduled session with his washington auditor on that day he has since been heard of here and there borrowing money and staying out of sight the registrar in melbourne subsequently left before she could be put on meter the only action taken concerning these people is suspension or cancellation of certificates pending emeter checks and clearing of overts against scientology none except moon were dismissed but they have been heard to say that they were they resigned without notice to any scientologist encountering any of these personnel would do all of us favour by getting them on meter and getting their overts against us off and reporting having done so to hco ww if any

justification we have all heard people attempt to justify their actions and all of us have known instinctively that justification was tantamount to confession of guilt but not until now have we understood the exact mechanism behind justification short of scientology auditing there was means by which person could relieve himself of consciousness of having done an overt act except to try to lessen the overt some churches used mechanism of confession this was limited effort to relieve person of the pressure of his overt acts later the mechanism of confession was employed as kind of blackmail by which increased contribution could be obtained from the person confessing factually this is limited mechanism to such an extent that it can be extremely dangerous religious confession does not carry with it any real stress of responsibility for the individual but on the contrary seeks to lay responsibility at the door of the divinitya sort of blasphemy in itself i have axe to grind here with religion religion as religion is fairly natural but psychotherapy must be in itself completed fact or as we all know it can become dangerous fact thats why we flatten engrams and processes confession to be non dangerous and effective must be accompanied by full acceptance of responsibility all overt acts are the product of irresponsibility on one or more of the dynamics withholds are sort of overt act in themselves but have different source oddly enough we have just proven conclusively that man is basically gooda fact which flies in the teeth of old religious beliefs that man is basically evil man is good to such an extent that when he realizes he is being very dangerous and in error he seeks to minimize his power and if that doesnt work and he still finds himself committing overt acts he then seeks to dispose of himself either by leaving or by getting caught and executed without this computation police would be powerless to detect crimethe criminal always assists himself to be caught why police punish the caught criminal is the mystery the caught criminal wants to be rendered less harmful to the society and wants rehabilitation well if this is true then why does he not unburden himself the fact is this unburdening is considered by him to be an overt act people withhold overt acts because they conceive that telling them would be another overt act it is as though thetans are trying to absorb and hold out of sight all the evil of the world this is wrongheaded by withholding overt acts these are kept afloat in the universe and are themselves as withholds entirely the cause of continued evil man is basically good but he could not attain expression of this until now nobody but the individual could die for his own sinsto arrange things otherwise was to keep man in chains in view of these mechanisms when the burden became too great man was driven to another mechanismthe effort to lessen the size and pressure of the overt he or she could only do this by attempting to reduce the size and repute of the terminal hence notisness hence when man or woman has done an overt act there usually follows an effort to reduce the goodness or importance of the target of the overt hence the husband who betrays his wife must then state that the wife was good in some way thus the wife who betrayed her husband had to reduce the husband to reduce the overt this works on all dynamics in this light most criticism is justification of having done an overtthis does not say that all things are right and that criticism anywhere is ever merited man is not happy he is faced with total destruction unless we toughen up our postulates and the overt act mechanism is simply sordid game condition man has slipped into without knowing where he was going so there are rightnesses and wrongnesses in conduct and society and life at large but random carping 11 criticism when not borne out in fact is only an effort to reduce the size of the target of the overt so that one can live he hopes with the overt of course to criticise unjustly and lower repute is itself an overt act and so this mechanism is not in fact workable here we have the source of the dwindling spiral one commits overt acts unwittingly he seeks to justify them by finding fault or displacing blame this leads him into further overts against the same terminals which leads to degradation of himself and sometimes those terminals scientologists have been completely right in objecting to the idea of punishment punishment is just another worsening of the overt sequence and degrades the punisher but people who are guilty of overts demand punishment they use it to help restrain themselves from they hope further violation of the dynamics it is the victim who demands punishment and it is wrongheaded society that awards it people get right down and beg to be executed and when you dont oblige the woman scorned is sweettempered by comparison i ought to knowi have more people try to elect an executioner than you would care to imagine and many preclear who sits down in your pc chair for session is there just to be executed and when you insist on making such pc better why youve had it for they start on this desire for execution as new overt chain and seek to justify it by telling people youre bad auditor when you hear scathing and brutal criticism of someone which sounds just bit strained know that you have your eye on overts against that criticised person and next chance you get pull the overts and remove just that much evil from the world and remember by and by that if you make your pc write these overts and withholds down and sign them and send them off to hell be less reluctant to hold on to the shreds of themit makes for further blow of overts and less blow of pc and always run responsibility on pc when he unloads lot of overts or just one we have our hands here on the mechanism that makes this crazy universe so lets go for broke on it and play it all the way

environment erase by any effective method set goals for session when pt problem and arc breaks handled establish rudiments at the beginning of each session reestablish rudiments if pc goes out of session check over what pc got towards his goals at session end step two scout for present life overts and withholds if found run what about that incident could you be responsible for see note on

sex on low tone arm case particularly below two find any terminal that dips the needle however slightly and run withhold on that terminal what could you withhold from what could you make terminal contribute run alternately with what would you rather not contribute to terminal has also made low tone arm rise scs and cchs have also done so the low tone arm is supposed to be the tougher one actually its the valence of mindless object and the last resort of the pc to withhold so rehabilitating withhold cleverly should get it easily step three clear the pcs field with responsibility as per recent hco bulletin on black invisible or dubin cases when pc sees pictures of pt then go at case in general step four run what about victim could you be responsible for until the tone arm tends to read at clear reading for sex in this lifetime whenever the pc encounters an incident that seems very sticky which is to say when the picture sticks many commands by the emeter spot the time in terms of years ago and down to the month and day when the incident is spotted if it continues to hang up run it as an incident with this command what about that incident could you be responsible for and as needfulon two way comm basis and by any process as needed get off its overts and withholds and who would it make feel guilty when any incident is reasonably flat continue with what about victim could you be responsible for this does not mean that you spot and run every incident encountered spot and run only those that stick step five explore the immediate past lifetime or lifetimes of the pc get the pcs identity and form sometimes they were animals and if lifetime alters position of tone arm run what about name would you be willing to be what about name would you rather not be do this until incident is flat if heavy engrams in such lifetime stick run what about that incident could you be responsible for step six run down any famous or enduring identities of the pc on the whole track and handle as above ease off this with responsibility as victim step seven do dynamic assessment on the pc and locate any terminal that drops and run on this what could you withhold from until pc can withhold if any severe incident turns up flatten with responsibility step eight any chronic somatic or disability of the pc if still not located should be tackled with what about that name it could

cases present life overts show up responsibility is the key to high and low tone arms not overts handle any severe overts that turn up on case with responsibility process do not run massless terminal such as sex or help find instead some actual terminal not significance beware running adjectival commands such as frigid woman or little boy with mole under his left grind run instead the plainest terminal that dropsdo not run things that are not real to the pc as he has made them unreal to lessen the overt instead run lots of overt finding processes such as what could you admit causing terminal real to pc alternated with what could you withhold from same terminal much of the material here is on the washington 1960 hcs tapes but this rundown here is to be followed in the event of any conflict of procedure important note where responsibility is used above it can also read what could you admit causing terminal what could you withhold from terminal this alternate command is better process than what about terminal could you be responsible for note usage of this rundown should be taught on staff theta clearing courses l ron hubbard lrhjsrd copyright 1960 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 28 january 1960 hco secs assn secs fran hldrs the key to all casesresponsibility during the past three months i have made several important discoveries in the field of the human mind which iron out the bits and pieces that were getting in our road in making broad clearing programmes possible first of these was the discovery that the tone arm of the emeter rather than the needle was foremost in analysing the case when the tone arm reads at three for males and two for females on the modern meter process can be considered flat aside from various special states such as valence shifts this will hold true when the tone arm reads at clear for the persons sex matter what one attempts to restimulate on the case you have clear additionally the hot areas of the time track are located because they throw the tone arm to higher or lower readings good auditing today cannot be done without an emeter of good reliable quality as distributed by hco ww in the uk and by wingate enterprises in the united states it could be said that the emeter has just now become an absolute necessity in auditing and general analysisusing the emeter right we can achieve clears next but not next in importance was the discovery of the anatomy of responsibility although responsibility has been known as case factor since 1951 just as the overtmotivator sequence has been it has not been until now that i have been able to get it to run well on cases responsibility is significance pcs define it in various ways and all rather tend to run from it pcs in general pretend they would much rather be victims than causative sources which is what is wrong with their cases in order to get responsibility to run i had to find out lot more about it and not until the very end of 1959 was i able to define it in any way that made it run and come into being on case now i mentioned the emeter first in this because it is responsibility level of which causes the tone arm of the emeter to fluctuate place the pc in an area which has very high tone arm reading or very low one and you find the pc in an area in time when he was being very irresponsible it is not always true that pc picked up as reading at the clear reading of his sex is high on responsibility there is an inversion of the matter where the pc is so very low on responsibility that he just gets body reading for his sex and that is that the test of this is the running of responsibility as given in this bulletin if the pc run on responsibility changes the position of the tone arm from the clear reading then that pc has very long way to go perhaps before he can achieve any responsibility if pc is run on responsibility as given herein if his track is explored and if the tone arm reads and continues to read at clear then he is very responsible and very clear but you would have to run the pc bit not just read him on the meter in order to get an accurate view of the matter in other words dont look for overts to check out on case look for tone arm fluctuations when responsibility is run it takes at least certain level of responsibility to show up overt acts on emeter what exactly does the emeter read it reads the degree of mental mass surrounding the thetan in bodya thetan accumulates mental mass pictures ridges circuits etc to the degree that he misassigns responsibility if he does something and then says that it was done by something or someone else then he has failed to assign cause rightly and doing so he is of course left with an apparently uncaused mental mass this to us is the bank to freud it was the unconscious to the psychiatrist it is lunacy he therefore has as much bank as he has denied cause as he is the only cause that could hang himself with mass the only misassigned cause therefore is self cause other peoples causation is not aberrative and does not hang up except to the degree that the pc is provoked to misassigning cause other peoples cause is therefore never audited here then we have the anatomy of the reactive mind the common denominator of all these unwanted ridges masses pictures engrams etc is responsibility the discovery of the direct anatomy of responsibility is as follows able to admit causation able to withhold from this you will recognize as old reach and withdraw and as the fundamental of every successful process but now we can refine this into the exact process that accomplishes removal of the reactive mind and reestablishment of causation and responsibility thetan will not restore his own ability until he is certain he can withhold from things when he finds he cannot then he reduces his own power he will not let himself be more powerful than he believes he can use power when he gets mad he of course can control nothing neither can he really direct anything when he causes something that he thinks is bad he next seeks to withhold if he cannot withhold then he begins to compulsively cause things that are bad and you have overt acts happening what we call responsibility is restored on any subject or in any case by selecting terminal not significance and running on it what could you admit causing terminal think of something you could withhold from terminal overt acts proceed from irresponsibility therefore when responsibility declines overt acts can occur when responsibility declines to zero then person doing overt acts longer conceives them to be overt acts and you do not even get wiggle on the meter needle when looking for overts and withholds on such case thus some criminals would not register on overts at all even though they had the loot in their pockets and it is often necessary on any case to run causewithhold on present life terminals as given above before the person can conceive of having committed any overts against those terminals this is very important case will run well and many cases will not run at all with present life overts and withholds undisclosed and unflattened these overts and withholds may not even come into view until the version of responsibility given herein is liberally run on the case choose any area where the pc conceives himself to be victim select terminal to represent that area that falls on an emeter run causewithhold as given herein on that terminal and watch the overts pop into view it is not necessary to handle these overts when they come up with any other process than causewithhold since cause withhold given here is responsibility there are other factors on cases that need handling but these are all handled with responsibility processes if all the factors involved in case are well handled as given herein you will have theta clear who will be able to do lot of things humans cant do and if you handled case totally with this material and its specialized skills then you would have anoperating thetan fortunately for this universe thetan will let himself go free unless he can operate without danger to others and the responsibility factor is way up on all dynamics this material is covered in tape lectures from the washington january congress 1960 nine hours and in the hcs course lectures washington january 1960 nine hours the congress which was very warmly received in washington is being replayed in many areas by public demand and the hcs course is being given as the hcsbscn course in all central organizations this is the major breakthrough we are starting the 1960s with we are counting on hgcs turning out theta clears at regular intervals and we are working to get all staffs of central organizations through to theta clear on staff clearing courses this material is also being used on pe courses which now should run as follows one week pe course with tr demonstrations this free people pass from this course directly into coaudit comm course at fee on the following process what could you admit causing person what could you withhold from person terminals other than person may be selected by the coaudit instructor full intensive given by hgcs on the basis of ot3 procedure is sufficiently in advance of this to make individual auditing necessary in most cases ot3 has been released to all central orgs who have the washington hcs tapes the cchs are used on cases incapable of defining terms in view of this material and what is now known of responsibility and overts and what they do to case level new kind of justice comes into being making it completely unnecessary to punish you can know person by his case level does it advance or doesnt it does he elect others ogres when he himself has been doing things or does he show scientology in himself this is brand new look and it can be made brand new earth we started the 1960s the right way as i think you will discover l ron hubbard lrhjsrd copyright 1960 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 2 february ad 10 bpi the coaudit team the running of coaudit team as done on staff theta clearing course as done on staff and at home by scientologists can be either very trying and unsuccessful activity or it can be wonderful success depending on whether it is done wrong or right fine example of this is the old time inability of large percentage of husbandwife teams to succeed but even husbandwife coaudit team can succeed these days and come out clear if they follow the rules laid down in this bulletin coaudit teams fail not because either partner is unwilling but because they dive into the deep without preparing the weather in advance the first requisite of any coaudit team is to thoroughly prepare the auditing climate and keep it repaired this is true of any new team matter what either member of it did on any old team therefore coaudit procedure must do the following before any cases are tackled audit alternate sessions not alternate intensives run as the first process to be flattened what have you done to what have you withheld from and they run this every time the arc breaks stack up assess the case with an emeter as to whether dianetics and scientology on one hand or the sex of the auditor on the other hand get the biggest fall on the meter or change on the tone arm this action determines whether dianetics and scientology or the sex of the auditor get run first they are both to be run a11 we want to determine is which to run ahead of the other find one or more terminals that represent dianetics and scientology run each the one with the biggest meter reaction ahead of the rest on what have you done to terminal what have you withheld from terminal run them all run only until each one is relatively flat and only as long as the pc has ready answers check them all over again running the sex of the auditor must also be done if the auditor is woman then run what have you done to woman what have you withheld from woman if the sex of the auditor is male then run what have you done to man what have you withheld from man all the above must be clean as whistle before one tackles case so making sure of the above matter how many hours its devouring will give wins all the way every session one handles all the rudiments is it alright to be audited by if not lets get into ow again and clean up dianetics and scientology againis it alright to be audited in this new environment if not get off the overts and withholds on the environmentfinding some terminal that represents it as general terminal do you have present time problem if so get it out of the road by twoway comm if possible picking up the overts and withholds and guilt on the terminals involved but dont handle ptps endlessly and skip other auditing what goal would you like to set for this session buy the goal the pc sets so long as its real to him dont force pc into the auditors goals or goals unreal to pc when one gets down to the pcs case the auditor does dynamic assessment and finds where the tone arm is moved by one or another of the dynamics if the tone arm not the needle is moved by dynamic then using the needle motion find the hottest terminal that represents that dynamic and run overtwithhold on that terminal when this is flat do another whole dynamic assessment find terminal that represents that dynamic and run it and so on always use general rather than particular terminals avoid adjectival commands never run significance terminal is flat when overtwithhold longer moves the tone arm around and the needle is not stuck the tone arm does not have to be reading at clear for the pcs sex if the terminal is flatit must only be that the terminal longer influences the tone arm and doesnt drop the needle when mentioned when the pc reads more or less constantly at clear reading for his sex after doing all the above then finish the case off with what have you done to yourself what have you withheld from yourself and now get this in coauditing there are greater strains than professional auditing therefore havingness problems arise so make it rule that for every two hours of auditing on rudiments or ow or anything else which i hope not run one half hour of objective havingness with the following single command look around here and find something you could have i am at the present moment working on more coauditing manual material but it wont be ready for quite while and it contains more or less what you find shorthanded above if one of the coauditors has hpa or hca its worthwhile to get training before coauditing i am giving you this in the interest of making clears i have piloted this out as probably the only safe procedure for everyone available in present technology these are both the fastest processes and least liability the above regimen is not just pretty good its winner but if you go running engrams or assuming the pc likes womankind or etc etc etc or if you plunge into the case without clearing up the idea of auditing and sessions you are in for trouble co audit or professional now lets see some more clears around here l ron hubbard lrh jsrd copyright 1960 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications

hco bulletin of 4 february 1960 fran hldrs hco secs assn secs theory of responsibility processing in order to make up ones mind to be responsible for things it is necessary to get over the idea that one is being forced into responsibility the power of choice is still senior to responsibility what one does against his will operates as an overt act against oneself but where ones will to do has deteriorated to unwillingness to do anything lack of will is itself an aberration variations in the reactions of pcs to responsibility processes stem from the pcs belief that his power of choice is being or has been overthrown where an auditor has pc balking against responsibility process the pc has conceived that the auditor is forcing responsibility on the pc and very little good comes of the session there is nothing wrong basically with doingness but where one is doing something he is unwilling to do aberration results one does in such case while unwilling to do the result is doingness without responsibility in the decline of any state into slavery as in greece or into economic strangulation of the individual as in our modern western society doingness is more and more enforced and willingness to do is less and less in evidence at length people are doing without being responsible from this results bad workmanship crime indigence and its necessities for welfarism at length there are so many people who are unwilling to do that the few left have to take full burden of the society upon their backs where high unwillingness to do exists democracy is then impossible for it but votes for the biggest handout where high unwillingness to do exists then we have constant restimulation of all the things one is really unwilling to do such as overt acts forcing people who do not want to work to yet work restimulates the mechanism of overt acts with thereby higher and higher crime ratio more and more strikes and less and less understanding of what it is all about the individual who has done something bad that he was not willing to do then identifies anything he does with any unwillingness to dowhen of course he has done this many times therefore all doingness becomes bad dancing becomes bad playing games becomes bad even eating and procreation become bad and all because unwillingness to do something bad has evolved and identified into unwillingness to do the person who has done something bad restrains himself by withholding doingness in that direction when at length he conceives he has done many many bad things he becomes total withhold as you process him you encounter the recurring phenomenon of his realization that he has not been as bad as he thought he was and thats the wonderful part of it people are never as bad as they think they areand certainly other people are never as bad as one thinks they have been the basic wonder is that people police themselves out of concept of good they conceive themselves to be bad and after that seek every way they can to protect others from self person does this by reducing his own ability he does it by reducing his own activity he does this by reducing his own knowingnesswhere you see thetan who sleeps too much and does too little where you see person who conceives bad doingness on every hand you see person who is safeguarding others from the badness of himself or herself now there is another extreme person who must do because of economic or other whips and yet because of his own concept of his own badness dares not do is liable to become criminal such persons only answer to doingness is to do without taking any responsibility and this when you examine the dynamics falls easily into pattern of dramatized overt acts here you have body that is not being controlled where most knowledge is obscured and where responsibility for others or even self is lacking it is an easy step from criminality to insanity if indeed there is any step at all such people cannot be policed since being policed admits of some obedience lacking control there is ability to obey and so they wind up simply hating police and that is that only when economic grips are so tight or political pressure is so great as it is in russia do we get high criminality and neurotic or psychotic indexes whenever doing is accompanied by will to do irresponsibility for ones own acts can result basically then when one is processing pc one is seeking to rehabilitate willingness to do in order to accomplish this one must rehabilitate the ability to withhold on the pcs own determinism not by punishment further bad actions only then will the pc be willing to recover from anything wrong with the pcsince anything wrong with the pc is selfimposed in order to prevent wrongdoing at some past time all types of responsibility processes have this as their goal to rehabilitate the willingness to do and the ability to withhold on ones own determinism restraint in doing something one knows he should do is secondary deterrent but comes with other offshoots of responsibility into the cognition area thus we have formula of attack on any given area where the pc cannot do is having trouble or cannot take responsibility locate the area b find terminal to represent it c find what the pc has done to that terminal that he thinks he should have withheld d reduce all such incidents in short all we have to do to rehabilitate any case is find an area where the terminal is still real to the preclear and then get rid of what he has done and withheld and we come up with an improved responsibility of all the responsibility processes the oldest one i developed is still the best one by test and that is what have you done to terminal what have you withheld from terminal the processing results depend in large part on the accuracy of assessment on the willingness of the auditor to process the pc and upon running the process as flat as it will go before finding another terminal assessment accuracy depends upon skilled use of the emeter dynamic straight wire is best and weather eye upon the tone arm to see what terminal varies it once one has the dynamic and from that has selected terminal the willingness of the auditor to process the pc depends upon the confidence of the auditor to obtain resultsand this is established by deletion of things the auditor has done to pcs and withheld from pcs in general and this pc in particular thus coaudit teams would be right always if they took each other as the terminals to be run first get these pretty flat and keep them flat during processing with what have you done to what have you withheldfrom then as the next thing to do run the sex of the auditor off the pc then clean up dianetics or scientology or use this as step two and only then go into case that would be pretty fine coaudit team after they have survived the first explosions and gotten them gone then in searching out areas to run as case care should be taken not to overrun terminal or underrun one pc running out of answers can get very restless responsibility can be rehabilitated on any case and when it has been you have clear and thats all there is to it l ron hubbard lrhjsrd

every high scale manifestation or activity has low scale mockery there can be an apparent clear reading on case that has never been successfully audited this case is too low toned to register at all as thetan the resulting read is therefore that of the body minus bank overts will show up on the needle of this case only when responsibility has been run does this case shift off the low reading and get different tone arm and needle responses such case is fairly easy to recognize the case has obvious areas of great irresponsibility and yet reads like clear but once you scout out the case this state of affairs becomes upset and the case reads otherwise and then eventually comes back after an awful lot of sessions and intensives into the clear range and stays there but now the case is able where it was before very apathetic and really useless any clear check out must include the following exercise and indeed this is the process which gets these low level cases really cracking this is both clear examination and good entrance to cases it is also the best way to check out overts when in doubt you run on the emeter dynamic assessment and pick up any dynamic that gives change of needle pattern or take any dynamic which makes needle drop matter how slightly having located the dynamic we now ask the pc for any terminal he or she thinks would represent that dynamic we take any terminal that has any drop on it as given or suggested by the pc on this terminal we now run overtwithhold as follows what have you done to terminal what have you withheld from terminal this was the terminal realest to the pc therefore when responsibility is increased on it you have generally increased responsibility when we have flattened this off mildly we go through the whole operation above again before we have done this many times overts will begin to show up on the case and will be recognized by the pc doing this well just once unsettles the false clear reading and that reading will not return until the case is actually cleared lrhjsmwcden l ron hubbard copyright 1960 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin

originated to protect criminals but to bring freedom to honest men into this area of protection then dived those who needed freedom and individual liberty to cover their own questionable activities freedom is for honest people man who is not himself honest can be freehe is in his own trap when his own deeds cannot be disclosed then he is prisoner he must withhold himself from his fellows and he is slave to his own conscience freedom must be deserved before there is any freedom possible to protect dishonest people is to condemn them to their own hells by making individual rights synonym for protect the criminal one helps to bring about slave state for all for where individual liberty is abused an impatience with it arises which at length sweeps us all away the targets of all disciplinary laws are the few who err such laws unfortunately also injure and restrict those who do not err if all were honest there would be disciplinary threats there is only one way out for dishonest personfacing up to his responsibilities in the society and putting himself back into communication with his fellow man his family the world at large by seeking to invoke his individual rights to protect himself from an examination of his deeds he reduces just that much the future of individual liberty for he himself is not free yet he infects others who are honest by using their rights to freedom to protect himself uneasy lies the head that wears guilty conscience and it will lie more easily by seeking to protect misdeeds by pleas of freedom means that you must never look at the right of person to survive is directly related to his honesty freedom for man does not mean freedom to injure man freedom of speech does not mean freedom to harm by lies man cannot be free while there are those amongst him who are slaves to their own terrors the mission of technospace society is to subordinate the individual and control him by economic and political duress the only casualty in machine age is the individual and his freedomto preserve that freedom one must not permit men to hide their evil intentions under the protection of that freedom to be free man must be honest with himself and with his fellows if man uses his own honesty to protect the unmasking of dishonesty then that man is an enemy of his own freedom we can stand in the sun only so long as we dont let the deeds of others bring the darkness freedom is for honest men individual liberty exists only for those who have the ability to be free today in scientology we know the gaolerthe person himself and we can restore the right to stand in the sun by eradicating the evil men do to themselves so do not say that the investigation of person or the past is step forward to slavery for in scientology such step is the first step toward freeing man from the guilt of self were it the intention of the scientologist to punish the guilty then and only then would look into the past of another be wrong but we are not the police our look is the first step toward unlocking the doorsfor they are all barred from within who would punish when he could salvage only madman would break wanted object he could repairand we are not mad

have an understanding of what limited process is any process which makes the preclear create is limited process and should be avoided such processes as tell lie are creative processes the preclear has creation tangled up with cause and cause tangled up with the overt motivator sequence the thing that straightens all this out is any version of responsibility run with the pc at cause earlier the best we had to straighten this out was confront responsibility is confront and is very senior to confront as process when pc overcreates he accumulates the unconfronted debris all you have to do to restimulate debris stiffen up the bank is to run the pc on some version of create process havingness is confront process and straightens out the create factor havingness is the lowest version of responsibility confront is the next lowest overt withhold is the next and at our present top for practical purposes is just plain responsibility actually all these are responsibility processes create is bad only when one does not take responsibility for the creation the key process of all processes at this writing is being responsible for having been irresponsible there is great deal of anatomy to responsibility great many answers lie waiting on its track when one maligns another he has not taken responsibility for the acts of that other person and so is separate from that other personone of the highest points of knowingness which is not at this time known is whether we are all one or if we are actually separate beings enough responsibility run achieves subjective answer to this while several offshoots of this present technology are under test at this time it can be said with certainty now that the best version of responsibility for most cases is what have you done to terminal what have you withheld from terminal it will be seen at once that what could you do to and what could you withhold from terminal is create process and is therefore slightly limited and leaves debris thus it can be said with finality overtwithhold rather than causewithhold is the best process in the presence of arc breaks havingness is must on any responsibility process and is always good preventive for flops dont forget havingness we know now that it is the lowest rung of responsibility this becomes evident when we examine the withhold aspects of havingness plain ordinary what could you be responsible for is of course very fine process and oddly enough often goes lower for short run than overtwithhold responsibility isnt just high level process it works where it works it is interesting that while running pure raw responsibility in its noncreate form what have you been responsible for we see anew the old knowtomystery scale revealed factual havingness can be run in its trio form with good results look around here and find something you could have look around here and find something you would permit to continue look around here and find something you would let vanish the old restrictions and knowhow of running this still apply look around here and find something you could have is of course wonderful process and whenever you run an hour and half of any other version of responsibility you had better run half an hour of look around here and find something you could have and be on the safe side summary the data in this bulletin is far from merely theoretical to some auditors it will come as an emergency super frantic hysterical rush item for they should shift over any version of responsibility they are running to the above versions dont run any other version of overtwithhold than that given above you can run responsibility as itself on any incident or terminal if the pc can take it run half hour of havingness for every hour and half of any responsibility subjective process note instead of the cchs for that low low level case why not get it going with havingness as above and then find any terminal that ticks on meter and run ow on that terminal then

auditing and have pretty well wrapped up the optimum auditing commands therefore i want to get this data off to you as fast as possible and get it in use as soon as possible because here again is an increase in auditing effectiveness over and above our existing successes in the next bulletin up i want to give you revised form of model auditing session and after that procedure ot 3a however you can use this following material right now and without those and i recommend that you recognize what you have here as modification which changes all earlier statements even if they seem to you slightly in conflict to begin person who does an overt act to another life form has already abandoned responsibility for that other life form an overt act and withhold are evidently expressions of abandoning responsibility already extant and are therefore manifestation of irresponsibility therefore for the sake of auditing skill as well as theory overts and withholds are the same as irresponsibility when running overts and withholds according to the evidence now to hand you are actually running irresponsibility off the case you are taking away the lower inversion of responsibility the way to run an overtwithhold process is to choose terminal with an emeter early in the case choose terminals that are specific and close to pt when you have chosen the terminal by reason of its drop on the needle and its reality in the pcs life you run on it the following what have you done to what have you withheld from when addressed to specific terminal it is worded what have you done to what have you withheld from now this may require up to thirty hours to flatten on some cases but whatever you choose to do on case then do that thing well the tone arm may or may not go down on this process but it will become very different try to end up the process with the tone arm lower than it was at the start if the pc runs out of answers well thats it dont force him hard just go on to the second stage on the same terminal in very generalized form by this time you have more than discharged an irresponsibility and you have the responsibility all to handle indeed according to the many cases i have now looked over the tone arm may not even begin to come down properly or come up properly until the second stage is run and flattenedthe second stage process is responsibility you take the same terminal you ran the ow on and if it was specific form you now use general form ie ow on your mother becomes responsibility on mother run as follows what responsibility have you taken for this is the process which will bring the tone arm down or up but only when the ow is fully flattened first this above combination of processes is the fastest and surest main line of auditing procedure now known the above commands are far and above the best proven commands as you can see the slightly older process what could you admit doing to and what could you withhold from are indeed manifestations of responsibility and factually are an index of responsibility but when it comes right down to cases the above versions cover all cases and do it right what lot there is to know about auditing today getting combination of processes such as the above for the general handling of cases relieves us of the constant tension of what should i run and gives us time to concentrate on perfection of running it extremely well an auditor ought to be adept at cchs and running the above he ought to be very sharp with an emeter and he ought to be able to run model session with blunders this done equals clearing people there is substitute for training at the level of hcsbscn running session right and handling an emeter and pc successfully are auditors skills it must be admitted that very few auditors are possessed at this time of complete and near perfect auditing ability i take my own responsibility for this and that responsibility lies in not having established an inflexible regimen of auditing i did not do so because there was ample room for the improvement of techniques and auditing routines but these last five months of work have brought us closer and closer to the exact right ways to handle cases and the exact processes to run on them this has arrived with much fuller understanding of what complexity man is accomplishing toward aberration with the fiftyfive axioms man got pretty complicated in digging himself in it has been my job to get pretty simple about digging him out the new key data which has emerged as clearcut fact includes as an invariable that the person himself dug himself in lost sight of why and is holding himself in state of stupidity aberration and even insanity we suspected this for years but way to prove it and then give person personal reality on it was not mapped through now it is as tough as this if you run what have you done what have i done you can hold tone arm inactive every gain is balanced with counter accusation which is to say new overt and so the process gets nowhere after few questions the pc did it all himself and must gradually come to realize that with total subjective reality through processing not because the auditor told him the pc made the facsimile to restrain himself from ever doing it again basically good he goes wrong by failing to keep his own high standards and so loses control of himself another datum high tone arm shows loss of the ability to start or reacha low tone arm below the clear reading shows the loss of ability to stop or withhold in locating terminal on an emeter and why try to audit without one of these key tools remember that the needle drops only on those terminals that the pc still feels some responsibility for there is some responsibility to be found on these the drop does not mean that this is what is wrong with the case so much as this is that thing wrong with the case that can be remedied at this time overts dont even show up on terribly irresponsible case until some responsibility is restored but rather irresponsible case run on the above procedures on any terminal that does drop will get changes away from the clear reading on the tone armto clear case it is not so much necessary to run everything off the case as it is to run whatever you run so well that the confidence of the case is restored restoration of confidence in being able to handle the bank and therefore life is better goal than trying to flatten the whole case indifferently what you contact do it well matter how long it takes good proceeding is to find anything close to pt and in the environment of pc ptps give real good clue and then handle it with great thoroughness with the above procedure any constant restimulator of ptps aches to be audited with the above and will do more for the case as whole if the auditing is well done and thorough than running any amount of back track confidence is the keynote of clearing that is what the pc lost on his way down dont worry if the needle stays high or low and dont believe the pc is still hiding something from you you can take the above rundown and do it all the overts of the pc will eventually out he doesnt tell you about overts at first because he doesnt see them as overts they were all justified and the target has been lessened etc etc then when he has ow and responsibility run on any terminal that drops his general responsibility comes up to point where he knows an overt was an overt i trust the above will correct any small disturbances that have been occurring or any stalls you have been running into l ron hubbard lrhjsjh copyright 1960 by l

bulletin of 25 february 1960 ma bpi scientology can have group win if every one of us relieved his conscience of all his transgressions against others what would happen to society the social ills of man are chiefly composite of his personal difficulties the combined dishonesties of individuals add into the formidable total of aberrated third and fourth dynamics criminality and war and is there difference came about because of staggering social aberration this is only composite of individual aberrations people who believe otherwise are just being irresponsible for their share each man and woman on earth has contributed to this massive tangle of transgression the overts and withholds of each are added to the total mass of social ills further one man or one woman failing to take his or her share in the general responsibility which makes society sane works as further subtractive from group or world effectiveness there are many many instances on record now of whole social situation clearing up with others when one person was processed on the problem wife estranged for years processed on her husband and his family quite commonly hears from them the enmity vanquished in her vanished from them there is therefore more to this than an arithmetical one for one throughout the world it would not be necessary to process apparently every person on earth to bring sanity to earth first there is the easily seen advantage of returning communication and honesty to just one person by removing his overts and withholds from the total sum on this proposition alone we could win and we should try to win on this whatever else we do each person should restore himself to communication with mankind and the world by removing from himself his own transgressions and failures to this we add the fact that each person so processed becomes strong point of effectiveness which then influences his associates and eventually even if only by this influence discharges their confusions and then to this we add the fact that when ones own transgressions are dismissed the persons involved in them even when not processed tend to become unburdened and if we strongly influence others to become honest by getting their overts and withholds processed we have approached with thorough and hardheaded practicality resolution of the social ills of man this is an impulse which can become wave and from wave can grow into an avalanche that would sweep away the snarled tangles from human life on earth all great cathedrals began their building by the placement of single stonethe building unit of great society is the individual we can speak of clearing in broader sense and we can discuss its potentials for earth but while we work at that there is today another meaning to the worda smaller meaning to the individual perhaps but greater meaning to all men since it can happen now in few hours of good processing the clearing of ones transgressions in this lifetime and the taking of responsibility therefore we are group inured to highflown tasks this is an easy task to confront hgcs can do this for people field auditors can do this for people we can demonstrably and easily clear in under hundred hours all the key overts and withholds from case in all directions and restoring responsibility thereon we have the skills i know we have the will every scientologist can get this done and every auditor can do it using an emeter and the processes of hco bulletin of february 18th 1960 and the session model of hco bulletin of february 25th 1960 the task is well within the scope of the skills of even the newly trained i think you will agree with that this one we can do and i assure you that doing it on case gives that case its fastest available relief later we can carry the case forward to higher levels with all the gain that would bringbut just now can we not assume goal that falls within the reality of all of us for it is accusation for any person living in our times to say that he can be relieved of transgressions against his fellows and even that small amount picked up from the great web of lies leaves the tangle surely less this programme is simplicity its technology is to hand proven and rechecked and it points ahead to big win shall we take this step to clearer earth as our first great group accomplishment l ron hubbard lrh jsrd copyright 1960 by l ron hubbard

needle this should bring the needle into quietness and the tone arm down to clear reading for the pcs sex on low tone arm case particularly below two find terminal that is in stuck picture and run withhold on that terminal what could you withhold from if an overt is very bad one that the pc can take little responsibility for run ow on the specific terminal involved then generalize the terminal form in the command and run responsibility commands here are what have you done to __ what have you withheld from then what responsibility have you taken for when pc has done very bad overt to person or thinks he has his level of responsibility is already below zero on that type of person therefore responsibility run on the specific terminal such as agnes wont work as pcs responsibility on woman was very low before he did an overt to agnes therefore it would be ow on agnes and responsibility on woman the whole essence of clearing in this lifetime is done by the steps up to and including this one the procedure would be to locate the present life overts or personnel in pt problems run ow on them and then responsibility on the general form step five clear the pcs field with responsibility as per recent hco bulletin on black invisible or dubin cases when pc sees pictures of pt then go at case in general ow on persons in stuck picture will move it running withhold only on such persons will raise low needle case step six run what about victim could you be responsible for until tone arm tends to read at clear reading for sex in this lifetime whenever the pc encounters an incident that seems very sticky which is to say when the picture sticks many commands by the emeter spot the time in terms of years ago and down to the month and day when the incident is spotted if it continues to hang up run it as an incident with this command what about that incident could you be responsible for and as needful on two way comm basis and by any process as needed get off its overts and withholds and who would it make feel guilty when any incident is reasonably flat continue with what about victim could you be responsible for this does not mean that you spot and run every incident encountered spot and run only those that stick step seven explore the immediate past lifetime or lifetimes of the pc get the pcs identity and form sometimes they were animals and if lifetime alters position of

could you be responsible for step eight run down any famous or enduring identities of the pc on the whole track and handle as above ease off this with responsibility on victim step nine do dynamic assessment on the pc and locate any terminal that drops and run on this what responsibility could you take for if severe incident turns up flatten with responsibility on the incidentthis step can be

actual terminal not significance beware running adjectival commands such as frigid woman or little boy with mole under his left grin run instead the plainest terminal that drops do not run things that are not real to the pc as he has made them unreal to lessen the overt instead run lots of overt finding processes such as what could you admit causing terminal real to pc alternated with what could you withhold from same terminal note confront can be run as prelude to any and all responsibility with the following command what about could you confront do not use the dichotomy version rather not

expansion of ot3a procedure step two hgc allowed processes step two of ot3a procedure is as follows run cause arc straight wire to give pc win on getting audited once each over and over end process only with pc in present time on cycle recall communicating to someone recall time you felt affinity for someone recall something that is really real to you now people do have time tracks the time span of the individual from beingness to present time on which lies the sequence of events of his total existence and when the preclear is in session and is being run on recall type process he with his attention goes up and down this time track he may recall things only from this life or he may recall things from his whole past track but however that may be his attention cycles from early on the track to present time or from present time to early on the track to present time this is known as the cycle aspect of recall type processes in ending such process it is of utmost importance that the auditor end it with the preclear in present time on the cycle the auditor wants to watch ending the process when the preclear has not made smooth cycle into present time but has made big jump from way back in the past to present time in such case the preclear has really bounced out of the past incident into present time and it is only an apparency that the preclear is in present time so when ending such process the auditor must exert caution to be certain the preclear is in present time being left with ones attention back on the track is not comfortable sensation and sometimes can be quite painful despite any justification offered by an auditor who himself has reality on the time track and i hope there are such auditors with cause arc straight wire the auditor must forget his fastidiousness about ending the process precisely so on the last command recall something that is really real to you he ends the process matter on what command of cause arc straight wire when the preclears attention has come into or close to present time close to present time being the last day or two in ending such process the communication bridge used is as follows the next time you come close to present time i am going to end this process he continues to give the commands using the question when was that after each answer the preclear gives and before the acknowledgement when the preclear gives an answer close to present time he says that was the last command of that process end of process bang with processes that cycle there can be communication bridges like if its alright with you in few more commands i am going to end this process it could take fifty more commands until the preclear is close to present time and by that time the preclear has entirely forgotten that there ever was any intention on the auditors part to end the process as it seems to him that the auditor must have changed his mind and decided to run the process longer than few commands an auditor should not get upset with preclear when the auditor in an effort to get the preclear to give an answer right in present time starts the preclear back down the time trackagain remember it is the auditor who calls the shot and if he misses then he had better learn to gage it bit better good auditor allows himself time in which to properly end process now two further cyclic processes which can be seen under step two of ot3a are 1 what would it be all right for you to make forgotten 2 what would you permit to have happen again these are called cause elementary straight wire and are two separate processes which are not to be run alternately the first process puts the preclear at cause over forgetting and the second process rehabilitates the preclears ability to duplicate these are both terrific processes in turning on recall in the preclear all processes under step two are unlimited with the make forgotten one only slightly less unlimited as it has bit of tendency to run down havingness havingness however should be checked upon in each session and run as needed the auditor should not consider step two of ot3a lightly these processes are in reality very potent and will certainly do more for cchstep cases than anything we have had before an example of this is how preclears broke through from psychosis to neurosis to sanity with the simplified version of arc straight wire as given in the original self analysis so use these processes and win faster note on second thoughts for purposes of differentiation the first process what would it be all right for you to make forgotten should be termed cause elementary straight wire and the second process what would you permit to have happen again shall be called duplication straight wire these two processes were first used in early advanced clinical courses in phoenix and were called at that time elementary straightwire the commands of elementary straightwire as given in dianetics 1955 were give something you wouldnt mind remembering and give something you wouldnt mind forgetting as the ability to recall depends upon the mechanisms of forgetting and remembering the ability to duplicate you can easily understand the importance of these in step two of ot3a l ron hubbard lrhjsrd copyright 1960 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 17 march 1960 fran hldrs standardized sessions there are many reasons why sessions should be standardized and held in pattern first of these is confidence the auditor going over practised ground feels more confident and startled by some sudden action or new development does not lose session control by seeming incapable to the pc the preclear accustomed to repetitive session pattern feels security when all his sessions are predictable as to pattern of address and if he changes auditors he is still able to feel confident that he is getting real auditing second reason is duplication just as old repeater technique done by the auditor to the pc will run out phrase or charged word so do session patterns well followed tend to run out earlier sessions duplication does not make all things seem alike duplication of session adds communication to the session and speeds up the willingness of the pc to communicate to the auditor the basic freeing action of auditing depends upon the separation of thought from form matter energy space and time and other life we see in science as currently practised nearly total identification by the scientist of mass with thought man from mud is natural conclusion by anyone who has all his thought bound up in mass the reason clears needle is so free and youve seen certainly how an emeter needle gets sticky then freer and freer is that his thought is separated from matter energy space time consequence the deadinisead case is totally associating all thought with mass thus he reads peculiarly on the meter as he is audited he frees his thinkingness so that he can think without mass connotations what auditing is doing is making the preclear think key thoughts until they can be thought without creating or disturbing matter energy space and time as most pcs associate themselves with thought only when they can think thought without ploughing anew into mass can they exteriorize difficult exteriorization or exteriorization with bad consequences is all caused by persons considerations of thought being matter self being matter etc etc the basic overt act is making somebody else want mest this recoils so that self wants mest thus we have the necessity for havingness running havingness restores the pc at cause over matter permits him to be separate from matter to some degree thinking then is separated from mest by repetitive thinking on the exact points that pin particular person to mest if person is aberrated say on the subject of women the shortest cut to deaberration barring havingness difficultiessee below would be the repeated command think of woman at last he would longer have pictures or masses just because he thought thatthought and you would then find he could think about women as opposed to reacting about women this naturally leads to an obvious basic process think about matter think about energy think about space think about time think about thetan in theory each one could be run flat in turn and then all run again in actual practice this is pretty steep for most cases and would not be real to many more complex approach containing more significance is more real to the pc the pcs mind is trapped into forms of mest and life rather than merely mest and life thus what falls on the emeter needle shows what form of mest and life his attention is fixed upon havingness is complicated subject when viewed in pcs mind familiarity which is to say predictability is strongly connected with his ability to have or own when he receives shocks or surprises his ability to predict is invalidated and he cant have the reason thetan dies is his loss of the familiar by the introduction of the unpredictable rapidity of change of state unpredicted would be definition of surprise also of death and forgetfulness the more change he is subjected to that he did not predict the less he can have thus when he is given rough session the pcs havingness goes down not predicting the shifts and changes of the auditor the pc ceases to be able to have the session or its appurtenancesthe auditor the room etc the smoother the auditing the better the pcs havingness stays up the model session is designed to avoid unpredictable changes thus it is designed to retain havingness by retaining pattern which is to say retaining predictability by lhe pc auditing done smoothly duplicatively session by session as to session pattern runs itself out even if the pc has constantly changing bank pc began to use pictures when he changed lives and sometimes therefore language but only after he had already adopted language for thought so an ultimate step in processing could concern itself with separating the pc from the significance of words some such process as think of word followed by think of meaning would in theory if it could be run but has not been tested and would violate havingness discharge the pc of his dependence on language for thought and would find him less fixated on having pictures which of course bridge the language barrier appearing in form composed of matter running on energy existing in space and keeping pace with others in time is favour pcs do one another or an overt act depending on how cynical you may feel when you consider it the games condition of havingness is have for self cant have for others appearing in form violates this games condition also giving another words violates it thus actors and writers tend to go downhill by violating their own games condition if they are in one games condition evolves from separateness running some form of separateness can then result in exteriorization not from willingness to lose the mass of the body but by curing the games condition separateness is of course handled on lower cases by running out obsessive connectedness but separateness itself can be run any auditing is solution solutions are ordinarily an alteris of problems thus getting people to confront problems or even solutions can resolve not only case but auditing whereauditing itself has now and then in absence of smooth analysis and session handling become problem to the preclear fine process for this is tell problem that auditing would be solution to and for that matter this also applies to any psychosomatic illness person with bad leg would experience relief if audited on tell problem bad leg would be solution to as repetitive process similarly it might work if one asked tell solution to bad leg you could confront or what problem about leg could you confront which last is very good as process the separation of thinkingness from problem from particular forms and from life and mest are the primary targets of auditing and just as the repetitive auditing command runs out not only the connection with mass but itself so does repetitive session design eventually free the pc from not only his aberrations but auditing itself person gets as able as he regains confidenceand he gets as free as his auditing is constant not itself wild variable l ron hubbard lrhjsrd copyright 1960 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 24 march

continuous session if it is not given proper cycle of action it does not result in any control of the preclear rudiments are not something it is nice to do rudiments are something that must be done great deal of the value of auditing lies in the mechanics of the session itself if you wish to demonstrate this for yourself all you have to do is try short sessioning this consists of starting continuing for few minutes session and ending the session it has good gain qualities for pc who has poor concentration it does not matter what is run what matters is that direct control of thought results in setting an example that thought can be controlled session without proper rudiments is session without control session without control gets gains of any note after working with this for years i believe nearly foolproof method of handling the rudiments has been developed the parts of modern rudiments are as follows goals surroundings auditor and arc breaks present time problem end rudiments present time problem auditor and arc breaks surroundings goals note the end rudiments are changed in order from hco bulletin of february 25 1960 goals goals are set at the beginning of the session in order to make the preclear postulate session occurrence if the pc says nothing about goals or even says nothing will happen probably nothing will happen of any note in the session goals are taken up first in session before environment auditor or problems because these may entail auditing if they are not rightand the moment you start to audit the last three then you are running session without setting goals and may run the entire session of the auditor or the present time problem and muff it because goal was ever set the auditor who does not set up goals immediately following the start of session may wind up without getting chance to set goals there is lot to know about goals there have been processes entirely devoted to goals great many more processes could be developed about goals however the value of these tools or processes does not compare to just getting goal or three set for the session itself if you run into difficulties about goals there are two processes which can be used and perhaps other old processes might also be worked on the subject the basic reason we give stress to goals is to keep the auditor from making one of the greatest fundamental errors he can make the auditor is processing in one direction and the pc wants to go in another this creates basic disagreement between auditor and pc which prevents auditing from getting anywhere and results squarely in arc breaks and upsets where these are frequent this mistake must be supposed to exist and must be cleared up there are only three things pc can do in session so far as results are concerned he can get better he can stay the same he can get worse therefore there are only three basic types of goals improvement goal nochange goal deterioration goal all this derives from survive and succumb as the two opposite poles the auditor may be seeking improvement while all the pc wants to do is succumb the auditor may be trying to keep the pc from getting worse and the pc wants only to get better the auditor but lets hope not may be working unconsciously or otherwise on particular pc to make him or her worse and the pc is trying to get better of course in the last case ow is indicated for the auditor on this type of pc fortunately the last type is rare the commonest disagreement on goals comes about on the first mentioned the auditor wants improvement and the pc wants deterioration some auditor trying wildly to make pc better gets failure only because he has never closely observed the pcs goals and hasnt got this straight with the pc if goals go wrong the simplest process to clear the pc on direction is problem process this might sound odd but it is quite true the fastest goals process is general problems process this occurs because the pc in looking over problems falls into realizing what his actual desires are the quickie version of this process handles solutions in this fashion the auditor looks over the preclear and sees that the pc has some obvious disability he asks the pc if the pc has any disability and steers it into getting the pc to bring this one to light this would be something like bad foot or cough one selects mass terminal for this disability such as chest for the cough whatever the pc says it is and runs the following command what problem would bad foot be solution to using this on one or more disabilities and running it while until pc is in pt on it shows the pc at once that at least as far as foot is concerned he has been trying to succumb this is very ordinary occurrence since factually any chronic psychosomatic is an effort to succumb remember that the doors are all locked from within by the pc himself if pc is still reluctant and upset about goals or isnt getting better faster because of the solutions process above run some consequences in this fashion what would you be likely to do if you didnt have bad foot this makes the pc look at it some more and some responsibility run on what he has said he might do will clear the thing away the general process that uncovers most of this is tell problem when pc has what part of that problem could you be responsible for when pc has the auditor says again tell problem etc etc etc on repetitive basisnow remember that we werent trying to make his foot well that may or may not happen with any rapidity what we are trying to get the pc to look at is that his goal alignment is not an improvement but deterioration the old process of worse than minus the invent part also accomplishes the same end think of something worse than bad foot this on repetitive basis will turn up all sorts of horrible consequences to not having bad foot of course having victim with his face kicked in before one and the police sirens sounding is worse than having bad foot by the pcs rationale because people hold in and cripple themselves mentally and physically to keep from doing things they know are wrong goals more frequently than you would like to find are in the direction of getting worse until you untangle this one as an auditor you may not be able to make any lasting progress with pc factually pc in bad condition is more likely to have succumb goals than survive goals when handling rudiments get the pc to set goal any goal or even two or three goals he really thinks he can make in the session but if after two or three sessions it is apparent that he is not achieving his goals as set by him in the session despite care to handle them by the auditor with processing it should be suspected that the pc is technically an opposite vector case and has private goals quite the reverse to getting better when one has uncovered this fact as the auditor without evaluation he had better get it uncovered to the pc there are auditing failures there are only errors in auditing chief amongst these errors is failure to take up and straighten out the pcs goals that is the first amongst the rudiments and last in the end rudiments so it must be pretty important dont discount its value and handle it with the attention it deserves once upon time or two i have asked some auditor auditing what his goals for the session were it produced some interesting randomity but pc is under orders but the auditors and it isnt something that is needed in the session also i have just up and told the pc what i would like to get done in the session and sometimes it worked and sometimes it didnt and i found that what the pc wanted to get done and what the pc said he or she wanted to get done were more important unless the pc postulates his recovery it wont last even if you make him recover in spite of himself or herself the way to make the pc postulate it is by handling goals as above the pc is often very startled by what he finds out about his actual intentions i have stopped being startled by what pcs do i find that when they dont recover very fast they dont want to and i start working over their goals matter what else seems to be the matter the cchs work better if rudiments are used but sometimes thats impossible due to state of the pc take up goals with such pc at the first available chance however and make your work easier life is series of attained goals auditing requires at least the setting of goals and their attainment l ron hubbard lrhjsrd copyright 1960 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill

for subjects who are not educated maps of town areas are useful with one eye on the meter you just point to areas of the map and let the meter guide you in when you have worked out an area or name repeat it several times and shift it around until you get maximum dropa whole mine of information can be picked up from silent person on reporters looking for possible accidents is good convincer tell the reporter not to speak and use over and under times have you ever had an accident was it more than five years ago was it less than five years ago watch the needle pin it down to maximum fall thats the year now get the month first or last half of year then for first half ask about jan feb mar month found get the day then the hour of the day then the type of vehicle or accident then who was hurt etc reporters always start talking somewhere along about this time dont pay any attention just go on and nail it down in security check you want the person who persuaded the person you have on the cans to engage in riot when you locate and have brought this new person you do the same thing but now you have whole committee of names to get and your subject is better educated taking ten people from strike or riot you can find the instigator of their group finding the instigator and getting him on the cans you can run it back to higher command level the end product is the discovery of terrorist usually paid usually criminal often trained abroad given dozen people from any riot or strike you can find the instigator of that group or more than one finding that one you can get his boss twenty or thirty paid agents provocateurs can keep whole country in revolt clean them up and the riots collapse thousands are trained every year in moscow in the ungentle art of making slave states dont be surprised if you wind up with white revolts kill an awful lot of natives only when security has been established can reform be applied use emeter clean hands to convince people that population is loyal and that reforms are in order in the riots in london anybody arrested has his fine paid for him by some mysterious group demonstrators are recruited so this isnt limited to south africa crack the agents provocateurs identities and youve cracked the new slavery of earth the workers production demanded by the state for nothing we have lot of reforms ourselves but we dont need criminal agents or dead people killed in riots to put them in effect dont use guns use emeters to make country secure by the way the answer to passive resistance is for the government to passive strike against any district from which it occurs water lights pay government or service simply use the same tactic back dont use guns cordon the area off and shut off power and water l ron hubbard lrhjscden copyright

time problems at times they come up unexpectedly they happen between intensives they pop up between sessions they indeed occur within sessions and the auditor who neglects to handle them when they arise will get little auditing done its the present time problem that sticks the graph makes it register change its arc breaks that drop one what is ptp as the auditors write it in their reports it is basically the inability to confront the dual terminal nature of this universe it is an inability to span attention and denotes that the pc who is having lots of ptps has his attention very fixed on something the definition of problem is intention v intention or two or more opposing and conflicting views on the same subject if the pc has problems with wife or husband we can be sure that they have divergent views on some basic thing in life thus the auditor who has pc who always has ptps with one the same person had better run ow overtwithhold on that terminal in specific form george and then responsibility on the general form husband thus ptp is as good as an assessment find what terminals the pc has ptps about and handle that terminal as above indeed this is more than trickits great timesaver one can waste hours on pc who repeatedly comes up with ptp on the same person but that person in the ptp is often the current clue to the case grace the wife leads to wife leads to woman present time problems are not always concerned with the world outside auditing auditors can be ptp to the pc especially when the pc has big withholds processes on ptps present time problem processes are many the earliest was twoway comm later one was invent problem of comparable magnitude to but this one of course is create type process and is therefore very limited still another process was tell your problem how does it seem to you now this almost runs the whole case recent one that has workability is what problem could you confront this finds out for the pc that he cant confront problem at first without doing something about it that isnt confronting the problem this is an amusing effective and educative process problems tend to snap in on the pc the mechanism here is that he cannot confront them so of course they snap in upon him when he invents few the first problem he had visiblymoves away from him this last is now demonstration not process because of the create factor the fastest current process is tell your problem what part of that problem have you been responsible for this is an alternate question process you will find the problem changes and changes it runs the whole case general process on problems which is very healthy process is what problem have you been or might you have been responsible for the easiest process on problems to run if slower is tell your problem what part of that problem could you confront confusion and the stable datum problems are nasty case stickers because in problem one has an old solution causing new problems this is the principle of confusion and the stable datum the confusion two or more opposed views or actions stays in position because it is hung on single fixed point if you want to see pc go into confusion ask him what solution he could confront this is not good process its demonstration preclear is sometimes chary of motion in the bank he seizes upon fixed particles to avoid moving particles very top scale process that does some fabulous things to pc also illustrates this what motion have you been responsible for this truly sets bank whizzing particularly black cases or stuck picture cases running this it is possible to discharge pc liability to problems the dual universe the basic unit of this universe is two not one the less pc can confront two things the more he fixes on one this is the highly individual person also the selfauditing case this is probably the basic trap of thetan he is single unit that has not cared to confront dual units and is therefore subject to the persistence of all dual things as he does not seem to care as much for two as he does for one that which is not admired tends to persist and we have persisting dual universe also when he is with somebody else he tends to confront the other person but not to confront himself what about you could you confront is murderous process it is all right to run it picks up the times when his attention was off self and yet self was creating this is the genus of reactive bank it is probably what pain is however better and more spectacular process that demonstrates this and gets to the heart of problems is what two things can you confront this increases ability and reduces ones liability to problems i suppose one could go gradiently up in number and have at last pc that could tolerate any motion or number it is quantity not quality which makes bank thus running significances is of little worth thetan gets ideas of too many and too few he cannot have at length anything that becomes too scarceone of the old important rules of havingness given in scientology 8 8008 out of sessiona pc is in session when he is willing to talk to the auditor and b he is interested in his own case the primary violation of part is overts and withholdsthe pc is afraid to talk or talks to cover up the second violation b occurs when the pcs attention is over there in present time fixed on some concern that is right now somewhere in the physical universe technically present time problem is special problem that exists in the physical universe now on which the pc has his attention fixed this violates the in session rule part b the pcs attention is over there not on his case if the auditor overlooks or doesnt run the ptp then the pc is never in session grows agitated arc breaks etc and gains are made because the pc is not in session hence the unchanged graph when the pc has ptp that is overlooked or not properly handled ptps are easy to handle if you the auditor become impatient at having to waste time handling ptp or if the pc considers it waste of time to handle it mistake is being made so long as ptp falls on meter even slightly it had better be handled until it longer falls when checked if the same type of ptp keeps coming up use it as case assessment and run it outout out as given above using ow and responsibility and if the pc always has problems better note he also has motionless pictures is only one and selfaudits heavily and get him used to motion and two particles as given in processes above and hell be better case very soon indeed l ron hubbard lrh jsrd copyright 1960 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 7 april 1960 franchise hldrs all staff auditors note hco secs send to every certified auditor in your area new summary of auditing this bulletin is the first major breakthrough in processing in 1960 it is new statement of processing you will appreciate in ten years the chief thing which needed improvement in the dissemination of dianetics and scientology was more and faster processing results good result in processing depends on two things the workability of the technical process and b the ability of the auditor to apply processing to preclear the bulk of my own work for ten years then has been on these two things however you should not make mistake in thinking that the first released processes did not work as processes book one engram running as any old time dianeticist can tell you works engram running from away back works so well that i probably would not have advanced auditing technically to any degree if people at large had been able to apply book one engram running as given in 1950 personally i have rarely failed to resolve case and bring it to happy conclusion solely with engram running i would have gone on researching to resolve the mystery of life but not to improve auditing if majority of auditors had been able to get excellent results alas or happily there were too many cases that didnt change when audited by some auditors and so i tied further researches on life with the development of processes most auditors could handle and with which they could obtain spectacular results rather easily i do not say that to condemn auditors only to show the why of further processes the basic impulse behind the release of new processes they make it easier to do it faster and they reach the few cases we now and then failed to reach before for long long long time ive felt we have been there i have wanted it to be positive enough so that all auditors could experience being there at process level training is better and easier theory today goes light years beyond what i would have considered as necessary years ago processes reach even unconscious people but in all this wealth of technology we still have the problem of auditor application here is an example in spring 1959 i gave the exact way to handle coaudit group london hpa and 6th london acc tapes to obtain maximum results i had learned the instructor was the auditor to each pc in the room each case was assessed by him each person run by him on via of the coaudit auditor here and there i hear of coaudit losing people i hear of an instructor saying i only have to look in on them the coaudit people once in while during an evening and i hear of spectacularly spectacular coaudit group fully successful severalclears in fact where the only thing that was done was the exact duplication of the london hpa and acc instructions now do you see what i mean by processing results depending upon the auditor coauditing in groups was wrapped up complete in the spring of 1959 the task now is to get it adhered to so there will be more clears whole year later we are just starting to win on this the programme of research may present myriad of new data it has not changed certain fundamentals about auditing it has not changed the exact way to make clear lets not lose sight of these facts the first and foremost rule of auditing is find something the preclear can do and process him to improve that ability lot of auditors audit quite oppositely and fail here and there and say they dont know why the auditor finds what is wrong with the pc and tries to remedy it that has nothing to do with the goal of auditing thats q and with the pcs bank the pc thinks something is wrong with him and restrains himself all you have to do to make pc clear is to help him build his confidence back in the things about him that are right to clear pc all you have to do is give him or her series of wins he or she realizes are wins the 1947 scale of wins was this get pc to have pictures by any device get the pc to erase light locks get the pc to be more and more able to handle gradiently heavier bits of bank when pc was fully confident pc was clear that wasnt all by the way thats been overlooked in clearing read the book one clear definition again of course as time has gone on we have been more and more articulate i have found ways to say things found ways to describe things that i thought everybody knew i have erred consistently in overestimating understanding i seek to remedy that by stating things more clearly i feel i am winning on this but there are certain things i myself find very hard to understand among these is how i can run any engram flat in few hours unless its overt has to be run first and that some auditors take 50 to 75 hours to flatten an engram how is that well im sure i dont know unless it is as follows all you have to do to run an engram is first get the pc accustomed to his bank and track by various mild processes get him under good control contact the least incident necessary to resolve the case and flatten it well thats it to flatten an incident dianetically you only erase it to flatten it scientologically you run it until pc has it back again fully and is total cause over it you run it after it has erased to accomplish all this apply the rule in capitals above auditing tricks are necessary unless you have thrown the pc in over his head without gradient approach to the bank recently i had some auditors complain that they were being forced using ot3a to start at step one on new pcs when auditor discretion should be used as to what step should be first taken and what was auditor discretion throw the pc in over his head i guess new pcs deserve at least some recall process to start out the rule i audit by is the one in caps above by gradients i recover for the pc confidence in handling himself at length analytical handling replaces reactive handlinghere are the first winning sessions on two pcs and the point of first win on each pc 1952 pictures all unreal suicidal now most people would have tackled the suicidal trait or some such this pc had had at least 200 hours on engrams results i found pc had an allergy to milk by using think processes i managed to get expanded gita run without creating mock ups think how you could waste milk etc the pc was able to drink milk after that big win pc made steady gains of like nature afterwards the pc could drink water that was an ability i made the pc able to drink milk too pc b 1959 pc never before audited and had mysterious field relief or release on scouting the present life change got the pc to describe field found it was window ran what part of that picture could you be responsible for for half an hour with pcs only response i could be responsible for looking out of this window then suddenly all shifted pc got big kinesthetic of jumping into his car and tearing off in it we stopped right there pc had big win felt there was change felt he could be helped by auditing the indicated procedure after was to run responsibility on anything pc saw in the bank until he was in present time with his pictures and then little by little accustom him to locks secondaries and engrams win every time until he was clear clearing is qualitative return of confidence in self not quantitative handling of bank by returning confidence one achieves clearing in short while by the quantity approach one drags the hours out endlessly since theres an endless supply of engrams the regained ability to handle one fully is better than ploughing through thousand briefly well some day somebody will hear and well have lots of clears theres also this matter of having session going before we tackle bank for the pc is always tackling his bank out of session and doesnt recover so there must be session if he tackles his bank and does recover session depends mostly on these conditions 1 pc willing to be helped by auditor or as in an unconscious pc unable to prevent being helped 2 pc under auditors control to the extent of doing the process 3 pc willing to talk freely to the auditor 4 pc interested in own case and 5 auditor welltrained enough to handle session form properly then and only then can we begin the gradient approach of recovering pcs confidence in analytically handling himself and abandoning his reactive withholds and restraints and self imposed barriers to accomplish 1 above run two way help even an alcoholic bum antagonistic and vicious will come around eventually on two way help more or less twoway commed until it is running like process how could you help how could i help youthose are the magic words on the reluctant or unwilling pc eventually the pc becomes willing to be under the auditors control to accomplish 2 above it is sometimes necessary to run you make that body sit in that chair or you make that body stand still or both for long time pc doing command each time before control exists sufficient to run scs these can be big wins for pc to do 3 above the auditor can run think of something you could tell think of something you might withhold from until the emeter arm dives pc will eventually talk if the pc was under control enough to do the process to accomplish 4 we have only to be lengthy in discussing the aspirations and upsets of the pcs life to accomplish 5 we should have started long time ago to give pc big wins we tackle small targets open up the recalls with cause arc straight wire and what would you be willing to forget erase and put back lock erase and put back moment of pain stubbed toe cut finger erase and put back secondary erase and put back minor engram erase and put back rougher overt engram do every little job well handle every session well finish what you start if pc goes greasy on the track and skids return to control processes via 1 to 4 above then win up some more wins straighten up women and men and other terminals with ows do what you like but keep it heavier than pc can win with give him wins not cavedin bank sometimes you have to patch up whole case that was long ago flubbed go at it just as above and then run out the first engram that pc was ever thrown into and then run out that auditor this is the basic philosophy of auditing the main reason any auditor has lost on case is his misunderstanding of his approach he knows whats wrong with the pc and attacks it and the pc loses before he wins the only thing wrong with pc is his lack of confidence in handling himself without hurting others so he creates disabilities which automatically restrain him from making the same mistakes again try to relieve those disabilities without returning confidence to the pc and you are liable to lose every time it would help you if you made up chart for each pc and checked it off each session 1 pc still willing to be helped 2 pc under control and executing every command 3 pc willing to talk to 4 pc interested in own case 5 i am following model session exactly 6 pc havingness is up 7 pc is having wins if you check these off every time before session you wont miss and youll know what to tackle if the intensive is not going too well the answers are there in those seven points not in startling new departure in processes look i want you to have even more wins than you are havingim not really growling about it ill even concede ive never said it so succinctly before or lined it up so smoothly but study it well wont you it contains the whole secret of auditing we want more clears whip up some more wont you l ron hubbard lrhjscden copyright 1960 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 21 april 1960 franchise hldrs presession processes have you ever wondered how to persuade stranger to get audited have you ever had to sell hostile family member scientology before you could audit someone have you ever had trouble auditing anyone well youll be pleased to know that these problems have been vanquished by some material ive developed you seei do think of you presession processes are new idea they were hinted at in hco bulletin april 7 1960 but theres more to it presession process is process that is used to get into session stranger who isnt receiving well b person antagonistic to scientology c person who arc breaks easily in session d person who makes few gains in session person who relapses after being helped f person who makes gains in auditing g person who having been audited refuses further auditing h any person being audited as checkoff before session aloud to pc or silently by auditor presession processes parallel in importance the auditing of unconscious people but i feel they have wider use and will assist dissemination enormously as well as improve graph gains these processes are four in number they are designed as classes of processes to handle these four points 1 help factor 2 control factor 3 pc communication factor 4 interest factor unless these four points are present in session it is improbable in great number of cases that any real lasting gain will be made this is old data it is new data to consider these as presession points before one has pc in session he cannot really run model session or any session at all the usual struggle is to start session and then try to start session by having the pc go into session this is confusion of long standing and leads auditors to run processes like the cchs when they could be running higher processes the cchs are often necessary but not necessary on pc who could be put into session easily and could then run higher level processes for faster gainsthe only thing this changes about model session hco bulletin february 25 1960 is the start if pc is in the auditing room and auditing is to be attempted then one starts not tone 40 but formal we are going to begin auditing now the auditor then goes over his check list and ticks off the presession points 1 2 3 4 and satisfied goes into the rudiments and carries forward model session naturally if he wants to put the pc into session with pre session processes when the pc is finally in session we would startle him out with tone 40 start pc who is running extraordinarily well and making fast gains should be checked over silently at beginning and then given start tone 40 as in the model session and the auditor proceeds at once to rudiments but this would be used only after the pc was really getting along new pc or new to the auditor should be presessioned as above for many sessions presession type of session might find the auditor not satisfied with more than the first two of the four points by session end if so end the session easily with location of pcs attention on the room and simply end it by saying so while many processes may be developed out of the four classes of help control communication and interest it is certain that these classes will remain stable since these four are vital to auditing itself and imply wrongness in the pc all other known factors of life and the mind can be handled by session and improved but these fourhelp control communication and interestare vital to auditing itself and without them auditing doesnt happen one or more of these four items was awry in every pc who one did not take auditing two on whom gains were poor or slow and three who failed to complete auditing so you see that is number of pcs and the presession processes are the important remedy why make the same error again one of my jobs is to improve auditing results this may be as you may find the biggest single step in that direction since book one since it includes them all the auditor can cause help control communication and interest rather than hope they will come to pass as such these four factors are practically clubs i would almost rather not give you some processes to fit these four conditions i certainly desire you to be free in inspecting understanding and employing them what great art could arise from this innocent scientific quartet i would rather you used them as maestro rather than play sheet music how adroit how clever how subtle we could become with them example of what i mean grouchy car salesman knows that anything scientologist friend bill takes up is rot hates people scientologist approaches gets scoff at bills enthusiasms scientologist handles help dont you think people can be helped lazy argument all very casual car salesman finally wins by losing utterly he concedes something or someone could help him another day scientologist approaches asks car salesman to move here and there do this and that all by pretending interest in cars really its 8c all casual salesman wins again by losinganother day scientologist gets on subject of communication with car salesman finally salesman concedes he doesnt mind telling scientologist about his shady deals does salesman wins and so does scientologist another day scientologist gets car salesman to see pictures or blackness by any smooth conversation salesman becomes interested in getting his flat feet fixed up negative result one scoffer less positive result one new pc any way you handle them the deadly quartet must be present before auditing or even interest in scientology can exist talk about john wellington wells the scientologist can weave even greater magical spells with help control communication and interest talk to new club what about help of course get them to agree they could be helped or could help and when they ask you to come back talk about good and bad control and when they want you again its communication you stress and interest of course when you give that talk will find you ready people in scientology everybody wins its the only game in which everyone does with these four factors you cant lose and neither can they as scientologist you know several processes under each heading its establishing each point in turn thats important ah what shock youll get on some pc when you find he wasnt ever interested in his own case he was getting audited for his wife youll only find that out if you get the three forerunners flat first processes on processes under help you have twoway comm about help twoway help help in brackets dichotomies of canhelp canthelp rising scale on help lots of forms on control you have twoway comm tr 5 you make that body sit in that chair cch 2 oldtime 8c object scs scs etc etc on communication you have twoway comm recall time you communicated etc but much more basically twoway comm to get off overts ow on the auditor think of something you have done to somebody think of something you have withheld from somebody with occasional anything you would like to tell when meter acts up nothing helps communication like getting off fundamental overts that would keep pc out of session or arc with auditor thats the point of this step whether done casually in drawing room or in an auditing room surely mrs screamstack you cant sit there and tell that unlike the rest of the human race you have never done single wrong thing in your whole life well thats one way to knock apart case at formal dinner party interest is the place where your knowledge of the mind comes into heavy play but note that this is number four how often have we used it for number one and flopped that was because the correct one was missing to say nothing of two and three i can see you now trying to interest family member with four without teaching on the first three why ive done it myself just like youi audited an official of government after dinner party for two hopeless hours one night he knew hed been run over but he surely was sparkling result i shamefully and vividly recall now that not touched by his idea of help was to kill off the whole human race the first steps of ot3a will gain interest from almost anyone even the black fives will get confounded when they find what state their recalls are in and then and then follow gradient scale of gain find something the pc can do and improve it when the four points the deadly quartet are covered we have the rudiments and they must cover facts not glibitity after the four points you improve the case by gradient scales and you keep the four points established summary if it takes you hundred hours to establish the four points of sessioning youll still win faster because you will win if it takes only two hours the first time you do them on pc feel lucky be thorough establish the four points use model session follow course in processing of finding something the pc knows he can do and improve that ability and youll have clears and if your use of the deadly quartet becomes as adroit and smooth as i think it will we will have this planet licked and be scouting the stars before were too much older at last weve created the basic weapon in scientology dissemination and processing that makes us lot more effective on earth than lot of drooling politicians scrubbing their hands around an atomic warhead by golly they better watch out now but dont tell them just run 1 help 2 control 3 communication and 4 interest now go tackle somebody who wouldnt buy scientologyuse the deadly quartet and win l ron hubbard lrh jsrd copyright 1960 by l

richard m nixon will enter his name this fall at convention as citizen aspiring to the presidency of the united states many scientologists think he is all right because i once quoted him this is very far from the facts and i hasten to give you the real story why richard m nixon must be prevented at all costs from becoming president two years ago in washington this mans name appeared in newspaper article as uttering an opinion about psychology i called attention to this opinion as matter of banal interest in an article shortly two members of the united states secret service stating they had been sent directly by nixon entered the establishment of the founding church of washington dc armed with pistols but without warrant or formal complaint and with foul and abusive language threatened the girls on duty there hulking over desks shouting violently they stated that they daily had to make such calls on lots of people to prevent nixons name from being used in ways nixon disliked these two men stated they were part of nixons office and were acting on his express orders they said that nixon believed in nothing the founding church or scientology stood for their conduct before the ladies present was so intolerable that mary sue having heard the shouting and curses from her office had to come and force these men to leave which they finally did but only after she threatened to call the police as scientologists were present much information was obtained of course from these agents as to their routine activities these were not creditable nixon constantly used the service against the voteless and helpless people of washington to suppress the use of his name i am informing you of an exact event it convinced that in my opinion nixon is not fitted to be president i do not believe any public figure has right to suppress the use of his name in articles i do not believe public figure should enforce his will on writers or organizations by use of the secret service i believe democracy ceases to exist when deprived of freedom of speech i do not believe any man closely connected with psychiatry should hold high public office since psychiatry has lent its violence to political purposes would you please write your papers and tell your friends that nixon did this and that his actions against private people in washington cause us to defy his cravings to be president its my hope youll vote and make your friends vote but please dont vote for nixon even his own secret service agents assure us he stands for nothing we do i do not tell you this because mary sue came close to serious injury at nixons hands i tell you this because i think psychiatry and all fascistcommie forces have had their day we want clean hands in public office in the united states lets begin by doggedly denying nixon the presidency matter what his secret service tries to do to us now inwashington it is better far better for us to run the risk of saying this now while theres still chance than to fail to tell you of it for fear of reprisals and then be wiped out without defence by the secret service or other agency if nixon became president he hates us and has used what police force was available to him to say so so please get busy on it i am only telling few friends l ron hubbard lrhjsrd copyright 1960 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill

in distribution the remainder of these facts are true matter what you do with an organization matter how much writing of letters you do the dissemination success of group will not accomplish any security unless books are distributed seeing to it that the newly interested person is provided with the proper reading materials is far more important step than most hco secs and pe directors have realized but these are not the worst offenders the field auditor attempting to run group and keep afloat fails most often when he does fail in the book department making sure that interested people get books is making sure that they will continue their interest assuring then they will read and understand the books it is necessary to get them into an extension course if you think you can interest person in scientology and yet avoid your responsibility in getting him or her to read books on the subject you are wasting tremendous amount of effort do you know why the first book dianetics the modern science of mental health was written word of mouth on dianetics was going forward so rapidly that my letter volume even before the first book was startling each one of these people expected either to write them long letter and tell them what it was all about or to be given chance to come and see so that i could tell them personally what it was all about in other words my time was going to be consumed not in further research but in writing letters and talking to people my answer to this was to write dianetics the modern science of mental health which rapidly informed the newly interested person what this new science was all about i will make you wager i think you are wasting most of your time answering questions which are answered in books i think you are talking yourself hoarse to friends and other people and groups explaining over and over and over things that are already taken up in books i think your time is being devoured by attempts to reach through the natural conversational barriers of people you are not giving i am sure the newly interested person an opportunity to go and sit down quietly by himself without any social strain and study book on the subject only in this way will he come to decision about the subject which is his own independent decision having inspected the materials this has to be done quietly and it is best done through the pages of book without any reservations i can tell you that dianetics the modern science of mental health based as it is upon mental image pictures and energy masses those things which are most real to people is the best forward vanguard in our possession it waswritten at time when i was very interested in bridging the gap between an uninformed public and an informed public and contains in it most of the arguments necessary to quiet the suspicions of the newly interested person and contains as well most of the answers to that persons questions dianetics the modern science of mental health contains today perfectly workable therapy but more importantly it contains bridge between the uninformed and the informed public on the subject of scientology if you are not furiously pushing dianetics the modern science of mental health and if you are not insisting that each newly interested person read it as something new startling and strange in the world you will be wasting most of your dissemination efforts oddly enough this book to this day sells more copies around the world than the average best seller in any given year where it has been pushed scientology is booming where it has not been pushed scientology is limp just inspect the number of simple startling items in dianetics the modern science of mental health here you find the dynamics here you find several of the earliest axioms here you even find the rudimentary arc tone scale you find as well thoroughly accurate description of clears and the reactive mind do you realize that the world does not yet know anything about the reactive mind here is the total answer to freuds subconscious here is the resolution of most of the problems of psychotherapy you know so many things that are new and wonderful and strange that you forget that bill and joe and mary have never heard of any part of them they are not interested in past lives they are interested in what makes them do strange and peculiar things they have heard vaguely about the tenets of psychology they do not know that these have all been answered in dianetics the modern science of mental health when people are asking you questions about dianetics and scientology matter how obtuse or abstruse the questions are your best answer to these questions was my earliest answer and that was read dianetics the modern science of mental health and that will answer your question in the last hco bulletin i gave you presession processes this makes complete cycle with presession processes we can take new person and by running the course of help control communication and interest put him in frame of mind to want to know more about the subject in this bulletin i am trying to tell you what to do about the person once you have brought him up to this point it is all right for you to go on and audit him but i assure you he will never get anywhere until he has read dianetics the modern science of mental health all the questions and counter arguments and upsets which are boiling through his mind now are answered in that book bringing him up to point where he wants auditing where he successfully goes through pe give him auditing let him coaudit do anything you want with him but insist insist insist that he reads dianetics the modern science of mental health you would be completely amazed at the ideas some people have of scientology even after they have gone through pe course and have read problems of work or some other manual pushed off on them simply because it is cheap problems of work is all right and should be distributed but it is not informative on the subject of the human mindlets get down to basics here and see what we have really done we have made breakthrough the moment of the breakthrough is recorded at public level with dianetics the modern science of mental health if people do not read this book they just will not have broken through any sales tricks you employ after you have succeeded by use of help control communication and interest in arousing that interest to get them now to inform themselves of the moment of breakthrough will be well expended by you otherwise these people will be talking through fog and will experience sensation of having been brought up to some high plateau without having climbed cliff it is factual that you can bring person all the way to clear and have on your hands mentally illiterate person i know because i have done just that all the clears i made twelve to thirteen years ago evaporated into the society i did them great deal of good some of them are now occupying high positions but none of them have ever associated and my work in dianetics and scientology with what happened to them they are for the most part convinced that what i did was some fabulously magical thing which was done for them only and for them especially something like spiritual revival but nothing to be understood these people never did gain that understanding because i never explained to them what was happening it was only after dianetics the modern science of mental health was written and distributed that we began to get somewhere in the world people we processed might have been led to worry more about their own cases than those i processed but at the same time their worrying was at least intelligent i can still clear people with the technologies of twelve and thirteen years ago and indeed have been carefully reintroducing you to these technologies now the time has come for us to realize that there are very close to two and half billion people on this planet who are mentally illiterate they do not know what makes them tick they have concept whatsoever of the basis of human reaction they are intolerant they are at war with one another they follow strange leaders and wind up in strange places they have hope that anything will ever dig them out only minute percentage of these people have ever been introduced to dianetics the modern science of mental health do not believe for moment that just because i wrote book on the subject cases became harder as matter of fact they became more cooperative we are making great many clears today hardly week passes on my correspondence lines without clears being reported but look at the mental illiteracy even of some auditors do you know that people report clears and call them releases these people have never studied the definition and capabilities of clear in dianetics the modern science of mental health they bring preclears up to this standard find there is considerable distance to go and start striking for thetaclear before they say anybody is clear you yourself may have made clear and classified the clear as release just because you were not totally familiar with the conditions of clear i still think the best statement of clear occurred in dianetics the modern science of mental health i have had reason to revise that statement pushed at however by many scientologists i have tried to find way stops between clear as defined in dianetics the modern science of mental health and ot there are quite few i almost laughed in somebodys face the other day when he said to that notable person on one central organizations staff was being audited by him and that he had gotten her up to state of release with free needle on anything you asked her and added that he would soon have her clear if he kept working at it concerning the same person visitors at that central organization for some time have been saying she has sort of feeling about her as though she might be clear the truth of the matter is she has been clear for several months but her auditor is straining so hard seeing as he does how far human capability can be made to reach that it has never occurred to him that he has passed clear some time back any pc that has relatively free needle has probably been cleared by the standards laid down in dianetics the modern science of mental health now that we can interest people lets take the next inevitable step lets push this book lets crowd it into peoples hands and demand that they buy it lets develop the trick when they ask us complicated questions of stating that they should read dianetics the modern science of mental healthafter all we have brand new science in the world dianetics the modern science of mental health is brand new book that describes it at public level and it is good thing if you want to get people into house to get them to come in the front door the front door we have is dianetics the modern science of mental health i personally do not believe the book could ever be written again since it was written at time when i was well aware of the public arguments concerning the mind for the indifferently literate person it forms the necessary bridge from knowing nothing to knowing something it is an exciting book push it get your people to read it now lets get going if you cause cards to be printed concerning the whereabouts of pe courses always add to them to know more about this subject read dianetics the modern science of mental health available at give the place the greatest scientific development in this century has happened to all central orgs push this book with every possible display and mention where you find people have not bought it in your central files youll find interest has been lagging play down all other pe books display dianetics the modern science of mental health as the book they must now buy tell them so during the breaks dianetics the modern science of mental health answers your questions unlimited stocks are available at hco ww and even more are already printed and being bound now in new zealand for nz australian and south african shipment order all southern hemisphere stock of dianetics the modern science of mental health through hco ww weve lost the people in maze of many titles take down all your many book displays concentrate on one dianetics the modern science of mental health i am asking australia for instance to have huge wooden book dianetics the modern science of mental health erected on their marquee and spotlighted we can absorb the worlds confusion on one stable datum lets do it l ron hubbard lrh jsrd copyright 1960 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 29 april ad10 auditors of south africa the scientific treatment of the insane the insanity rate per capita in south africa is appalling through the papers and reports of peggy conway and other sources it is easily seen that primary requisite in any programme of the rehabilitation of the bantu in south africa would be mental health any race which lives in poverty is already overwhelmed by bad food and disease without adding insanity amongst its familial units for instance white family in the united states which has amongst its number one insane person is crippled economically through concern and confusion in family already burdened by the environment one insane or even neurotic person could become the back breaking straw however my records show and will have to do until i can make closer survey myself that the number of insane and neurotic persons runs much higher than amongst comparable populations the subject has not been studied well probably because native customs or tribal characteristics are too often advanced as an explanation of irrational conduct true there are native customs and tribal characteristics but it would take scientologist to separate out the ethnic factors and understand the remainder as neurosis and psychosis malnutrition and anxiety in any person as we well know can produce all the symptoms of insanity having studied twelve separate primitive peoples in far flung parts of earth in this life it has become obvious that when state of primitiveness is veneered by white customs the incidence of insanity rises amongst the primitives for example the american indian when he lost his tribal lands and hunting diet turned to alcoholism and other degraded forms of insanity the whites then adjudicated these as characteristics of the indian rather than insanity any race which is seeking survival under adjusted conditions experiences high incidence of mental illness the keynote of insanity is destructive efforts on various dynamics it is doubtful if anyone has realized the part insanity has played in various disturbances nor how it has prevented the bettering of various conditions in the world mental health real programme of mental health is vital to the public peace and public safety here we have hardworking man trying to adjust trying to hold his head up at home he has wife too neurotic to help teenage that has gone the route of criminal insanity father who has taken to drink all of them hanging upon his work and pay its rough trying to remain steady hardworking and sane under such conditions the temptation to quit is strong before populace can be credit it must have some hope it can live through itand insanity is the biggest threat to that hope yet insanity in any population is not limited to the poor indeed the incidence of insanity in the united states is as high in the very rich as it is amongst the very poorreal mental health which the scientologist can accomplish as the practitioner of the only validated psychotherapy in the world today would reduce the statistics south africa lately suffered from insane havenots and even worse at the hands of an insane have insanity is problem that is both legal and scientific criminal is in fact insane terrorist is insane people can be policed only so far the insane as we know so well on scientific level are so far from being policed that they cannot follow the simplest order insanity is neither hard to understand or treat but only scientology could say this insanity divides into eight general types these are easily plotted they are irrationally destructive or succumb impulses on each dynamic assign the tone scale to each type and you have all the insanities there are the cure of insanity is accomplished in its deeper stages by very light and careful handling person has to be brought up to the level of being processed the first step is rest the second step is mild exercise the third step is group processing above this level processing is possible the cost of treatment is not high if undertaken sensibly but 1 9th century practitioners who knew little about it got on compulsive do and failing with milder methods resorted to brutality fortunately such practices are now fading out under our influence rest camps and hospitals would do more for insanity than all the violence in the world but only scientologist would be wise enough to refuse to q and with the violence of insanity by using violence to cure it scientology could handle the problem of insanity in south africa only when insanity has been handled could there be broad guarantees of calm future what is riot but third dynamic insanity the tremendous work done by peggy conway bless her in her surveys and contacts now comes to great use without in any way transgressing we have already formed programme on this we must legally establish ourselves support the government in its desire to handle this problem and coordinate our efforts the government and the population need our help and if we help we will bring order in our sphere of activity we will be wearing our own hats i am in deadly earnest about our role in public peace it is not political but technical and as such we have peers all we need to work on at the moment is getting people convinced of the truth that we can help the situation and that only we can help in this sphere so here we go are you with l ron hubbard lrh dmnm copyright 1960 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 5 may 1960 all fran auditors assoc secs hco secs help we have known for some time the importance of the button help it is first and foremost amongst the key buttons of scientology thoroughly clearing help alone and on back track terminals has made clears in an essay published on the otherwise unpublished students manual i stressed the fact that unless the preclear and the auditor had help straightened out they were not not likely to make very much progress help is the key button which admits auditing the remaining buttons of control communication and interest give us session but ill we cannot even start presessioning with any other button than help since the winter of 195758 when this was used in an american acc i have been working with this trying to get better understanding of it for you it now appears that help is the makebreak point between sanity and insanity that person cannot accept help along some minor line does not mean that he is insane but it certainly means he has some neurotic traits the inference level of this condition of aberration on the subject of help would be fear of dependency this means that help has already gone wrong with the person we see in children occasionally an enormous striving to be selfreliant we ordinarily applaud this but if we inspect the child carefully we will find that resistance to being helped goes along with an obsession to help parents themselves disbelieving that the child can help them usually inhibit the childs help and thus worsen the condition i have seen one child go downhill to normal by reason of thwarting of help by the parents but matter how fondly the psychologist used to believe in the nineteenth century that childhood was good pattern to use for estimating future social conduct we in scientology know that the child has already become aberrated on the subject before it is manifested in this light my examinations have now led to the conclusion that person has makebreak point of sanity on any given subject this point is help on the tone scale it would compare at 20 for any dynamic the whole index of personality could be adjudicated by an examination of the persons reactions to various types of help above this point person can help and can be helped providing of course the help is sincere and really is help below this point help becomes betrayal help is always betrayal to thoroughly aberrated person this explains great deal to us when we understand it the first example that comes readily to notice is the reaction of very low scale pc undergoing auditing he invariably thinks and may even sometimes tell the auditor that the auditor has not helped him but betrayed him all auditing protests except those against flagrant breaches of code denote breakdown of the help button in the auditing session while it does good to run help on preclear and continue while running it to repeat flagrant code breaks it does do great deal of good to clarify the whole subject of help if session seems to be full of arc breaks matter what the auditor tries to do to patch them upit is unfortunately true that help can be as wrong with the auditor as it can be with the preclear where we have uncleared people doing auditing however it has been my experience that even while some of their efforts were completely knuckleheaded practically auditors exist who are not sincerely trying to help the preclear the trouble comes about when the preclear clips the effort of the auditor into the category of betrayal this makes the auditor react against the preclear and the situation deteriorates we have in the immediate past of this civilization the deterioration of several of the practices which began as sincere effort to help and which are not now classifiable as anything better than betrayal psychiatry and medicine are both good examples of this the person who goes to psychiatrist usually finds himself betrayed he does not receive help he receives brutality in the form of electric shocks brain surgery and other degrading experiences even in the highest form of psychiatry it was common advice for the psychiatrist to tell the wife that the best cure for her troubles was to betray her husband and vice versa the psychiatrist was caught in this helpbetrayal deterioration psychiatry had so long attempted to help the insane without success that at last they began to q and with their patients of course to an insane patient help is always betrayal medicine is now going similar course unwittingly and has lost most of its public repute through not having stayed on research line that would bring medicine upscale but continued with line of application which considered man body and would not consider him anything else considering person to be hunk of meat is sort of betrayal in itself naturally one betrays thetan when he regards the thetan as piece of meat world war two pretty well saw the end of the last dregs of sincere help in psychiatry most governments involved in the war employed psychiatry it now turns out for political purposes they were set very good example by one hitler thus the last embers of sincere help in psychiatry were more or less extinguished nothing like this would happen in scientology because we are dealing with basic truths rather than basic ambitions where ambition becomes greater than truth any sphere of activity goes to pieces indeed in the final analysis that is the fundamental deterioration of the track another excellent example is found in the maumau uprising in kenya the terrorists killed only twenty whites as compared to thousands of natives but the whites they chose to kill were only those who had sought to help them the kikuyu was evidently completely certain that anyone seeking to help him was only betraying him their reaction then in killing their best friends becomes more understandable the action remains insane but in their frame of reference it was entirely comprehensible any time we go about the task of handling large bodies of insane people or illiterate and fearful native populaces we would do well to keep in mind the importance of this help button realizing that to these help is totally betrayal the thing to betray is this helpbetrayal identification not the people if you sort this out and find your own examples and see whether or not it holds true for you i think you have small gasp of relief coming to you scientologist has been without preclear who has not become absolutely certain somewhere in the course of auditing that the entire goal of the auditor was to betray this left one hanging with an unsolved riddle our own sincerity was beyond question how to be misinterpreted this wildly was so incomprehensible that we often assigned the reasons to ourselves perhaps some of these reasons did lie with ourselves nevertheless in the final analysis the only thing we did wrong was not to clear the help button with the preclear clearing help there are many ways to clear the help button as this is the first step on presessioning it may be that the button has to be cleared several times in the course of auditing the first thing to do is to put the preclear on meter if you dont have good meter and you dont know what meter does order one fast and get instruction discuss help with thepreclear and note the needle reactions if the needle tended to stiffen and stick on any discussion of help then you have your work set out for you if the needle remains free and continues to be free on the subject of help matter what you run or how you discuss it of course the button remains free it is important that any attack you make upon this button be continued as presession activity for auditing period after auditing period if necessary until the meter needle is free on this subject there is need to go on in fact there is point in going on if the preclear thinks that you are going to betray somewhere this will manifest itself as arc breaks the whole auditing programme will go to pieces and you will wind up without preclear as well as an unfinished cycle of action so pay attention to what i tell you here where auditing is concerned work with help and nothing but help until the needle is free on the subject what processes should you run the first process of course is ordinary twoway comm one discusses the preclear helping others and others helping the preclear one gets the preclears views on the subject of help and without evaluating for the preclear lets the preclear express these views the next process is help on twoway bracket this is how could you help alternated with how could i help you do not expect this to do very much to the tone arm because it wont twoway flow of this character is not reliable way to bring tone arm down but it does do something and does tend to free up the needle on this particular subject the old fiveway bracket on help can then be employed how could you help another person how could another person help another person how could another person help you how could you help how could i help you this is rough bracket but it is useful and should not be dropped out of the repertoire is there any process which would clear up the help button thoroughly and totally naturally since it moved forward again into such importance i have been doing work on it and have developed up to stage of conditional application which means i leave myself free to change my mind when broad experience has been gained new way of loosening up any solution i have been applying this to the central buttons in scientology and have found it working the general formula is to take the button one wants to clear and ask the pc what problem certain solution could be to him applying this to help one would repetitively ask the pc what problem could help be to you i first used this on the button responsibility with very good results since i found that responsibility is very aberrated in its reactive definitions and because one is often being valence is run irresponsibly this version of running responsibility to flat point seems to be quite workable if the preclear is inventing answers rather than picking them up off the track you might do better to ask him the following version what problem has help been to you if invention was present one always has the remedy in spite of the fact that terminal is apparently present of running what help could you confront what help would you rather not confront i dont know how far this would go as i have not tested it over long period but at least in its first stages it works responsibility oddly enough can be run on nomass terminal or significance i have not had much chance to test out confront but on the theory that anything you could run responsibility on you could also run confront on i would say at first glance this is probably workable process i will know more about it soon and i would appreciate your telling anything you have on ityou have therefore several processes by which help can be flattened unfortunately none of these processes reach an unconscious or insane person of course when i say unconscious i mean somebody with his eyes shut and when i say insane i mean somebody who is institutionalized and should be in the matter of the unconscious person you have the cchs and you also have them with the insane person to some extent however the best thing for an insane person is not processing but rest and when the person has had considerable rest still processing is not yet the answer exercise is and when the person has had some exercise over long period of time you will find that group processing with other insane persons is still better than individual auditing only at this time is it possible to do very much for the insane the first reason of course that one takes this approach is the auditor why attack large numbers of insane cases with individual auditing when other methods are far more economical and efficacious so long as those other methods are only rest exercise group processing hobby work and such efforts to reach the insane with help of course simply restimulate the insane idea that help is betrayal this is why psychiatry resorted to such savage and bestial treatments as shock and surgery they were up against people who apparently would not be helped thus psychiatry went into total effect this is why psychiatry failed and is in failed state today and has lost all of its public repute people have been betrayed so often on the whole track that it is wonder they get help mixed up with betrayal but help became betrayal only at those periods of the track where the dwindling spiral had been reached for any civilization even the upstanding roman by the third century ad was happily using the political mechanism of inviting all the germanic chiefs that would accept to feasts and then poisoning them after vast assurances that rome was about to help the chiefs country deterioration of help can occur on any dynamic and in any area but as i said above it occurs at the makebreak point of sanityinsanity one word on all this the preclear may be sane analytically and still react violently at times in session remember that he is reacting in session because he has been thrown into the area of his reactive mind in reactive zones and areas help is almost always betrayal thus when running rough engram do not be amazed to find the pc whom you have carefully cleared on the subject of help getting rabid about betrayal he is in the middle of an engram and of course the hard core of any engram is betrayal dont break off and start running help on him just run him on through the engram he will come out of it all right if you do your job help should be handled as presession process and should be handled well and thoroughly and if in any series of sessions the preclears idea of help apparently deterioriates you have gotten him into series of incidents where help is betrayal and he should be cleared once more as presession activity in some later session on the subject of help there are many possible processes there are many possible approaches as scientologist understanding this you should not permit yourself too far into the frame of mind of believing pc is evil or cannot be helped simply because he apparently will not be helped all pcs can be helped most pcs have aberrated ideas on the subject its up to you to take hold of these as first order of business and clean them up at least until the meter needle is free on the subject matter how many hours that takes l ron hubbard lrhjsghrd copyright 1960 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard

everywhere as the data has come in and i have had chance to view what has been happening i would say that many riddles are answered and that we are now embarked upon broad hgc pc and central org staff clearing programmes i will be talking more about this and you will see the pattern shaping so here is forecast of it from october to march i stressed security on central org staffs and heavy withholds on hgc pcs as the important point now we have broad experience with this we will continue to use it and not forget what we know about ows and we will continue to teach it dont let bad security risk near staff position ever whether you know the overt or not its enough if the needle falls badly on key questions thats it the person is not put on any post until audited dont retain on post while auditing for youll get devt and other evils on an hgc pc bad ow picture must be cleaned up before you can get too far as the first thing to do not even help bites on nonconfessed criminal such persons know their own overts were kidding ourselves if we think they dont so shake the pc down when you see wild tone arm getting the ows confessed is all you do the tone arm may not change much but the pc will stop dodging it all and you can begin help for responsibility is too steep at this stage and the pc too far down for real high auditing in other words theres prepresession stage for all staff members and wild tone arm hgc pc its not auditing really its confessional cure the analytical im afraid hell find out the pc is holding to dont run anything on it as though it were real session just shake the info out by any means or process thats enough now we begin on help two way help is probably the hottest pe process there is you can shift to that in pe but remember to get the pe coaudit team to more general form of help within couple of weeks the five way bracket would be good enough for pe complicated enough for the staff member we go from getting off few of the hotter ows to help and we run help flatflatflat any version type or kind we run help until the pc can be asked how could you help your worst enemy without registering the tiniest change on needle all we run is help any version for hours and hours we take up terminals we take up dynamic assessment but we only run help on anything we find we flatten help until you couldnt get its width with micro electronic caliper nothing else and youll hear on this for months to come the same applies to the hgc pc once the worst ows are confessed we run help in suitable versions and we run it for weeks if need be until we get needle flat free utterly calm on any help question of course if the pc cant talk sensibly at all we use the cchs remember help was the primary reason for the clears in 195758 remember at 20 there is the makebreak point help is betrayal how to help betray what is help way to do you in so we audit pcs up to 20 with other processes they blowthey dont come back the auditor yak yak yak so why run any other process if you do youll evidently lose the pc in lots and lots of cases flatten help until the pc can be helped and can help without any qualms youve learned lot about help apply it now when we have help flat well go to other things well follow up the scales of processes like this for staff member in an hco or central org ows confessed only dont employ wild tone arm help flattened control flattened communication flattened communication reestablished thoroughly by ow and responsibility havingness completely rehabilitated for an hgc pc ows confessed help flattened control flattened communication reestablished thoroughly ows and resp locks secondaries etc as per the light touch bulletin if you have to use cchs you probably are auditing somebody who shouldnt be in an hgc on an hgc pc havingness can be run on any presession type session end it up each day with an hour of look around here and find something you can have and have comfortable pc but in using havingness while presessioning before control is flat to free needle remember to make sure pc has done each command before you give the next on the field auditors and anybody who has been trained we ought to carry on programme like get ows confessed get help flatflatflat make sure they get the highest cert they trained for get them in for modern training get them validated for 1960 get them audited the rest of the way if we attack the field in that order flattening ourselves each step we take with them and taking this step by step with each new academy trainee well be clearing the field ah so you penetrate what im trying to do yes youre right ive stayed on post and not gone off hunting lions and have reresearched ten years of work and successes and have plotted out the broadest clearing programme i could practically apply i am clearing every staff member in central orgs and hcos on timed programme of few months for each step as given above youve had the first step confessed ows it worked well by the way income came way up and flubs went way down from an october of strewn wreckage we have moved to may that sees us in pretty wonderful shape organizationally income is moving up everywherecomm lines are better staffs are happier what did it the first step for staff membersows confessed and their use in establishing security in my programme just to make sure we thoroughly win ive calculated how long it takes to move new concept in its about 5 months ows info is now grass common almost everybody on staffs is aware of meter action and potential we wont forget or lose it all right we conclude this stage for staffs as of now and move into help youre going to get help for months run it pe it coaudit it hgc it staff clear on it any one of you can grasp all this in minutes but as group we have to experience it learn about it know it use it so its months now coming on help after that well move on up this is longrange clearing effort i want to see nothing but clear staff members the world around and well do it in just twenty months from now it will be done thats the timetable were five months on our way like it now when im stressing this on staff members and hgcs are hitting it hard hgc will continue to run the scale for hgc as given here on each pc you are going to hit the field auditors and the public with the subject in vogue thus youll be stressing help now until five months are up to all the people you reach of course even after that youll stress it but for five months were monomanic on it dig up the help essays in lectures and abilities use them in mags and letters get familiar with handling help talking to people about help handling help in all its phases you get clever on the subject thats all part of it youll see another resurgence in central orgs and the field just by flattening this one for five months ow doubled our success see what help does now what formidable people wed be if we had all five steps flat were already the most effective group on earth lets upgrade our own group ability so thats the programme staff member is lucky to be aboard just now has been lucky especially since autumn 1959 that was when the bell went and do not send to find for whom the bell tolls it tolls for an aberrated earth i audit you you audit the field and scientologists they audit earth is it bargain so get hot on the staff coaudit programme get hot on the pe

world can run help may not be everything that is wrong with the world but it is the only common denominator the world can understand i have known about help for some years and in 1957 autumn used it with fateful step 6 in clearing people the first clears made easily by others were done with meter assessments and fiveway help brackets on terminals it was found that step 6 being creative process was bad on some cases the clearing formula was help and step 6 we tended to abandon both when step 6 became an overt it blew us off the next big technical development was ow overtwithhold of course is as old as 1954 phoenix when reachwithdraw was introduced but the full knowledge of what overt withhold meant to cases was not released until november 1959 here came much new technical data all of it vital to clearing person with large withholds from the auditor will not go into session this is true valid and useful we could not clear many people even now without it further we find all losses in scientology personnel in central orgs and the field stem from ow in researching ow as early as december 1958 washington dc it was found and proven conclusively that it was what the person himself did to others that was aberrative not what was done to him the test of this can be made easily given an arc break between auditor and pc who have known each other some time note the position of the meter tone arm run what have you done to what have i done to you observe that after some small variation the limited value of this twoway flow which assumes the auditors bad action was half what was wrong with the pc shows up in stuck tone arm this twoway process is too limited to alter the tone arm after few minutes lie has been introduced this lie sticks the tone arm now shift to what have you done to what have you withheld from and watch the tone arm free up and eventually go toward clear reading in other words the situation freed wholly only when we assumed that only what the pc had done had any aberrative value this and other vital material learned between 1957 autumn and now was the technology necessary to do full clearing on everyone except the wholly psychotic and unconscious people where we have the cchs everything learned about ow is still necessary to clearing but everything that applied in ow also applies to running help its marvellous that fiveway bracket on help cleared people it did clear some but where it failed it ran into the rule that its only what the pc does that is aberrative what is done to him is not thus what help the pc has given and what help he has denied or failed to give are aberrative what help the pc received in the long run is not matter how the psychologists cut itthere are probably thousands of ways help could be run you can think of dozens all of them would be effective in greater or lesser degree just add help into any process form we know but the one general process on help that would rank high would be what have you helped what have you not helped alternated this is not dichotomy this is the best way i know of to run the sense of what help one has given plus what help one has withheld this is the ow version and we will call it help ow to keep ourselves oriented and not introduce too many new terms i find failure to help instantly upsets what help have you given what help have you withheld this version does not run the correct sense wording is what help have you given what help have you not given this lets the pc asis his failures to help as well as his denials of help this is only the general form think how much more we know about ow apply it to help twoway help would have use but would be limited use it know its limited fiveway bracket help would have use but would be limited use it know its limited this pair has enough power to gain more constant attendance in pe coaudit than we have had so use them in pe coaudit twoway help has just moved pe coaudit case that has been in coaudit for one year without moving on any other process twoway comm on help has value its the presession version matter who is helping who discussion of it can get the pc closer to session now here is data youve been

betrayal help is the button the world spun in on few million years ago its where we find our pc help is betrayal so there is way out scientology must be bad because help is betrayal everybody knows that so if scientologists help people then we must be betrayers weve heard it seen it but now we know what it is and can laugh quietly when people try to chew us up when they really wanted to make trap of it all it was propaganda given out that help is betrayal none must have any help lest they be betrayed so the thetans stay in their cages it is interesting how this mechanism developed the game of victim is very old it intended to arouse mercy and safeguard possessions it became trap once one believed in victims thoroughly he started to help only victims so this sequence beganone hurt another who played victim one felt sorry for the other one sought to help the other ever see professional help sponge when this was very old the action of injury became identified with the action of helping as the cycle was injure victimhelp as soon as the time gets vague in it the parts of the cycle become injuryishelp or helpisinjury it has long been true that help could be injury as common denominator out of this rose selfreliance as virtue youve known people who refused help because they were proud or self reliant well thats only the first stage of helpisinjury the second phase is not so old i think its only been reversed for the last two million years or so in this quarter of the universe the complete flip is not an identification of help with injury but disassociation complete dispersal on the subject howtoinjure becomes help this is betrayal with the intention to injure one offers help to create dependence on something disguised which on use becomes injurious it is this psychotic action which finalized the trap as trap dont dare accept any help because it is only an effort to betray is the fixed idea which has become prevalent one can have neither games nor life with that idea its this idea which poisoned christianity now that may be hard for you to see because by the very virtue of being scientologist you dont think all help is offered just to injure but others have that idea and so you find them hard to understand we are few because we few didnt believe all help was injury but as soon as we sought to help others who didnt accept scientology we ran into wall what was the wall the above idee fixe the majority in the world evidently believe that help is only an intention to injure this is more than helpcaninjure this is allhelpisdangerousbecause anyoneofferingtohelpintends onlytoinjure there are too many examples around for you to need many more you can find your numerous own but the maumau people killed only those whites that had sought to help the blacks and just as i was wrapping up the research on this technology which is now beyond being only theory i received letter from white attorney who had been asked to help in panic he was demanding to be let off quick it was very funny with my research papers on my desk before i was presented with perfect example of the technology poor manlittle didhe know what his letter was arriving into i wrote him back and his next letter was so confused he may even recover these ideas as fixed convictions are all about us and across the world this is the idea which blocked our way in our sincere intention to make men free this is how we have caught it in the press and some of us from our dearest friends and relatives we have been confused but so is man man is still confused we are not by studying and knowing our data on this the wall will go poof any psychosis neurosis or illness is fragile matter how fierce it seems these can only thrive in lies now what will happen to the barriers we have had when they are hit by truth i give us twenty months to having all cleared staffs on central orgs three years to all cleared scientologists two decades to large proportion of earth cleared thats my idea of it now so learn to handle help get cleared on it in coauditing or in the hgc learn dozen ways to discuss it so as to break down the barricade of disinterest which is really fear and get the show on the road help is not injurious help is not the best way to hurt help is just help lets flatten it until well always know it and never forget it again and learn adroitly to collapse the help psychosis in others by talk alone we have bought our own freedom to help use it l ron hubbard in the next bulletin i will give you the exact way to use help in model sessions lrh

the cancellation of an auditors certificates is measure taken by hco when these conditions exist the auditor has consistently refused supervised processing and b the auditor has committed antisocial acts liable for prosecution under criminal law or c continues to associate with decertified auditor and balk efforts of hco to bring the person into an hgc for auditing wild tales and rumours are often spread by person who has been decertified and his friends to prevent the public from recognizing the truth of the action that truth is hco is trying to get somebody to have auditing that is effective before he irrevocably harms himself and that hco has evidence of criminal activity or association support hcos efforts to get auditors in for supervised processing when they have gone wrong you can assist hco by doing the following realize that the whole punishment by hco consists of getting the auditor to have processing that is effective and at very low rates b realize that hco has evidence of criminal actions or association when the certificate is pulled and c support hcos efforts to keep certificates in clean hands and the repute of scientology beyond reproach if they dont believe scientology will help them why are they auditing please assist hco to make auditors keep their code dont buy auditing from decertified auditors dont pay bills to decertified auditors they have right left to sell processing for money force them in to the hgc where we can care for them very few get decertified but they do all the public damage to scientology in hco we have to choose between two overt acts 1 an overt act against the offending auditor by decertifying or 2 an overt act against you the public and scientology by ignoring their antisocial actions in hco we always choose 1 many are the cunning rebuttals and tales put out by an auditor whose certificate has been pulled just remember when you hear them that the person putting them out refused auditing for long time before he lost his certificates and that hco has evidence of criminal activities by that person it is not publishing we dont pull two certificates year in all the thousands around the world help us keep it low by making our demand that offenders get audited where we can supervise it stick its only kindness when we dont get them to an hgc they sometimes die sometimes ruin their lives and they hurt all of us

security check 1 stable datayou are not processing but looking for needle or tone arm action that will not blow off clear up on investigationfurther questioning and emeter exploration 2 rising needle means nothing except you arent asking right questions 3 you are looking for significant drops or tone arm changes that will not clear up it is something that person is consciously withholding and as he continues to withhold it on further questioning the needle or the tone arm action will increase 4 you start out by asking nonsignificant questions50 of questions are to be these ie if you have 10 significant security questions to ask you start out with 10 nonsignificant questions if you have needle pattern on nonsignificant questions you note it and it doesnt count on security questions 5 on significant questionsany question that gets drop or ta actionyou dont go any further but explore on this question you may be getting action on past life or rather unimportant this life actsie sniping balloon from store as small child clear this out the needle may cool off less action but still be reacting if so explore furthersee if you can clear it off if on exploration the action increases the person is consciously sitting on something he doesnt want you to know if hes handing you up something else to explain the needle action ie trying to clear it up by handing you something else the action will increase because hes basically lying if the action increases you can tell him hes sitting on something he wont tell and that hes risk he may break down and let go of it at this time if sohe still needs processing on it and is risk until hes responsible for it just letting go of the withhold doesnt make him responsible for it he is not retained on staff while being processed to clear it up what you are looking for is that which wont cool off you can cool something off and go on to the next security check question and then later come back to the reacting question it may have built up again if so explore some more 6 on security check sheet you only note those questions that wouldnt clear if something wont clear or cool off the person is security risk if he does tell you and clear it if its heavy crime note it 7 emeteruse of in security checkcheck out meter before connecting person to be checked see former bulletin on checking out emeter generally you set the sensitivity straight up on american meter unless the needle is very very sticky english meter ismore sensitiveso you set it lower then set the tahave the person squeeze the cans you want about 13 dial drop so you can adjust the sensitivity if the action is too much or too small on the can squeeze put the person at ease dont act accusative you dont want to restimulate all the interrogation in the bank itll just take that much longer to clear it off 8 there may once in while be person who reads nicely at their clear reading with action and youre very suspicious the guy isnt clear this could be complete blab responsibility casea mockery of clear you can check this out as follows make somewhat accusative statement to the person that would be real to himie you never get your work done the mockery of clear person will wildly justify and blame check this person out on help2wayon an employer etc they will be real nowhere on helpie cant conceive of helping an employercant run 2way help etc this person matter how secure he may seem is an employment risk because he cant help and will only cause difficulties on post hell be camouflaged hole 9 along with security check on staffs help check should be given if the person is sticky on help can conceive of some help in some areas but has several areas of help especially on 3rd dynamic he needs processing before he can be hired if hes nowhere on helpcant run 2way or cant conceive of helping an employer or an organization he is not hirable until hes flat on help which will probably take many hours hes probably cch case 10 remember as security

amongst them is an ethics hat by which i have had to protect often with small support the good name and standards of conduct of dianetics and scientology to say the least the hat and necessary actions of counterattack and defense have been distasteful to and in this regard i humbly ask your help we have the answers today as to the why of squirrels we know the reason for their overts against dianetics and scientology technically with overtwithhold and the phenomena of help we not only understand them but can straighten out their insecurity and hates to their own benefit could you help in this it must be evident by now after ten long years that if there were any twist or untruth betrayal or insincerity intended by or organizational people we long since would have passed away the rumours that are put out by unbalanced people achieve only harder work for and for good people everywhere in ten consistent years you should have proof enough that ill stay at my post and do my job and overcome barriers technical or administrative organizational and field somehow i dislike punishments and quarrels and entheta as much as any of you sometimes i havent handled these things well but i have tried to do my job as best i could here on muddy earth today nothing can destroy us or our works i have fear for our future and i know what we can do available to your hands is the technology necessary to handle rumor mongers unethical persons and enturbulators you can help by handling them and getting them to good auditors preferably an hgc and preventing them from upsetting others and our task winning is so easy now success is in our very grasp what failure do you think i feel when i am asked to cancel certificate with all the wealth of truth before him someone avails himself or herself of part of it and with glass of water held in hand dies of thirst yet some of this burden lies with you when an auditor forgets his personal auditing and audits without being clear why does the field permit him to crack up why havent his friends and associates thought enough of him to force him to get processing from reliable source why do they wait for him overworked already to emerge from the tangle of some emotional crisis utterly unstrung and hating everything before they offer processing clearing the executives the auditors the people of scientology is your job now when you hear somebody going bad running away and raving against us all dont harbour him and sympathizeyoull kill him make him go to the nearest hgc or an auditor with altitude over him and get his overts off and his ability to help increased there are thousands of auditors across the world few of them are clear once or twice year amongst all these one of them turns upon us rumours fly people wonder eyebrowsraise why in few years theyll be clear weve just begun the project right now they are not instead of standing around blinking wondering even believing such wild tales why arent you being effective the person doing bad and untrue things needs assistance the least you can do is drive or force him to an hgc where supervised auditing and not pattycake will straighten the person out and make life bright again my lines are heavy my days are long to these should we also add my ethics hat breakthrough has happened here in 1960s spring bigger even than ow were clearing people fast in hgcs it just began to happen but it isnt happening to auditors in the field yet and it wont for quite some while meanwhile must i go on and act to minimize the damage being done by people not only not yet clear but heavily caved in you could help by pressing these people in toward auditing by understanding the why of their rumours and hates and getting them processed and you can help by insisting that names in scientology get processed regularly by competent auditors in an hgc not by some friend wholl pattycake until theyre really cleared i myself have had scores of hours of processing since last fall if i could be clearer than i am whats that make the case of other scientologists you could lighten my lines and my heart if youd share this burden even little bit hold the field together until they are all clear now certain you will help in this and let get on to wider work i wish to celebrate the occasion of hgcs using new technology beginning to make clears again by announcing the

whether on another side or ours and what in their actions gives us the keenest insight their ability to help some think that help cannot be done shun them some think that help is always an effort to betray process them for here you have the criminals of earth some people cannot help they can only injure and destroy and if in the name of help they only injure and destroy then know them carefully for they are criminals what is criminal one who thinks help cannot be on any dynamic or uses help on anyone to injure and destroy who are these men with covert ways who bring earth its pain they are the men who cannot help who are the women who must be helped but who can only maim they say these men and women that theyll help and then they make thorough shambles of it all from where did earth conceive her traps and aspects that are grim earth would be lovely place if all men helped to help not to destroy think heavily on this point judge men from what they think of help judge women too and find the good ones from the bad the good can help the bad will not or if they do they help only to betray the good of earth comes from above the point of make and break where help is help and honestly the pain of earth comes from the tones where help does not exist or where its used to pull us into agony know your friends its strange that those who argue with us against our goals and scientology

sussex hco bulletin of 9 june 1960 fran hldrs central orgs hcos the basic assumptions of scientology versus overts the entire secret of all overtwithhold mechanisms is valences i have known for long while that profile on our tests is picture of valence if the preclear were in valence but was himself completely he would have perfect test response and would be wholly clear in this statement we have one of the background structure points of scientology this was an assumption point for some time point of departure like conservation of energy in physics is the primary assumption point of 19th century physicsif we assume this point then we have the truths axioms and other data in elementary physics the point assumed and never proven and not even well phrased is the start point in physics from which all deductions are made it is an understood nonexamined theory physics was demonstrable truth but only in limited and finite sense the moment nuclear physics my dear companion that haunted my college days came into action the assumption point began to crumble and is not now considered to be truth hence while elementary physics works in finite limited sense it is not considered true science any longerit is only elementary science freud for instance had as his start point or assumption point the libido theory of 1894 in which he based all on sex it is rare that science ever embraces its own assumption point and resolves it freud was stuck with his libido theory just as newtons successors were stuck with conservation of energy so long as elementary physicists were concerned only with energy which could not be destroyed or created they treadmilled themselves into deadend mirrored in such things as inadequate costly engines difficult construction and complete lock out from space and other planets the great einstein not physicist but mathematician established new science which deserved the name of the physical science physics name already purloined by the natural philosophy of the 1 9th century old time physics was the science of the age of fire and ended with the age of fire it died to whimpering embers under the down blast of atomic fission we are longer scientifically nor politically in the age of fire we are in the age of freed energy we do not yet have an atomic physical science we have only number of guestimates like the bronze worker of early greece who knew nothing of the facts of fire metallurgy the fire age begun by prometheus whoever he really was is ending on earth the raw energy age has begun with all the teething troubles of any new era called the atomic age just now it started with hints of others before einstein but was actually born when einstein wrote his theory of relativity this crude guestimate was yet great departure point in the history of this planet it has unlocked space to man promised him new engines widened his scope unhappily it has also unlocked vast opportunities for political bunglingbut i would rather say that it exposed political diplomacy as bungling subject which must now urgently improve nations can longer afford political ineptness now the assumption point of physics the science of the fire age became disproved and the science is in question and the fire age is in fact over the holes in physics have begun toglare some day new science will be organized from the assumption point of einsteins work matter if hes debunked forgotten or becomes legend like prometheus the professors of tomorrow can teach as myth einstein stole the secret of eternal fission from heaven named princeton where the goals and ages hence somebody will prove or expose the basic assumption and the fission age will resurge or die depending on whether or not the assumption is found to be true or false in freuds case in lesser sense short and ineffective but highly interesting age of psychotherapy began with the libido theory in 1894 and began to disintegrate through lack of progress and development about 1920 although the subject itself became an intellectual football in the late 20s an artists cross in the early 30s and teenagers subject in the late 50s his contemporaries added nothing effective to freuds work and the subject like psychology which originated in 1879 and assumed men were animals failed in all fields but wide popularity back of all work on mental states however lie various assumption points most of them hidden or undelineated from which the remainder of the subject evolves and grows if the cornerstone is proven only relatively factual long enduring career is guaranteed to the subject freud used as his assumption point more than his libido theory that all impulses and behaviors are sexmotivated he assumed that if one were sexmotivated then if one unblocked this drive by removing an early traumatic sex experience that was impeding the drive the patient would recover from neurosis all manner of interesting complications proceed from this art being considered sublimation or aberration of the sex drive had to be considered wholly neurotic success being most desirable as sexual success was product of blessed neurosis if achieved in any other field as treatment it was common for freudian practitioner to cut through the gordian knot by ordering patient to go out and have sex with everyone prove his or her prowess and thus become well and happy while this secured the popularity of the subject it did little to reduce asylum statistics as these were on the increase throughout the freudian age and were highest at its end and indeed were higher in freudian dominated areas than in others where freudian treatment was not used not my propaganda just recorded fact the psychiatrist following russian science has more basic and brutal assumption point which is that shock cures aberration the idea goes back very long way making psychiatry long if sporadic age psychiatry ebbs and rises in use since it is dramatization rather than science it springs from the same impulse that assumes punishment cures wrong doing the limited workability of this is apparent around us on every hand we could do nothing socially about crime so we inhibited crime by striking at criminals this gave us suppressed criminality and more criminals but it must be said that lacking any solution that worked well then any solution that even seemed to work occasionally was considered better than nothing perhaps at some early date in whole history this worked better but all expedient cures tend to become new illness alcohol in any alcoholic once cured something but now produces with amazing similarity the malady it once cured these are stopgap cures that do this not cures in any absolute sense as the earliest punishment was the production of shock in the offender whole track history continues to repeat the treatment for misbehavior as dramatized action not an intellectual undertaking if person misbehaves he should be punished thus if person misbehaves insanely he must be punished psychiatry is not then science but legalized at present dramatization and this is the very dramatization that makes this cruel universe when it is punishment is unworkable as all the statistics show punish the criminal and he becomes too often confirmed and hardened criminal all this however is based on yet earlier lie the last two years of my researches have been devoted to establishing or not as the case may be whether anything could actually be done to person or whether it was not the person himself who did it i knew the latter wastheoretically true but i had not found means to demonstrate itand indeed was quite prepared to discover that something could be done to person without his being prior cause this work will be found under all 195859 data released all overts and withholds the earlier assumption to punishment is that something can be done to another being by evidences to date odd as it may seem it appears by all processing tests that one becomes aberrated only by means of his own not anothers actions i do not say that nothing can be done to person or being by another person or being obviously communication exists i am only saying that all aberrative effects of action are created by the person who has them indeed none could be processed successfully through burn or engram unless he himself were holding the aberration therefor the fire location and other people are not consulted and are not even there in fact at the time of processing preclear being audited on past incident can recover from its ill effects therefore it seems conclusive that he himself must be causing the ill effects in present time or he could not eradicate them since the sources are not present thus they must not have been the sources of his ill effects the preclear must have been inspecting the assumption points of dianetics and scientology one finds now that what was originally assumed is fact thus we are to be here as science for very long time as science before ever proved its assumption point that i know about we are suddenly unique in that our results tend to verify more than our basic truths the further we go forward in other words the more basic are the assumption points unlike then physics or psychoanalysis or other sciences we have examined and improved our assumption points we assumed in dianetics that if we removed engrams life would resurge and become good this assumed that being was all right until injured and that eradicating the injury would find him all right again this is not the same as freud for freud never assumed goodness or rightness in man but on the contrary seemed to warn that we had better not go too far art and all that depending on the madness of us all as god seems to be blamed for most of the art work in this universe this seems most impudent evaluation of gods sanity on freuds part although i do not think he ever displayed an actual professional sign saying s freud psychotherapist by appointment to god the dianetic assumption that man is basically good and is damaged by punishment holds valid in practical practice and in some tens of thousands of cases and were the only ones in history that validated our findings by strict long long precise testing on cases we find that the more we process successfully the kinder and more ethical our people become that disposes of the vile nature of man by staggering poundage of evidence the assumption that all art is derived from aberration is discounted by the numbers of singers and artists who sang better and painted better after they were made saner by us the basic psychiatric assumption that enough punishment will restore sanity is disproven not only by psychiatric statistics but by actual observation and removal of the effects of punishment by processing that being without aberration would be good ethical artistic and powerful is still basic assumption in scientology it has just been demonstrated as factual for our practice this is news our assumption point has just become basic truth it is not just an assumption therefore we will now find ourselves on new plane of progress perhaps with new teething troubles certainly with even further goals the truth was demonstrated in this wise i knew valences those mocked up otherbeingnesses person thinks he is were the source of test profile patternswhen we rid the pc of an undesirable valence his profile rose on the graph and he felt and acted better when we did not alter the valence in tested cases the profile remained much the same if the preclear were driven into undesirable valences by experiment his profile worsened apparently although this is more difficult to verify since the tone of the existing valence was undoubtedly dropped as well now from this i have found the mechanism by which being gives himself pain that is actually selfinflicted but is apparently otherinflicted and this is vast stride for it resolves ows and we can consider it broadly completed cycle of research ending two years with victory for our assumption point by being valence not himself person confuses the source of pain inflicting it himself upon the valence he is in and by experiencing the pain from the valence being can counterfeit the effect of being an effect of punishment by being valence he can conceive the environment is guilty of striking valence but as this is in fact an overt by himself against valence if only by failing to protect it he feels the pain of valence as he thinks of himself as valence he can then feel his own pain the conclusion is that to feel pain and for pain to persist one must be in valence the remedy for pain illness aberration insanity and the lot then is to free the preclear of valences apparently freed of all valences of an unconscious level the preclear would yet be able to experience but would not be involved with pain etc except by postulate the way to free him of all valences or unconscious counterfeit beingness is not the purpose of this paper here i only wish to examine with you the aspects of assumption points of subjects and sciences each of which has one usually unknown to the originator and to pass along the interesting intelligence that our former assumption point of remove the aberration and you have worthwhile person has become demonstrable in practice and can be considered truth this means new level has opened to the future with new certainty an overt recoils upon one because one is already in valence similar to that of the being against whom the overt is leveled the mechanism is exposed and as it is exposed we find it is not needed since being without valences is basically good only being with valences has his overts recoil upon him only being with valences commits overts harmful to others as he is behaving as he supposes the evil valence would behave but as unvalenced being does l ron hubbard lrhjsrd copyright 1960 by l ron hubbard all rights

society so deeply laid they seemed right everybody knows that is tombstone of progress for it contains uninspected lies that bring the wittiest of us to grief everybody knows that man is evil was only one of the many things we found wrong exposed and dropped from our own knowledge however in the field of what is expected of scientologist we have for ten years carried along an inherited error it is this everybody knows that specialist in science hangs out shingle and if professional becomes private practitioner now listen psychoanalysis was developed in 1894 by sigmund freud everybody who studied it was expected to hang out shingle and start practising it took half century for psychoanalysis to become generally known by the people yet how could it miss its tenet was that if you were sexually uninhibited you would be happy the psychoanalyst took his cue from the medico of his day if you could heal you were healer with shingle well im afraid lot of us have bought this too if we were trained in scientology as professional we should hang out our shingle as practitioner with all due respect to the scientologist in professional practice where they have every right to be this is not true idea it is borrowed idea its as old as the witch doctor scientologist is the being three feet behind societys head and society runs on eight dynamics not in sick room some of us of course would become professional practitioners but professional scientologist is one who expertly uses scientology on any area or level of the society housewife who does not have professional level skill in scientology could not expect to run wholly successful family or keep order in her neighbourhood and keep her family well factory foreman could not possibly handle his crews with full effectiveness without professional scientology skill the personal assistant to corporation executive could not do fully effective job without being professional scientologist corporation president without certificate will someday fail and the head of country would go to pieces if he didnt know scientology from professional angle how can these people handle life if they have expert knowledge of how to handle life now we dont expect everyone in the world to become trained auditor but we expect the people who are making the world to have knowledge of how to make it go trained scientologist is not doctor he is someone with special knowledge in the handling of life we have many many personal success stories in scientology they begin with book acquaintance and bloom when professional skill enters the background these people small people big people drove wedge for themselves into companies societies with scientology and then took over control of the area they succeeded where they never would have dreamed they could and every time one of us drives in such wedge we all win because the world is brought nearer to sane and decent worldthe factories the marts of trade the homes the neighbourhoods these are the places we want trained scientologists in that way alone were on the busy still healthy communication lines of the world some of us need to run centres and schools just to give the rest of us service when required training at pro level must continue and must be kept good and service and communication must be given hence we have central organizations on every continent and hcos but if we avoid the throbbing comm lines of the world and act like doctors we will not win soon enough as group any trained scientologist can win to success in society heightened iq knowledge of life forthright attitudewith these things it is easy for him or her to improve 2 social or business position to get higher pay to exert wider personal influence this we know we can do we have done it so often so lets improve the ability process people weekends run coaudit some evenings of the week at home but get on the active lines of the world and make your presence felt it takes full training to do it its been done from our books alone but not always well it takes tough academy training to make scientologist so dont go at it half armed and stop feeling apologetic because you are not full time auditor we are the auditors to the world not to handful of the sick we are not doctors we are the worlds trouble shooters when we make company win the whole world wins when we make neighbourhood win we all win full time scientologist makes life better wherever he is and that is enough pro activity for anyone what do we expect of you to become the best scientologist that can be and to get on the comm lines of the world and bring big win where it counts we dont expect you to hang up shingle as doctor and have private practice well respect you if you do but well respect you just as much and even more if you get trained as pro and go out and up in the world of action and of life hit for the key spots by whatever means the head of the womens club the personnel director of company the leader of good orchestra the presidents secretary the advisor of the trade unionany key spot make good sound living at it drive good car but get your job done handle and better the people you meet and bring about better earth and stop feeling hangdog because you arent auditing full time nobody expects you to well keep centres going to service your needs some of us well provide ammunition and books and the rest of us had better invade every activity there is on high level of success and make our influence felt on the comm lines of the world scientology is the only game on

first hope for auditing and get the terminal closest to that goal it will often be found that the pc was trying to help his eyes or his wife or himself as the first help terminal in auditing when this terminal was not totally flattened the pc finding he had not helped whatever he was trying to help got an auditing lose by finding out what the pc was trying to help at the very first contact with scientology and by giving him sessions on it with help ow most important win can be obtained this bulletin should be given very serious attention in hgcs where the cases always come that have real heavy auditing problems hgcs get the toughest cases and usually all the old time cases where any case is being handled in an hgc it should be suspected that there has been an auditing flub somewhere along the line perhaps the pc won wonderfully with the first auditing session but failed heavily down the line somewhere in such circumstance always convert the loss to win hgcs do more patchup than virgin work thus it is safe to assume first that any applying pc has had something he tried to help in his own auditing that he received and that it isnt flat and second that the pc has had lose on some terminal hgc auditing as rule should regard itself as parasitic upon other auditing already done hgc staff auditors should rarely be attempting the new and strange in an assessment of case but should be trying to recover past data dredged up in earlier than hgc sessions and converting the losses to wins this is type of assessment peculiar to an hgc and we should study it l ron hubbard lrh j

hco bulletin of may 30 1960 dynamic assessment on help covered this terminals found should be handled with concept help use lots of havingness when running such terminal there is another new assessment know to mystery scale assessment this is done by using the emeter on the buttons of the know to mystery scale that level which most changes the pattern of the needle is the target use concept help on it the most profitable fast way to get case moving is to find out what the person was most trying to help when he or she came into dianetics and scientology this may be an arm or my friends or myself but whatever it is run it on any help process until it is flat concept help is good starter for the terminal thus located this gives the pc big primary win flatten the terminals we stalled on acc clearing procedures because auditors did not flatten help before starting on step 6 lets not lose this horrible lesson the technical reason for this is that when help is unflat pc is still in valence running step 6 in valence is courting disaster as the pc is in picture that increases in mass and gives him somatics we are not returning to step 6 we have better processes but we are returning to help with far more knowledge of it flatten every terminal on which you run help by flatten is meant needle change when the terminal is mentioned way to test this is to depart by two way comm from the terminal and then ask about it again if the needle reacts the terminal mentioned is not flat just talk about something else like the weather and then mention the terminal again youll see it is better to use general form of terminal than specific form it is better to run young man than joe if the emeter reacts to joe it is best to find out what joe is to the pc and find the general form that reacts most friend young man bum and run that not joe you will get lot further than when you run specific close to present time terminal help as valence problem when people become valence they do so for at least two reasonsfirst and probably most powerful the thetan takes valence that he believes will help others or the universe second and more mechanical the thetan tries to help something or somebody and fails and the last stage of his effort is to mock up picture of the thing and try to help it there are various aspects of all this more and more complicated the thetan becomes man to help women he fails and thinks men cant help women so he restrains men or he becomes woman thetan can become very involved with his computations on the subject of help one black case i know is seeking to help others by absorbing all the blackness in the universe there is formula for handling 1 above find out what thetan is being and find out what that beingness helps and not helps by using the command what would ____help what would not help there is general form which discovers beingnesses in pc find out something very general that pc is trying to help or has failed to help and run what would help ____ what would not help____ on the discovered terminal the pc will get cognitions on what he or she is being and what the pc is restraining himself or herself from being finishing off difficult terminal any terminal that is being run on help that was unwisely chosen can be eased off by running old overtwithhold alternate confront or responsibility this is crude way out but it will work in any event any session should contain general alternate confront what can you confront what would you rather not confront and havingness these take the edge off unwise choices any rough auditing and make the case feel better if the pc can do it responsibility can get pc off bad choice fastest if pc can run responsibility easily the pc has to be running rather well in general before it can be attempted the pcs who are suffering because of an auditor choice ofwrong terminal usually cant run responsibility easily of course successful auditing is what you can get away with the best and smoothest way to get off bogged terminal is alternate confront but when the case has afterwards been run on other terminals with help its best to go back and clean up the ones that earlier bogged with help by running more help on them general processes the general processes which assist help sessions are alternate confrontwhat can you confront what would you rather not confront and havingness look around here and find something you could have any couple hours of help should be followed in the same session with fifteen minutes of alternate confront and fifteen minutes of havingness these times are approximate and are given just to communicate some idea of ratio truly boggy case could do with ratio of 111 such as 45 minutes of help 45 minutes of alternate confront 45 minutes of havingness as the case gets out of long long comm lags on help increase help in the ratio to 1 1212 or one hour of help half hour of alternate confront half hour of havingness all this is auditor judgment established by observation as it is the help in any form that does it remember to use help to advance the case and alternate confront and havingness to make the pc feel goodalternate confront and havingness improve case of course but are long long hauls as processes if we think of clearing with them help on near present time terminals is far less effective in clearing than help on general terminals that have lot of track to them as general terminals can get pc into lot of confusion on the back track alternate confront and havingness keep the pc from getting too bogged to run alternate confront also takes the edge off invented answers by the pc create confront phenomena there are lots of help processes and many ways to run them they all win to some degree it is the amount of help run rather than the number of terminals cleared that clears the case help basically sheds valences therefore havingness is needed but the valences are all canthaves so when the valence is off at last the havingness of the pc comes up almost any brand of help run long enough by good auditing should clear pc hence the idea is to run help and run it flat lrhdmcden l ron hubbard copyright 1960 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 23 june ad10 important ma franchise holders special zone plan the scientologists role in life ten years ago on about this date i was up against third dynamic confusion of such magnitude that within few months i was to decide to forget organization problems and concentrate on research because of this decision for years we were poorer in numbers but richer by far in knowledge it evidently was not enough to be able to help the basic problems of an individual there were eight dynamics it was necessary to take in at least some of all eight dynamics before we could be effective and toward the end of june in 1950 i first sensed that truth and the maximbring order to your own house before you attempt order next door in june 1950 the foundations were already beginning to shatter under the enthusiastic door pounding of the public i had built the proverbial better mousetrap and all the world was beating path to our doorand was breaking the door down yes we could do wonders with people greater wonders than had been done in recent millenia but we were ignorant beyond the first two dynamics the moment we sought to handle the third we were done that was ten years ago within months of that date all that was left of the first organizations was rubble and newspapers blowing by in the wind i worked hard and studied and researched never friendless often helped and worked ahead for ten years the first dynamic self fluctuated in results and has stabilized with unsurpassed processing technology in proof our people are individually in better shape than any other group on the second dynamic family and sex we have gotten into winning position we know the answers to marriage children and sex the material isnt all published broadly enough yet even for scientologists to know it but its there and were living better lives the third dynamic groups is the spectacular breakthrough of today its happened so gradiently weve hardly realized we have won but observe we have magnificent organization in america england south africa and australia we have just about the most wonderful organizations man has seen for their size cost and defensibility here we have achieved spectacular stability largely selfdetermined yet cooperating smoothly these third dynamic examples compare with june 1950 foundations like the royal ballet compares with the aftermath of hiroshima just as we can represent in ourselves the grip we have on the first dynamic so do we represent in our organizations that we have the third dynamic well in handthe technology of our third dynamic in organizations and the field is an exact one as skilled as an auditors knowhow and having applied it to organizations we are now applying it to the field which is the main subject of this bulletin you in the field you are about to win too with complete new level of policy and action if you want it you are about to be included in the fourth dynamic mankind is now an understood zone of operation and is declared herewith to be operational for scientologist the prize of understanding man as racial and political species has fallen to our hand dont smile i know its an incredible announcement but its factual on the fifth dynamic that of living things i have been making headway since last year and know quite bit now about them many of the secrets have dropped into our hands on the sixth dynamic the physical universe we have for some time stood well above what they know in physics on the seventh dynamic the spirit we covered this ground very thoroughly in 195354 55 and its still all true but too advanced for general consumption the best record of this was in the 1953 philadelphia lecture series of 64 hours on the eighth dynamic the supreme being we have at least found the key question and in little while we should have it answered on demonstrable basis far from presumptuous it is about time somebody neither atheist nor zealot asked some questions and arrived at some answers that have selfinterested curves in them so you can see where we are going and have at least passing acquaintance with developments here we are with the largest fund of information of life and its patterns that has been assembled in factual package on earth now the question is what are we going to do with it until we had the third and fourth dynamics demonstrably in hand technically we could not answer the question weve each had his own idea of what we should be doing with it and each of these ideas is right to the degree that its right for each of us i have never discussed this point strongly because i did not want to shake anyone into an uncertainty so lets say that all these ideas are right and then add third dynamic idea with which we can all agree improvement is the common denominator of all our ideas and of course each one has zone of interest where he or she feels improvement is most needed or where he or she would be most comfortable in doing the work of improvement and thats the gist of this third dynamic idea its rather deceptive idea at first glance since we are each of us doing something of that but let us be far more definite and let us expose fallacy that has long been riding with us as an unknown passenger people think of professional practitioners as doctors who aloof from all other concerns practise on the sick this is very novel idea dreamed up probably by the first lazy witch doctor and used forever thereafter by most specialists in human livingness and here i want to asis and banish that idea from amongst us all if we are doctors by which might be meant repairers then we are doctors on the third and fourth dynamics and handle the first and second dynamics only to achieve better function on the third and fourthand true enough most scientologists agree i think with this concept but it itself is as new and novel as the idea of being professional practitioner to individual health once was i believe our third dynamic organization taking in all scientologists should go this way the central organization and centre scientologists should service the remaining scientologists doing administration instructing and auditing instruction to professional level of all scientologists should be entered upon as must central organization and centre auditing should be special and referred cases and the scientologists themselves when they want it as part of service being trained and cleared need not hold up the next zone of action though it is taken for granted that these will occur for each the field auditor should be included wholly in to the general activity as large zone divided into smaller specialized zones the field auditor should of course run group some evenings he will find he has to and audit not only members of his family but contacts in his zone on weekends or evenings but as you will see he or she is largely wasting time by trying to be an individual doctor type practitioner where he or she is only partly successful at it some of course will have to work full time in centres as we get into action but centres are mentioned above as special activity along with central organizations the largest majority of scientologists should i feel consider themselves as doctors on the third and fourth dynamics and if we work well at this we will have answered all our various needs and brought it off on the third and fourth as well now i wouldnt be talking to you like this if i didnt feel i had this studied to conclusion consider our position we have arrived at very special plateau of knowledge as has been reviewed above data on our knowhow is being codified for use in these zones of action consider the position of the world the story is often repeated on the whole track as mest is made to help too much plateau of civilization is reached in which the individual is downgraded to number the end of thisthe lights eventually go out through lack of personal initiative and ability we are in fantastic position at the right time and place to halt this cycle of decay and start new one on earth and i believe we should overtly do so how we are masters of iq and ability we have knowhow any of us could select out zone of life in which we are interested and then entering it bring order and victory to it of course theres heavy challenge in doing this some of the victories would be hardly won but we would win across the world if we kept our vision bright the third and fourth dynamics subdivide any third breaks down into many activities and professions neighborhood business concern military group city government etc etc etc the fourth dynamic breaks down just now mainly to races and nations now just suppose scientologist were to consider himself professional only for the purposes of treating and repairing or even starting again these third and fourth zones see this housewife already successfully employing scientology in her own home trained to professional level takes over womans club as secretary or some key position she straightens up the club affairs by applying comm practice and making peace and then incidentalto the clubs main function pushes scientology into zone of special interest in the club children straightening up marriages whatever comes to hand and even taking fees for it meanwhile of course going on being successful and contributing wife or this scientologist lesser executive or even clerk in company trains as professional auditor and seeing where the company is heading begins to pick up its loose ends by strengthening its comm lines or its personnel abilities without selling anybody scientology just studies out the bogs and remedies them if only as an able person he would rapidly expand zone of control to say nothing of his personal standing in the company this has been and is being done steadily across the world now that we have presessioning its easy to straighten up other people our unreleased technology on handling third dynamic business situations is staggeringly large youd be surprised how easy it is to audit seniors they and their families have so many troubles or how easy it is to spot the emergencymaker and audit him and see this race is staggering along making difficulties for itself locate its leaders get paid post as secretary or officer of the staff of the leaders of that race and by any means audit them into ability and handle their affairs to bring cooperation not trouble every race that is in turmoil in nation has quasisocial groups around its leaders and this nation or state runs on the ability of its department heads its governors or any other leaders it is easy to get posts in such areas unless one has delusions of grandeur or fear of it dont bother to get elected get job on the secretarial staff or the bodyguard use any talent one has to get place close in go to work on the environment and make it function better occasionally one might lose but in the large majority doing good job and making the environment function will result in promotion better contacts widening zone the cue in all this is dont seek the cooperation of groups dont ask for permission just enter them and start functioning to make the group win through effectiveness and sanity if we were revolutionaries this hco bulletin would be very dangerous document we are not revolutionaries any more than we are doctors of sickness in individual patients but we are not revolutionaries we are humanitarians we are not political and we can be the most important force for good that the world has ever known who objects to company functioning better to produce better civilization who objects to race becoming sane and stable asset to its communities who objects to neighborhood smoothing out only the very criminal would object and they are relatively ineffectual when you can know and spot them and there are criminals except the mentally disabled so this is challenge on the third and fourth almost all scientologists are in position to begin to help on such programme and i am studying now first the popularity with you of this plan and if great how best to help us all achieve it the first thing required is an understandable designation for scientologists undertaking their portion of this special zone plan i should think the word counselor is acceptable with an appropriate additional designation such as family counselor or company counselor or child counselor or organization counselor what we would do is issue an hpa or hca as certificate as always and would issue special zone certificate to any person operating in that zone after he or she had completed an additional correspondence type briefing course covering that general zone in other words anyone would have to have professional certificate before he or she could be designated as special zone counselor the costs of obtaining such certificate would be kept slight more than bare administration the advantages of having such designation are plain clerk with certificate on the wall from the academy of scientology designating that he or she has been graduated as company counselor would startle even complacent executive into conversation about what was wrong with the place and as he was talking to pro auditor any scepticism would quicklyfade pro would know as it all starts with being good auditor and as the additional technology is exact in any of these fields the programme is feasible we are at this stage of this programme i have found that scientologists operate with high success on the third and fourth but that it rarely occurs to them to try it and when they do they think i want them to audit full time and they are apologetic about their attempt i have the technology pretty well to hand and can write zone manuals i feel we now have clearing well in hand in central orgs and will soon have it broadly so for scientologists in the field but i do not feel we need wait on that but take it and further training in stride i feel that we are ripe for an overt attack on the third and fourth down spiral i feel our auditors should take advantage of their increased personal ability and should be regarded accordingly by society and its zones i see clearly that we have to win on the third and fourth if we are to attain our goals of better world the special zone plan is made possible by slight shift of approach take the case of police officer who got interested on pe course and read some books he tried to sell his chief on scientology as subject and was given heavy loss one our pe level trainee was insufficiently schooled to be effective two as pro his approach could have been any one of several he could have eased himself nearer command source area in the department or he could have taken over pistol marksman on the force and made him champion as we did with the olympics team once the slight shift is that we would have made this police officer get pro training before telling him sell scientology to the force and then would have advised him to sell it by action not words handling the familial problems of the commissioner as his driver or making the rookies gasp at how fast he could train them would be selling by action only and other kind of selling would be needed hed be running an evening coaching class for his fellows or superiors on scientology in few months and making some of them follow the same route how long before he had altered the whole character ability and effectiveness of the police force and through that how long before he would have civilized the whole approach to law enforcement in that area for once we have created an opening we always avalanche to fantastically swift gains thats the special zone plan several hundred thousand are ready for the first steps those that arent trained as pro hpas and hcas could start in soon there are special ways to get training at an academy now and even while awaiting this training and working toward clearing such scientologists could begin to determine their zone goals and work on them our impact on the society is already weighty with special zone plans we could move that impact up thousands of times greater and have in our present lifetimes our goals at least in part accomplished and decent world to come back to again what do you think of it write to in care of central organization hco in your area to give your views on the special zone plan when you write please advise as follows whether you like or do not like the idea if you like it tell the zone you are in or would like to be in what area do you want to help but whatever you say please write as your letter

below the level of consciousness the source of all engrams is the pc who creates picture of the incident below his level of knowingness and recreates it into keyin he uses the engram to warn and restrain himself but this as solution to trouble is faulty one it might have cured trouble once but like all cures became itself new trouble in 195758 we attempted to handle this before we had help flatflatflat step 6 used then made the whole bank toughen up if help was unflat if person is in any valence he is victimized by his own creation to produce or create anything is to invite toughening of the reactive mind if help is flat on numerous terminals and if the emeter longer reacts to help questions of any kind the person is mest clear only now is it really safe for any auditor to handle the subject of create several things reduce the toughening up of reactive mind due to aberrations concerning creation chief amongst these are alternate confront in any form particularly general responsibility processes also reduce the banks heaviness havingness also takes the edge off bank and of course help on terminals reduces heavy or thick bank therefore help alternate confront and havingness are the keys responsibility is less workable in early stages since the pc is usually in some valence and when he says i could be responsible for he means valence could be responsible for which runs in fact irresponsibility not responsibility since valence not pc is responsible there are some ways to run create in early stages before help is wholly flat on other terminals best of these subordinate methods is what creation have you helped what creation have you not helped one that is pretty high but sometimes works well if the person is not in valence is what creation could you be responsible for combination suggested by dick foster ow on other peoples creations is not very good but very spectacular using create with alternate confront what creation could you confront what creation would you rather not confront is of course workable enough people are coming up toward or have arrived at mest clear now that you had better have the next stage i would advise help and not help on creations until the needle is floating with reaction to questions of any kind on them alternate confront on creations and havingness should still be used as in help but first be sure help is flat on all terminals including the thing the person came into dianetics or scientology to help and also flatten help on every terminal that has been contacted or run on ow processes or any help

good today but they can get faster in any hgc appoint competent instructor from the academy not staff auditor give this instructor the many hco bulletins on presessioning model sessions help alternate confront havingness have him gen himself up on those and this present hco bulletin convene the hgc including the d of p for one hour three days week immediately after they complete auditing for the day have the instructor drill them on the following subjects first teach them regimen 1 second get them easy with model sessioning third get them easy on presessioning fourth make them study all the data on help alternate confront havingness fifth check them out on dynamic assessment meters and flat needles lay down and permit them to run as your first step as of now only the following regimen 1 only regimen i can be used until an auditor has excellent results on several pcs assessmentask the pc what is wrong with him take the pcs answer make it into general terminal run that and nothing else when its cooled off assess again same way run that dont argue or dispute or change what the pc says except to convert it to general terminal example auditor what do you think is wrong with you pc my wife auditor ok well run wife example auditor what do you think is wrong with you pc im impatient auditor can you think of somebody who was impatient pc my father auditor ok well run father example auditor what do you think is wrong with you pc well i think im attenuated auditor did you ever know an attenuated person pc yes auditor who was itpc george james auditor since this is specific terminal and we want general one what was george james pc loafer auditor ok well run help on loafer all right pc fine when loafer is flat flat we do the same assessment again and as above get new general terminal b use as process twoway concept help example think of father helping you think of you helping father etc flatten it down to reaction on meter lay meter aside for most of sessions use only to check c for quarter of any session time run alternate confront what could you confront what would you rather not confront d for quarter of every sessions time run havingness to end withlook around here and find something you could have start session with checking for ptps and arc breaks handle ptp with what part of that problem could you be responsible for only f handle arc break with what have i done to you what have you done to only regimen 1 omits presessioning it does rough kind of model session as good as one can get but skip being critical of it it will take the instructor week or two to get the staff to buckle down on regimen 1 only dont let the instructor get off into anything else than regimen 1 while teaching it except these above points and the following 1 handle pc pleasantly 2 dont chatter at pc 3 get pc to execute every command given 4 run good trs now with the d of p stress all auditing points and handling the auditors with heavy 8c teach d of p not to q and with auditor problems example auditor comes in demands unusual solution d of p gives it auditor comes back saying it didnt work it didnt work of course because auditor never used d of ps solution the only reply of d of p should be what didnt work and all is revealed d of p is taught not to give solutions or sympathy just to demand adherence to instructions and get results auditors dont have personal cases where the d of p is concerned the instructor must get this effective attitude into effect good 8c on staff auditors excuses accepted the instructor can be given this as an added assignment and can still instruct in the academy its only 1 hour 3 days week probably between 330 and 430 switch the tape hour in the academy or something now on all new staff auditors use regimen 1 matter what else comes out thats new while hes learning regimen 1 he can still audit pcs how you ask the new staff auditor what process have you been most successful with he says 8c you say ok thats what you run on pcs until further notice meanwhile he learns regimen 1 out of session and when he has it cool switch him to that you could do this on the whole hgc staff while they learn regimen 1 if desired summaryheres the point on the above an uncertain d of p or staff auditor is guaranteed if he or she is using stuff thats unfamiliar raise familiarity with the simplest version of modern processes and you raise confidence this is good for any hgc even if it is doing well and this is the way to handle new staff auditors you want clears ok build up the confidence of the hgc on gradient scale youll have clears it is envisioned this programme will go on for months until it is complete and all auditors are handling all varieties of help and doing assessments well enough with meters to be turned loose with everything they are turned loose on gradient scale as they win it is also envisioned that staff auditors like other staff members will be getting auditing evenings or on staff

grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 7 july 1960 fran hldrs the assessment of help you should realize at this stage that we are still feeling around for the most adequate and fastest method of running help everything which has been given to you thus far is near the mark and presessioning model session and flattening help are right on the mark however there are certain things that make auditors unhappy with running help chief amongst these is the fact that it is tremendously restimulative process when one has not had any run this means that we had better get the staff theta clearing course or staff coauditing going fast on supervised basis the second thing is that help does not flatten very easily on late specific terminal of course this is true of all processes but help is peculiar process and is slower on late terminals than other buttons and here is why help resolves cases because it is the basis of all association and as you know association leads to identification and identification is the basis of all mental upsets the action of help is not aberrative the failure to help is what does it or the lack of things to help however all valences and all identification stem from this button and other now do lights dawn and bells ring help is the button which if run settles all difficulties with association and identification and all problems of beingness thus there is something peculiar about help which is not true of any other button any help run is gain even gawdelpus if it is left wholly bogged with half hour comm lag all bits of help run are chewing away at all tangles of identification so chew away and to the dickens with it any help run is better than help run and because the pc is bundle of aberrated identifications any help run untangles some of him and any help run on any terminal tends to get at any other terminal so thats why help run in any old way will sooner or later make the grade but this is reason to believe there are not also smart ways to run help any late specific terminal being so confounded far from basicbasic on the time track runs tough and endlessly therefore as always it is better to run general terminals than to run specific terminals however in the case of ptp you can go ahead if you have to and run help on the ptp personnel but as soon as the edge is off the ptp for heavens sakes shift to the general form of the specific terminals you have been running and flatten those lot or little keep very close record of what you have run on help as the only precaution you have to take and when the pc is running toward mest clear check back with help on these terminals and make sure they are flat when lot of help has been run on basic material then of course you will find that what ran very arduously before will now run much better it is almost waste of time to run specific terminals but still you must run things that are real to the pc and if only yesterday was real to him then you are stuck with running the pc on later terminals or even specific terminals much faster way to run help than by sorting out real terminals on an emeter which is still necessary sometimes is to do an assessment on the pc using help and the dynamics and finding button that is entirely off dynamic and that the pc cant imagine helping this is trigger to case unusual results happen very fastanother way to go about this is simple questioning of the pc on the subject of his dislikes watch the meter and when you get silly reaction on dislike like rock slam or heavy drop or sudden theta bop then pick this out make general form out of it that registers like the first mention and run that on the pc this is rather loose and sometimes misleading assessment but remember that all help run leads to untangling all buttons and so it is perfectly good approach and as the pc gets run on something he is awful darn sure he ought to be run on he is often very happy and cooperative in this whereas on dynamic assessment he is made intensely curious as he didnt know he was aberrated on what you found out in other words just asking the pc what is wrong with him getting it into general form that registers on the meter and running help ow or concept help on it is good reasonably fast processing it is better than assessing for just terminal that drops or for specific late terminal that drops as comment it should be noted that help is the last thing that folds up in the dwindling spiral of aberration about the first thing that folds up is interest but when it is gone there are still three buttons left on which the person can function the next one to go is communication this becomes contest of overts as in the arc breaky case anybody below this lives his or her life this way the next one to vanish is control so dont be surprised to find somebody around who does plenty of overts and who cant stand control who can yet be run on help and who can still function in life when interest communication control and help are gone thats it you havent got person left so beware people who are below help beware of them in living but in auditing when you cant get help to bite at all and if he can talk to you you can get help to bite you have nothing left but the cchs you can make it on them too but with tremendous investment in hours and when youve got the cchs flat then you can start running help but as i said above i have not yet been able to say the perfect way of running help i am still investigating it like mad and am giving you all the gen as it comes visible however have patience with i have learned that people not only have it twisted bit theyve got it shattered and thats the majority of people so were in there slugging away and were making clears and if i get hold of any faster ways to do youll be

creating making pc invent answers is of course right on his worst button therefore concept help goes long ways on case it is quite unlimited matter what form is run so long as some attention is paid to flow direction flow run too long in one direction gives anatenunconsciousness remember alternate confront concept help however has the liability of making things muggy at times because of its indefiniteness aside from create the primary button that is awry but which cannot be directly attacked without often overshooting the case or involving it in heavy bank reaction the next things mechanically wrong with pc would be unconsciousness and confusion help of course is the primary point of association and identification and is why things go wrong with pc but scale of what is right with pc in descending order of importance would be as above creativeness consciousness order control and these would be flanked by the things wrong with these items which make them decline createirresponsibility consciousnessrefusal to confront orderunwillingness to bring order controllack of control help fits in somewhat on this order one creates to help and fails one goes unconscious to help or makes another unconscious to help himher and fails one sees difficulty for others in too much order seeing that two systems of order clash and lets down his to help one conceives that control is bad and ceases to control and resists control to help others these are all wrong helps apparently and when done bring about aberration aberration consists evidently of wrongway assistance as follows optimum condition response resulting condition creativeness irresponsibility disowned creations consciousness nonconfront unconsciousness orderliness unwilling conflict confusion ability to control consequence of control miscontrol confront is remedy for the consequences of the first three conditions and also communication an auditing session itself by its tr mechanics improves control and communication therefore confront in one form or another is needed in routine sessions havingness is an objective and somewhat obscure method of confronting and using it as we do objectively it is specialized form of confronting possibly its best form objective or subjective even though series of subjective havingness in washington in 1955 tended to show that profile gains were not made by subjective confront conclusion still subject to further checking confront straightens out any mugginess churned up by concept help vast tone arm improvements should be expected from alternate confront but even if it doesnt work well like havingness as primary process it has very good uses alternate confront gives us stabilizing tool pc feels weird run alternate confront hell feel saner following this subjective process with the best objective process havingness we achieve stability for the gains reached by help process as comment beingness is more involved with havingness than with confront confront on short test can be run lopsided and does disturb the tone arm what would you rather not confront run all by itself in one pc bma type test series did very well what can you confront of course did very well alternate confront has enough wrong with it to be poor as process for getting gains but wonderful as process for stabilizing case ill run some more tests on negative confront and let you know but it is fluke by theory it is improbable as it is cousin to the nogood what could you go out of communication with but what could you withhold is the greatest iq raiser known and it works so perhaps negative confront what would you rather not confront will work too of course its fundamental button all unconsciousness stupidity forgetfulness and enforced beingness result from problems in confronting identificationaaaa is as true today as it ever was the inability to differentiate is of course decline in awareness identifying joe with bill or rocks with smoke is loony this is identification word that is amusing semantically as its exact opposite identify is its cure but is the same word association of things or thoughts into classes is considered all right and may even be necessary to learn things but this is the middle ground already half way to lazy thinking help as assistance is an identification of mutual interest in survival thus we have 1 possible confusion of beingness and 2 continuation this makes help ripe for trouble when one fails to help he keeps on helping matter how he does keep on helping what he has failed to help one of many mechanisms is to keep the scene in mockup help is fundamental necessity it appears to every person but it is dynamite when it goes wrong as symptom of its continuance survival factorsee book one pcs running help readily get the idea that help on some terminal will never flatten even though it is flattening nicely to handle this as special item one can run the confront part of session with continuous confront the alternate form of which is what could you continue to confront b what would you rather not continue to confront the positive form can be run alone for case gain and i am going to test the negative form b as single run to see if it can be gotten away with in theory as all anaten is unwillingness to confront and as all help is continuous survival form b negative continuous confront should do marvels for iq and may become the proper companion for help processes if the session is ended with havingness at the present moment auditing routine is presession model session help processes

satisfactory way of making pc happy and getting results is to ask the pc what he thinks is wrong with himher and run whatever the pc saysproviding its terminalin general form if its not terminal get the pc to convert it to one example auditor what do you think is wrong with you pc my wife auditor ok well run wife example auditor what do you think is wrong with you pc im impatient auditor can you think of somebody who was impatient pc my father auditor ok well run father example auditor what do you think is wrong with you pc well i think i am attenuated auditor did you ever know an attenuated person pc yes auditor who was it pc george james auditor since this is specific terminal and we want general one what was george james pc loafer auditor ok well run help on loafer all right pc fine terminals by profession there are however some professional terminals you can run which do lot for case find out what the pc was professionally in this lifetime and sort out what this profession helped as terminal and run that then run the beingness of the pc in this lifetime as terminal and youve cleaned up lot of track always use of course the general form of any terminal not aunt agatha but an aunt not the works mechanic at pulman but works mechanic or mechanic the less adjectives the better this does much for case and rapidly assessment by goalsa pc also gets very happy when you run beingness the pc is trying to be or hopes to be or even once hoped to be for instance the pc wants to be painter or wishes he were painter or wishes he could be painter again fine just run help on painter the pc wanted to be singer run it as singer the pc is trying to be good housewife or husband fine run housewife or husband in short when you explore why the pc wants to be processed the pc often is either trying to correct something wrong see above or is trying to be something your assessment is done when you establish either item and the pc will recover do better and be very happy with you recovery of past skills when pc is getting processed to be able to recall sanskrit or german if the pc is in good shape by reason of other processing as above you can recover it for him by finding out what spoke the language or had the skill and run concept help on that terminal example typical pc cant learn spanish desperately wants to learn spanish emeter will tell you its overts against the spanish people or iberians that occludes it all overts run will improve the situation but help neglecting the overts should recover the ability run think of helping the spanish people or spain or

letter perfectly run i still have research line running and new facts appear thus i will continue to present this data even though it is not for immediate use in processes old action cycles the oldest cycle of action is of course the early vedic hymn probably written by the monk dharma himself so far as i recollect it shows the dawn becoming the day becoming the night and out of nothingness progressive development into new nothingness this has been written as i think the hymn to the dawn child available probably in most libraries as the vedic hymn the next cycle of action is the createsurvivedestroy of early scientology the dominant part of this cycle of course appeared in dianetics as the primary law of book one survive the dynamic principle which motivates most biological life is survive the more fundamental urge of thetan as different from biological existence is create thus in fundamentals of thought the cycle of action becomes createcreatecreatecreate create or countercreate survival is the apparency of creating creation brings about an effort to continuously create which becomes survive double cycles it is interesting now that behaviour particularly as applied to work is easier to understand by closer viewing of the cycle of action there are two double actions in the cycle which give better grasp of the actual value of worker as well as other areas of life these then become valuable at this time as an evaluation of human beings the lowest double action in the cycle is the most difficult to handle when it is present in an organization this is destroy in order to survive we see this most easily today on the fifth dynamic with eating one destroys form in order not to die one kills to live of course this involves some very degrading consequences as it is not duplication out of this we can evolve the overtmotivator sequence duplication would be killing in order to die or making survive in order to survive as soon as one destroys in order to survive he is in miscommunication situation there is duplication possible individuation results the intention is double and contrary one destroys something over there in order not to be destroyed over here the violation of duplication brings about the upset of feeling bad here when one tries to kill therethere are too many workmen who enter this upon the whole programme of work around them machines structures and people collapse such workmen are trying to survive only by destroying everything around them and this reaction is not confined to workmen anyone in an aberrated state may have some tinge of it another double cycle action is to create in order to survive this is fairly sane an artist sometimes will not work unless his survival is threatened then he creates this principle of threatening survival is common to most actions in business and the arts the middle ground double is of course making things survive in order to survive as survival is translated for processing as continuous confront what could you continue to confront rather not continue etc we can find persistences in this category we also see destroy in order to be destroyed and create in order to be created in phases of life probably the worst double is destroying in order to survive and the most susceptible to psychosis is creating in order to destroy science dedicated to the last as weapons people go quite mad and even the farmers decline is found here concept running on these doubles is quite interesting destroying in order to survive is the first concept to be run being the

been obvious that we needed an auditing procedure that would serve to train auditors using for the first time model sessions some weeks ago i developed regimen 1 this was primarily for use in training hgc auditors it has been so sweepingly successful that it is here given for general field use it must be clearly understood that complete session would consist of presessioning the exact use of model sessions and the new techniques that are producing clears regimen 1 then is stopgap bridge between old style formal auditing and complete grasp of pre sessioning and model sessions it is intended when using regimen 1 that the auditor come as close as possible to model session but not be critical of it as regimen 1 is more and more used by the auditor he should continue to study model sessions hco bulletin of february 25 1960 until he can do one letter perfect once he has the model session pat he should then study up on presessioning until he has that perfect naturally all the trs and knowledge of the emeter go into session these with pre sessioning the model session give us an auditing form which should be mastered before complete clearing results become inevitable regimen 1 only regimen 1 can be used until an auditor has excellent results on several pcs assessmentask the pc what is wrong with him take the pcs answer make it into general terminal run that and nothing else when its

what have you done to only regimen 1 omits presessioning it does rough kind of model session as good as one can get but skip being critical of it general requirements naturally there are some general requirements which make up the background music or lack of it in sessions and while there may be many of these four of them are vitally important these are 1 handle pc pleasantly 2 dont chatter at pc 3 get pc to execute every command given 4 run good trs it also goes without saying that one should follow the auditors code in session as well as the code of scientologist out of it so far as the auditors code is concerned the only modern error which keeps repeating itself and coming to attention is evaluation apparently this is because very few newly trained auditors have good grasp of what evaluation is briefly evaluation consists of telling the pc what to think about his case this is something an auditor should never do it is directly contrary to scientology practice and enormously inhibits pcs gains nothing will cause an arc break like an evaluation an example of this is to say good with question mark on it or to say all right as though you dont believe the pc another difficult point in auditing consists of the auditor thinking he has to believe the pc utterly and accept his story completely in order to have any reality with the pc little study of this will demonstrate that one acknowledges what the pc believes he acknowledges it as something which is believed by the pc the auditor is quite entitled to his own opinion of it and quite ordinarily supposes that the pc will change his idea of it after more auditing but this does not mean that one should take what the pc says in state of mind of well thats reality for you but i have my own reality on the situationthere is

assessment the most important part of auditing is assessment this became apparent when i realized that i had assessed all the clears of the 20th acc and most other clears therefore it follows i must have been doing something in assessing that i had never articulated and with the advent of the 1st saint hill acc i managed to do this for dick and jan i have reduced file cabinet of data on assessing not before coordinated to two primary laws as the common denominators of assessing while assessing still requires judgment we now can check proper assessment and can begin to teach accurate assessment this is preliminary paper on the subject the laws of assessment are i thetans reality on terminal depends upon the degree of outflow thetan can tolerate from that class of terminals ii thetan tends to become that on which he has produced nonbeneficial effects thetan tends to move from source beingness to effect beingness iii thetan tends to maintain position on the tone scale where inflows are comfortable and to change that position it is necessary to accustom him by auditing to higher terminals law i the fall registered on the emeter when terminal is mentioned registers the amount of inflow the thetan is aware of when he is not aware of inflow he is totally unreal on it or he is completely aware of the terminal therefore when any terminal is mentioned to pc it will be too forceful b barely tolerable c completely real d too weak ignored the emeter registers on b type terminals with fall it registers on type with rise or reaction it does not register on c type pc has concept of type even though he flinches from it steady needle rise he does not know it he cannot confront on type but may not even realize it pc reacts to b type because it is slightly above his tone scale position but is difficult to confront therefore he can be run with moderate success on any terminal that produces fall pc does not react to type c since he can confront it with comforttype d is so weak that thetan at higher position tends to outflow toward it and thus possibly interiorize into it type terminals are too insignificant to thetan in any given tone scale position and tend to be ignored they are still real law ii thetan moves from source beingness to effect beingness so therefore any time fall is noted on an emeter it can be assumed that the thetan has become an effect beingness it is necessary to find what would create or handle the terminal that caused the fall this is better to run than the fall terminal even though it barely checks rise one runs causative terminals always never effect terminals but what may seem an effect terminal to the auditor may be causative terminal to the preclear law iii always seek to run terminals that do not clear by twoway comm and which are causative to some slight degree to terminals that produce fall on an emeter terminal is improperly assessed if it does not during auditing 1 produce loosening and tightening of needle action 2 produce change of position on the tone arm of at least minimum three tones of difference up or down per hour of auditing 3 produce longer and longer periods of loose needle as the intensives continue 4 produce change of comm lag from command to command in the pc 5 produce cognitions and 6 improve the ability of the case to confront l ron hubbard lrh jsrd copyright 1960 by l ron

now process package which makes mest clears theta clears and ots without further special uses on many cases i hasten to send you the data and ask that you yourself at once get audited on it and audit those persons who are surest and best around you in order to obtain control of areas with the increased ability nothing in this process discards the main line of theory of dianetics and scientology but since results can be obtained so swiftly with it it must be asked that persons uneducated in scientology must not be run too far on it as they will obtain high levels of action without any understanding which would be an overt against them in short do not complete this process on any pc beyond the level of mest clear unless the pc has been sent for course this will save considerable

apparent dynamics on people are inverted from their sixth dynamic and that the theory of confusion and the stable datum is paramount here in the process we remove the confusion and permit the pc to release the various terminals and ideas later assessment and the running of terminals is probably needful the basic process was looked for first in 1951 there was lecture on it called motion and emotion and talk about the governor of pcs speed of advance since then i have had to search very hard and it has taken eight years to match up processes to hit at this i have now done this the rundown is as follows every session presession model session help alternate confront havingness the thing on which help is run is motion the commands are these what motion have you helped what motion have you not helped do not run what motion could you help or any invent process help being responsibility process gives us the only practical way to get the pc to face nonterminal like motionthis is mest clear

missing points in it which i have been filling in in order to clear as many 1st saint hill acc students as possible seeing that students were not obtaining as much tone arm action as hgc auditors would for the same amount of auditing it was necessary to study the fact students audit each other without altitude and so i had to resolve altitude as such altitude is the factor that makes pc receive and execute an auditing command any good auditor in the field and certainly hgc auditors audit from altitude therefore they get more tone arm action and faster clearing students auditing each other audit without altitude as one cant build up the altitude of students to one another it was necessary to reduce the need of altitude on the part of the pc i have developed then new presession step at the level of control to care for altitude it turned out to be possible oneshot clear command this step should be run hard on any pc and very hard on pcs who do not have much effect on their banks many pcs cannot run think command the gradient of cases is the increasing ability to affect the bank with new thought low level case cant high level case can as low level cases also cannot execute an auditing command cleanly without alterations vias or nonexecution it follows that the process run is not in question what is in question is the pcs ability to follow command therefore if tone arm on an emeter does not swing at least through 3 tones in an hour of auditing the pc is not following the command clearly or the pc can produce small effect on his own bank if such condition exists then the pc is allergic to orders and will be slow case or hangfire in auditing the remedy of this is presession process at the level of control the process is presession control processing the commands are what order was disobeyed or b what intention was not followed if does not work go to b in any event eventually run both and b at the level of control in presessioning as this is heavy

possible has given us new weapons for the difficult case and new heights for all cases with evidence of increased speed in processing and easier handling of processes by auditors i have been very busy on this and myself received some eighty hours of processing to iron out commands and get subjective reality by case synthesis on these new approaches i evolved new basic theory of processing from observation of what did not move some acc cases and what did this has been strenuous research period and though by means at end results should now become much easier to obtain in other areas presession two is not composed of new processes but is new combination in 1956 i discovered that talking reduced difficult pcs tone level now it is obvious that significance process moves low graph case therefore presession two is to be used on all cases until pronounced change of tone arm and needle reaction is attained as below presession two cannot be run without good emeter when pc has been steadied at his clear reading by many sessions of presession two then regimen two or three as will be issued may be embarked upon presession two the presession is begun by stating to the pc if it is all right with you we will begin auditing on his assent the auditor says tone 40 start of session we will begin by running havingness here is the first command and gives it discussion is begun or permitted with the pc rudiments chatter the auditor starts briskly and crisply and invites discussion of anything and if any is offered by pc says we will take that up later on in processing right now we have to begin case can be retarded by talk in its first stages therefore talk just processing the havingness process is look around here and find something you could have this is run to loose needle and any closer approach up or down of the tone arm to the clear reading the best action on which to end the process is blow down of the tone arm or blow up in the low tone arm case meaning sudden approach of the arm from non optimum reading toward the optimum read the first blow down or blow up is the signal to change to the second processthe auditor then says i will run two more commands of this and end the process if that is all right with you and then does so when he reaches the last command he says that was the last command of this process is there anything you would care to say before i end the process he acks whatever pc says keeps it brief and then says end of process at once the auditor adds we will now begin alternate confront if that is all right with you here is the first command and gives it the commands of alternate confront are what could you confront what would you rather not confront this process is run to relatively tight or sticky needle and secondarily to an abnormally high or low tone arm as soon as the meter shows the pc is now getting sticky the auditor says i will run two more commands of this and end the process if that is all right with you he does so and says is there anything you would care to say before i end this process the auditor acks whatever pc says keeps it brief and says end of process not tone 40 at once the auditor says we will now begin havingness if that is all right with you he acks pcs consent and does so here is the first command etc the action of the tone arm is the signal to change processesloose needle to change from havingness tight needle to change from alternate confront this may take three minutes to happen on either process or half an hour there is set time it is all done by the emeter one runs these two processes one after the other on and on presession after presession until the tone arm is stabilized at the clear reading then one begins regimen two or three that is the entirety of presession two goals checkout on help control comm ptps arc breaks handled it runs out ptps and arc breaks anyway it is smoothly audited crisply with good trs almost muzzled this will move any case that can go through the action of the commands even if the havingness does not seem real to pc keep pc at it it will become real by and by the alternate confront answers do not have to be subjective but usually will be here is an auditor trick that permits better attention on pcs answers and less command mistakes on alternate command processes when you give the plus command could you put your thumb on your index finger hold it there until it is answered when the minus command rather not is given put your thumb on the second finger tip until it is answered this sets up physical universe tally and keeps one from mucking up the command sequence without having to hold it in mind this permits better observation of the pc if he fogs out and needs the question again thumb position tells the auditor which one it is without recall i have been using this to free up all attention units for observation of pc and meter and find the additional attention helps the pc the thumb system is done unobtrusively of course this may seem bit silly to propose but your auditing attention is for the pc and the state of the meter not holding command like concept the mental holding of the command starts some uncleared auditors into selfaudit during session and may be cause of session selfaudit presession is ended by the auditor asking after his last end of process do you have anything you would like to say before we end this session he can now take up whatever the pc says and gracefully ease the session to close the presession activity is closed by sayingi am now going to end processing for this morning this afternoon today tonight here it is tone 40 end of session he can add now tell i am longer auditing you this morning this afternoon today tonight an auditing presession in actuality presession of this type is session of sorts minus rudiments and end rudiments but in very real actuality i now find pc isnt enough there before he is consistently reading at clear to do anything but cut up his havingness with talk in session his postulates arent sticking well yet he arc breaks unexpectedly any talk by the auditor invites upsets and havingness and alternate confront handle ptps and arc breaks better for somebody who reads off clear than most other processes further as above the more pc talk the more chance for flubs and arc breaks summary presession two is based on the theory that one is taking the 6th dynamic off the seventh dynamic this is opposed to taking the seventh dynamic out of the sixth dynamic theres so much to this and so many mechanical facts involved that im going to write book about it shortly as its too lengthy for bulletins were going right ahead now and make lots of book one clears through the hgcs and the field only these will be whole track book one clears presession two and regimen three are the first process arrangements i have done which require only repetitive commands assessment or judgement of case beyond emeter needle and tone arm readings as assessment and discussion with the pc have been the major impediments to broad modern clearing by others i am happy to be able to remove them it has been quite feat as this

evolved to isolate them from thousands of other good processes and to get them run exactly right in the correct order presession two by the way is not for has coaudit use or any coaudit use where meters are not in every auditors hands it is vital that they be run by meter otherwise these two processes just stall each other coaudit people would just get involved in engrams here and there and be unhappy use help on supervisorassessed terminals in coaudits its good dont run alternate confront run havingness afterwards if you like one further comment on needle action in running presession two the fastest case advance is probably achieved by getting off alternate confront and back to havingness immediately after consistent needle rise or steady creep downward for low arm case sets in steady rise means the pc has just hit something he cant confront the source of rise or steady slow fall for low tone arm its all have from there this requires watchfulness be certain to catch it and return to havingness again each time there is sticky needle coming about all comments on needle and meter reaction in this bulletin are subject to review as the matter is still under study but the above

regimen 3 help on motion alt conf and havingness done in model session regimen 3ii this has been preceded by presessions the presession only is used until pc rides at clear reading with loose needle during session then the presession that cracked the case is combined with help on motion as new regimen 3 this is designated as follows regimen 3v this means that model session is run with help on motion the confront command being that of presession v the havingness command being that of presession v in the model session the sequence of processes is the havingness process the helpmotion process the havingness process the confront process the havingness process the helpmotion process etc the havingness process is run briefly until havingness is up the confront is run until pc is in pt helpmotion is run until pc gets high on the arm or gummy on the needle the following presessions are those that have been effective on one or another of the acc cases more detailed report will be made later presession ii is for fairly easy case presessions v to vii inclusive moved one or another of them all difficult cases presessions viii and ix have not been used but are included for completeness the rule is that if tone arm does not shift more than one division on meter dial in an hour of processing you should try another presession if you have the right one for the case you should get rapid shifts of the tone arm and should flatten it as presession pc reading during its use at clear read and then go into model session using your same presession as the havingness and confront commands of

people that has now emerged as final datum for without an emeter you cannot tell the way it has now developed whether case is really moving or not or whether process is biting this startling fact was proven in the 1st saint hill acc 7th london in late 1959 i began to study the tone arm as means of discovering more data about case year later i can assure you of the following truths 1 case which is not registering rapidly moving tone arm during session is not progressing well 2 case which has wide tone arm movement during processing has not remedied objective havingness 3 extreme low arm and extreme high arm cases only have low objective havingness 4 case should move three tone divisions of the tone arm dial up or down in an hour of processing before it can be considered to be running well 5 if tone arm doesnt change under processing the case is not progressing 6 the keys to moving tone arm are havingness b overts 7 case should be processed on anything else but some form of objective havingness or ow before the tone arm is moving freely 8 extreme high and extreme low tone arm cases alike are unable to have the room of the session 9 extreme high and extreme low tone arm cases alike cannot have the auditor or people 10 until case is made to read around the clear read it should not be processed on anything but havingness ow confront or duplication processes the tone arm tells you by its motion the extent of case advance long before you get another graph inadequate tone arm motion during processing means inadequate case gain if the case isnt gaining try another

in the west he gets to slave for the extreme right if born in the east he slaves for the extreme left should he find anything or invent anything his discovery becomes the boast of leftist or rightist at once he has been persuaded he must deny all further responsibility for his creation and sign over the whole thing for rouble or one dollar to his captors and must remain anonymous and then he must also wear his old school tie and belong to the right society his credentials must always be in order if he invents or discovers anything his credentials are examined first its political use is examined next and then hes given his microcosm of security and sent back to his cell his govemment his society his employer all have managed to insist that these conditions exist and more are normal and fitting if he utters blasphemy such as i feel radiation is not assimilable for babies or science was invented to serve man he is sacked his security is taken roughly away and they tear up his old school tie they say nasty things about him in the papers and glare at his former fellows hoping they start nonsense now when you make man grind enough years at the mouldy texts of yesterdays prejudices he is already on the ropes he is dimly peeping through bad eyesight at myopic world he has been made to feel that if he doesnt treat life like tightrope hell fall and so he is piteously grateful to receive his old school tie he is cringing with gratitude when they offer him anonymous rewards if he destroys mankind thereby by dreaming up bomb he never finds it out he forgot mankind he denied all responsibility for his creation once scientists stood for truth and tried to serve humanity now they serve economics and political creeds why has defence been built against fission because nobody wrote cheque to build it scientifically it is problem only slightly more complex than atom bombs why has scientist started to work on it cheque or cheque can it be they gutted scientists of guts when they perverted newton can it be he or she is coward this scientist can it be pay cheque and old school tie mean more to him than life ah yesi well recall seeking to shame some applecheeked young officers strayed like blinking lambs into manofwar i graded them on their watch standing with and b and c and put gold stars on their records on the bulletin board such was my irony so heavy was my hand as i stood back that finally i could only weep they thanked meso the product of the groupthink the death of the individual in university of today extends further than the scientist slaves it has been said love their chains more so than scientist who sells his tiny spark of soul for pat on the head from political boss and so as the responsibility of the individual for his creation dies so we enter in upon madness of destruction where all human suffering is made available to all the man who would destroy all man for pay not even vengeance is so far below contempt he is longer man but animal beast unclean who cares not what he kills so long as he is fed you want to end the threat of bombs then please awake politics died with victoria government is longer done that way its done not by appeals to men but appeals to their bellies and their fears the world is now controlled by economic groups who debase laws and rewrite texts and so make slaves for anything to happen now enough to end this crazy dance it will be needful to amend mans pride and confidence and teach him he can stand alone on his two feet the recreation of the individual is all thats left matter what you would improve man buys his lies from cowardice afraid to face the truth he cannot view his deathcoming fast for all mankind in companies in every path of life show men they can be free and youll have courage back for them how do i know this about scientists for thirty years ive been maverick an iconoclast each old school tie they sought to hang with i painted its stripes comically and i have watched in thirty years almost every other maverick go down ive seen them denied security given bad notices ive seen them produce brilliant work and have it lie neglected even though their nation bled america had the v2 in 1932 why did she have to import foreign scientist to recover its secret america had helicopters in 1936 why did she copy german machine the fockewulf ten years later america had thousand things she would not buy from men who would not wear the old school tie and bow their heads in abandonment of their creations i was myself once threatened with expulsion from university because i said that students should be allowed to think terrible crime we go into the teeth today we scientologists of the greatest slavery of them all the slavery of thought the battle is not ended yetbut listen weve broken through we today are the only group on earth that is not owned by either camp or any creed we serve flighty masters once there was only sickened sometimes by lying press inspired because i would not be slave but now theres you and you and you sometimes weve lost man or girl but only because they were not brave enough to stand upon mountain top and say im i think i feel i am slave come on be free but even in our very trying days we still kept most of us and now we grow into crowd whose mutters shake the cornerstone of prisons and weve won technology why should i give you sales talks now upon every continent an hgc is turning people into clearswere winning or why should the press begin again to growl on one hand on the stands we read that grayayayt university now believes that iq can change while in the same day huge scientific group says we are good our hands lie heavily on destiny yours and mine weve turned downward trend upward again and so as we mount higher be clever and understand whats happening attacks in press and elsewhere will mount up upon upon us violence just entheta and money lots of money will be sent to scream out more and more be gratified their hysteria is our index of win nothing less pity the poor slave master there in his extreme right or extreme left den hes penned successfully the cream of brains and wit and just as he licks his chops to say youre now all slaves mighty host cries back who us and strikes the fetters from his prey poor fellows commissar gulpski and capitalistic grab will have to unite to have quorum in their caves oh its mad dream politics is dead economics now dominates the world and we sit laughing with technology to undo all their buttons and their charms as we improve organisations we will improve people and as we improve people we make men brave and then at last the slave looks down and says why what are these chains and shakes them off the vested interest of the world since its beginning made but one mistake they thought that punishment and hard duress were all that made man work but man just worked so long as he could help and when his wares were turned to bringing hate and death he struck until someone you and give back his willingness to help the world like tired wheels will grind down to stop it is an overt act by you and to leave in power any group that denies men freedom knowing what we know therefore attack we are the only men and women left on earth who are longer slaves and we are now all past the point in knowledge and in numbers where we will wear their chains the men who need us most are the slave masters we will get around to them last i think it is more fitting so ps and now do you wonder why the mutter grows scientologists are dangerous but

duplication after several years of trying to find the precise mechanics of havingness i think ive come very close havingness is apparently the willingness and ability to duplicate in all senses of the word it also has many lesser connotations but the havingness ability of pc apparently depends upon his willingness and ability to duplicate again in all senses of the word that which makes communication work in processes is the duplication part of the communications formula axiom 28 the position of being on the tone scale is determined by his willingness and ability to duplicate the lower the tone of the being the less willing the being is to permit similar incidents to happen again this outlaws the experience factor and leaves the being with an experiencescarcity which causes him to refuse further experience all this is remedied by objective havingness processes objective duplication increase the bank additionally must be adjusted by subjective confront processes subjective duplication increase case will not advance appreciably until the being can remedy objective havingness objective havingness the ability to remedy it determines the entrance point of case before process to improve pcs objective havingness is well established the case will not advance matter what else is run after process that remedies objective havingness is sufficiently established to bring the emeter tone arm down to the clear read for the pcs sex the case will advance on confront and help and other processes so long as objective havingness is re established frequently objective havingness is probably incapable of making case totally stable in the absence of other subjective processes as havingness is the willingness to duplicate room objects axiom 28 then anything which improves the pcs ability to duplicate improves his or her havingness if verbal process after considerable test of various verbal command objective havingness processes fails to work the pc may be run on the new presession xxxi or cch 3 or cch 4 or both cch 3 and cch 4 various old mimicry processes have some workability and we now know why they are duplication processes and work only because they raise havingness i feel sort of slow on this one it took six years to find and establish it but it gives us now the entrance point of all cases this is why they did or did not make gains they could or could not remedy objective havingness possibly by 1st saint hill acc case standards only some 25 out of 40 pcs are not able to run look around here and find something you could have and successfully remedy their havingness without havingness undercuts being used therefore this is critical point in cases and demands care at the very start of case an objective havingness process must be found for every case which will reduce or increase the tone arm to clear read for the pcthirtyseven new havingness processes now exist use them people go out of present time because they cant have the mest of

difficulty in south africa getting cases started as these have included the roughest cases in scientology you can see that my confidence in processing as it exists right now is well taken the only difficulty i am having is compliance with auditing rundown and this is not much of barrier as in general the south african staff auditor is very good so d of ps be warned if cases arent moving today with the following rundown in use look for gross auditing errors this is what i am using on all cases check for the havingness process if the one that works is found it will loosen the meter needle and bring the tone arm toward not necessarily to the clear read for the pcs sex the right havingness process will do this in dozen commands so only use dozen commands to test each havingness process if the process doesnt work in 12 commands which is to say doesnt loosen the needle then skip it and go to the next for test if you have found the havingness process for the case and it ceases to work after session or two look for arc breaks ptps between sessions with these cleaned up the havingness process will start working again rule the makebreak point of any case is getting the case to run consistently on an objective havingness process gains will be stable unless an objective havingness process is established for it and used often in sessions rule when havingness process ceases to work arc breaks and ptps must be cleaned up before the havingness process will work again in clearing up ptps and arc breaks use only ow on related terminals which is the havingness version rule case must be prepared and repaired with ow to make havingness process work exception if havingness process is not clearly established in few hours not more than ten revert to failed help only to prepare case to run havingness process i have been shaking the case down for withholds as follows run what question shouldnt i ask you until needle longer quivers in response even though meter sensitivity is increased to 16 run what have you done what have you withheld general form until needle is unresponsive and tone arm moves toward clearif case does not respond well if case gives thinkingness answers for mass i at once go to failed help failed help this is the best casecracking process now known i have worked with it since 1957 as line of examination and it emerges as the lowest verbal entrance process therefore this process is very important one help is actually the most effective version of taking responsibility when ow will not run well when the case just doesnt respond on the meter even though giving out with hair raising overts the responsibility button is out this is recovered by failed help failed help is run in this fashion alternately who have you failed to help what have you failed to help twoway comm on failed help is not always well handled the auditor should not direct the pcs attention to time periods or terminals the process is run permissively all cases will run on failed help it is oneshot clear process but used exclusively it introverts too hard havingness must be discovered as process and run as havingness is the makebreak point of the case to go further here is the proceeding so far for average cases try for havingness if you find it go on to locate the right confront process if you have the havingness and the confront assess for good general whole track terminal using the havingness and the confront liberally run alternate help on the terminal found typical session thereafter is run with model session form all in one session 1st process objective havingness 2nd process alternate help on the assessed terminal 3rd process the objective havingness process 4th process the confront process 5th process the objective havingness process 6th process alternate help on the terminal 7th process the objective havingness process 8th process alternate help 9th process the objective havingness process how long to run each run havingness always to loose needle and ta nearer clear run alternate help or confront process to tight needle and pc near present time cyclic aspect if needle gets very sticky and ta ceases to move well on the confront or help get over to havingness fast run havingness only until needle is loose and case feels better dont run havingness as the process that solves the case run havingness only as the process that stabilizes the case havingness runs to loose needle all other processes run to tight needle all processes except objective havingness if they are working make the ta move if the ta doesnt move the process isnt working run havingness and try againpoor cases if havingness cannot be found at once go into what question and ow then try to find havingness be very careful to keep arc breaks and ptps cleaned up find the confront process and proceed as in an average case low cases if pc is diffident about having auditing if pc critical of others if pc arc breaks easily if pc favours significances over objects start in with failed help as above and try as above to get case up to havingness patch up case frequently with failed help ows keep the case running and the havingness established and effective the difference between averagepoor cases and low cases is that one keeps up the havingness with ow in the averagepoor and in the low case keeps havingness running with failed help and ows this should get some understanding around i believe as of now that there are impossible cases if case wont talk or be audited as chronic condition not just as result of arc breaks we still have the cchs the lions say

franchise holders failed help probably the most sensational case cracker of all time is failed help in that the pc has many times tried to help his own case and failed the most accessible button is failed help this is run as who have you failed to help what have you failed to help alternately more difficult cases run on either one or the other it can be distracting when the pc hits an automaticity on who or what however even the alternate version will win this flattens ptps and arc breaks so on very low case whose havingness is down the rudiments may be omitted the first few sessions failed help may also be run on terminal if the pc is always having ptps with certain type of terminal woman man etc then failed help can be run in specific or general fashion how have you failed to help your wife this is run repetitively or how could you fail to help woman lower dichotomy could be run in this fashion how could you prevent help how could you fail to help this last pair are experimental they would be run alternately while running failed help one should attempt every now and then to find the pcs havingness process if the pcs havingness process cannot be found even with overts off run failed help as above but continue to search for the havingness process at least once session if failed help is running very well indeed do not chop into it to search for the havingness process do that toward the end of the session quarter of division of the tone arm in three hours auditing is good shift for low case on failed help do not expect big changes at first as any failed help run is good its all right to make an error and use it on cases that could have better gains on something else cases that dont need it move the least on the tone arm with it one has yet run 75 hours of failed help on previous cch case so i cannot tell you how much it will take or how far it will go but i would be prepared to run 75 hours of it of the whowhat version on case before it could run havingness process this is marvellous process i thoroughly recommend it just be careful not to lay in arc breaks and try to keep the case coaxed along and i think youll make it with some

sussex hco bulletin of 10 november 1960 franchise holders formula 13 i am having very good luck undercutting beginning or old unmoving cases in scientology by using new formula called formula 13 this consists of running failed help as the confront process and ow on specific present time terminals as the havingness process failed help is almost the lowest rung of help processes it is run with the commands who have you failed to help what have you failed to help alternated theres lower help process than this that is who have you intended not to help who have you helped but this is not formula 13 overt withhold is havingness process this comes about since havingness is duplication and one will not care to duplicate what he has overts against therefore the source of low havingness is overts against people and mest it might be commented that overts against mest are more important than against people in the reduction of havingness but this again is not formula 13 the essence of running formula 13 is running in model session form little failed help with ow on present time terminal it is done in this fashion one opens the session even uses presession i if needed does rudiments using ow to clear ptps and arc breaks and then does about ten minutes on failed help then he makes an assessment from prepared list of people the pc knows in pt and assesses for needle fall on one of these then ow is run on that specific person until the fall vanishes regardless of ta position and returns to failed help for ten minutes or so then reassesses for pt terminal from his list until he finds one that falls and flattens ow on this and then runs failed help and so on it will be found that this is the best case undercutter for general use i have so far developed it is generally recommended and urged for all hgcs formula 13 is followed by finding the havingness process then the confront process and then regimen three is used assessing for general terminal and with the havingness and

is to have the pc squeeze the cans before the 1st command of havingness squeeze the cans after 5 commands if the drop is greater on the second squeeze the havingness is working if havingness tightens

session this is factor often lost in processing unless an auditor is aware of the definition for in session and uses it very low slow results will occur the key to fast high results is pc in session there are various degrees of being out of session the most severe of these is the person who refuses auditing the answer is usually old presession one help control communication interest the next degree is sitting in the chair but refusing to answer questions presession one or its twoway help part is generally the answer failed help is useful tool here the next degree is sitting in the chair and being uncooperative or even choppy the best answer is presession one or twoway help now in all the above out of sessions is meant the pc coming to have processing for the first time there are similar aspects from different causes during session pc used to processing can go out of session in varying degrees pc who refuses to answer questions is suffering from an arc break or has withhold if its an arc break then run ow on the auditor or better run ow on an auditor if the pc appears vague or nervous its probably ptp and the specific terminal or terminals connected with it should be run on ow the withhold case can be handled with what have you done what have you withheld alternated the definition of in session is interested in own case b willing to talk to the auditor when either of these is violated the pc is out of session and is receiving benefit from processing for the beginning pc these two factors must be established if the above remedies do not suffice then the auditor must run by definition the auditor must find something in the pcs case in which the pc is interested and something about which the pc will talk to the auditor an emeter will fall on things that the pc is interested in and will talk about if case already accustomed to processing goes out of session the rudiments long ago were designed to get the pc running again rudiments can be used at any time during session all the clever processes in the world will fail if the pc is out of session it is high sign of auditing skill to get the pc into sessionwhich is to say interested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor there is an exception to case interestwhen the pc goes upscale on any one process he or she will hit boredom before enthusiasm dont stop at that point go on even if pc infers it will slay him or her with boredom the period of time they hang up in this is briefa few minutes or at most sessiondiscussions of people the prospective or out of session beginning pc has failed to help usually solves this difficulty here is lower pointpeople the pc intended not to help but however they get started start them and get them into session before you worry too much about

for clearing on it has coaudits are out because they may mess up the only processes known that will clear people at individual processing level thus barring the road b instructors have not noted or realized the stress done cases when they had to hold on to heavy overts thus making the person blow scientology c they do not procure well in comparison to other activities now under development by in

then ow comes into vogue as method of enforcing peace ow is theory which sets in when aberration sets in it is not high natural law it is junior to the various laws of communication control and help ow can occur only when help has failed help is cojoining of vectors of life when two beings who have joined forces to help fail each other only then does ow come into existence the forces of two

miscommunication control miscontrol help failed help overts and withholds overts and withholds by transfer worrying others worrying about others being critical being critical of self basically ow is an effort to regain the status of independent being without taking responsibility for any of the intervening steps the reason we run ows is that most pcs are on ow by transfer which is to say when they kick george in the head they get headache themselves this makes them think they are george we use ow since it explains phenomena found at low humanoid level we do not use it because it is senior governing law of the universe when help comes up ow as mechanism drops out we could run full case it would appear with help however in practice it is better to run lots of ow with failed help as they complement each other and move the case faster by running ow we disclose many newfailed helps why look at the cycle above and see that ow occurs only when help has failed similarly on the same cycle we see that worry undercuts ow but if it is run it should be worked with ow the worry cure has commands as follows get the idea of worrying something get the idea of not worrying something get the idea of something being worrisome people animals things can be used in place of something the process going rapidly up toward failed help is bit limited and should be run with another process of the type of get the idea of attacking something get the idea of not attacking something to keep it going the worry process bogs if run too long just by itself it is very valuable process as it explains many reactions and undercuts many cases worrying something is close to the lowest level of overt it is the lowest effort to individuate but just as worry is not way of life nor an answer to all of life neither is the ow mechanism an endall law many cases are not up to recognizing their overts they will also have trouble recognizing their failures to help usually then they can recognize being worried or worrying people and thinking unkind thoughts and even attacking things failed help also lies as harmonic below ow and so runs on any case if assisted with w as in formula 13 or assisted with the worry process as above worrying people is almost way of life for the juvenile just as ow is with criminal people who feel childish or act that way are stuck in the violent motion of childhood

bring about confusion of identities this is normally resolved by thetan by obsessive efforts to individuate blow phenomena or merely insistences upon individuation the end product of failures to help is aberrated selfdeterminism at an overtwithhold level the thetan is trying to individuate and is therefore proceeding to individuate after failing to help thus thetan is at obsessive cause while trying to do overts or get motivators as i have stated before it makes little theoretical difference whether help is run twoway or on an ow basis i also promised to inform you when more data was to be had on this apparently there may be some virtue in terms of case gain and saved time in running help on pandetermined basis the theoretical look at this see recent table in hco bulletin of january 5th 1961 ow limited theory is that overts are below help and that when one enters upon an improvement in help obsessive individuated cause falls out and pandeterminism moves in possibly very early in running help at regimen 3 level one could run help ow but after few hours on the same terminal could shift to twoway help and after few more hours could change to 5way help and finish the bulk of the 75 hours of run of help on the same terminal with the 5way version i think not doing this is slowing clearing in other words when the pc starts on his help on terminal he is still rather in the ow band very soon he is moving higher and into pandeterminism and shortly after this should move very broadly into pandeterminism my evidence on this is technically light at the moment but i do know of

is to end the session and let him call his wife when the session is resumed you start the session again and go to where you were in the rudiments and ask do you have present time problem if the pc has present time problem of being excused you would not in this case end the session as he will remain in the building and be back shortly the process of handling the present time problem of short

of the havingness scale in auditing is as follows havingness is the makebreak point of case before havingness can be tested for all heavy areas on the lower part of the scale must be flat the most elementary use of the scale and the one recommended at this time is to assess the points on the scale upwards until fall is observed and then to run this fall out then to assess again from the bottom until fall is observed and run it out all auditing to be done in model session form the assessment follows either after the rudiments or after discovered button has been flattened the upper nine points of the scale are best run as regimens from help upwards i have not accumulated cases using this type of approach on this scale but i feel by past experience that it should catch even those cases that failed help hasnt reached i do not know how long it should take to flatten one button on this scale i would guess from failed help down that it would take few hours per button probably this will develop into running pairs as in all formulas but until it is established how that should be done the above simple system should be used l ron hubbard lrhaecjh copyright 1961 by l ron hubbard all

also had chance to study the uk case somewhat as the country is full of english people fresh from home and ive already had years of experience with it in england i believe that clearing uk case easily requires between finishing off the formulas and starting the regimen lot of scs or 8c the havingness found effective for the case control seems to get inverted on uk case more easily than on some other nationalities and i think the inversion must be cleared up before help as in regimen 3 can be effectively run this isnt criticism on the uk case its just an effort to speed up clearing close study indicates that the uk case tends strongly to alteris command its wonder looking over the countrys history that commands got dangerous therefore in the hgc in london i am now going to require an addition to procedure for clearing as follows when the formulas are gotten out of the way and while still running failed help between tests for havingness the havingness is found period of at least fortyfive hours is instituted where the pc is run on scs or 8c interspersed with few commands of his havingness every half hour the last five hours will be run on opprobydup only when this is done will the auditor locate the confront and then continue with regimen 3 if test by the auditor on any case regardless of nationality shows that the pc is poor on control the above routine should be followed this data is backed up by enormous success with scs and opprobydup in england and the general success of 8c i have been looking for the bug in uk clearing for some time and feel that this is its remedy scs scs now has four stages instead of three it has been found that at least one pc never flattened start because the body was already started being in constant motion and so the pc never could start it the added command is when i tell you to stand still i want you to make that body stand still all right stand still the remainder of scs is as always lrh jmsrd l ron hubbard copyright

flux to the degree that person is creating and countercreating thats what thetans attention gets fixed on the creates or the counter creates all other things ruds havingness processes etc fall into line on that understanding the case is fixed on or fluctuating amongst the masses and energies it has created the things that put them out of existence or make them unreal are of course created by the case the person is at war with himself thats why an attack process works its countercreate most cases especially downscale are more dedicated to countercreation than creation the case is in state of unreality about the fact that hes doing it mocking up things on which he is then fixing his attention sometimes person may know hes doing it or not doing it but often thetans dont know that they are creating what they are fighting so you could have level of processing of doingness on creating eg what wouldnt you mind creating would you rather not create were dealing strongly with havingness these days with success the axiom of aberration is all doingness harms self doingness processes address this fact you could ask what liability would there be to doing something or what could you do which wouldnt be harmful to you this could fall flat because the person is doing so many more complicated things that he has to come up to these basics this process is too high for most cases beingness processes are relatively easy to run you could run an engram with what in that incident would you be willing to be the pc must have the ability to be something before this would be workable process some people cant be anything so you have to test for this with look around here and find something you could be you could develop the whole rationale of processing at the level of beingness or doingness or havingness though they must eventually merge all three are needed if pc doesnt move just with elementary rudiments ta change of case its probable that the pc is withholding some big recent overt or the pc may have some unusual or secret goal not imparted to the auditor or the trouble may be big ptp so in going over case on the basis of rudiments one takes it easy until one finds out that the havingness scale as you have been taught to use it doesnt move the ta why ask for trouble before youve got it you go over the ruds pretty well wild drops go on in search of the prehav level find where the pc lives get one of his principal goals aligned convert it into terminal which drops as well as the goal dropped assess the prehav scale with that terminal then run anything that fits that level the commands are what was _______ for positive and what _______ failed for negative for terminal its eg what terminal was _______ and what terminal failed to _______ or what terminal was not these are the all bracket commands they could be repeated for each level you could run 15 brackets against the prehav scale when has terminalactionterminal there are possibilities of 32way brackets but fiveway is enough more details on prehav running if pc isnt interested in the process the ruds are out as its an interesting process so beat the ruds to death if you cant solve it with ruds run cchs the pc needs this when he cant control attention and your command isnt reaching him noeffect case on whom command has anything to do with him etc totally on automatic etc so use cchs to give them an example that control and duplication can exist and to increase their alertness havingness and effectiveness ten to twentyfive hours of cchs must be done with good auditor control and presence if the auditor cant impinge on the pc however and has auditor presence even cchs wont work since they depend on impingement lrh impinges more than most auditors because of his certainty that something will happen and his not being scared to confront the pc to lrh its personal affront if the pc isnt movinghe can even get bad research results because even when using process that shouldnt work his postulate that the case should change and his wanting to do something for the pc will cause the process to work so he depends on hgc results etc to test processes just asking the pc questions can do tremendous amount for the pc dont underestimate what auditor presence confidence and interest can do cchs depend on auditor presence more than any other process maybe 6 percent wont get gains because of needing cchs the rest have ruds out if they dont win on goals and prehav more data on goals and prehav running the havingness processes are arranged in order of their frequency of effectiveness command that works on cases that have relatively uncontrolled banks and cant run engrams is where is _______ frequently person with low havingness is in universe of objects that are mad at him etc as you run what is the emotion of that object the object goes downscale and the pc cuts in across the bottom and goes upscale when hes upscale about the object the process is flat this havingness process can change when emotion disappears out of the physical universe to what is the condition of that object if the havingness process stops loosening the needle first check to see if there is an arcb about the command and then if not find new havingness process other processes are tr10 notice that indicated object what arent you putting into it good outside process is what is the condition of that person when you get rise on can squeeze the pc may have heavy withholds maybe inverted interest and wont liecheck perhaps the havingness test would be how much less does the needle rise in this case if the case arcbs all the time you can run who would i have to be to audit you the prehav scale running runs subjective havingness the hav processes run objective havingness the

because of specific processes this is handy script of the patter of model session use it dont vary it know it by heart it is the mark of well trained auditor by making all patter the same later sessions run out earlier sessions this does not enjoin against twoway comm but reduce auditor comments and chatter in sessions if you want smooth results and arc breaks start of session auditor is it all right with you if i begin this session now pc yes auditor acknowledges start of session tone 40 note 1 if pc says auditor twoway comms concerning objections then asks again is it all right with you if i begin this session now note 2 if pc is doubtful as to whether the session has started auditor has this session started for you pc auditor acknowledges start of session tone 40 then now has

note 7 if during clearing of the command or failure of needle to react it seems that the pc will not be able to handle or do the announced process profitably auditor says according to what we have been talking about it would seem better if i ran name another process end of process 1 cyclical auditor wishing to end process where are you now on the time track pc answers auditor acknowledges if it is all right with you i will continue this process until you are close to present time and then end this process pc answersauditor acknowledges auditor continues the process asking after each pc answer when until the pc is close to present time pc answers close to present time auditor acknowledges that was the last command is there anything you would care to say before i end this process pc answers auditor acknowledges end of process 2 noncyclical auditor if it is all right with you i will give this command two more times and then end this process pc answers auditor acknowledges and gives the command two more times pc answers auditor acknowledges is there anything you would care to say before i end this process pc answers auditor acknowledges end of process note 7a the cyclical ending is only used on terminals that exist also in present time or when pc is going into the past in his answers it is not used after pc says he is in present time noncyclical is used when the pc is running terminals which do not exist in present time or when the cyclic aspect can be neglected repeated commands auditor gives command pc i dont know i cant find and answer auditor acknowledges i will repeat the auditing command repeats the command note 8 if pc still cannot answer twoway comm to discover why cognition auditor gives command pc not having answered command yet say that mass in

the purpose of rudiments must be what is called problem of short duration problem of long duration such as goal or psychosomatic difficulty is not handled as in rudiments but in proper session and will emerge in the normal course of assessing sop goals note 19 if any rudiment difficulty can be blown with very small amount of twoway comm process is run note 20 only the meter reaction shows if the environment arc break withhold or ptp is still in existence in all questions of whether something is blown or not or if terminal is flat or if the process is flat take what the meter says if it is different from what the pc says the meter knows even if the pc says something else note 21 after running process on rudiment because meter reaction showed it should be run always ask the rudiment question again before bridging to end the process if it still reacts audit the process further do not abandon rudiment until the meter gives reaction to the question note 22 always get an answer to every auditing command note 23 never expect two answers for one question even in doing an assessment note 24 it is not obligatory for the pc to actually set goals he must always be asked he cannot be forced to do so ordinarily when he does not care to set goals for this part of the rudiments he is suffering from an arc break note 25 follow the auditors code l ron hubbard lrh jlrd copyright 1961 by

elimination as the only weak spot in sop goals is assessing for the right goal and terminal i have given this lot of study and am utilizing something new i have observed that should cancel out any doubts about rightness in the auditors mind do all sop goals steps in model session form this gives you two cracks at the withholds and arc breaks if in doubt about how the pc is standing up to long assessment end the session give pc short break and start new session goals list to do goals get pc to give you every goal he or she can think of then start using the meter to find goals and keep on finding goals until when you ask for one you get drop on the meter in other words look for goals like you look for withholds ask for secret goals withheld goals antisocial goals childhood goals goals youve just remembered silly goals goals youve failed at your resulting list may be as long as hundred or more or as short as fifty just clear the meter on the subject make sure you write down every goal you get now to assess the goals tell pc he or she doesnt have to answer aloud and start reading the goals off to the pc write down how much each goal fell by divisions or fractions of divisions lightly cross out every goal that does not fall go over list to pc again still watching needle read off to pc every goal that fell before you will find some of these have gone nul mark present divisions of fall for each goal cross out every goal that now does not fall read remaining goals off to pc mark divisions they fell and cross out those that went nul read now the goals that remain and cross out those that go nul keep doing this until you have only two or three goals discuss these with the pc they may be all the same goal get better definition of the goal now read the remaining goals to pc and cross out the ones that go nulyou will have at least one heavily falling goal left that does not go nul on two way comm this of course has to be run this assessment is assessment of goals by elimination terminal list we have the goal now to get the terminal we get the pc to suggest terminals that represent this goal we have found we keep on urging the pc to give us more terminals for that goal we list every terminal the pc thinks up we are not content until we have list of about thirty possible terminals we now treat this list exactly as we did the goals list we read the list to the pc marking divisions of fall and crossing out terminals that dont fall now we take the uncrossedout terminals and read these to the pc we mark divisions they fall and cross out those that longer fall we keep doing this until we are left with one terminal this is our terminal the only way it will nul is by auditing this is terminal assessment by elimination commands are pretty easy to get the best command is the fiveway bracket as follows you terminal terminal you terminal another another terminal terminal terminal the how type of command is very good the additional data on terminals commands is to add bad or badly at the inverted levels on the prehavingness scale you should add waste below failed abandon you should add regret shame and blame going upwards from somewhere

unit of time not as blur with other questions and to acknowledge it and to teach him how to shift from one question to another with communication bridge rather than an abrupt change training stress one question and student acknowledgement of its answer in one unit of time which is then finished to keep student from straying into variations of command to insist on communication bridge when question is changed even though the same question is asked it is asked as though it had never occurred to anyone before to teach student that communication bridge consists of getting three agreementsone agreement to end this question second agreement to continue session in general and maintain arc third agreement to begin new question teach student that preclear is part of these

instructor student must handle originations to satisfaction of coach position student and coach sit facing each other comfortable distance apart purpose to teach student not to be tonguetied or startled or thrown off session by originations of preclear and to maintain arc with preclear throughout an origination training stress the student is taught to hear origination and do three things 1 understand it 2 acknowledge it and 3 return preclear to session if the coach feels abruptness or too much time consumed or lack of comprehension he corrects the coach into better handling history

the auditor makes simple hand motion holding his hand or hands in the final position the coach bobs his head as having received it the coach then mirrorwise makes the same motion with his hand or hands the student then acknowledges if the motion was not correctly done by coach the student acknowledges doubtfully then repeats the motion to the coach if the coach does it well student thanks coach by shaking own two hands together prize fighter fashion keep motions simple student must always be able to duplicate own motions position student and coach are seated facing each other at short distance coachs knees inside students purpose to educate student that verbal commands are not entirely necessary to make student physically telegraph an intention to show student necessity of having preclear obey commands training stress accuracy of student repeating own commands teaching student to give preclear wins teaching student that an intention is different from words history developed by

substituting word supervisors for instructors adding the words command to tr 3 and substituting the words and coachs remarks about self as pc in tr 4 in place of and remarks aimed only at the student due to the following factors i have modernized trs 0 to 4 1 the auditing skill of any student remains only as good as he can do his trs 2flubs in trs are the basis of all confusion in subsequent efforts to audit 3 if the trs are not well learned early in the hpahca bscnhcs courses the balance of the course will fail and supervisors at upper levels will be teaching not their subjects but trs 4 almost all confusions on meter model sessions and sop goals stem directly from inability to do the trs 5 student who has not mastered his trs will not master anything further 6 sop goals will not function in the presence of bad trs the preclear is already being overwhelmed by process velocity and cannot bear up to tr flubs without arc breaks academies were tough on trs up to 1958 and have since tended to soften comm courses are not tea party these trs given here should be put in use at once in all auditor training in academy and hgc and in the future should never be relaxed seven weeks

1961 name confronting preclear commands none position student and coach sit facing each other comfortable distance apart about three feet purpose to train student to confront preclear with auditing only or with nothing the whole idea is to get the student able to hold position three feet in front of preclear to be there and not do anything else but be there training stress have student and coach sit facing each other neither making any conversation or effort to be interesting have them sit and look at each other and say and do nothing for some hours student must not speak fidget giggle or be embarrassed or anaten it will be found the student tends to confront with body part rather than just confront or to use system of confronting rather than just be there the drill is misnamed if confront meansto do something to the pc the whole action is to accustom an auditor to being there three feet in front of preclear without apologizing or moving or being startled or embarrassed or defending self after student has become able to just sit there for two hours bull baiting can begin anything added to being there is sharply flunked by the coach twitches blinks sighs fidgets anything except just being there is promptly flunked with the reason why patter student coughs coach flunk you coughed start this is the whole of the coachs patter as coach patter as confronted subject the coach may say anything or do anything except leave the chair the students buttons can be found and tromped on hard any words not coaching words may receive response from the student if the student responds the coach is instantly coach see patter above supervisors should have coaches let student have some wins coach does not mention these and then by gradient stress get the coaches to start in on the student to invite flunks and then flunk them this is bull baiting the student flunks each time he or she reacts matter how minutely to being baited this tr should be taught roughroughrough and not left until the student can do it training is considered satisfactory at this level only if the student can be three feet in front of person without flinching concentrating or confronting with regardless of what the confronted person says or does history developed by l ron hubbard in washington in march 1957 to train students to confront preclears in the absence of social tricks or

coach says start says good without new start if the command is received or says flunk if the command is not received start is not used again thats it is used to terminate for discussion or to end the

knows it was heard ask student from time to time what was said curb over and under acknowledgement let student do anything at first to get acknowledgements across then even him out teach him that an acknowledgement is stop not beginning of new cycle of communication or an encouragement to the preclear to go on to teach further that one can fail to get an acknowledgement across or can fail to stop pc with an acknowledgement or can take pcs head off with an acknowledgement patter the coach says start reads line and says flunk every time the coach feels there has been an improper acknowledgement the coach repeats the same line each time the coach says flunk thats it may be used to terminate for discussion or terminate the session start must be used to begin new coaching after thats it history

l ron hubbard number tr 3 revised 1961 name duplicative question purpose to teach student to duplicate without variation an auditing question each time newly in its own unit of time not as blur with other questions and to acknowledge it to teach that one never asks second question until he has received an answer to the one asked commands do fish swim or do birds fly position student and coach seated comfortable distance apart training stress one question and student acknowledgement of its answer in one unit of time which is then finished to keep student from straying into variations of command even though the same question is asked it is asked as though it had never occurred to anyone before the student must learn to give command and receive an answer and to acknowledge it in one unit of time the student is flunked if he or she fails to get an answer to the question asked if he or she fails to repeat the exact question if he or she q and as with excursions taken by the coachpatter the coach uses start and thats it as in earlier trs the coach is not bound after starting to answer the students question but may comm lag or give commenting type answer to throw the student off often the coach should answer somewhat less often the coach attempts to pull the student in to q and or upset the student example student do fish swim coach yes student good student do fish swim coach arent you hungry student yes coach flunk when the question is not answered the student must say gently ill repeat the auditing question and do so until he gets an answer anything except commands acknowledgement and as needed the repeat statement is flunked unnecessary use of the repeat statement is flunked poor command is flunked poor acknowledgement is flunked q and is flunked as in example student misemotion or confusion is flunked student failure to utter the next command without long comm lag is flunked choppy or premature acknowledgement is flunked lack of an acknowledgement or with distinct comm lag is flunked any words from the coach except an answer to the question start flunk good or thats it should have influence on the student except to get him to give repeat statement and the command again by repeat statement is meant ill repeat the auditing command start flunk good and thats it may not be used to fluster or trap the student any other statement under the sun may be the coach may try to leave his chair in this tr if he succeeds it is flunk the coach should not use introverted statements such as i just had cognition coach divertive statements should all concern the student and should be designed to throw the student off and cause the student to lose session control or track of what the student is doing the students job is to keep session going in spite of anything using only command the repeat statement or the acknowledgement the student may use his or her hands to prevent blow leaving of the coach if the student does anything else than the above it is flunk and the coach must say so history developed by l ron hubbard in london in april 1956 to overcome variations and sudden changes in sessions revised 1961 by l ron hubbard the old tr had comm bridge as part of its training but this is now part of and is taught in model session and is longer needed at this level auditors have been frail in getting their questions answered this tr was redesigned to improve that frailty number tr 4 revised 1961 name preclear originations purpose to teach student not to be tonguetied or startled or thrown off session by originations of preclear and to maintain arc with preclear throughout an origination commands the student runs do fish swim or do birds fly on coach coach answers but now and then makes startling comments from prepared list given by instructor student must handle originations to satisfaction of coach position student and coach sit facing each other at comfortable distance aparttraining stress

comprehension he corrects the student into better handling patter all originations concern the coach his ideas reactions or difficulties none concern the auditor otherwise the patter is the same as in earlier trs the students patter is governed by 1 clarifying and understanding the origin 2 acknowledging the origin 3 giving the repeat statement ill repeat the auditing command and then giving it anything else is flunk the auditor must be taught to prevent arc breaks and differentiate between vital problem that concerns the pc and mere effort to blow session tr 3 revised flunks are given if the student does more than 1 understand 2 acknowledge 3 return pc to session coach may throw in remarks personal to student as on tr 3 students failure to differentiate between these by trying to handle them and coachs remarks about self as pc is flunk students failure to persist is always flunk in any tr but here more so coach should not always read from list to originate and not always look at student when about to comment by originate is meant statement or remark referring to the state of the coach or fancied case by comment is meant statement or remark aimed only at student or room originations are handled comments are disregarded by the student history developed by l ron hubbard in london in april 1956 to teach auditors to stay in session when preclear dives out revised by l ron hubbard in 1961 to teach an auditor more about handling origins and preventing arc breaks as tr 5 is also part of the cchs it can be disregarded in the comm course trs despite its appearance on

cenocon franchise change processes i have been studying change processes in relation to the tendency of the pc to alteris commands and have found that if pc is bad off on change which includes about eighty per cent of the pcs you get he cannot run another auditing command cleanly as he never really runs the command but runs something else therefore the only thing that can be run is change process and it must be run until motion is removed from the tone arm this does not mean stuck tone arm but motion of about onesixteenth of division on the tone arm dial discovery what has made the change process so important is recent discovery i made that resisted change is the basis of all mass in the physical universe resisted change is the basis of every stuck point on the track there are probably dozens of versions of change processes the safest way to dope out what change process to run on the pc is to read it on the needle and get each different command of the whole process to fall properly and then to run whatever has been figured out safe rules for change process run at least two ways of flow run positive and negative change run version that is real to the pc with each command cleared on the meter to get each command to fall before actually using it this is meter clearing the command its new examples think vs get the idea of can be sorted out on the meter the right one will fall the wrong one wont or will fall less get the flows sorted out with commands process versions get the idea of changing yourself get the idea of another changing himself get the idea of changing another

process think of something changing think of something failing to change think of changing somebody think of failing to change somebody another process get the idea of changing another get the idea of failing to change another another process recall change recall failure to change summary there are many many versions of change to get the best result adapt process to the pc before leaving change process you have been running because motion has come out of the tone arm try to find another change process that will get the motion going again change does not particularly cut down havingness but after while you can scout the pcs havingness process out and use it from time to time during and at the end of session the reason change does wreck havingness is that resistance to change prevents the pc from having and as the ideas of change are sorted out the pc has increased havingness anyway similar to ow which is havingness process l ron hubbard lrh jlrd copyright 1961 by l ron hubbard all

future meters 18 summary 19emeter essentials the following essential points concerning the electrometer must be known to an auditor 2there is known way to clear anyone without using meter 3there is guarantee that scrap or nonstandard meter will behave properly 4the only way known to learn to use an emeter is use one handle one practice with one skill in meter use depends upon familiarizing oneself with the actual meter 5get familiar with the meter by holding it watching it turning it on and off touch it reach and withdraw from itplay catch with it dont just read books about it 6put various persons on the meter check them out on security checks rudiments checks and release checks check out dates of incidents 7do dynamic assessments do goals assessments 8the person who says the meter is not precision instrument is either unfamiliar with one or has something to hide the auditors questions can be off the meter never is 1theory 1the meter tells you what the preclears mind is doing when thepreclear is made to think of something 2the meter registers before the preclear becomes conscious of the datum it is therefore preconscious meter the meter passes tiny current through the preclears body 3this current is influenced by the mental masses pictures circuits and machinery when the unclear pc thinks of something these mental items shift and this registers on the meter 4some preclears are in denser masses than others therefore the tonearm reads very low most dense very high or normal 5a lowtoned preclear may not be able to influence his mind or body atall and reads the same as dead body around two or three without action lowtoned person may read at two or three on the tone arm with stickyneedle 6a middletoned preclear reads actively on the meter both tone arm and needle with low sensitivity setting 7a very hightoned person clear reads at two or three on the tonearm with free needle 8the key difference between lowtoned preclear and hightoned one is seen in needle response the lowtoned having sluggish needle or stickyone the hightoned person having free needle 9the lowtoned person cannot answer questions about help intelligently 10 thus we see that the emeter basically registers the body at two female or three male on the tone arm if thetan is dead he doesnt addto or subtract from the reading if thetan is partially alive he adds or subtracts from the reading if thetan is fully alive he is not necessarily inside the body he controls and so does not add to or subtract from the reading 2practice the tone arm 1 the three general states have many way stops there is always lowertoned mockery of higher tones lowtone case to the relatively unskilled can be at clear read unreactive on sticky sort of needle he cannot however do things in life he or she cannot answer questions intelligently about help or control 2the first advance of very lowtoned case may be to drop into theminus two area on the tone arm dial 3because of the construction of an emeter the tone arm cannot pass through the bottom of the dial as lowtoned case gains responsibility thetone arm goes from three or two to 15 to 1 to 6 to 5 to 4 to 3 for male and then to 2 for female this occurs over long term of processing of course and takes many many hours of processing and the tone arm ebbs and flows back and forth 4very few cases are in dead state most cases will be found on thetone arm around four or five 5the tone arm registers density of mass ridges pictures machines circuits in the mind of the preclear this is actual mass not imaginary and can be weighed measured by resistance etc 6therefore the tone arm registers state of case at any given time in processing 7the tone arm also registers advance of case during processing by moving an unmoving case has an unmoving tone arm moving case has moving tone arm 8if case is not moving matter what the preclear says the tonearm is not moving 9if case is moving matter what the preclear says the tone armis moving during processing 10 if the tone arm shows motion continue the process matter whatthe preclear says 11 if the tone arm shows motion you can change the process 12 to change process while the tone arm shows good motion is breachof the auditors code clause 13 also to continue process that is producingno tone arm motion is breach of the same clause 13 when level of the prehavingness scale is flat for terminal the tone arm is showing very little motion one must reassess for new level for the same terminal on the scale whereupon the tone arm will again show motion 14 when all levels that needleregister on the prehavingness scale are flat the tone arm will longer show motion but neither will it stick in frozen way 15 it is nice judgment when to leave process the judgment is done by the tone arm action 16 when the tone arm slows down and isnt moving more than quarter of an inch up or down it is time to reassess to go longer would stick the tonearm and make needle action too stuck for reassessment to be possible you will always find any unflat level in future reassessments on theprehavingness scale so it is not dangerous to so leave one it is 3dangerous to leave level of the prehavingness scale when the tone arm shows motions of one inch up or down the tone arm dial as the preclear will get confused 17 take hold of the tone arm of your emeter set it at 45 on its dialmove it to 3 move it to 5 now pretend period of twenty minutes move thetone arm from 5 to 4 then from 4 to 45 then from 45 to 35 then from 35 to 48 then from 48 to 4 if all that happened in twenty minutes of processing that is terrific tone arm motion the case would be changing veryvery well you would not change process you would go on running the same process 18 take the tone arm in hand again set it at 35 pretend period of twenty minutes move it from 35 to 33 move it from 33 to 36 move it from 36 to 34 if thats all that happened in twenty minutes of processing be alert for youd better reassess for new level for the terminal on the prehavingness scale the tone arm may be getting ready to stick 19 but dont be surprised if the tone arm motion suddenly picks up again if it does carry on with the same process 20 the above give you two extremes of tone arm motion the first example is excellent motion the second example is poor motion between these two examples you have variety of types of motion 21 in using the meter you are trying to assess for process that will produce tone arm motion and b run the motion out of the tone arm 22 when the tone arm does not move under processing one of two things is true you did not get the right process to run or b you have run it flat the remedy for is to do better assessment and run another processthe remedy for b is to do another assessment 23 that the tone arm moves under processing denotes change in the preclears mind that the tone arm doesnt move under processing denotes change of mass pictures machinery or circuits in the preclear 24 when preclear is clear he may occasionally get some tone arm motion due to purely body electronics but in the main reads at male or female on thearm 3 or 2 according to his or her sex 25 as preclear nears clear an assessment plus few commands will blow the connected masses and thus flatten the terminal chosen as preclear gets even nearer assessment alone blows the remaining massestherefore when the state is approached the tone arm motion gets less and less matter what you do but the condition is selfevident when observed the preclear gaining more and more effect on his bank with less and less time necessary to remedy condition 4mechanics 1 the tone arm stops moving and sticks because the assessment and process have dragged in picture chain or mass upon the preclear that thecommand asises only part of when the process is longer asising the picture or mass yet is still restimulating it the tone arm registers that the picture chain or mass is there but not changing another process from theprehavingness scale for the same terminal is now needed to asis another portion of the picture chain or mass thus the tone arm starts moving again 2when you overrun process level of the prehavingness scale particularly early in processing you can pull this picture chain or mass in so strongly running stuck tone arm that reassessment becomes very difficult as nothing moves the meter 3stop running level while you can still read the meter 4if you do overrun too far still try to read the meter for newlevel of assessment if you cant run the change process to get back actionand then reassess the same terminal you will now be able to read the meter to have to do this however is pretty dull 5processes move in or activate pictures chains masses machinerycircuits and nullify them thus clearing people life is doing this to them all the time without running them out 6the mechanics of the mind in clearing are only those mentioned in this section to try it without meter or without knowing meter well is of course beyond the observational ability of homo sapiens 7only meter registers these mechanics only processes blow these barriers to living 5the sensitivity knob 1 the sensitivity knob increases the swing of the needle 2to run with too high sensitivity makes the auditors work unreliable 3to run with too low sensitivity makes the needle unreadable 4the sensitivity knob is adjusted at the start of the rudiments any assessment or any process or when the auditor wants to know 5the exact setting of the knob is done as follows have the preclear hold the electrodes comfortably in his hands have him tighten his hands andthen relax them still holding the cans the needle should drop exactly onethird of dial adjust the sensitivity knob by asking the preclear to squeeze the cans again and observing the needle fall 6on older meters as the preclear gets to release you cant get just onethird of dial you get more even with the knob on the lowest sensitivity set it as low as you can and use it anyway 7in short adjust the knob to still needle that will yet move on needed responses 8if at any time the needle doesnt react and you want comparative reaction between two or more questions increase the knob read the question responses and then set it back again for running 9if you change the sensitivity knob during an assessment you have to do the whole assessment again on the new setting as the amount of needle fall will be changed 10 in running rudiments when suspicious set the sensitivity knob higher 11 in looking for suspected withholds in particular read with high knob 12 by holding constant sensitivity knob during an assessment or during process you find out how the preclear is reacting on the needle relative to the start of the assessment or process 6the needle 1 needle is monitored by the sensitivity knob the tone arm and the momentary or changing reactions of the preclear 2there are ten main needle actions 1stuck 2no reaction nul 3fall 4change of characteristic 5rise 6theta bop 7rock slam 8free needle 9body reactions 10 stage four 3in totally stuck needle 1 the preclear would not even register being pinched it looks stiff in nul needle 2 the question does not change the needle behavior in the presence of an arc break with the auditor the needle is liable not to register any reaction at all and to look like nul needle therefore before writing off any assessment item prepcheck or security check questionas nul be sure to check for and repair any arc break 4a falling needle 3 makes dip to the right as you face the metera fall may consist of half division about oneeighth of an inch or may consist of fifteen dials the whole meter face dropped fifteen times it is still fall fall always happens with rapidity within second or two it is also called drop dip and register it denotes that disagreementwith life on which the preclear has greater or lesser reality has met the question asked 5a fall is the most used and observed needle action it means to the auditor ive found it or ive gotten response in the bank it is the click of the light switch illuminating where we are going 6falls are measured relative to falls thats why we leave the sensitivity alone when we are looking for something question by question 7given two falls the longer fall is the right one for instance question about joe gets threeeighths of an inch of fall question about mabel right after gets fiveeighths of an inch of fall the right answer is mabel 8any fall denotes there is something there any fall at any sensitivity level on rudiments questions denotes the presence of bad reaction to the room an arc break withhold or present time problem and must be cleared matter what the preclear says 79a fall follows at once upon the question being asked fall can be in two stages or more providing they take place within second or two after the question 10 fall is the diagnostic meter action set for falls from still needle as given under sensitivity above 11 in starting out the first thing you want to know is is the preclearreading on this meter you get the preclear to squeeze the cans you get fall as he does oh he or she is reading on the meter the meter is not broken or turned off or disconnected it is the fall that tells us 12 the next thing we want to know is rudiments it is the fall thattells us what we must handle 13 the next thing is the assessment it is degree of fall that tells uswhat is right for we always take the greatest fall we can obtain the sensitivity being kept constant 14 the next thing is the running we ignore the fall now and watch the tone arm instead the needle of course has to move if the tone arm is going to move but until we want more rudiments type answers or until we want new assessment we ignore the needle and watch only the tone arm 15 change of characteristic 4sometimes as in old dynamic assessment we cannot get clean falls on what we are looking for another guide is change of characteristic of the needle 16 the needle is doing pattern of small rises and falls we ask question it stops moving we ask another question it resumes idly rising and falling as before that stop is change of characteristic or the needle is stopped while we ask long series of questions but suddenly does small dance that is change of characteristic 17 change of characteristic occurs when we hit on something in the preclears bank it occurs only when and each time that we ask that exact question as the question or item alone changes the needle patternwe must assume that that is it and we use it 18 question that stops rising needle is change of characteristic question and like fall means we have struck something further exploration usually develops it into fall 19by using change of characteristic we can sometimes get our foot in the door and get into channel that brings about falls 20 whole assessment can be done by change of characteristic as well as by falls but it is not usual and in fact will develop falls anyway if you are on to something hot 21 it is not much used but must be known as it may have to be used sooner or later when we cant get falls the only needle reactions in which you should be interested are those which occur instantly ie within onetenth to onehalf of second after you have asked question of the preclear 22 rises 5 rising needle means confront 23 of course needle must rise at times or the tone arm would never move but it still means that the preclear has struck an area or something he isnt confronting one never calls his attention to this but one knows what it is 824 the only use rising needle has at this time is to stop going up the prehavingness ladder with terminal assessment when the needle begins marked rise you have exceeded the preclears reality and he isnt confronting so youd better turn around and go down the ladder again before you get things too unreal for him by asking if the terminal can do things the preclear cannot imagine it could do 25 the right circuit valence machinery called off will stop rising needle this was once used but is not necessarily employed at this lime 26 the rising needle is therefore not much employed but one should recognize one it is steady constant movement of the needle rather slow from right to left 27 needle returning to position after fall is not rising needle 28 theta bop 6 is small or wide steady dance of the needle over spread of oneeighth of an inch say depending on sensitivity setting it can be half an inch the needle goes up and down perhaps five or ten times asecond it goes up sticks falls sticks goes up sticks etc always the same distance and constant speed 29 theta bop means death leaving dont want to be here it iscaused by of the preclear as thetan vibrating out and into the body or position in the body its as if the needle is jumping between two peaks across narrow valley 30 mention death to anyone or make them think about it while theyre on meter and youll see theta bop 31 its use is to detect whether preclear is being left stuck in death or to locate death or departures 32 if preclear wants badly to get out of session he or she may start theta bopping without being stuck in death but few theta bops mean the preclear wants to leave session its most often turned on for desire to leave session during security check 33 if you get bop turned on during an assessment or security check it takes it quite while sometimes to turn off the next several questions after bop turns on are therefore seldom validly readable just keep on with an assessment but be careful to go over the ground again and again if youre getting bop theta bops turn on fast and turn off slowly 34 they are not very important in diagnosis theyre more interesting than vital 35 rock slam 7 in assessing or running you occasionally get rockslam this originally meant and still does that you are on the rock chain 36 rock slam is crazy irregular unequal jerky motion of the needle narrow as one inch or as wide as three inches happening several times second the needle goes crazy slamming back and forth narrowly widely over on the left over on the right in mad war dance or as if it were frantically trying to escape it means hot terminal or hot anything in anassessment and takes precedence over fall 37 it differs from theta bop which has precedence over fall in that theta bop is even and gentlemanly and rock slam is as crazy as commie agitator 38 if found in an assessment use it but make sure of what turned it on before you buy it means the item is hot 39 if found in running process just carry on it means the going is hot so for heavens sakes dont stop the session 940 free needle 8 this is probably the least understood term and needle action in all of emetering 41 it means an idle uninfluenced motion matter what you say about the goal or terminal it isnt just nul its uninfluenced by anything except body reactions 42 man its really free 43 youll know one when you see one theyre really pretty startlingthe needle just idles around and yawns at your questions on the subject 44 it doesnt happen until person is well above release so dont worry about it until you see it 45 use nul as word not free if youre in doubt about it nul just doesnt fall on question it might fall on similar question free needle wouldnt fall if the psychiatrists surrendered in body or the empire state building fell down 46 free needle means when it is used as term the preclear is getting awful close to clear 47 tight needles stuck are far from free stuck needle can be made to fall by advancing the sensitivity way up thus even stuck needle can be nul but free needle is not stuck or nul it just floats around 48 body reactions 9 the deep breathing of preclear sigh yawn sneeze stomach growl can any one of them make needle react 49 get person on the cans turn the sensitivity high make him do the following one at time sigh yawn breathe deeply cough laugh knock the cans together lift finger off the electrode can convulsively grip the cans scratch his head while holding the cans scratch his leg rub can against his or her shirt or skirt rub his fingers together without letting the cans touch and stretch note the needle reactions now have the person do all these things again as you read them off now turn down the sensitivity knob so that the needle drops one third of dial about one and half inches now with that setting read off the list to him and watch the needle 50 do you see now why you dont run with high sensitivity 51 these are body reactions 52 the meter will also read basal metabolism interesting because it tells you if the preclear really is eating or has eaten breakfast have the preclear on the cans take very deep breath if moment later the needle falls half dial two inches or more the preclear has good high basal metabolism if he hasnt eaten breakfast it wont fall like that on the second or third deep breath let out the basal metabolism stops registering so the first time is the test not subsequent tries 53 you can also make high sensitivity set needle jump by imagining the preclears hands being better connected to the cans and seeing whitish glow between cans and finger tips that is if youre in good shape you can also do it by seeing this glow in the area of preclears old injury that is the extent of your influencing the preclear and the meter reading outsideof auditing 54 you can also after youve been talking to not processing preclear set the meter on yourself then give the cans to the preclear and he or she will read the same adjustments for few moments 1055 these are all more or less body reactions they get in your road as to movement and sneezes and they dont affect your processing as to crosscurrents between auditor and preclear so bear up under them and skip themtheyre not important once you know what they are 56 stage four 10 this is the sole survivor of an old system 20thacc that used four stages of meter reaction as test of state of case 57 stage four needle is still important to identify when met as it means this preclear is from place as case 58 stage four is below merely stuck needle the preclears thoughts and few of your questions have any bearing on the preclears case this is most promising as cch stuff but not only stage four takes cch see director of processing check type one for case reactions that take cch 59 possibly the change process or attention process may bite here 60 stage four needle goes up about an inch or two always the same distance and sticks and then falls goes up sticks falls about once asecond or so it is very regular always the same distance always the same pattern over and over on and on and nothing you say or the preclear says changes it except body reactions 61 break through this meter action by pulling withholds or unkind thoughts or the joburg security check or the cchs or processes and you have busted the lowest level of the case 62 but its disheartening phenomenon the emeter just doesnt react to anything except kick in the head up stick fall up stick fall on and on like metronome set for the dead march of saul know it when you see it until you break it theres case change 11finding havingness and confront processes 1the thirtysix havingness and confront processes are tested for on the emeter in an exact way 2the havingness process is located on the needle by the preclear squeezing the cans before the command is tested and after it has been run five to eight commands 3if the second squeeze shows the needle looser wider swing than the first squeeze did youve got it the command you are testing is the havingness command for the preclear and may thereafter be used at intervals toset up the room in rudiments gain havingness before or after processes and at session end using only ten or twelve commands at time 4the confront process from the thirtysix presessions is located on the tone arm if eight or ten commands of one of these moves the tone armthats the confront process to be used after other processes and before thehavingness process 5havingness is tested on the needle with can squeezes 6confront is tested on the tone arm by its motion 7if the process tested for havingness tightens the needle during the test get rid of it dont bridge off just get off now 8if the process being tested for confront fails to move the tone arm during test after eight or ten commands get off it dont bridge off more commands of it 9the havingness process selected even if the right one if run too much more than ten or twenty commands will start running the bank it doesnt harm the preclear but that isnt its use the tone arm may blowdown toward clear if you run fifteen minutes or half an hour of the havingness process again it might not the purpose of havingness processis to get the preclear stabilized in his environment it will also do otherthings if overrun none bad but other processes do them better 10 the confront process gets the preclear to present time from areas on the track where his attention was fixed by an earlier process 11 use of the havingness process of the preclear ten to twelve commands at time plus the confront process of the preclear run ten or fifteen minutes ended with preclear in or near present time followed by the havingness process followed by the confront etc etc just as above often can bring the preclear down to his clear reading if carried on this is known as stabilizing case it should be done before person is pronounced release it is never done now to start case despite the name of the thirtysix havingness and confront processes presessions we can now start cases faster using sop goals or attention or change or the cchs but the meter behavior and the necessity of havingness and confront processes remain the same it must be done at some stage of the case it is usually done after the first sop goals terminal and goal are flat on the prehavingness scale and should be done before the person is pronounced release it can only be done on and with an emeter 12security checking 1in using the meter for security checking you establish needle response to common nonmeaningful questions seeing this you do not mistake real fall when it comes 2on meaningful questions you look for falls fall means oh oh hes got you dont leave question that is getting fall response until you are sure you have been told all and the needle longer falls when you ask that question 3if the needle still falls on the question you have one of twothings the preclear hasnt told all or b its in past life and he does not consciously know about it since the meter precedes preclear consciousness 4in the case of you keep asking in various ways until it is cleared fall even with high sensitivity knob and you do turn up the knob on question that didnt respond well at first and then turn it back before you go on to the next 5in the case of past life possibility you add in this lifetime to your security question as you repeat that if the misdeed was in past lifethe fall will vanish 6a person being security checked is subject to mental dispersal you may get only one fall and then fall at all for one or two repeats and thena fall you havent asked quite the right question the preclear is trying to ignore it the rule is if you get trace of fall or reaction on question beat it to death by varying your wording of the question or slightly shift the type of question in any event be sure not to leave trace of reaction or single reaction until you are certain it wont develop 7if the preclear tells you withhold always as in all rudiments ask the question again as this might not be all of it 8the fall comes out if the preclear tells all the fall stays or gets worse if the preclear is hedging 9on security check sheet follow up every change of characteristic before you go on change of characteristic if it amounts to anything will develop into fall 10 if the preclear has not told all or its past life the meterwont be clear 11 dont be fooled by excuses dont discredit the meter the preclears first attempt when hes in really tight spot 12 the meter is right 13 if question will not clear its or b above and thats the total of it 14 grim experience of decade has taught that its or b and never i moved the needle myself or i feel nervous just generally the emeter is right even when it seems to make the preclear wrong 15 the mark of good security checker is thorough swinish suspicion and belief in mankind or the devil only the meter 16 peoples cases will not move until they are clear on all withholds so thorough check is really kindness after all 13meter oddities 1there are few exceptions to the rule with emeters they are study composed of facts which have right or wrong answers and the answers to emeter questions are all in black and white 2these are the known exceptions 3some people very few in very bad shape get rise when they are asked to squeeze the cans this is reverse action it means nothing except they need to be started in low levels 4some preclears in very bad shape rock slam when security checked and one cant find what is rock slamming as nothing clears the slam they have to be flunked audited and tried again 5in south africa bantus withholds read not on the needle alone but on the tone arm as well the tone arm goes up as much as two divisions 3 to 5 just before you get off bad withhold on one 6high tone arms on anyone or very low mean lots of withholds but they might not be conscious of them all at once they come off session by session as we run along 7holding the two cans in the right hand with paper between so they dont short is the way to free preclears hands for pointing out things if you change hands and he holds them in the left the meter will read differently this only means he is electronically imbalanced old epicenters and has other use 8preclears claim sometimes they are pushing the meter about thats why it reads you could also ask then why didnt you prevent it from reading but dont really ask them that 9the meter knows more about the preclear than the preclear it is reading created masses he is withholding himself from the preclear wont confront all he is creating hence the omniscience of the meter 10 dating things on meter is not as important as it was but skilled auditor should be able to do it it isnt covered here because few can do it well and it looks so complicated you might miss the important things and they are all in this bookdating is well covered in electropsychometric auditing the first book on the meter and the later book the hubbard electrometer 11 another emeter oddity occurs when asking preclear to do lie reaction test some will get fall only on the truthsome will get fall every time they are asked to answer only in the negative or will get fall only with the positive replies this is not very important the important thing about lie reaction test is whether or not the person is reading on the meter and the characteristic needle response to vital questions remains unchanged the lie reaction test is given to study needle pattern for the preclear not to establish his lies 14meter frailties 1emeter faults occur in new meters or after long usethey are few 2if the meter doesnt register the squeeze the preclear gives the cans it isnt turned on or connected up or it isnt working see the mechanical direction sheet for setting up particular meter and follow it before you decide meter is out of order 3if meter registers the can squeeze it is usually in good working order 4the batteries rarely run down in british hubbard electrometer the drain being the shelf life of the battery even if you left it on for weeksday and night this is not true of the american hubbard electrometer steelcase its batteries can run down if its left on for days 5if the meter is not in working order when you get it send it to the manufacturer or the director of materiel in central organization or hco for repairs do not try to fix it yourself 6if it is responding to can squeeze when turned on according to directions it is undoubtedly faithfully all right throughout the hubbard electrometers do not go slightly wrong they either work or they dont 7one exception the british and american hubbard electrometer early models had carbon pot which is to say the tone arm was in pure carbon bearings if you could call it that speck of dust can get in the pot and cause the needle to rock slam whether connected to the preclear or not pull the lead wire jack disconnecting cans and if the slam continues its thepot thats wrong work the tone arm vigorously for while if that doesnt stop it squirt some lighter fluid into the tone arm bearing from the meterface side if that doesnt stop it turn it in to be repaired later models ofthe british and american hubbard electrometer have wire wound pots and this does not happen 8if the batteries go down after year or two the test will not register in its needle dial area be sure the meter is set up for use before you use rest as in the british meter test can be thrown off by the zero setting knob trim and youll think the batteries are down when theyre not if they are down get some new ones they are available anywhere theres an electric shop anybody can install them it is cheaper than shipping but hco will do it if you like 9the ancient tube valve meters that connected to the mains still work on all the above rules but they pass an uncomfortably strong current through the preclear and sometimes shock him also after the 1950 models they became too fancy in design with too many dials and knobs for intelligent use too many variables could be run in on them 10 squirrel meters or homebuilt meters may be right or wrong but they are noted for inaccurate needle behavior some dont show bops because the potentiometer used was too cheap some register half second or second late on questions some are so lightly needled that they register everything they can i only trust meter types ive checked out myself making sure they register the preclear not the local tv antennae cheap meters at cut rates usually prove to be very expensive in the long run i developed the present emeter with hundreds of tests and expert assistance and i know how wrong meter design can go 11 the new british now ready and american when built hubbardelectrometer mark iv are the best meters we have ever had and will be the standard meter for long time to come they are built by one of the best instrument people in england and their parts are specially made by very old firm 15future meters 1i have an entirely different meter for an entirely different purpose under development it is for use above clear up to ot range not covered by an emeter 2they are to be available toward the end of 1961 3they will be called ot meters ive been working on this since 1952 and have it pretty well solved 4the ot meter will not outmode the emeter which will continue in use so long as we have homo sapiens to audit note since first publication of this book the advanced hubbard mark v has become the single authorized emeter for information on purchasing mark v see the page following the index in this book the editors 16summary 1it will be seen that the tone arm the sensitivity knob and the needle form three distinctly different parts of emeter operations 2the tone arm shows case change and process action the needle shows case significance and reality the sensitivity knob is magnifying glass for the needle 3the needle shows except for finding confront processes what to runthe tone arm shows how it is running 4when searching watch the needle 5when running process watch the tone arm 6the needles most looked for reaction is the fall 7the tone arms most looked for reactions are change of position and b ceasing to change position 8skill with the meter comes from gaining great familiarity

franchise process levels necessity for training here is some good news and some bad after considerable study of the use of sop goals by auditors it is apparent that the technology while very effective in the strictly supervised auditing of hgcs is beyond the average training level of the field at this time in trs emeter and model session this means that we can do releasing at once but we are confronted by an enormous retraining programme before broad field auditor clearing can begin but great advances can be made on cases now with the change processes my findings indicate that the chief reason auditors fail to handle the emeter expertly is to be found in the tr failures mainly confront sop goals to be effective demands precision of auditing skill common only in hgcs sop goals is pure dynamite to cases but it becomes pure backfire when used by poorly trained auditor sop goals works too fast to admit of bad technical application before sop goals becomes effective it must be applied with perfect technical precision however there is cause here for alarm because concurrent with sop goals i have made another discovery which was released in last weeks hco bulletin change processes which wrap up really and truly all cases from answers intelligibly to release thus we have simple basic process which takes preclear to release basic accurate test for release all brackets of change nul on the needle and another full process package from release to clear in sop goals this gives us the most orderly division of training levels we have ever had and rather smooths out what we do

can and will audit change processes easily and successfully with enormously swift results on pcs when all change processes are flat on pc the state of release is easily tested and observed when sop goals is flat on pc you have clear apparently sop goals should not be run on pc by an average auditor until all change processes are flat since many pcs dont do the actual commands until change is flat thus i am very happy to be able to tell you of lots of wins and orderly progress ahead even if i have to warn you not to run sop goals until your pc is release and you are perfect technician

assess for all the goals the pc ever had when all are out and longer give fall on the meter the list is complete when the list is complete the meter longer registers reassess the list until only one goal continues to read now list all the terminals for the goal all the terminals which would represent that goal until the meter goes flat null the list until only one terminal reads falls on the meter sop goals is the entirety of data needed to clear all cases this is unlike the situation earlier when lrh would develop regimen to handle one pcs case then develop the theory which matched it sometimes this was picked up by others and whole school of therapy was based on it for instance the dianetic tech used to handle one individual altman later became gestalt therapy the emeter is tension machine the more tense the individual the more offbeat is the read clearing is taking the tension off the meter at the lowest level of tension theres point in doing anything about anything youve got dead thetan totally incapable of influencing the machine he reads as clear but this kind of case can still be detected because the needle is tense it doesnt react favorably at all the person cannot answer to his satisfaction or yours any questions about help the needle also shows reaction to anything even kick the sensitivity has to be way up to get third of dial drop on can squeeze the guy can be machinemotivated feels he had bad luck doesnt believe anything can be done so he can get help etc hes very obvious cant do case doingness is the common denominator of the prehav scale someone who cant do isnt even on the scale the best case detector is the sensitivity knob not the ta or needle the worst case is where person is super tense but doesnt know it this guy would be long job to sec check rock slam is stronger indication than fall it shows that you are on the chain of the first time the person ever decided to be another valence the theta bop is diagnostic it has to do with leaving and death the thetan moving in and out like yoyo it can be dial wide or small it can be repetitive or even at an extreme one cycle this is not very useful returning will also give you theta bop the rise means the pc isnt confronting we used to be concerned about what stopped the rise which was what was producing it or rather the pcs non confront of that thing caused it stage four needle is an indicator of total noeffect case it can be very tiny it always has stick at the top of the rise unlike the theta bop the bottom of it is very relaxed it just means lousy case shape sometimes you see the needle vibrate this means that the pc has an alternating current ridge 45 means crowd if hes stuck there hes afraid of people or stuck with people stuck at 25 means robot machine theres seven on the ta dial that cant be read on the meter as person develops responsibility say hes dead thetan at 20 hell go down to 15 then go out the bottom through 7 to 65 5 4 etc to in range pc can have consistent pattern he can even repeat the same fall in this case change of characteristic is diagnostic when the pc has charged question in his level of reality you get change of pattern the meter that would be used above clear would be an oscilloscope meter an ometer or theta meter which registers flows this is not comfortable to audit with the meter has to be very sensitive someone could be clear and still have bugs because hes still using body the emeter measures the games condition called the physical universe you need something which shades the tiniest things from 200 up we

course picking up fundamental which sits right in the middle of anyones case and you tend to blow off little confusion in trying to get hold of it it would be easy to teach you to run diesel engine but the data were teaching goes straight into the middle of reactive computation sop goals does this exact thing exactly reversing how the mind got aberrated the most hidden factors of mind were the things that aberrated mind because ones ever freed mind before so they must have been the most concealed or they would have asised sop goals undoes all the things that plowed someone in it consists of all the solutions person adopted to fix all the oddball circumstances he got into ever that longer apply who wouldnt want to have the kind of mind that could be happy doing something simple basically what youre afraid of is getting bored this happens because what you are doing is somehow inadequate to the demands of the environment if ones simple game gets invalidated one looks for more complicated one this could only happen if one had invalidated someone else already to get kicked in the butt you must have kicked someone in the butt and postulated that its bad to get kicked in the butt if the way to do perfect assessment were put on paper theres high probability that it wouldnt be followed because were dealing with the basic stuff of which the reactive mind is composed and on this subject more than any other youll find more confusion more silly questions the datum restimulates the whole confounded bank what happens is that the guy does something which eventually recoils on him in way which gives him new problem he gets his motivator and gets new beingness to have new game but hes now not being himself hes being solution to the problem of livingness the solution eventually ends him up with new problem which he solves with some new beingness some new game every time he gets overwhelmed in some game he shifts beingness to the new game which solves the old one if you clear someone without clearing up his bedohave condition hell realize he has game and hell recreate his old condition or be bored or worried hell go unclear he thinks its less dangerous to be aberrated than to have game if you clear erase his games conditions across the boards hell do this the essence of all games is beingness and doingness towards havingness the problem is that they get jammed into cant have must have situation in games condition the person has to be something but he cant be it there is something wrong with being what he is being so he cant be it and he dare not be it and yet he must be it and this emerges when you are auditing sop goals game or goal is abandoned because it was invalidated too many times guy goes into new game and valence and ends up not being himself in assessment you are backtracking these valences expressed as goals since by this time the pcs comm with the world is very poor you have to handle whats real to the pc so thats what you handle whats odd is that theres only one valence thats real to the pc at one time in life as the valence goes up the pc comes down this ends up with serene valence and the pc out the bottom so the individual goes around acting psychotic in serene valence this is the theetie weetie case as you audit the person the valence comes down and the pc starts taking over handling the game and the environment on his own determinism as the pc gets out of fixed games he can look around and find hes got more games if hes got more games hell go more clear if less hell go unclear the act of finishing off clearing doing more and more sop goals is what stabilizes the clear having to play the game is what prevents one from playing the game one can play the game as long as one doesnt have to details on running of sop goals any goal which is to put up mockup is liable to be false one and is dangerous one to audit it is perishable because the result of failure is to create mockup so that you get into an arts goal always be suspicious of an arts goal because theres always the thing you can do when all else fails and thats usually the arts when actual masses dont work to overwhelm theopposition they turn to aesthetic masses which are closer to the thought band if you go just little further with assessment the case will likely get into better goals channel you can ask what did you want to do before you went into the arts this also applies to professions in the thought band like philosophy and law featherweight goal denotes hell of failure just ahead of ithubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 19 may 1961 cenocon urgent assessment data on sop goals assessments the following mistakes are being made 1 auditors are assessing with high sensitivity knob setting 2 auditors are taking up to an hour and half to assess on the prehav scale 3 auditors are trying to run the whole case on rudiments only these rules which follow become very important they prevent endless assessing for goals and terminals on sop goals and save session time rule one assess with the sensitivity knob set for one third of dial drop on the can squeeze more rule high sensitivity knob settings for more than third of dial drop are for any joburg security check or getting off withholds only only increase sensitivity beyond third of dial on withholds assess with only third of dial drop sensitivity setting if the sensitivity knob setting wont decrease enough to get only third of dial drop get your meter rebuilt if you have larger setting than above the sop goals assessment by elimination will take ten times as long rule two assessment on prehav scale is not by elimination one assesses with one read up and one read down and takes the largest not the lowest read on the needle the needle read for the proper prehav level will repeat on the trip up and the trip down only say the level once dont keep saying one level over and over thats auditing you can get all the prehav data you want with one coverage upward from scale bottom and one coverage downward to scale bottom this rule applies to assessing for general command and assessing for terminal goals and terminal searches require repeat over and over of the goal or terminal on the list in order to get them to go nul as nul as they go with the sensitivity set for third of dial drop as above the prehav assessment for level does not require repeat of level over and over in assessing in fact you had better not this one time prehav rule will also apply to the new prehav scale now being compiled in that one you will read levels once upwards once downwards on the primary scale taking the largest reaction of the needle as your level go over to the secondary scaleand do the same thingonce up once down and then take the resultant greatest needle reaction for purposes of assessment rising needle has meaning dont even remark that it is rising you dont know what the pc couldnt confront that starts the rise so you ignore rising needle always in any modern assessment anything that stops rise is meaningful the rise has meaning dont even list rise on an auditors report further rise means nothing as reaction in rudiments rule three dont ever run rudiment only because needle was rising only run rudiment if the needle rock slams theta bops or falls only run rudiment as long as reaction rock slam theta bop fall remains on that rudiment rise indicates meaningful data the rule about rudiments is this dont run case by rudiments the reason you use and clean rudiments is to get the pc in session so you can have the pc 1 in communication with the auditor and 2 interested in own case therefore you run rudiments with the sensitivity set that will give the needle third of dial drop with can squeeze you can increase sensitivity when asking for withholds in rudiments but if you do decrease it when finished with withholds back to third of dial drop the purpose of rudiments is to set up case to run not to run case summary i developed the above rules to correct various mistakes being made that were taking an assessment as high as thirtyfive hours the auditor was erasing goals by repeater technique with the sensitivity set to full dial drop and to help auditors get on with auditing not trying to solve the whole case with rudiments l ron hubbard lrh phbh

on when you ask just the right question it reads hard and consistently you must then get an answer to every auditing question or the read will persist forever if you dont audit the hidden standard the pc will seem to progress in the session and then say he didnt make any of his goals for the session hell be putting via on every command answer to slant it through the hidden standard you can ask the pc if theres some goal there he hasnt told you its necessary to getting case progress to get it out of the way the emeter wont be reading well either as its not the question if you dont ask for the hidden standard pc will not improve if he has withholds or undisclosed overts on his auditor or scientology in fact hell pull in motivators and get case gain you cant accept help from quarters you

franchise the only valid security check amends all existing data on security checks hco sec form 3 name of person date_________________ name of security checker location _____________ since security check failure can compromise or injure persons position or economics and because we are not moralists it is better to be more positive on the subject of security check failure leaving part of it up to judgment the question of what constitutes security check failure has now troubled enough people to make it necessary to lay down the following policies security check to be used for any organizational reason must be made on an hco ww form there are only three ways security checker may flunk any person 1 the security check may be considered flunked if there is needle response of any kind to any question with meter sensitivity even at extreme high rise as reaction is ignored throughout security check rise is not useful reaction 2 the security check may be considered flunked if any compromising or important question still persists in getting consistent reaction not rise even after the security checker has done his best to get the person being checked to clear it by answering truthfully 3 refusal to be checked lie reaction failure may longer be considered flunk important questions always have enough charge on them to cause reaction even on bad criminals and the reaction will continue consistently or sporadically if the person is still withholding information the question of something reacting because of past life crimes is ruled out if when question fails to clear the security checker adds in this lifetime to or in the question and works on that question continuing to use that added phrase reactions by reason of past lives tend to drop out and clear if this is done the task of the security checker is to carefully question and clear if possible changes of meter needle behaviour caused by the question plainly note any level that failed to clear this fails the person the lie reaction questions were originally used in scientology only to study the needle pattern of the person being checked so that changes in it could then be judged in their true light some pcs for instance get slight reaction every time any question is asked some get areaction only when there is heavy charge both can be security checked by studying the common pattern of the needle demonstrated in asking the lie reaction questions the purpose of the lie reaction questions is returned to the original intention totally stuck needle can be freed by processing or by getting off withholds if person is flunked by reason of 1 above they require auditing before another check is taken the auditing to be taken at the responsibility of the person being checked all security check sheets of persons security checked should be forwarded to saint hill complete with all markings and the reason why the question would not at first clear if important or the drop marked which would not

would use it in violation of the code of scientologist in reprinting this check sheet leave all directions as part of every sheet directions attempt to clear any reaction observed rise is not classed as reaction mark any reaction observed or any meter reaction change elicited by the question then write what it cleared on mark largely if the reaction could not be cleared since this constitutes failure to pass only fail somebody if there is needle motion of any kind even with sensitivity at 16 on any question rise is not reaction if they are failing because it is hard to clear question work very thoroughly on it in an effort to clear it in all cases complete the test run check with high sensitivity setting more than 13 of dial drop if an important question fails to clear even after security checker has worked very hard to get it off the test is flunked the following statement should be read or quoted to the person being security checked we are about to begin security check we

accurate and complete the secondary scale is not necessarily complete or edited this is the first major revision of the prehavingness scale i originated in january of 1961 this scale now contains primary scale and secondary scale the secondary scale contains nearly all simple verbs in the english language properly placed for level and repeated on other levels use the scale is used for general running of levels without specified terminal in brackets of 5 or 10 using someone or something as the terminal sometimes using plus and minus change change the scale is also used for terminals found for sop goals by goals and terminal assessment the two uses of the scale are done exactly the same way with the single exception that for general run one says do you have _____prehav level or are you_____prehav level or do you_____prehav level and in the use for goals terminals one says would the or a_____goals terminal prehav level general run assessment example start at bottom of primary scale 65 faith go up prehav primary scale asking about each level once only and carefully noting emeter needle reaction ignore rises of the needle that responds or doesnt respond to the question convert the level to sensible question without varying the actual level the questions do you have faith are you cause do things have effect upon you are you the effect of things do you think people run cant have on you do you create do you think etc etc when you have reached the top of the scale go back down again from level 1 to 65 still noting reaction the one that reacted most when you went up and when you went down the primary scale is the level do not take the lowest level take the level that reacted most as the worse off people are the higher terminals tend to be found on the scale as loose rule terminals come down scale as the pc goes up on successive assessments after runs you now take the primary level found by emeter needle reaction and go to the secondary scale for that level assess this secondary scale for the level exactly as you did the primary scale go from the highest number lowest point up to the top lowest number asking once about each level and noting needle reaction not rise take the level that reacted most on the needle form it into five way bracket or 10 way consulting the needle for the best expression of each leg of the bracket then run it the motion of the ta should increase then decrease then tend to halt if it remains unchanged 18 to 14 of tone arm division of motion only in 20 minutes reassesswhen reassessing on the prehav for new level assess exactly and as carefully as you did the first timefirst assess on the primary then assess on the secondary scale for that level example for assessing goals terminal or pt problem or arc break terminal the assessment is done the same way as in general run assessment except all questions have to do with the terminal example if the goals terminal were woman start at the bottom highest number of the primary prehav scale and assess one level at time would woman have faith would woman cause things would there be effect on woman etc etc noting the needle reaction not rise then come down lowest to highest number the prehav primary scale one level at time again noting the needle reaction always ignore rises the right level will react going up and going down in much the same way take this level and go to the prehav secondary scale assess it from bottom highest number to top lowest number and then back down again choose the level that reacted both going up and down any levels found may be checked cautiously repeating only once by comparing it to other levels in terms of needle reaction you want the level with most reaction always if you take more than fifteen minutes to do level assessment you are doing something odd or unnecessary such as saying the levels several times or expecting the pc to answer you aloud the pc should remain silent during an assessment or you are unfamiliar with the scale in asking assessment questions on the scale always speak with the same degree of loudness and inflection and always make the level the hardest and most stressed word in the question if you vary loudness from question to question or change emotional tone the needle may react to your change not the prehav level giving you an inaccurate reading based on your goofs or changes not on different scale levels you can do an assessment twice you should come out with the same primary and secondary levels if you dont run dont walk to the nearest academy the secondary level is the one used in commands you will note that the primary level words are repeated in the secondary scale thus if the level comes out to be that primary word youll still have it as secondary word and can use it in the command audit only one level at time use only the word that caused the needle to react to make up your command do not combine two levels if you get tone arm motion running level either generally or as goals terminal ptp or arc break level flatten it before choosing and running new level one knows when level is flat the tone arm doesnt move any more you can cause pc to feel spinny by starting new level before the old one is flat do not overrun level the test of flat is the ta moving only 14 to 18 of division up or down in 20 minutes of auditing not cumulative movement such as the ta moves 116th twice so thats 18th of divisionthis is wrong if it moves from 225 to 250 to 225 two or three times in twenty minutes this is called flat and has moved only 14 of ta division this is right the secondary level if not the word in the primary level may react on the needle far more than the primary level the primary level may not react at all in rare cases if this happens assess the whole secondary scale all groups independent of the primary scale starting with the secondary group for faith and going right on through the groups this is only likely to happen with rough beginning cases or with persons nearly clear who are being shaped up and stabilizedwhen pc assesses as rock slam it may be necessary after level turns on the rock slam to say nul word to the pc like floor floor floor until the rock slam turns off rock slam carries over many levels unless it is shaken out of the needle in this way mark the level that turned it on rock slam this is the strongest react there is if several levels turn on rock slam choose by reading the rock slam levels once each again using nulling word several times between each one and choose the widest rock slam or the one that didnt fall out which will probably be the widest in auditing rock slam the rule assess by the needle audit by the tone arm seems to have an exception however if the needle that is rock slamming could be held at set on the needle dial by moving the ta you would see that rock slam is tone arm reaction thus one cant call process flat while rock slamming needle still exists on level the rock slam has to be run out before the level is flat _____________ the complete and edited version of the secondary scale and the primary scale will appear first in the clearing series book sop goals to be

sussex hco bulletin of 25 may 1961 franchise releasing and preparing case for sop goals sop goals takes great deal of accurate scientology to run one has to be the kind of expert one would become from studying at saint hill or under person who has been here who graduated with honors one has to have his trs 0 to 4 perfect one has to know an emeter backwards and forwards one has to know model session so well that he or she can pass all trs while doing it and one has to know assessment there is nothing however so bad as to get wrong sop goals assessment on case it condemns the pc to an infinity of auditing he or she will never get clear until right assessment is done and the auditing in between is wasted so until you get to saint hill or get special course in sop goals from saint hill honor graduate or from australias peter williams whom i taught in south africa or unless i am right on the other end of telex as i am for london may i please ask you to content yourself and get marvellous case gains releasing people with the preparatory steps of sop goals and skip trying to run sop goals on wrong assessments these steps release people the preparatory steps of sop goals consist of only two things 1 the johannesburg security check well done the revised issue of which will come to you next week and 2 general runs on the prehav scale after proper assessment of the pc on that scale you can easily learn to give joburg you can easily learn to assess on prehav scale and you cant do any real damage and can get the fastest case gains youve ever seen the joburg check if withholds make the pc get gains then what better way to clear them up than by fabulously thorough check on withholds such as is found in the joburg check ask every question in various ways until the pc gets further needle action on that question with sensitivity raised way up the general runs on prehav assess the prehav scale saying each level once to the pc on the meter going up it saying each level once to the pc going back down it write down every fall theta bop or rock slam and how much take the level which gave the most reaction going up and down take that prehav level that reacted mostusing your good sense make up fiveway bracket auditing command from the level suppose the most reactive level was overts this translates as done to the 5way command is what have you done to someone what has someone done to you what has someone done to another what has another done to others what has someone done to himself run the process watching the meter tone arm when the tone arm moves more than 14 of tone arm division movement up or down matter how many times it went up or down continue the process matter what the pc says about its being flat when the tone arm moves less than 14 of division of the tone arm dial in 20 minutes change the process bridge out reassess on the prehav scale as before take the next level make up fiveway bracket the pc can do and flatten it off as above audit by the tone arm except in rock slam assess by the needle for rock slam just run the slam out of the level until its gone for 20 minutes then with two prehav levels flat on the tone arm do new joburg security check it will have changed do it all in model session handle the rudiments do joburg then couple of pre hav levels then joburg then couple of prehav levels then joburg etc etc on and on the case will soar release this is the production of release it is the simplest and fastest way to produce release it has to be done anyway to set case up for an sop goals assessment mistakes you can louse up pc by 1 failing to get nul needle on every joburg question as and when you ask it get each question cleared not by auditing just by watching the needle and asking until the pc tells you the withhold 2 running several levels without flattening any this puts the whole case in stew the movement of the tone arm as you run it tells you when something is still unflat as long as the tone arm of the meter is moved by the process continue the process its code breach not to 3 running level too long you can stick the tone arm by overrunning the level this is more serious than leaving one slightly unflat if tone arm for twenty minutes is only moving between say 325 and 335 you are already in danger of sticking the tone arm get off of it if you do overrun its hard to reassess for the new level and hard also on the pc remedy for overrunning is to assess the auditor on the prehav scale and run the auditor out of the pc for about ten fifteen minutesif the needle moves at all4 dwelling on levels in the assessment repeating them over and over instead of just once each can start an avalanche on the pc dont do it take the meter needle reads when they happen jot them down then take the most reaction thats it 5 sad to relate its been done but dont think you just take the first level of the prehav and run it and then go up one and run it and then the next one up thats murder assess them with an emeter and run the levels of the prehav that react when they react 6 dont skip the joburgs because they make pcs squirm this is how you find and get the withholds off the case wont move if you dont and give many joburgs one after every long prehav run one or two levels for the case responsibility comes up and as it comes up new overts are realized and theyve got to come off summary youll do the most for the pc by taking him or her to release with preparatory sop goals runs this is strong powerful auditing the pcs will thank you they wont if you try sop goals when you dont know how thats the

have to increase their tolerance for change change is pain because its fundamental is shift of location in space on mechanical level change is time time is temperature the hotter the faster this is discovery in physics it goes along with the discovery that the speed of light is not constant but depends on the velocity of emission and that zero is variable not an absolute zero time is change on mechanical level rate of change is measured by rate of change not by time but one pretends that it is measured by time if you find the right temperature you can speed time up or make something timeless for instance after the atomic bomb exploded nothing moved for twenty minutes not even the twenty minutes temperature alteration caused this there is zero there is nothing but nothing of what this is variable society at present doesnt know that it doesnt know this is dangerous scientology points this out to society which is painful to society the best approach to study is always to find out what you dont know and then to remedy the situation one should not start out study by finding out something new the gradient approach is 1 not knowing that one doesnt know 2 knowing one doesnt know but not knowing what one doesnt know 3 finding out what one doesnt know 4 remedying the situation the only thing wrong with ones case is the vast area of ones beingness that one doesnt know one doesnt know about things you do reactively produce the opposite result from what you intend gradient of states of case 1 release release is person who knows he wont get any worse he has low state of case but he is better than nonrelease since he knows he isnt there yet on meter he would give whole dial drop on lowsensitivity can squeeze and the ta would be fairly near clear read he would also have reality on scientology as way to improve the communication help and control buttons are in good shape he can asis certain things by inspection 2 stable release this is tested release he has adverse needle reactions on help communication or control life can still mess him up but he will come through better 3 mest clear this individual has an fn at sensitivity one and doesnt react to routine questions he reads at the clear read for his sex 4 stable clear this is mest clear who has run lots more sop goals where they start blowing by inspection for this individual engrams have persistence he can erase engrams or mock them up at will his healing rate is fantastic thinkingness can have an effect on the bank before clear but clear has more effect on the bank in all case states up to clear thinkingness has varied effect on the bank the lower the case state the less effect ones thought has on the bank psycho is total effect of the bank and can produce effect on the bank then we go up to more and more effect of person on the bank up to bank memory trouble is withholdingness withholding from people results in withholding from self the pc lessens the overt and pushes it out of sight if you increase his responsibility he becomes aware of more overts the overts unlessen and one starts to feel bad for instancewhen you discover that you have been committing overts against the org that has been so nice to you this is what happens when you process person towards greater responsibility without pulling withholds the person will cave in again therefore you must pull these overts and withholds and get the charge off them as they become available this is the rationale behind interspersing sec checks with other auditing otherwise the pc becomes unwilling to make case gain

washington dc who had been using change exclusive of the whole prehav scale and had been having trouble is of interest to all technical staff 29th may 1961 wayne change is only one part of prehav assessment it is the only one that has secondary scale to assess on prehav means to assess the whole prehav scale of which change is part change belongs at inverted control cross out inverted control write in change instead assess only on the whole primary prehav if and only if you get reaction on change you assess change scale when level is flat you return to the whole prehav scale and assess the whole scale every prehav level of the primary will soon have its own secondary level you always assess on any new assessment for level the whole primary prehav scale you choose the most reactive reacting on the needle level of the primary then you move over into that levels secondary scale you find the most reactive secondary level you run just and only that level flat then you take the whole primary prehav scale for the next assessment once more you find the most reactive primary level then you move over into its secondary and so on change is the first one to have secondary level every level now has one and they will be issued shortly so put change at inverted control instead of inverted control and carry on the best routine is hco bulletin of may 13 1961 it modifies nothing of this but gives you sure approach to release provided you keep rudiments cleaned up every session best ron lrhjlrd l ron hubbard copyright 1961 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6106c01 shspec5 flattening process and emeter on running prehav level be sure that you run the process long enough to get it to bite when the pc needs high sensitivity for third of dial drop you may not get much ta in the first three hours this can happen on sticky level at any time it is not flat or it wouldnt read in the first place so run the ta in then out if it is getting little ta and never did get much you are getting some ta and you want to continue to increase it the goal becomes less intense when you find the terminal this is because the goal is the significance that surrounds the terminal and the pcs attention has been yanked off the goal over to the terminal where it was fixed anyway so the goal after you have found the terminal will read less than the terminal theres nothing in the goal for his attention to be fixed on since the goal is just something he achieved reactively to solve problem given him by terminal that overwhelmed him the goal is the tag hanging out from the bank and can be used to get in there and handle the bank this phenomenon of tags was first noticed in 1949 with engrams for instance with boy who is always worried about red caps it turns out that red caps were in an engram about which he knows nothing goals work the same way the goal that wont null is the toughest one the one attached to the terminal that most overwhelmed the pc that he can still confrontissue 129 june 1961 the magazine of dianetics and scientology from washington dc the sad tail of pdh l ron hubbard every time we get up to high roar such as now when were clearing people as never before we measure our progress by the violence of reaction in squirreldom they come down from the trees and start looking for nuts to convince how were all wrong if they werent paid to do it id be happier the latest brainwave to greet our highest peak of helping man is rumors of pdh this is paindrughypnotism as practiced by the communists brainwashing in fact it is interesting that when the commies fight you they try to convince people that youre guilty of their own overts it is also fascinating that commie rumor line is international in scope the same rumor bursts out in dozen quarters around the world spread by paid agents at the same time this rumor of pdh started in australia where scientologists laughed at it went to south africa where scientologists got mad about it and then sprang up in the us where some scientologists didnt know well disregarding the fact that such dont know anything anyway we now know who is helping the little red brothers with the sickle in one hand and the hammer in the other to make trouble in the us anyway im not writing this article to scold im really laughing at the idiocy of it ive been showing the students here at saint hill whove come for special briefing and clearing and who are getting clear how to convince pc by flagrant meter reaction that the cat has pdhd him its very funny but youd have to know how an emeter works to appreciate the joke here is the drill you put anybody on an emeter and say have you ever been victim of paindrug hypnotism the meter reacts strongly so of course the test subject on the meter is startled he begins to gape the meter action is so strong its so convincing now you say who did this to you was it_____ and name some person the subject knows or knows of and we see another fall the subject gapes astounded has dear old frank been giving him pdhs how horrible he never would have thought this of poor oldfrank and you leave it at that and your test subject now believes he has been brainwashed by his best friend but you dont leave it at that all right you say do you know of any pets the test subject says yes i have cat well you say did this cat give you dose of paindrughypnosis and the meter falls the test subject is bewildered or ridiculing now but there it is did your cat make you victim of paindrughypnosis you insist and the meter reacts what date you say and the meter reads for midnight 12 july 1960 our subject now has horrible visions of his cat sitting on his chest while he sleeps pdhing him why well people who believe bad things instinctively often arent capable of learning but you are capable of learning so heres the explanation you say to the test subject is this meter falling on the word pain the subject wriggles giggles i sure dont like pain says the subject the meter clears up on it you say is the meter falling on the word drugs and that fall comes off as the person says drugs are pretty bad is the meter falling on the word hypnotism and that fall comes off because the subject realizes that he doesnt like hypnotists and says so or did the meter fall on the word victim the subject now laughs or responds the meter is cleared up in this way now you say have you ever been the victim of paindrug hypnotism the subject laughs you repeat the question the meter doesnt react at all now how about this cat you say or j edgar hoover or whoever did you ever kick this cat do you have overts on this cat well yes says the subject i didnt kick the cat i drowned cat once when and after dating it on the meter midnight 12 july 1960 the exact date of the pdh or one should say the overt on the person cat for the meter reacts on any person or thing on whom the subject has committed overt acts and when these things are inquired into the question have you ever been the victim of paindrughypnotism draws nul meter if it were really true the meter would still respond you have to compartment any meter question to get the truth the emeter never lies but you can ask sloppy question when question the basis of which is false contains restimulative or charged words one has to break the question down to phrases or words get the charge off them and then ask the question again now if the fact is true the meter reacts on the question not the words in the question example asking pc about goal do you want to be freeman and climb ladders and rescue beautiful women the meter falls madly what is it falling on to sort the goal out one must know the whole goal is true or part of it or none of it so one asks do you want to be fireman meter is nul do you want to climb ladders meter is nul do you want to rescue meter is nul beautiful women meter falls off the pin do you have goal to have beautiful women meter falls off the pin again it was beautiful women not fireman that made the meter fall meters are accurate but sometimes people are sort of stupid l ron hubbard ps if there were any advantage in brainwashing which there isnt and if anybody were really pdhd it will clear

how to do assessment on the prehav scale primary and secondary assess primary prehav locate most reactive level by most reactive needle response if several levels react clarify them by asking about one then another very briefly at the primary level you discovered say withhold move over to secondary scale say withhold secondary for that level in the same way as on the primary scale find the most reactive verb on the secondary scale say the withhold secondary run that verb only dont try to run nothing but that secondary scale for the next 5000 hours run only the one verb made up into multibracket command when that one verb longer produces tone arm motion less than 14 of ta division of motion in 20 minutes of auditing means flat get off the level assessed is flat you now assess again on the primary scale you find the most reactive level of the primary scale as before taking this primary level you move into its secondary scale you assess the secondary just like you assess the primary you find one word one level of this secondary scale just one verb that reacts on the needle more than the rest you choose this one verb you run it flat on the tone arm you dont reassess inside this secondary again unless its primary comes up again in new assessments you assess newly on the primary level etc it is always the same system you always do the same steps of selection find primary level find the one point of its secondary that reacts make up command with brackets run the tone arm flat assess again on the primary scale go to its secondary find the secondary make up command and run the secondary flat etc etc etc at this writing only one primary level has had its secondary scale issued that is change which belongs at inverted control but as this is written all the secondary scales for 65 levels of the new primary scale are sitting in box near my desk being mimeoed one by one mary sue jan and dick halpern assisted in the assembly for nights on end or it wouldnt have been ready for 20 years if done by ford foundation or u of pishtush standards so very shortly you will have all secondary levels complete i will later cull them out and arrange them bit neater in gradients but you need them and so they are being mimeographed and sent as they are when you have them all dont do as one person didread that you ran the secondary level and so ran every one of the words in the whole secondary scale without further assessment ruined more pcs it did lrh jlrd l ron hubbard copyright 1961 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6106c02 shspec6 flows prehav scale primary scale person that has flowed in one direction too long eg writer who has written too much shipping clerk who keeps shipping etc one day he will want to stop it is an electrical phenomenon people who are affected by gravity are affected to degree by newtons laws of motion action and reaction when thetan pushes particle out theres recoil effect the law really only applies to masses of comparable magnitude the stuck flow occurs when one neglects the return flows one is in fact receiving one fails to asis it and creates ridge from the resistance if theres been too much inflow ridge may be formed from notised outpushes newtons second law is thus the reason for solidification of flows the facsimiles of back pushes are neglected therefore they stick the stuck flow is reacted to with unconsciousness which is dopeoff if you have someone run flow in one direction in mockup he can either get field in front of his face going black or an avalanche will be triggered where all the things come at him at once or reverse flow avalanche an avalanche of resistance an inversion flow too long in one direction produces reverse flow not just stuck flow this reverse flow is 1 not asised because not noticed 2 resisted then you get flow in the original direction but on an inversion on running ow we can only do this when the pc is below the ability to tolerate change ow is reach and withdraw but only from one terminal and it doesnt account for all the possible motions as long as the individual is below change ow only runs well on f2 see ow limited theory hcob 5jan61 ow is 100 effective below change but not effective above it cf the later order of the grades below the level of tolerating change the individuals inflow and outflow get locked up and change produces ridges on various flow lines therefore the person is individuated cant change his viewpoint resisting change he gets left on some individuated point of the bracket eg he has stuck outflow so he cant relate to people if he was so bad off as to be psycho hed maybe get upset with flow three and maybe get up to obsessive cause if one is fluid on change and doesnt resist it he wont resist the flows and therefore he wont create the ridge when he sets up newtons second law of motion he knows therell be consequence of every thing he does so he knows better than to cause or experience much the consequences of change is change when he cant stand change hell go into ow thats why running brackets is safety factor when ridge is set up it has to be taken apart on both sides alternately if person goes unconscious on running bracket it may be that one flow is overloaded or maybe he isnt really doing one leg of the bracket so you have to check and see about that by asking once on each leg did you answer that to your satisfaction the flow three on brackets is to handle his dispersal in connection with stuck flows the concept of god is interesting what kind of shape would you think god would be in if hed just been creating things and causing everything you could never reach him or say anything to him what kind of duress must he be under to propitiate to us all that much he must be quite spun in anyone whos on such an obsessive cause must be practically nuts we should have society for the resurrection of god he ploughed himself in for us so we should help him out the prehav scale is reactive bank scale when person is eventually able to have he doesnt have to have bank so the bank disappears at the point of have the bank wouldnt be there to measure on an analytical scale the best description of the analytical have scale would be axioms one and two all other truths are the result of postulates agreements and considerations so the scale would depend on what bunch of thetans agreed on it could changethe prehav scale is fixed nowimsupposedto this is it why were here scale its the order of the value of postulates that are fixed and not changeable in the absence of scientology at some time

run by their earliest criterialondon 57which is to say cchs 1 2 3 4 are run in rotation and each only so long as it produces change and longer change is measured by comm lag or alterations of pc in doing process do for instance cch 1 only so long as it is producing changes in pcs responses to doing it twenty minutes of nochange of response should be regarded as nul for the moment one then goes on to cch 2 the same rule applies only if pcs responses are faster or slower or different each time continue the process test for twenty minutes again all of which must produce marked difference of response to the process if process is now nul go on to cch 3 same rules apply go on to cch 4 same rules apply go to cch 1 same rules apply etc etc it is code break clause 13 to change the process while the pc is giving differences of timing comm lag or attitudes of response it is code break clause 13 to fail to change the process when the pc is not giving any differences in timing or attitudes of response if done this way and with good tone 40 wonderful results are achieved by the cchs the case criteria is meant to embrace the auditor case at the bottom and the theetie weetie case sweetness and light case at the extreme top of the graph who will go to graph bottom before the case starts up again as though the profile were cylinder which when it goes off the top then appears on the bottom when people are in serene valences meaning they are wholly overwhelmed as thetan 2 the johannesburg processing check is the same as the joburg security check only it is now being used for processing purposes with great results i have rewritten it in hco ww form 3 as the joburg security check and will rewrite it as hco ww form 4 calling it hgc gain control check or some such name but the questions are about the same meanwhile use form 3 as is in hgcs dont rewrite or omitthe directions are on the check form the difference is that in using the joburg in processing these rules apply 1 clear all needle reaction from any question before going on to the next question bypass reaction you see on the meter to the question if you do let one slide the pc will shortly complain about being given the check if pc starts complaining about the check you have either passed hot question without getting the withhold or he has hot withhold remedy if pc complains continually while being checked during processing not in pure security checking for the org but in using the check in processing you go back to the beginning and start over 2 the joburg used in processing only is done in model session only however on the question are you withholding anything dont spend more time than needed to clear pt withholds on the auditor as the whole check is devoted to withholds 3 if pc refuses check altogether and you cant get on return pc to cchs do them few more hours and try the check again this is all there is to routine one cchs and joburgs and the graph is now the full criteria of when you use routine one routine two this is covered very fully in hco bulletin of may 25 1961 releasing and preparing case for sop goals and other current hco bulletins routine two consists of two steps only 1 joburg checks given as above in routine one 2 general runs on prehav scale without terminal using primary and secondary scales 3 on pt problems of long duration years or within this lifetime only assess on meter for terminal and nul the tone arm for each level level after level using mainly the primary scale 4 find the pcs havingness and confront processes and use them briefly early in each session and at each sessions end and where needed for every general level flattened fully on the prehav level found do joburg for every ptp of long duration completed run joburg the hav and confront processes can be found at any time but are better found after one joburg and one general level flattened why all these joburgs as case gains it gains in responsibility as it gains in responsibility the pc remembers more withholds and considers the things he has done more in the light of having been overts if the case isnt given chance to get rid of these it stalls or the pc is half killed by realizations that he has been bad when the targets of his overts unlessen from pigs to people therefore it is brutally unkind to improve case without then removing the withholds now realized this is also an excellent therapeutic mechanism it is also an excellent test of pcs progress ie if he has more withholds on new joburg that werent found on his last the pc isnt progressing on successive joburgs if new overts and withholds show up that werent there before the pc is not progressing yes ive found why cases stalled and gained only so far and then blew your thanks are in orderthis routine two closely followed and carried out will bring out the state of release in from 50 to 75 hours routine three 1 sop goals assessments for goals and terminals 2 running sop goals terminals flat on every level 3 joburg processing checks as in one and two above 4 use of hav and confront processes as in routine two or finding new hav and confront processes as case gets more able this is the full extent of the things used in routine 3 routines 2 and 3 are not crossed or intermixed routine 3 if one is expert indeed can be done on any case but one can make mistakes find the wrong goal or terminal and so until fully briefed and flawless in trs emeter model session and assessing an auditor will get more case gains per unit of time by using routine two when he or she is release it is much easier some day to have routine 3 then completed if the person is released first in short for sure gains until you are sure of your tools as listed above use routines 1 and 2 when you are perfect in handling sop goals do routine 3 on pcs w r n i n g on running general runs and sop goals terminals on prehav levels the most serious mistake that can be made is not flattening level before reassessing on rough case the ta motion required to end is present at the beginning and so auditors leave the level and leave it unflat if two or more levels are run and left unflat the pc can feel he is spinning flatten levels in this wise 1 run until ta is showing better motion 2 run until needle is practically stuck for the whole of 20 minutes 3reassess example on sticky meter case level assessed build first three hours of

not begin to move for quite while then it begins to move then it nuls so be careful it is better to have ta stuck for 20 minutes than to leave level unflat summary since february 1961 ive been teaching auditors close up and far away how to clear i have now pretty good grip on what they can and will do i have been modifying the tools to fit hands more than to fit cases they already fit the cases and have since february the auditor who can do cchs and has fair command of routines 1 and 2 and who keeps the rudiments in and doesnt q and and who has good d of p behind him to see that he does can get wonderful case results with routines 1 and 2 only the auditor who has perfect trs total command of the emeter perfect model session good grip on assessing and whose case is in excellent shape should attempt sop goalsand that right now isnt two dozen and aside from peter and eliz williams their two new acc clears and few of their acc students aside from the south african clear jean kennedy and very few sa acc students the rest are right here at saint hill at this moment there are none in america and there will only be one there by july 30th 1961 there are none in england outside the boundaries of saint hill who could clear and only one genned in on routine two at hasi london so theres what ive found out after an awful lot of work with you guys ive found most of you can do routine one some of you can do routine two none save the above named can not by permission but by actual fact do routine three ive also found out that all this is very easy to remedy and that your willingness is superb our work is cut out for us but boy do we know where were going we have to get all auditors perfect on the trs model session emeter security checking prehav assessing and sop

reserved6106c06 shspec7 routine one two and three always check for what happened between sessions if the pc has different ta read from the end of one to the beginning of the next session even after just break the definition of rudiments is whats needed to get the pc in session they are nothing more than that dont use ruds to waste auditing ruds processes are weak let the pc asis it by telling you about it but dont two way comm it if the pc is still dramatizing something its too deepseated for ruds anyway if needed you can ask in several ways to find what it is this is not the same as two way comm you can run rudiments process if it doesnt clean up when he spots it with cchs you are auditing out valence end bringing the pc up the valence will fight for survival you will get comm lags etc the cchs are not run in model session you dont pick up arc breaks etc because the person doesnt easily blow them and can get quite involved in them routine one cchs and sec checks routine two general run of the prehav scale joburg and havingness all in model session ptps of ld are assessed for the terminal which is run on the prehav scale routine three sop goals assessment assess for terminals run flat on prehav with joburgs interspersed6106c05 shspec8 routine one two and three an auditing result is determined by 1 the adequacy of the tool being applied modified by 2 what auditors will use which is modified by 3 what they can use good process is one that can be widely applied good procedure is to ask an auditor what hes had gain on himself let him run that until he gets reality with training on something else hell get result where he himself believes he can get result if you increase persons potential responsibility without letting them be responsible for what theyve done it is vicious the person will feel miserable which is better than being irresponsible but theyll stop getting case gain because they feel its not deserved or safe as pc gets processed his reality level on his life and overts comes up thats why sec check reads change as the person gets new auditing the point of doing ow is to bring responsibility up but this is only possible where there is some responsibility the dead thetan case wont read on ow he has total irresponsibility but person cant take responsibility for his acts unless you let him do it and communicate them6106c07 shspec9 points in assessing the problem with communicating scientology is that there are agreedupon realities ready made in words if you give person one of these concepts and its name and definition he will recognize the truth of it but it will take awhile for him to really grasp it and he has to get the concept first this is almost like processing people read dmsmh and got an understanding that changed their physical condition but the ideas of dianetics and scientology havent been familiar to man so it takes awhile or it takes familiarity with them to grasp them you could teach someone the principles of scientology by teaching him the vocabulary youve got to get the ptp of long duration off the pcs case if he has one before you can go on with goals processing because the ptp ld is more real to the pc than anything else on his case his attention is fixed on it if the pc has his attention fixed on the hidden standard youve practically got computation right there it has to be gotten out of the way to get case gain it is always right on the goals chain or it wouldnt be ptp of long duration so when you get it out of the way youve got the case flying it has been mistake not to assess the hidden standard finding out who had it when and what this is presession 38 dianetic assist see hcob 23feb61 pt problem and goals or more certain method would be to run the hidden standard with terminals assessment by elimination whose might it be what might it be etc this line of questioning is interesting both to the pc and casewise because the hidden standard is the primary source of individuation for the pc it is what makes him different from everyone else it is the least well duplicated part of the bank so it will fire off as an automaticity because it is the area that is most out of communication and most out of control the pc could get lots of terminals from this the hidden standard is substitute for the case of the pc it is more real to him than any case or life difficulties the pc may have it is form of individuation the pc is the one with the earache this distinguishes him from others6106c08 shspec10 q and period and ending an intensive lot of specific data about running sop goals6106c09 shspec11 reading emeter reactions auditing latent reads is auditing the analytical mind it is the reactive mind that we are interested in auditing the reactive mind is mind that acts without inspection on the basis of stimulus it puts into action solutions to problems it fancies must exist which may never have existed or which havent existed for billions of years put in any part of the problem and the reactive mind goes into forming the solution thetan is trying to survive who has necessity for trying to survive at all which is the first idiocy so the mind is trying to solve nonexistent problem then it addresses itself to the survival of form the perpetuation of an existing state which would take out all the mest in sensible state and garbleize it the reactive mind is the individuals accumulated goals for the survival of forms the reason it destroys is to get something to survive it creates to get form to survive the reactive mind is the part of the cycle of action that will never move because its keynote is survival of form so it is trying to make something survive that is already dead old bodies identities etc you could remember it if you werent trying so hard to make it survive but because of the survival effort when you try to remember it you get restimulation as if you were still in the period because all the impulse to survive has been trapped and rides up to pt all of these forms have nothing to do with pt but here they are so the reactive mind has starvation for the other parts of his old games eg the opponents and it acts without inspection and very fast to get form to survive you cant take time for inspection this leads to such idiocies as people attacking their own planes or ships in war when theyd gotten used to attacking enemy ones the safe thing to do is not to inspect under battle conditions the jam of the time not taking time to inspect results in noinspection when you speed up things in the physical universe to too great degree on the false basis that you are prone to nonsurvival but in the interest of keeping something surviving youll run into the timeless reactivity of action without inspection so therefore what you are after is instant reads your auditing target is the reactive mind not the pc the only thing wrong with the pc is the reactive mind and there is inspection involved there so he cant see what is wrong with him if he could see it it wouldnt be wrong this is also why the reactive mind is more in control of the auditor than the pc the noinspection factor he cant think on the reactive subjects you can so if you take his instructions on what to do or handle youll always do the wrong things one of the pcs goals is to make his reactive mind survive so he wont let you near any part that should be audited it dictates to you that it must survive it throws you red herrings when you turn around and look when youre running from battle that youre losing you normally get speared therefore its very very bad to look at the things that are pursuing you so you mustnt so you had better prevent the auditor from looking at the things that are pursuing you there is another obscuring element withholdingness is the comm bridge between the pc and the reactive mind when withhold comes out of the reactive mind the pc will do what the reactive mind tells him to do which is to withhold it withholdingness is part and parcel of survival it is protection of forms from attacks and destruction its nonduplication too you withhold your form from duplicating the form of someone youve killed this sets the mechanics going for survival its actually prior to the actual idea of survival so the pc gets into withholding thought the withholding of form is superbasic to all sorts of other things eg individuating the pc also withholds his body from destruction when the pc gives up withhold hes conquered dictate of the reactive mind by being controlled by being the auditor rather than by his bank this is the mechanics by which he feels better when he gets the withholds off because withholds add up to keeping him separated from the human race he can always be counted upon to dramatize the withhold when it comes up on the meter theres first tick then fall as the pc spots it the secondary action is not to get the withhold off the pc but to keep the pc from dramatizing hisreactive bank so we say what was that when withholding the pc is reactive he is dramatizing otherwise hes talking to you analytically or at the dictates of the reactive mind early in the case auditing the pc is like auditing the light bulb to fix the generators in the power plant the emeter helps you locate all the parts in the generator if the pc is left with withhold in session hell arc break half an hour later what youre trying to do is to keep the pc from being fooled about himself if you avoid the reactive mind youre just doing q and with the pchubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 12 june 1961 central orgs franchise the rising needle skip it former acc students will well remember the emeter drill in which among other reactions they were to produce rising needle on their coach the time has come to change nomenclature on this one for practical auditing purposessuch as deciding if sec check question has been cleared or whether particular level of the prehav scale should be runa rising needle is not classified as reaction of the 10 needle actions described in rons new book emeter essentials lets call the following reactions in as much as they are of value to an auditor in deciding what needs to be run on case or what needs further work rock slam fall theta bop stuck change of needle characteristic the following might be called simply needle actions or motionsin that you dont use them in deciding to do something with pc free needle reaction nul stage four rise body reaction about all rising needle tells you is that the pc cant confront therefore has exceedingly low reality responsibility and knowingness on whatever significance its rising on so skip it treat rising needle for practical purposes like security check or assessment like nul needle you neednt pursue this particular subject any further at this point in the case because the pcs knowingness and responsibility on this subject is practically nil there may very well be further material available on this particular subject after the pc has had some more auditing but not now so let go of it skip it so its putting the tone arm up this rise all right thats why emeters are built with tone arms that rotate sometimes they go up fine you dont need to do blessed thing about it and shouldnt try just keep on with your check assessment or whatever it is youre doing let your auditing guides be the rock slam fall theta bop chiefly plus stick and change of pattern if its rise with sticks in it you do find out whats putting the stick into it if it were rising needle with rock slam in it youd investigate the rock slam but the rise itself or needle that is simply rising you ignore in this way you will save hours and hours of auditing time trying to kill rise by finding out what its rising on is attacking the case at its least approachable pointthe point responsibility reality confrontingness and knowingness are at their lowest the point when the pc and the meter is least capable of helping you or himself why try to scale wall where its 20 feet high when you can walk through the breaches in it so gear him in instead where the needle is reacting with rock slam falls theta bop or sticks where he has some reality andresponsibility where he knows something about it and can confront it little that way hell move and youll both win lrhim rd l ron hubbard copyright 1961 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6106c12 shspec12 emeter actions errors in auditing the emeter only reacts on those things that the pc is aware of or capable of becoming responsible for this responsibility factor becomes reality factor so you can audit what appears on the meter things that dont appear are beyond the pcs zone of responsibility getting new reads on sec checks is thus test of the pcs advance in responsibility if change there is some gross outness countering the auditing dont get trapped by all the little minor errors these gross efforts come from the impulse to make nothing out of something which goes back to productivity the effort to produce is one half of the dichotomy all strikes are on the other half the effort not to produce many people are dedicated to non production nosurvival this comes about as reaction to stuck flow on must survive many operations would go better if just left alone todays planned balanced economies reminiscent of markab which specialized in this generally result in unbalanced messed up economics produce and nonproduce should be on the secondary prehav scale the goal could also be results here we are talking about continually recurring gross errors not just occasional errors anyone will do that dont attempt total perfection or youll never complete or accomplish anything people get so tense about doing it right that theyll never get anything done good exercise to cure perfectionism is to deliberately decide something is finished without the finishing touches when you can do perfect trs metering etc you can relax and just audit with anxiety communicating to the pc you must exude confidence in order to give people hope which is fundamental necessity to making someone well or better mainly it has to appear that you are trying to do something for the pc not that you are trying to be perfect using instant reads one gets at all the held down fives in the bank using latent reads one is handling all the pcs concerns about why the fives were held down this is longer road to clear6106c14 shspec14 seminar withholds you dont destroy records when you are pulling withholds and you dont agree with the pc to do this if you do it is as much as if you were telling him youll withhold for him and he wont get much gain the only liability to getting the pc to where he cant be influenced by the reactive mind is that in sense you are auditing him towards state of noeffect total serenity total noeffect the way the lamaist did it the individual must be able to experience to live it is possible to plough someone in on level and make them look good but not clear this is education by fixation see p 37 one should be able to do anything on the prehav scale repairing his ethics will eradicate his impulse to do hasty things and get action on rational basis as result of inspection not based on inhibition this is new thing on earth in human behavior theres nothing wrong in theory with native state processing as practiced in 1957 and 1958 knowingness deteriorating by postulate to notknow to must know to cant know forget to remember this processing was too simple and of too much generality to be functional an ot process tell an intention that failed tell an intention that succeeded would be onebutton clear process if that could be run since its axiom 10 factor 2 but its too simple to plumb the reactive mind with certain level of complexity is necessary to resolve cases the worse off person is or the clearer they are the more you need to run the secondary scale greater complexity how many buttons are there there are all the beingnesses ever all the doingnesses ever all the things anyone ever had or could have you cant force person to grasp reactively things which are analytically obvious because its reactive and nutty process must have some complexity to be effective at reactive level and some simplicity to make it easy to administer if one invalidates the basic agreements and identifications of the mest universe mest changes characteristics for instance if you stop agreeing that water runs downhill and challenge that itll go all gelatinous and globby security check is running all the notknow off the case that it has run on everyone and everything for god knows how long you are actually running the native state cycle of sequences not withholds at all overts consist of putting notknows into the third dynamic for instance someone robs store the storekeeper comes in and doesnt know who did it or when or when it might happen again also notknowing where the stuff is that was taken then the storekeeper runs the notknow on the police now the area has notknow that accumulates in the society until people cant trust each other and cant produce and the society is aberrated someone feels better when he gets off the overt of creating ignorance eventually hell realize that this overt worried people thats another overt then eventually he cognites on the notknow overt and hell notice his memory improving his iq going up as he runs out overts of making people notknow or be stupid in other words sometimes case will recover totally by getting off one big overt auditors dont effectively run presession what question shouldnt i ask you etc see hcob 15dec60 because they arent imaginative enough about all the evil in the world it also requires the auditor to create not knows about the pc it works better to give the auditor list of mean nasty vicious not knows someone might have run on the world this doesnt run notknow on the auditor this is the sec check different sec checks should be devised for different routines routine three cases need wholetrack lists otherwise their whole track memory will get occluded whole track memory depends on some kind of whole track sec check this also answers the question of why pcs feel better after giving up same withholds but not others and what is withhold its running dont know or cant know on self or others when the overt is on someone else it gives big resurge when it comes off messing up time by lying is different breed of cat its creating for one thing all of life is an invented episode writing fiction is done with the intention to amuse and inform the only notknow in it is to keep the reader from knowing the end before he gets there the onlyaberrating thing about it for the writer is that its creative effort which can wind someone up in the soup cf the effect on some people of step six if you tell lie to obscure your own guilt thats another notknow or false knowingness which eventually makes the person feel that all life is pretense cf the sociopath auditing then becomes just literary criticism of life as romantic episode6106c15 shspec15x notknow theres mechanical side and thought side of boiloff one is prone to worry when the pc boils off but it is only matter of concern if the auditor ceases to audit because of it the mechanical definition of boiloff is stuck flow lot of stuck flows got parked on the track and when the pc hits them he boils off most of the time when the pc goes unconscious if you kept giving the auditing command the pc would keep on doing it at about the same speed or bit slower as when he was awake because the pc isnt really unconscious if he didnt hear you theres harm done it s not an implant situation he comes right through it the thought definition of boil off is that it is the accumulated notknow the pc has run on everybody unconsciousness is merely the intensification of notknowingness you could even run notknow in the course of being kind by not telling people that theyre upsetting or bugging people they will make enemies who eventually hit them surprising them because one told them they were messing people up immanuel kant introduced notknow into philosophy with his transcendentalism this killed philosophy until scientology came around the greek philosophies amounted to this if you couldnt lick them confuse them with entertainment and philosophy this outcreation with philosophy and entertainment was very effective means of conquest many philosophies have been mere dramatizations of prehav levels relying for their force on bank agreement by observing what people underline in books you can see that what people go for is what agrees with their banks one gets into this frame of mind as result of thinking truth is merely subjective there is broad truth this is the philosophy of the only one solipsism also general semantics then theres dale carnegies 11ism which tries to communicate with an unreality they run notknow on people by being nice and the people sense it too where reality is not present notknow is substituted for it an unreality is created whenever you substitute an unknown for known communism does this well with the iron curtain or take someone who always says im fine when you ask how are you theyre substituting nonfact for an observable fact giving you an unreality that eventually makes then disappear curious phenomena will occur around someone who is doing this they eventually do disappear but if theres terrific notknow about someone he persists like mad for instance the monk dharma who lived 10000 years ago in india formed the basis for most indian religions but nothing is known about him or what he said the leastknown philosopher is someone whose name we dont even know hes influential in the background of laotse confucius and buddha he is held in place by the notknow this is dharma who is not even thought of now as person but as fate on personal level notknow shows up as boiloff an extreme manifestation is unconsciousness at lesser level its death notknow at its most extreme is when person cannot go unconscious we call that insanity death is state of beingness not an action unconsciousness is lower well below death one can get knocked off and go on knowing what is happening insanity is where person cannot notknow the fifteenth substitute for reality delusory state they worry about these things laying in wait for them theyre in state of combat with the unknowable this can go on the tone scale on level of notknow from serenity about the unknowable on down they may seem fairly sane at the top but they dont know what it is they dont know about and are looking for they get down to grief about not having found out what it is they dont know about the guy will also be utterly fixed on the track if you know what you are unhappy or bugged about you are not insane merely wondering the fact that you can wonder why demonstrates that you are not insane knowing this one wont be baffled about insanity for bafflement is just q and with not knowingness the reason one gets worried about the insane case is q and of trying to find out what the case doesnt know what he doesnt know is notknow if you can speculate about what you dont know you will be ok you can introduce some sanity into someone who is spinning by getting him to think of one person who doesnt think he is insane because you have introduced knowingness into his unknowingness or you could use one command look around here and find something which is really real to you6106c16 shspec16x confront and havingness havingness gets eaten up by valences and consumption circuits until the pc is clear or nearly so then it orients him and stays with him stably as long as he has dominant valence or dominant machinery havingness gets eaten up any gain it gives is in ten to twelve commands any more than that is waste of time arc straightwire does lot for havingness at first also havingness works by shifting attention but doesnt asis the banks masses it just moves them around details on running routines one and two and havingness and confront processes if case with lot of auditing hasnt had significant change the policy is that regardless of graph meter read or anyones opinion you run routine one cchs and sec checks this is the most rapid way to make the case change its just the effective thing to do this prevents you from making mistake on the case the only reason someone gets upset about being run on cchs is that pride enters into processing which is in itself sign of some nuttiness6106c19 shspec15 q and period auditing slowdowns test for release the person should not be reading weirdly on meter the sensitivity knob should be down you should get good drop with sensitivity zero you should get reaction on the questions do you think youll get any worse does scientology work for you how do you feel about help how do you feel about control every time you find something in the pc struggling for survival it isnt the pc because he cant do anything but survive its valence every valence fights for survival it can be such clever valence that it can fool the auditor the auditors code is there so the valence wont feel challenged so it wont kick back before you can jump it the pc gets most upset by the auditors failure to handle his case the valence says see the red herring if the auditor complies the pc will get unmanageable because hes lost confidence in the auditors control the auditor neednt apologize for positive certain control thats how to make valences lose and pcs win kindness validates valences not pcs valences arent hard to handle if you are certain and let it come across auditing weakly gives power to the pcs circuits and valences auditing with certainty validates the pc instant read is within tenth of second the death of the ego is the death of the valence6106c20 shspec16 sec check questions mutual rudiments the perfect answer to any question is the exact question when it is correctly asked it is answered say you are trying to lay out serving equipment in hotel kitchen when you finally spot exactly what youre doing you perceive that you are not arranging machinery but trying to accomplish some exact result like trying to get food from to b in asking the person whos going to use it what he needs you are getting more precise phrasing of the real question you wanted to ask when you have all the data to define the exact question you will have the answer the borderline between the reactive mind and the analytical mind is the broad savannah of i dont know things get foggy on it the pc knows something is there but sees nothing very clearly the auditors action in compartmenting and clarifying the question helps to pinpoint the source of fog for the pc the exact answer to problem is the exact problem when correctly phrased or asised this is why repetitive look at problem and rephrasing of it will cause resolution we have made recent discovery of magnitude weve known that coaudit teams tended to make less progress than hgc auditing but not why the answer is now known the first clue was the d of ps finding auditors ruds on pcs out even when the auditor found them in it turns out that the ruds werent out with the auditor it was mutual ruds of the team that were out with others but not the team for instance the pair agree the pcs family are swine so it wont read on ruds but someone else who isnt in on the agreement will find the pcs out ruds the meter registers on disagreements one way to solve it is formula 13 failed help and ow on terminals alternated see hcob 1dec60 cleaning up all the people who read or on ruds substituting we for you even cchs can do it6106c21 shspec17 seminar at saint hill details on running prehav 13 its process which combines overt running with prehav assessment and running of brackets relative to list of charged terminals at upper level strata beingness is higher than doingness and doingness is higher than havingness to do can squeeze get hands relaxedly in your lap then squeeze them gently with the hand itself not clear on up to the shoulders6106c22 shspec18 running cchs the way the cchs are run is 1 2 3 4 over and over and over it is breach of the auditors code clause 13 to run process beyond the point where it is producing change or to stop running one which is producing change the words in the process have very little to do with the process theyre run with meat and motion they are all done by compulsion if necessary the pc never has an opportunity not to execute the command the consequences of letting pc out of doing the command are grave the cchs run out surgery shock etc as the pc dramatizes you should run the process flat which means the pc has the same aspect for twenty minutes matter what the aspect is and matter how nutty or unconscious as long as the pc is doing the command change means such things as somatics etc it may be necessary to run cchs for few hours before they bite you dont pay attention to what the pc says its what he does though if he communicates to you that something is happening thats change running cchs permissively will also screw up the pc you must apply control to get communication and communication to get control irresponsibility denies havingness so sec checks also raise havingness all ow running since it raises responsibility results in havingness prehav really means prevent havingness scale it consists of those things that prevent havingness this is gotten off in routine 2 see p 34 or hcob 5jun61 the fixed reactive buttons that prevent the pc from having things are gotten out of the road on routine 3 the pc gets out of the road all those unrealized goals each of which has been defeat hence denial of havingness so havingness is the end product of all this ow raises havingness because the individual individuates from things because he cant have them so he develops overts only on those things he cant have so when you get the overts off he can have if you could have the whole universe it gives you trouble its only the things you cant have that you have trouble with next time you have ptp see whats in it and what prevents you from having them individuation from the thing the dynamic the universe is what brings trouble because you get into an obsessive games condition which adds up to you cant have it and it cant have anything to do with you the cchs knock out individuation from the physical beingness which has been caused from the pc to his body and apparently his body to him thats why they run out electric shocks etc and you have to let him take more responsibility or he wont improve his havingness you have to maintain control or youll show him the body cant be controlled so it can continue to overwhelm the pc also the pc will become practically unauditable misguided kindness is all that could let you allow the pc to control the session its actually vicious thing to do even if the pc is right in his advice dont follow it hell gain more from being run wrong but under your control than right under his own if youre going to err err on the side of control and toughness not sweetness and light its better to end the process wrongly on the auditors determinism than to end it rightly on the pcs if you let the pc take control youre very liable to get an arc break half hour later you may not notice that its because you lost control because of the lag but the way to handle it is to spot the point where you lost control and reassert it if the auditor is in control of the session auditing takes place if the auditor is not in control of the session reactivity takes place if you flinch from auditing its from those times when you didnt control the session

all cases that have had significant or rapid change over long periods of auditing shall be run on routine 1 hco bulletin of june 5 1961 regardless of graph meter behaviour or objections this applies

objects theyve been looking at facsimiles of the objects when the facsimile asises the wall looks bright such people tend to have bad depth perception because they never see anything they are easily invalidated because the reason hes making and looking at facsimiles is that the physical universe isnt safe for him the auditor begins to be real as the pc sees that he can duplicate him so if the auditor indicates eg on cchs 3 or 4 you didnt do it the auditor ceases to be real and the pc will put pictures of him up instead overrunning the process tells the pc that he was wrong to think hed got it this makes auditing unsafe the purpose of the cchs is to make the auditor the physical universe and present time real to the pc to show him he can observe the auditor the room and pt his havingness on otherdeterminism is very low the cchs remedy it he sees somebody else exists and the universe is here you can run cchs wrong by making the pc aware that the auditor and the room are real but dangerous when running child take account of the childs shorter attention span if its biting run it at least an hour before youd expect it to flatten exteriorization as done in 19525 was unstable lrh found that before thetan could get along without body he had to be able to have body and people who exteriorize easily generally want nothing to do with one philosophies that strive for peace are covert operation towards making people succumb spots of sudden change of pace are spots which brake persons life theyve got upsets in them and advice to take it easy and from then on it goes wrong they were asked to confront motionlessness which is most difficult to do medicine and psychiatry gave drugs etc to make person be quiet unless person can confront motion hes dead he cant confront life cant work and will become criminal the natural consequence of adopting motionless philosophy is to get religion peaceful one if you enforce nomotion on someone and make him think motion is bad hell get buddhistic road safety campaigns make sense because they emphasize going slowly less motion not keeping unsafe drivers off the roads or putting freight on trains the more you make population motionless the higher the crime rate tv corrupts the youth because it pins child motionless not because of the tv material the theory that people get seasick because of motion led lrh to think one should have pictures of very still scenes to counteract this he chose some thought about it and started to feel seasick he realized that whats needed is pictures of motion to accustom them to motion not motionlessness the cure for motion is motion not stillness philosophies of motion dont necessarily mean criminality eg space opera if you could keep it up with rest you might manage to be ok when you become incapable of handling the motion of life you can then start to experience pain the experience of pain comes about because of intolerance of motion you can run motion or nomotion to handle this situation predictable motion is better from the pcs viewpoint than unpredictable motion because with unpredictable motion he doesnt know what to confront when he gets the idea that its bad not to be able to confront everything at once he starts to butter all over the universe stick on the track etc also whenever person gets hit hard by life or as soon as he begins program to coerce people into working harder that person will obsessively start producing production follows defeat as in germany japan etc someone whos been defeated will produce more bank than someone whos doing well so in eradicating on the one hand persons intolerance of motion and on the other hand his failures or defeats you are causing his bank to disappear the first can be done by cchs the second by goals running everything becomes cure for past failures every goal is consequence of not having done we dont erase the bank the person gets accustomed to not needing one the person himself takes over the automaticities of beingness identities doingness creation and havingnessmost havingness is the result of defeat and the whole cure sequence where nearly everything in the universe is cure for past failures every goal also is the result of not having done so we get intolerance of motion feelings of defeat ability to have without having defeated anything if you can remedy those things for someone youve produced new being who is not the same as an old being whos never had the experience his knowingness of whats happened doesnt leave him but his knowledge of the consequences of what hes done lets him emerge as veteran of campaigns unscarred by his battles tough and capable that which strips all games from the universe would normally result in motionlessness but how about ending certain games for somebody who doesnt have the consequence of ending in motionlessness youve broadened the persons view of games he can play this gives him more games not less play is delusory motion about which youre not supposed to be serious so youre not supposed to asis it so person gets trapped in it because its not real play is dishonest doingness work is not serious activity person can work at sport and have fun as his job also if you dont just do what you are doing but put an i should be doing something else in youll stick in it if one just did what he did when he did it he wouldnt get stuck in it morality is nowimsupposedto which makes people not willing to do what theyre doing when they do wrong so they never asis their wrong acts so they continue to do them its certainty then that one gets persistence of the things he doesnt want or tanglement of the things he does want then he wonders why he feels odd so auditing is straightening someone out so he has tolerance for motion and motionlessness and can have what he should have or not as the case might be as he wishes to do that you have to erase all the oddities of doingness all the pain and boredom of motion or nomotion the prehav scale disentangles all the doingnesses but if you make the pc intolerant of motion or be motionless when he cant or give him failures in auditing or dont make it duplicative so he cant have then you reverse the process goals are to large extent do something else or nowimsupposedto if the individual isnt doing anything he simply isnt doing anything there should be now imsupposedto superimposed upon the situation6106c26 shspec20 dealing with attacks on scientology scientology doesnt have an achilles heel so its in good position to defend itself people do get upset when confronted with new idea but new theories get accepted fairly quickly eg harvey on blood circulation socrates on the nature of man proponents of new theories dont necessarily get martyred the ones that do generally are getting motivators for their overts as tyrants also if one continually fails to advance an idea one may get suicidal and die for it eg christ and socrates lrh believes in making an idea effective not to fail at it and make everybody feel guilty because they kill you its not necessary to sacrifice oneself for new idea thats just way to protect old ideas man is great believer in nochange while he obsessively changes everything so new ideas are rejected scientology is over the top but it is still being fought because to the degree that one is right to that degree he is dangerous we threaten to upset lot of beliefs and customs its only safe for us to do it because we can undo what we do for instance we can run out bad auditing the reason there is question on sec checks about overts on lrh is that if one had lot of overts on ron and scientology one could acquire forceful overwhelming valence called scientology so this is the first time anyone has said try it and see in the early days people said we should go big on aesthetics lrh said you can always overwhelm thetan with aesthetics but its not desirable to overwhelm thetan if its true far you its true not because weve overwhelmed you were attacked because we have evil motives people get frantic because they cant figure out whats the ditch if you can make thetan commit overts against you or set him up where he can commit the overts and remove any possibility of running the overts you can overwhelm him and get him so stamped dawn with valence that he cant even wiggle in other words you set person up where he cant receive an overt from you you wont commit one and on the other hand you set him up where he can commit overts on you and cannot get them run out then youve done him in good and proper former efforts at this were entrapments it isnt really an effort towards total freedom either since it allows for games man becomes alarmed at the fact of there being this selfless philosophy that doesnt demand that one become subjugated and enslaved by it and that it doesnt say that the originator of it must be carried on an imperishable valence that everyone should bow down to when attacked all one needs to do is to take effective actions not get frantic just keep up effective pressure investigate loudly and dont feel rushed about it let it coast when people are in terror they make mistakes so let them make the mistakes for instance man called ettleman had been hired by the ama and the apa to attack scientology in this case which went on for three years when it finally came to trial his attorney didnt show so the case was dismissed all that can be zone to an organization or person is to harass them to the point where theyre too worried to do their job so keep the reaction to attack to the minimal effective actions dont waste time and keep the show on the road the more you worry about the attacks the more motion you waste and the less scientology you get done so all the enemy can do is to get negative gain by reducing your effect see if its your game before playing it nothing wastes as much time as the law because the law has overts against time if one anywhere fought scientology it would be as nothing unimportant think of all the philosophies that must have been developed in the past eleven years none of them have been fought sure sign that we have ignorance and aberration on the run is that there are attacks and fights the process is biting start worrying when there are more attacks also note that our comm lines are far more rapid and effective than the enemys and must be kept up this alone discourages the enemyhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 27 june 1961 franchise holders central orgs tech depts routine one it has been noted that hour of joburg for hour of cchs has been taken to mean you run the cchs for an hour and then the joburg sec check for an hour this is very wrong if another auditor is giving the joburg it should be given in the same day an auditor less skilled on cchs could thus be employed for half the auditing day giving joburgs but the cchs must be run as they are supposed to be run run one two three four one each one to temporary flat point 20 minutes of auditorobserved change of comm lag or demeanour not pcs statements about change or somatics and when one is biting you flatten that cch as per the 20 minute test if one auditor is doing cchs and joburg sec check whenever he has pc temporarily flat on cch he can give page of joburg probably onethird of the auditing time is best for sec check rather than one for one in time with cchs if one auditor is doing both pc can go three days on cchs without sec check at time when cch that was unflat but is now temporarily flat sec check consisting of couple of pages or more can be given in any event about five hours worth for fifteen hours of cchs for one auditor if you have two auditors on case one giving cchs one sec checks this means 2l2 hours in the morning on cchs 2l2 hours in the afternoon on sec checks or vice versa some pcs getting sec checks in the morning and some pcs getting them in the afternoon would keep all auditors busy i hope this helps you to handle routine one l ron hubbard lrh imj rd copyright 1961 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6106c27 shspec21 cchs circuits the way to bust up machinery on cch1 is to vary the pace hell jump the command if machine is doing it one effect of the cchs is to help the pc find the auditor if he goes on automatic he doesnt have an auditor just running the cchs will run it out varying ones pace will prevent it from starting if you just use intention on the pc and verbal commands your intention may be good but the pcs command circuits may be goofed up and you may not get the response you expected he may not be hooked up the way he should you can have fun with meter talking to the entities in body you could start talking to the pcs circuit but it hooks in harder and harder it hooks in on drop of havingness and you are making comm line talk across to his circuit youre validating the circuit and lowering the pcs havingness if the pc has problem and you try to run think of solution repetitively the pc caves in you are running off the core of an area of motion leaving the motion on automatic the pc is not confronting the actuality of the thing hes not confronting whats going on at all hes confronting solution to it that is hes trying to notis what it is and the problem mass moves in on him if you get him to spot the mass connected with the problem then describe the problem then spot the mass it moves further away if you get him to think of solutions the mass will move in problems of comparable magnitude will also move the problem out this occurs because of confront if the pc avoids it it moves in you can also move the mass out with havingness solution is stable nomotion datum amidst confusion circuits can be used to get data to verify answers to calculations confirm if they are right or wrong or to give you tomorrows weather the latter takes the increment of time that is tomorrow and inspects it this is possible if you can look with equanimity at tomorrow at least its insignificant aspects you can predict to the degree that you can confront people who cant confront pt obsessively try to confront tomorrow or yesterday but its not real tomorrow and probably not real yesterday either the way you go nuts on circuits is to ask yourself who put that there or who else put that there and what does it mean this gives you mystery pcs who dont control their circuits and havent inspected them for many years or eons have things popping up all the time when you audit them some get auditing answers from their circuits the circuits were put up as substitute for confronting and are so old and forgotten that now nothing about them is confronted when the pc nears one of them it tells him what to do or say since circuit is just noconfront running havingness and confront improves circuits the pc may have originally put circuit there for convenience and then come to believe that it was unconfrontable because there was circuit there you could say to the pc were going to handle your primary aberration so make picture of it and look at it tell what you see youd get amazing answers the action of taking picture of it then looking is of course an alteris of confront in auditing you want people to look directly at things circuits encourage them not to because they think they cant confront something as you audit pc these things go live as havingness drops the pc gets anxious keys in circuits to predict or confront drops or as the pc improves and circuits can be activated as the pc comes up through them so everything goes on via auditing walks him up to less and less vias more and more confidence the reason confront isnt on the prehav scale is that it isnt doingness its an ability cf p 22 where confront is described as an action also cf p 40 where confront is defined as subjective havingness or at least the process is defined as subjective havingness process that explains oddities you get running cchs youre activating and knocking out circuits because direct control and communication brings about continuous shift of circuitry in terms ofhavingness then since hes been gotten to pt confronting the auditor this brings his havingness up if you talked to those circuits they might well say anything which is also true of the pc on cchs so the less attention you day to what the pc is saying or thinking the better dope off and comm lag indicate things happening to the pcs confront and havingness circuits go haywire when they contain the postulate that the thetan is unable to confront apart from that they can be useful6106c28 shspec22 raw meat troubleshooting cases details on handling raw meat cases tests etc if pc has persistent out ruds check for continuous pt overts at least at the level of unkind thoughts on automatic this is very common you can handle this with prehav 136106c29 shspec23 wrong target sec check herbie parkhouse telexes from london auditors arent getting sec checks done because it takes two to three hours to get ruds in he wants to scrap model session for processing checks this is an unusual solution people are now in the same position about auditing that ron was in when he started researching life theres been so much alteris and countercreate the truth is obscured naturally in relaying comm about the simplicities of life these things get restimulated and people start looking around corners when the cop is right on the sidewalk there is secret about life it is just surrounded by alteris and obfuscations people arent doing their jobs because they are so busy doing other things for instance government is so busy doing the work or charitable organizations that it has time to administer justice protect citizens from criminals etc in good government production rises people prosper welfare state government attacks producers with taxes its all off post everything is trying to make you wear its hat so in scientology the person who is on the ground observes parkhouse by not observing caused ron to interiorize into his hat the analytical mind isnt really computing machine it is the pc when he or the analytical mind is attacked by the auditor youll get auditing done your target in the reactive mind this is why lrh can do in 5 hours what it took other auditors 25 hours to do the difference isnt that lrh is good and others are lousy it is that the other auditors reactive minds were apparently choosing the pc as their randomity attacking the pc because he was aberrated the target is the reactive mind you sit down you take the emeter you say have you ever stolen anything what you really want is for him to recall ventilate air the reactive mind you shouldnt assume he already knows and purposely wont tell you when you do sec check because of the specific question he remembers it and will ordinarily tell you if you get heavy reads and he says have him keep looking let him know theres something there but maintain arc the proper attitude is you couldnt possibly remember this and not tell lets just get the show on the road when they look hunted use light touch to get them to tell you if youre suspicious and accusative youre cutting comm with the pc and encouraging him to withhold assume that if he remembers it hell tell it at once it puts him in session that way the meter check is just to make sure we got all of it its up to the auditor to create an atmosphere of communication you can use some dunnage to do it this approach gets the pc comfortable relaxed confident his knowingness comes up he gets relief after all you are the auditor not the emeter the guy gets to where he feels safe his anxieties come from feeling unsafe in life so your attitude alone can produce great change in the pc if youre using the meter and he says you dont assume he knows and wont tell you but that he hasnt overwhumped the reactive mind youre disappointed but you assume he can remember this builds his confidence and gets him in hopeful frame of mind doing it this way speeds it up enormously gives faster gains its not that hes getting more confident in you its that hes getting more confident in his ability to overwhump his bank you get far more off the case faster by this method youll slow it down by making sure he wont want to tell you and has to be trapped and beaten into telling you dont ever assume games condition in auditing this will also keep the rudiments in since ruds go out with rough auditing set yourself up as someone who can be confided in rather than as cop sniffing out the

trs talk on auditing details on running trs cchs and prehav 13 and routine 26107c03 shspec26x routine 1a problems routine 1a is problems processing alternated with sec checks it is to handle cases that are too tied up with out ruds to run cchs what is it that makes problem so deadly in processing problem is postulatecounter postulate an indecisional proposition because the two sides are in balance one can hardly confront the two data at once the pc doesnt see the amount of confusion on it and the confusion mounts up around each side of it thus you get two separate zones of confusion each side with its stable datum because each side has yes and about it so you dont as is the problem and it persists thats its most basic characteristic people get impatient with problems so they solve them but problem solved has been notised not asised the solution of problem is of course an overt against problem everything in the universe is cure for something else solution this is one reason the universe persists cures deteriorate and solutions become new problems alcohol century ago was curing things even diseases once cured something cf sickle cell disease the bacteria that caused disease once cured something take an organization that is hammer and tongs on the subject of creativeness the catholic church they have the hatchet out on the 2d they dont think creation should be done that can be prevented they oppose vd campaigns because they think vd is good thing as cure for sex if you get vd sex stops so if sex stops you get vd sex vd because vd sex prostitution is also nosex proposition so it gives nosex disease sex is cure for bodies and bodies is cure for sex you dont get pc whose idea is horses sleep in bed who wasnt curing something with that idea every aberration hes got was cure for something his motionlessness is cure for having killed so many people if you pick up withholds on killing he will be able to move again killing too was cure for something maybe for hating people hate in its turn was cure for associating with people whom you might damage and damaging people was cure for people being people etc an aberration is cure that doesnt cure that you dont understand this all goes back to confusions and stable data if you have two confusions and two stable data opposed to each other which you dont confront you get an endurance because you never asis the thing you solve it pcs who go through vias continually on an auditing command have some problem theyve never looked at as problem when you run problems of comparable magnitude youve taken the via of curing the problem off automatic and sneakily gotten the pc to take look at the problem certain conditions that are designed to cure other conditions actually create them eg snakes venom makes snake antipathetic and snakes have venom because people and other animals dont like them the willingness to solve problems but not to asis them is the basis for q and people dont like getting the question fully duplicated as the answer this is because they are trying to solve some very fundamental confusion they have an effective method of teaching is to try to find the source of the question if you try to cure confusion it continues duress and punishment are the results of despairing of solving someones problems jails and mental hospitals are the cure for confusions about people this seems awfully drastic but it is born out of despair the effect of jails is to merely educate criminals more into hating people there is way to make correct and frontal attack on these confusions they often stem from withholds so joburg will help you may note that pc may look bit confused as he tries to find the problem he was solving problem remember is multiple confusion there are two solutions or ideas involved each with its own confusion an encysted confusion so one tries to back off from it which only pulls the problem along this is why thinking of solution makes the problem mass move in you cant really escape your own ideasthought mass is basically composed of problems it endures because its not confronted given enough of this the pc will be overwhelmed and will dramatize being problem one which is insoluble so you keep worrying about the pc because the pc is problem pc who says he has had gain is saying im problem solve your chances of doing it are poor hes got two confusions and cant confront either pcs whose needles keep rising are notconfronting problem you ask how are you doing the pc says fine the needle rises you ask what happened the pc says nothing its discouraging they cant tell you what it is because they cant confront it cchs will saw through this but slowly slowgain case is heavy on comm lag or not quite on the subject when hes talking the comm lag stems from noconfront so does the alteris which is dissociation from the confusion you ask the pc if hes got problem he gets upset because he cant confront it and knows he cant and he wants to avoid it altogether phenomena observed in the field stem from problems on noconfront or inverted basis in fields of stress or duress religious cults make their finest harvest they offer an escape from problems the reason alcoholics anonymous doesnt cooperate with scientology is that they have for their very existence contrary datum alcoholism cant be cured you cant do anything about it so you might as well join aa matter where you go you can never get away from yourself if you try to pretend you are not where you are you get dispersal of location youll be buttered all aver the universe the guy who permeates everything without being anywhere is trying to escape his problems which all carry noconfront you put motion and action into thought process and they become inextricably tangled up inextricably that is short of scientology processing all this is prelude to very simple killer process for the pc for whom all life is problem the difficulty for the pc is series of ridged problems the ridges people have trouble with surrender on this one command which is horrendous to run because it moves very slowly at first and turns on fierce somatics recall problem you must be very careful to get the question answered on recall problem you should ask what problem was that and make sure he is not giving you generality instead of specific problem the pc will come up with some interesting solutions which will suddenly turn awful hell discover hes been both sides of various conflicts each side to solve losing on the other if the pc does locational on some object hes used to solve problem of boredom hell come uptone to interest this is another reason touch assists work more details on running routine 1a6107c04 shspec27x problems and solutions only lrh could get simplicity on auditing problems usually when one tries to look at them he just gets confused the only mistake psychiatry made about psychosis was to try to understand it since its basically incomprehensible thats its whale character then they have to use heroic measures which fail and leave them place to turn the common denominator of psychosis is problems of course when the problems cant be associated with the solutions any longer you get solutions to problems which is psychosis when psychosis has been objectively described theres missing datum what problems is this behavior solution to cf rd laing and j haley the lack of this datum makes the psychosis incomprehensible you cannot cure psychosis by addressing the psychosis or more generally you cant cure an aberration by addressing the aberration this is because in so doing you are running the still in the middle of the motion the stable datum in the middle of the confusion the solution youre trying to cure the solution and not looking at the confusion you are looking at the cure which wont move out unless you get the motion off it the whirlpool wouldnt whirl without the motionless center but the center is motionless only because it has motion around it you should take the whirlpool off the motionless piece not the other way around here you have confusion and the stable datum motion and motion sound and silence absolute location and change if you try to get the motionless points out all you get is new motionless points all that is wrong with thetan is what is wrong at the lower and of the scale at the highest level thetan can be motionless at the lowest level he has to be its matter of determinism at the lower levels motionlessness is not determined by postulate but by the mechanics of motion if you want to see someone stiffen and go still stand fellow up shake your hands in front of his face produce lot of motion and say theres the motion at this point the fellow will sort of freeze as he becomes stable datum but this doesnt work well as demonstration because the observers will also all go still in sort of stupidity they wont confront the motion theyll put barrier up against it and become still so the motion will duplicate them and they will butter themselves all over the universe and become agitated auditing motionlessness just makes more motionlessness in the bank stillnesses identify more rapidly than motion in psychosis the person is being stillness the worst example of this is catatonia there cant be such thing as anaverage individual there can only be someone who is trying to be lot of other individuals and is therefore buttered all over the universe in terms of beingness hell be obsessively still the next step down is going round the bend the operations this universe uses to try to make one assume the average are so numerous that one accents then as normal insanity is the adoption of solution to the exclusion of all other solutions in the absence of problem if person confronts problems takes responsibility for them and goes into being solution all problems go on automatic they just go on all around him there can be million problems but theres only one solution him psychiatrist is being an obsessive solution also he never really cures anything he just persists with his ineffective solutions which just hold the problem in place he isnt aware that psychosis is problem hes handling people who are being obsessive solutions so he becomes one too the psychiatrist is the societys solution just as his solution is shock treatment psychotics dont realize others have problems or that theyre being problems to others psychiatrys research has been search for solutions but they hate solutions and they dont recognize the problem man has made the mistake all along the track of not realizing that if theres solution there must have been problem look at the ten commandments actually theres 162 pagesof them these are moral codes and moral codes are series of solutions to problems which are neither confronted nor analyzed almost all the bibles commandments are prompted by the obsessive crimes of the time several are solutions to vd that was problem that descended on them that they knew nothing about so they looked for solutions they already had various areas of nosex they had already prevented true ethicality by inventing immorality with bunch of new morals lot of religions also encourage facing motionlessness eg by getting you to turn inward contemplate the stillness within meditate face mecca etc this is the basic operation of the track i believe its perfectly all right to do anything you want to to people as long as you dont say its something else or try to convince people youre doing something else as long as other people are not completely ploughed under by it the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics gives lot of lattitude the main crime is the entering in of notknow thats the only real evil there is when person reaches stage of being an obsessive solution with total notknow on what hes being solution to or when one is to being terribly still he doesnt know what motion hes being still to counteract obsessive stillness enters the bug factor here is the notknow in all this where you have someone solving problems you dont have an evil its ok to solve problems but an individual who has put all problems on automatic cant solve problems except with some fantastic liability of cavein terror stomach etc he doesnt dare solve problem there are gradients of this there are people who can salve minor problem but not major one theyll try to protect you from problem by preventing you from solving problem by feeding you extraneous data this is not to confuse you its to protect you eg the pedant who doesnt want to make mistake and doesnt want you to make mistake either when you see someone sitting in the middle of catastrophe one of two things is happening either the stuff is avalanching in faster than he can cope with it but hes trying to cope or he doesnt even know its catastrophe he doesnt even see all the papers all over the floor and the account book being used far doormat thats the condition of the thetan sitting in his bank he feels hes got it all straight and the trouble is all over there since you cant see the clutter you say well hes behaving oddly but thats not the situation hes confronting noly it is all notised when you run something in an orderly fashion you will at once get something done in the first place youre giving the pc an orderliness to confront and he finds out theres some motion that can be confronted where you have individuals who are totally insane you have confront of problems so routine 1a wont work it doesnt go as far south as the cchs but it works on most people including the guy who thinks hes is such good shape that he doesnt need any auditing if you run problems on him hell go hm ridges where did this come from the bank starts going solid somatics turn on hell see there were some problems around their masses start showing up this is the first time weve had good cure for this type of mass it bypasses the liability of curing it were enough on top of the mechanisms of existence to pull the overtmotivator sequence without falling athwart of its consequences similarly with the problemsolution sequence you can thus solve all the pcs problems without squashing him unlike psychiatry which also tried to solve all of his problemshubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 6 july 1961 franchise routine 1a here is the first refinement of the routines it sometimes happens that certain auditors cannot get results with cchs and it also happens that certain pcs have heavy constant problems that prevent sop goals assessment the problems being hidden standards by which all auditing progress is judged it also happens that problems as subject is the only reason why cases fail to advance as in rudiments therefore problems are probably why some people clear easily and others dont considerations about the stable datum and the confusion also lead toward the auditing of problems as such for problem consists of two opposed stable data and therefore two confusions the definition of problem is two or more postulates in opposition to each other probably all pcs should be run on routine one the change scale was aimed at handling alteris in doing auditing commands auditing problems you will find cures alterisness in case the full rundown on the basic routine 1a was given to the sthil briefing course students on july 3 1961 and the tape of this date should be studied for full data on routine 1a routine 1a can however be used without serious consequences and with great benefit without all its data at least it will get better results than poorly run cchs and will get results anyway try it steps routine 1a only has two steps 1 problems 2 security check hco ww form 3 or hco ww processing forms the original command was recall problem this is the fundamental command somewhat better command since it increases ability and does more than merely asis track and since it moves pc off the 1st dynamic follows what problem could you confront what problem dont you have to confront what problem should another confront what problem wouldnt another confront what problem would be confronted by others what problem wouldnt others confrontnote the third question may be what problem could another confront also whichever checks out on meter sec check this is followed by security check the security check must be an hco ww form sec check and not local version ever sec check is done with full command of the new book emeter essentials now being mailed from hco ww security check is done and so are goals only by instant read and never by latent read if the needle falls or reacts within tenth of second after the question is asked pursue it for this is an instant read if it doesnt fall or react for second or more and then reacts do not pursue it or do anything about it this is latent read only use the emeter if the pc says or disclaims having done it if the pc owns up to question dont refer to the meter dont even look at the meter when asking sec question the first time if the pc then says he hasnt done it look at the needle and without looking at the pc ask again pc still says or its equivalent and you get an instant read pursue it with more questions never pass sec check question that is getting an instant read its hot always pass them if they only give latent read its cold or its something else only use the meter after pc denies it increase sensitivity high asking question again before leaving any question which pc disclaims ratio between problem and sec check run problems and sec checks one for one in terms of time but never on the same morning or same afternoon or same evening never in the same session sec check mornings run problems afternoons or vice versa or on alternate days dont wait for problems to flatten before you sec check problems are long run two different auditors can work on one pc one at one time of the day the other auditor at another time of day the pc may arc break if problems session is cut off to sec check so sec checks are one session problems are another session and spread them apart into different auditing periods value of routine 1a routine 1a should be run on every pc at one time or another when going to or having arrived near clear it is best run first as it speeds the auditing later removing pips and alteris of commands it does not go as far south as the cchs but almost routine 1a is extremely valuable on any case it will give you many wins i believe at this time though i have broad data on it yet that routine 1a will speed up cases that are hanging fire or taking long time to clear therefore use it lrh jlrd copyright 1961 l ron hubbard by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6107c06 shspec26 routine 1a problems the cure for step 6 phenomena or creative processing ill effects is six way confront bracket on the pictures and responsibility on pictures people who go solid on step 6 type processes have an automaticity where if they create anything everything theyve ever created gets created hence since the bank is an individual creation the bank beefs up if you use these remedies and you keep these things in mind it would be safe to do creative processing you can prove this by taking picture improving it then looking at picture b you will find that picture b has also improved if you improve the pcs ability to perceive you improve his ability to create and it is only because the pc is doing it all himself that you can clear him however if you improve the pcs ability to create without improving his ability to confront youve done him in art school does this same with technical schools if you make sure the school has only text diagrams and real objects being studied youll cave the students in everything he doesnt like about the subject will eventually come to the fore because you are running cant have on him its games condition you are fixing it so he cant have what hes being educated in the more theory on the mind you give someone unaccompanied by an ability or opportunity to confront the substance of minds thinkingness and the beingness of life the less reality they will have on it so youd do better to leave them alone in their present confusion all training must be accompanied by confronting particularly in the creative fields the cure for obsessive create is confront if the guy is creating his own aberrations it must be that the road out would be confront that would be the secret of clearing mind is an obsessive unknowing creation into which only few important factors enter create problems confront change responsibility notknow goals prevent the pc from looking at anything hes always looking at tomorrow not looking at what hes looking at theres nothing wrong with having goals but what you are looking for is the obsessive goal of the case theres only one of these and it prevents the pc from looking at any part of that goals chain because the goal is so obsessive that it removes his attention from that chain to something that isnt yet in the chain when you find the terminal that represents that goal youll have found the terminal theyve never looked at or inspected but have been with an obsessive goal the pc isnt in pt hes down the future track at an imagined future point so of course he isnt confronting where he is one of the pcs goals leads to the person who most obsessively had that goal which is the valence the pc is in and of course this is the total noconfront of the bank all bunched up in that spot if you only looked at tomorrow and never observed the immediacy of the situation you would eventually have asised any future of it at all so it hangs in time 100 youve never asised any immediacy of the situation so it is all there on that chain and all the future of it is asised goals processing undoes this mechanism of noconfront you are taking off all the futures if you did goals processing crudely and peculiarly you could get the pc totally regressed so that only some back point of the track has any reality to him and present point does if you arc broke him didnt keep him moving on the track this could happen rightnowness of moments on the track those points are on the goals chain theyre moments where the pc wished to god he were somewhere else but he cant be somewhere else so all hes got left to escape to is future this solid scene hes looking at part of it is actually observed itsa total overwhelm and hes got future there future postulate so it stays on the track as solidity since he cant confront it hell hit these and bounce into the future this could happen quite early in sop goals running the more hes confronted elsewheres than the unwanted incident the more they have asised and the more hes fixed in the incident where he didnt want to be when you run creative processing these points come up easily because hes obsessively creating them all the time problem is the least confrontable thing there is being composed of unconfrontable confusions some pcs will run total irresponsibility on problems of any kind they will perceive connection between having trouble in life and not confronting problems in their lives this is the clue to slow clearing profiles dont change when ptps exist clue to cases is the magnitude of problem the pc comes up with it can drive kids buggy when their parents idea of what problem is is grossly different from theirs you may see someone sitting in the middle of disaster of dramatic or quiet sort who is worrying about the fact that the lady next door has bought new hat thats the level of problem which that person can confront and the things connected with the disaster are not problems in fact theyre not even there someone could say to this lady why dont you straighten all this out and shell think theyre nuts that theres nothing to look at or if there was something there there would be nothing you could do about it you could probably do sanity and ability test by making list of problems by dynamics prepared list in gradients of magnitude you could then have the test taker just check the problems in each dynamic what he checks would tell you where he liveshubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco policy letter of 7 july 1961 issue ii cenocon processing security check hco ww sec form 6

reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 10 july l 961 central orgs franchise metering rudiments the following question from hasi london and my answer are of general interest from academy and hgc london ron from rosalie 67 375l re rudiments data you gave was that falls are all one was concerned with in clearing rudiments i have heard all reactions should be taken into considerationie falls rock slams theta bops sticks mary sue issued bulletin of may 9th 1961saying falls rock slams theta bops change of characteristic should be considered would you please clarify best ros d of t ron from selwyn 67 376l rosalies query goes for too best selwyn d of p ros from ron info selwyn info msh 375l2 regarding the remark that only falls are taken into consideration while doing rudiments this is misleading the word fall is often used mistakenly or colloquially for change of needle pattern because the latter is so clumsy in phrasing any instant change of reaction in needle pattern is indicative of charge and so in any metering whether rudiments assessment sec checking one explores and pursues all reactions of the needle which change the pattern of what the needle was just doing moment before on rudiments change of pattern detectable when and only when the sensitivity knob is set for third of dial drop of the needle one and one half inches on the can squeeze test is explored and cleared the sensitivity knob is not advanced to see if the reaction is entirely handled when the needle reaction vanishes at one third of dial drop sensitivity setting unless this sensitivity setting is also observed in addition to change of needle pattern the auditor will take forever to clean rudiments when it is not necessary rudiments exist to run enough to get the pc into session not to audit the case by rudiments it will be found that when any charge on ptps arc breaks or withholds or room is dissipated by rudiments so that it does not produce fall detectable with the sensitivity set for one third of dial drop or any other change of pattern the pc will be able to go into session as further note when running routine one it is not necessary when doing the problems part of it as main process to handle in rudiments present time problems when doing the security check part of routine one ptps can be handled to some extent also one does not try to get all withholds off in running routine one beyond clearing them for sensitivity knob setting of one third of dial drop as these are being handled by the security checki hope this clarifies your question and related matters best ron lrhimjrd l ron hubbard copyright 1961 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved6107c11 shspec27 problems and solutions just going into session and running do fish swim would give gain if there were ptps arc breaks or whs this is hard to teach auditors though its been known since 1955 that if ptp was present youd get change in profile if an arc break was present youd have depressed graph and if wh is present you dont even have session its weird youre trying to hold the pc still so that you can audit him problem is postulatecounterpostulate resulting in indecision any time you have fixed stable postulate it accumulates or came about because of confusion problem has at least two stable data the two opposed postulates each surrounded by confusion so at mesty level it looks like confusion counterconfusion situation war is one of these twenty years after world war ii traces of it persist as nato the common market etc as for the bank someone set up some idea that he should oppose to some other idea however the idea that he set up to oppose the other idea commits overts against the other idea in that it confuses the other idea then it in turn gets back confusion and the other idea attacks his idea so you wind up with two opposed confusions which then gather more confusion this then goes down the ages as one aspect of the reactive mind problems have duration thus the reactive mind has duration how many ways could you take problem apart as motion as looking at two things as getting confusions of comparable magnitude all without adding new solution solving problems without being stuck with new solution has never been done before psychoanalysis by contrast lays in new solution that produces new confusions then more solutions thus you get branches and schools of psychoanalysis if someone has to have solution he didnt confront and asis the problem solution is always noconfront confronting produces vanishment of the problem if you want something to persist just dont confront it this gets us back to the original mechanism of structure in this universe preventing solution of the problems of the universe to guarantee the persistence of the universe so anybody who solved problems with regard to the universe was persona non grata with anyone who was trying to get total persistence of the universe the problem is that it is impossible to create and at the same time to say that something will persist things created tend to asis so if we want things persisting around us if we cant create weve got to preserve what was created the way to preserve it is to get in this mechanism of noconfront and solutions that we are now trying to undo in the reactive mind this is the idea that anyone who solves problems is dead duck horrible things will happen to anyone who solves problems and everybody agrees 100 and everybody does it to everyone and you get physical universe fact that enters the mental field with reference to the above quote i think hubbard means by solve asis this is where structure and mind take their first divergence if you want shakily persisting universe to persist forevermore youve got to prevent solution asising of its mysteries youve got to prevent it from being confronted so you say anyone who tries to solve this thing is gonna get it this goes over into pcs trying to solve their problems from day to day the terrors of having solutions asisings then bring about all these other mechanisms the universe poses lot of problems why is it here why does time go clicketyclick etc and person who could be tremendous mystery thought he could guarantee to himself tremendous persistence obviously the way to live was to be mysterious and if you confronted nothing youd live on and on so we developed whole genus of thetan who had decided not to solve anything because to solve something is dangerous if you just ask pc to solve something repetitively masses close in on him he dramatizes the cure of the impersistence of universes basically theres nothing wrong with solving asising problems but when youve got tremendous overts against people who were trying to solve problems of course it becomes impossible to solve problems the persistence of the reactive mind is q and aing with thephysical universe so you find that most physical universe principles that affect the mind are in the area of problems gravity being trapped stillness etc the person gets threatened you solve asis problem and well put you in jail so the fellow has problem doesnt solve problem doesnt confront the problem doesnt create space between himself and the problem and of course he gets embedded in sort of black basalt of energy he solves the problem and jails himself he knows if you confront problem you get confused all this is protective mechanism resulting from an upperlevel creative failure the consequences of creating showed up with step six so after the universe was figured out on the basis of if you create one there are terrible consequences therefore its impossible to create another one so your havingness would be shot to pieces if you knocked out the one youve got because you couldnt create another one youve already had earlier on the track tremendous problems on the subject of creation it isnt enough to just create something and say thats it you have to agree its valuable and one can ever create another one like it etc you make something valuable by protecting it and by never being able to replace it these are all mechanisms of value by which people try to get you to lay off mest so everyone is convinced that creation carries penalties and that you have to protect creations against being asised and you get the problem sequence going we have legends against looking medusa pandora etc another threat would be you realize that if you solved the problem of time all time would cease actually if you could solve the problem of time the worst that would happen would be having to put it there for yourself again and mass without time probably wouldnt entrap anybody anyhow if you told the pc face solution repetitively hed get upset in the first place solutions are the easiest things thetan does and the easiest things to create and hed practically get his head knocked off with the confusion surrounding the solutions you didnt have him looking at the confusions only the solutions so the confusions just get more confused not confronting the confusions you have reason why any of the solutions ever occurred if we say look at the confusion they havent much inkling where to look whats communicable is the package of confusion solution which is the problem when he looks at problems he looks at future solutions too so it asises things bit youre not trying to get the fellow to solve or erase problems but to get him over his horror of problems and the piability of solving things youre trying to get him to recover from these things which were set up on the very earliest part of the track person who cant confront problems hasnt much judgment so this is the clue to judgment judgment can only take place in the presence of observation we can observe synthetically when using mathematics or when mocking something up judgment is absent in person who cant confront problem the auditor who cannot confront the problems of the pc wont see them as problems wont handle them and the pc wont make progress so this resolves auditing too the more confrontingness person has the better his judgment an auditor with judgment is valuable auditor so we want to get someone familiar with problems we start with reach and withdraw on the mest he has problems with any number of processes will increase the pcs familiarity with problems people go off onto the collection of solutions for which problems exist eg decorative knot tying or botany then there are people who will have nothing to do with problems but are overwhelmed with problems most of these problems wouldnt seem like real problems to you just facts as he describes them eg tell problem ok the sidewalk as you enter the area of problems with pc youll find him in one of these two conditions if its problem hes never been able to handle 1 pc in an obsessive automaticity of solutions 2 pc totally immersed in the problem as facthell never be in the center line of these are problems until he wakes up to it when you run problems on someone he first starts coming up with solutions then on gradient he starts to relate them to the facts which for him appear to be problems or he goes into the processing announcing facts not solutions so it doesnt seem to you the auditor that you are listening to problems its not that he hasnt told you the whole story the fact hes given you is to him problem it starts peeling back onionlike until you find eventually there was some problem it was involved in usually with an overt in it and he can see it all and it blows the way to get the pc more familiar with problems is to get him to look at them recall problem is one way 6way confront bracket is another the two can be combined with profit you can also use recall ptp this situated him in the time of the problem its headon type of process with alteris of time for 6way confront see hcob 6jul61 routine 1a in view of the fact that the aberration about problems was originated to protect the universe and creations you find the early end of problems run appearing to run forever since it was put there to insure persistence however you will notice that the ta is active this then starts deteriorating and hell pass to either side either facts or solutions or cognitions he can alternate between facts and solutions too6107c14 shspec29 checking ruds and withholds to clear somebody at this time he must be in body just so he can be picked up and audited thetan who has just dropped body has to get another one before we can clear him when columns b c and d consistently register low after processing you know the pc hasnt found the auditor this is due either to an auditor who doesnt impinge or pc who cant tolerate being effect or control case that hangs fire has an automatic notis which can wipe out the needle read hell tell you all sorts of overts on sec check but not consider them bad he doesnt think its real he knows about it but its all notised dont get outraged with the auditor who missed it he didnt really miss it all the time you are checking the pc over you ask about the auditing so as to unearth the moment of notis youll make it safe by putting it on via eg have you ever thought it wouldnt hold up your case if you didnt tell your auditor did you ever have objections to the auditing room and just fail to mention it is there any time in your life when you felt completely beyond help did you ever tell your auditor these are tricky questions but youre counting on the fact that during that fifty hours something did get brought to view that can be reexamined when spotted it requires bit of cleverness to spot it theres sense in trying this technique before hes has any auditing the ground hasnt been plowed yet hes been like this all his life and thinks its normal the meter registers on disagreement and he doesnt have any yet in fact you can use disagreement as broadsweep ruds question when nothing else will register the this is normal is in dianetics the evolution of science as the everyone knows the pc really knows its not normal but the valence hes in considers its ok you could ask what is life really like to find out what normalis to him when we say its below his level of reality we mean he has some specialized compartmented values of existence which really have nothing to do with existence his level of reality has nothing to do with other people this is his reality so it doesnt register when you ask for differences for instance you ask for critical thoughts he says and it doesnt register because its all justified that he natters continually the disagreement is in total agreement with his reality they have everything identified with everything so there is sense in disagreement the complexity of disagreement with everything is such that the disagreement is just the way things should be thus there is read an automatic notis is an automatic disagree you have to be clever to unveil it all the pc has opted out of life because it was too much but he knows he shouldnt have he will perhaps tell you that he has led calm orderly life that nothing much has happened actually he just hopes he has past how do you get him back into the mainstream of life the meanest thing you can do is to ask him have you ever left anyplace he answers then you hit him with why now you are asking for the points of departure from the main highway you are asking what didnt you confront that you feel you should have confronted now the meter gets active it can be summed up in this way did you ever have anybody demand that you put your attention on something have you ever had anybody tell you that youre wrong not to have had your attention on something thats the basic trick this comes up on problems the basic trick of life making people confront is the overt and having to confront is the motivator all deaths and the whole mechanism of death comes from unwillingness to confront so when people leave and feel they shouldnt have left it is because there was something there that was too threatening and it keyed in death so they did q and on death and opted out of life they were running noconfront on people giving people things that couldnt be confronted if you do that you get the idea that you cant confront after you get that idea you can only leave and when you cant even leave any more all you can do is to go nuts when you get the why of leaving you can ask if thats been problem to him at any other time you could get his ptp that way you can ask have you ever thought of blowing session why what youve done here is to walk around cleverly using all the buttons thathe is using to lie there quietly unchanged the buttons of the prehav scale can be used in this line eg prevent which has to do with problems the surprise element is effective in all this so it shouldnt be rote the pc must realize that he is being interrogated by an intelligence control is associated with intelligence the labor management situation stems from suspiciousness of cleverness when people are unclever they are easily overwhelmed by cleverness they can protest it with strike labors basic yap is against the intelligence of management but management is never bright enough to use intelligence as counterweapon intelligence is an altitude factor this applies very strongly in sec checking you wont get anywhere operating as robot similarly with ruds if you know there is something wrong because the pc hasnt responded to the correct processes then there has got to be something wrong with rudiments if you cant get the pc to respond well its not that he is trying to hide from you consciously he is being dead body up in gully covered with leaves and youve got to work around cleverly to communicate with him so he can be gotten back into life the trouble is that he thinks he is just lying there quietly and he isnt he is shooting guns and making all kinds of fuss on the other hand you dont want to get so helpful that he comes to rely on you totally and never looks6107c18 shspec30 cant have create in 1952 the philadelphia doctorate course and scientology 88008 were the basic texts on havingness havingness is dominant thing it is part of games conditions now we are back to games conditions and its relation to havingness in scientology 88008 we had the principle that the goal of processing is to remedy the scarcity and abundance of all things but all that we previously had to do this was creative processing and lot of people couldnt run it now we have come up with new way to do this and thus clear someone fast there is new datum on havingness its relation to create after you create something you may have it or not create doesnt necessarily mean that youll have all of auditing could be considered prehavingness hence the prehav scale the relationship between creating and havingness has to do with the fundamental formation of the reactive bank and is very important what person cant have he creates that is the law on which man operates it is the most fundamental law of the bank that has yet been discovered this is how the bank is formed eg whenever italy gets beaten they have renaissance or like when you abuse plant it blooms lrh wanted ship and couldnt buy one so he started to build one if rosebush cant have rose if you trim it off it creates roses if shipyard cant have ships it builds ships that wear out in twenty years so you cant have the ships either probably the government punishes everyone for producing in order to make them produce on reactive basis theres evidently some crossrelationship that goes further than the ow mechanism it was described in theory in scientology 88008 plus in the discussion of games conditions in the fundamentals of thought games conditions concern preventing people from having things things of all sorts are havingness the thetan is only unhappy when he cant have his idea of quality could be reformed if you deny him anything hell try to obtain it eg the prohibition now lrh knows how to make civilization decide what would be good things to have and create knuckleheaded bureaus to prevent each one of them the trouble with economics is that it tries to create demand with supply it should use scarcity how do you create creation run broad cant have the games condition can get so bad that if you insist on people having something they dont want it police action creates crime bbc creates rock and roll as long as you arent in games condition with the people around you as long as you dont run cant have or must have on them and still have control all will be smooth sailing its supposed to be good thing on this planet to run cant have eg with strictness but this is the way you create problems problems may appear to be dont haves but how did the pc get into the condition of dont have actually dont have is the last ditch of cant have because even with cant have you could materialize what you dont have maybe even build one but the way you got into dont have was the overtmotivator sequence first you run cant have on others then they dont have then you dont have so if the pc doesnt have anything it must be because he denied it if hes got low quality of something he gets it thus he cant have good one but nobody wants bad one so hes got bad one the test of his havingness is that he has it because nobody wants it if nobody wants it he can have it total lack of something doesnt mean that the thetan is without it itll still be obsessively created in his reactive bank the covert creativity of the bank is remedy of havingness thats all it is now say you run cant have on somebody on sex then you find people running cant have on you on the subject of sex and youre puzzled youll find 2d activities are impossible so youre likely to do flip to go off in some different direction and build up various sorts of 2d activities you could have when these also fail you end up with them hidden from yourself but still created in the bank so we get the downgrading quality the degrade is on the basis of what he can have common denominator of pcs at the bottom is the complaint ofnot being able to feel bit higher they complain of not feeling as much as theyd like about things thats cant have on feelings also the feelings degrade and go on down the tone scale serenity is impossible so the thetan becomes enthusiastic but thats an overt so he goes down to conservatism but thats for bank managers so he gets bored but people wont let you be bored so down to feelings but of course all these feelings are being mocked up at the back of the bank at the first st hill acc lrh talked about two routes experience and the auditing route used at that time they are now combined because the experiential factor is havingness experience is havingness so all experience can be restored beingness and doingness can be junior to havingness but cf p 42 at upper level strata beingness is higher than doingness which is higher than havingness so maybe lrh is talking about lower level stratum here but beingness and doingness operate on the same cant have mechanism when you hit bottom on your own beingness youll mock up some very desirable beingness and you will be that except that you are not really being that for instance kid isnt permitted to be pilot and fly airplanes so he mocks up being an ace aviator person may end up settling for lesser and lesser beingness finally he is not being much so he mocks up substitute reactive beingness little kids are not permitted to fly planes so what do they do they become aviators what confuses people is that while cant have produces create at reactive level all this can take place at an analytical level not all cant haves trigger the obsessive create but if you communicate the cant have in an unacceptable cant have way in good games condition the guy may well slip into the reactive create absence of arc is almost requisite for reactive creation by reason of cant have if you run strong cant have on war in the interests of peace war will result keeping the peace is not done by running cant have on war by propaganda etc for instance at the outset of world war ii information was given out about the war it was not considered ok to attack the enemy yet we did get ourselves into it when people run cant have on things that do exist we get delusory state christian science does this try running 8c on christian scientist the insistence of thetan on axiom 1 is fantastic on some people if you try to run think process they cant do it these people must have an ow games condition on thoughts because they cant have thought if someone withholds thought hes running games condition on you on the subject of you cant have it this will put him in condition where he has less of it if you can get off his withholds ie get him to give you the thought youve stopped him from playing that game condition and hell feel better but why does he have these discreditable things anyway because they are scarce if thought is scarce there has been cutdown of thought of activity so the person withholds telling you about actions agains the mores of society because such actions are scarce if you can get hold of one its his jewel scarcity he also holds onto it because he doesnt want you to have bad thoughts about him this is another games condition to handle this you could run cant have process on thoughts theoretically 1 what thought havent you permitted another to have 2 what thought hasnt another permitted you to have you could see another mechanism from another theoretical process you run think of say woman at first he gets generality or nothing then he thinks of specific departed women then dead women sick women funerals too you are making him examine the scarcity of women and it runs backwards to the point where he could think of present woman with perfect ease and get 3d picture of her whatever it is you find him inverted or nonexistent on you develop process by which you can discharge his propensity for using that item in games condition on others and they on him because you are running out stable data on this you add confusion problem or motion along with it for instance you could use when have you denied another woman when has another denied you womanwhat problem about women is not present now the not present now is because it is the notis version of problem confront this is murderous process because it unnotises everything involved games condition is unnatural since in such condition the person becomes convinced that there is only that game so they run the cant have and the more they do this the less they have of it eventually it disappears from view and they have gotten worse not better way back people wouldnt clear because they thought it meant losing their game when cleared they promptly went out and aberrated themselves again to have game they expressed it as i didnt want to be detached from existence what pinned it down was scarcity of games they thought being aberrated was the only game going the remedy of havingness of games is broadening the pcs view on the subject of games all you have to do is knock out his fixed attention on aberrated games so that he can look around at all the other games if you do this the pc will blow clear almost at once6107c20 shspec32 games conditions games condition means an agreement of cant have amongst beings its have for self and cant have for others in true games condition but as an agreement its cant have on all flows its agreement that nails it in concrete widespread cant have agreement gives you lots of mass for instance the christian prohibition on sex which is very fundamental as cant create bodies are necessary as favorite vehicles and identities but theres penalty in the christian system for creating them this results in mustmust not it is in the field of disagreement and can be processed in various ways but how did you get suckered into position like this where you could accumulate motivators like this you must have been party to the cant have somewhere along the line you cant suffer any consequences you had hand in creating and you must have done it by agreement with lot of others with the disagreement youre objecting to the game you helped to create in the first place if you get the disagreement off you get considerable resurgence you could undercut it by getting all the agreements to have the game games condition process seeks to isolate the basic agreements on some kind of game games condition is derogatory term it means package consisting of fixated attention inability to escape coupled with inability to attack to the exclusion of other games theres nothing wrong with having games but game condition is unknown arbitrary reactive performed outside ones choice without his consent or will its sort of mental doingness trap in it youve got to do things assume certain beingness and have communication with anyone not part of the game the world thus becomes massless timeless spaceless and peopleless very rapidly most marriages that go on the rocks are in games condition where theres total agreement that neither one can have anything overlaid with another set of agreements that are in disagreement with that fundamental cant have agreement their tenderest moments are when theyre in disagreement with the basic agreement of cant have this gives us interesting maxims like hell hath fury like woman scorned which reflects the later disagreement when two people get this fixated the rest of the world ceases to exist they just stay with each other and shut out the rest of the world games conditions can exist on any dynamic wars are an example on the third or fourth dynamics one can find portions of the track where one has repeatedly gotten into the same game eg defending the capitol by being part of an interceptor squadron shooting down or being shot down by the enemy right over the middle of the airport this was games condition because it was an unknowing fixated activity it did nothing effective for the society the clue to games condition is that the person is doing compulsive confront that makes it necessary for him to assume compulsive beingness in order to play this game one must deny certain havingness the us has in its last two wars demonstrated itself to be in war games condition because it cannot have the fruits of any of its victories in games condition matter what the person says he always ends up with havingness so you get an obsessive beingness and doingness and cant havingness everybody has few games conditions few have complete games conditions going the latter are in the spin bin when you see one of these games conditions it defies all logic because its obsessive it has nothing to do with the real world this is true of all aberration its out of pt the rationale which rationalizes games condition has holes in it but dont try to argue someone out of it audit him out of it you cant educate someone out of games condition because its aberrated and he cant look at it analytically the situation of person who cant influence his bank with thinkingness is interesting the gradient scale of less effectiveness in this regard ends in effectiveness if you give such person an auditing command he doesnt do it and even if he did do it it would have effect on the bank such person breaks auditors hearts and gives people loses it is of interest to understand the anatomy of this phenomenon which exists to some degree in all cases sinceclearing person means putting him in control of the bank weve been working on the question of how person could get into condition where they could not affect the bank since 1954 the answer is withholds the fellow is backing out of life hes withholding as part of games condition denying something to someone else the withhold gives him cant reach pull back multiply this by lot of instances and you find that eventually the person practically exits from the dynamics but this is really not possible to do so he inverts on them as far as hes concerned his effort is to leave compounded with the withhold and notreach thus you get an ineffectiveness you cant control something you cant reach and from which you are withholding yourself the mustnt reach is really mustnt be reached of course this is true especially when there is punishment involved punishment compounds withholds so as we go downscale on reach we get 1 ineffectiveness 2 destructiveness the pc cant communicate with something well enough to understand it so when he does reach he can only be destructive 3 inability even to destroy something 4 inability to have any influence at all of any kind 5 inability even to affect his own mind add up all these withholds and cant haves on all dynamics and you get someone whos totally withdrawn individuated totally ineffective on his own bank when he runs cant have on people he makes them less familiar and more withdrawn from things then by the overt motivator sequence this reacts on him so he stops reaching and starts withholding at 100 withhold or 100 withdraw he cant influence anything including his thoughts and bank if he reads on the meter you know something is effecting his bank dont be amazed if the pc has never noticed really the condition hes in he cant think or rationalize on the subject he will buy wrong whys on it readily so if you run command that you havent tested for read you are doing something adventurous since if it didnt read youre in an area where hes still totally ineffective or totally effective pc can be compulsively exterior the detached case freud could never help this kind of case thats someone who is backed out of the dynamics and backed out of his head people will tell you they feel detached that indicates games condition in the area where they feel detached most homosexuals are detached in this sense in any area person is in games condition about he is detached how do you reverse the games condition find something that reads on the emeter and is therefore something he can effect ie something real to the pc real means can the pc be effective in that sphere get the pcs withholds and cant have off the subject on gradient scale you take off the games condition and the pc can now reach in the area and regain effectiveness its basically idiotically simple but if you violate that doingness you dont get results in auditing say you want to cure psychosomatics with auditing you can find people who are so much the effect of their psychosomatics you can have more effect on them than the they can you can make them well but they dont know it so they never thank you for getting well what you should do to avoid this situation is to assess all the persons difficulties get the best read get off all the persons withholds on the area get the games conditions in the area cured and the difficulty will right itself you can eradicate illness and upsets but you have to assess them first the fact that the pc complains about something all the time doesnt prove anything it could be circuit or mechanism or it could be part of some other games condition there is gradient scale of difficulties the pcmay have lots of them but may be effective only in one area thats where you must start thats been the barriered line on healing and help if you run command that doesnt read the pc is ineffective in the area therefore its auditor vs the pcs bank with help from the pc hell be arc breaky hard to audit because youre just auditing bank and the pc isnt there this violates the basic auditing principle auditor plus pc is greater than the bank6108c03 shspec33 creation and goals the earliest unanswered question in dianetics and scientology is why does thetan mock up bad pictures its remained unanswered all these years you almost never find anyone with fixed pleasure moment old validation processing was productive of more grief charges etc validation processing validation effort processing this consists of discovering moments when the preclear is successfully approaching goals when he is successfully exerting an effort when his selfdetermined effort is winning 5110cm01 octser october series selfdeterminism effort processing plus validation straightwire the theory of which was to validate all the good moments of the preclears past by having him recall them ability major 5 ability straightwire page 7 what is this fixation on death disaster and invalidation one theoretical possibility is that hes getting even hes been made to produce so he mocks up bad production mechanically of course its something he hasnt asised because its unpleasant etc but why did he agree to those mechanics in the first place he makes an original agreement then revolts against it maybe hes been made to produce lots of good things so he revolts with this mechanism so when hes called upon to mock up something good he mocks up something bad this may happen on 11 level this can be seen running pleasure moments when the pc slips into the badness of it all assuming that the fellow is in revolt this can be very overt hitoned or covert eg not producing but having excuses for failure or forgetting to do it at all the latter is lower harmonic of direct refusal occlusion is this level of revolt and we let people get away with it for instance hitlers around somewhere and we allow him to get away with having forgotten who hes been i cant is covert i wont the mechanism is so lost it has become way of life not revolt any more the guy just mocks up bad pictures and forgets some civilizations on the track were really productioncrazy eg arslycus where the thetans were actively producing mocking up matter you couldnt get away there were entrapment mechanisms production got bad name because it was production against power of choice over production the bank dramatizes this creation against the wish to create the fellow doesnt want to mock up the bank so he mocks up the bank his will to create has been badly overwhelmed partly because he overwhelmed others will to create arslycus eventually fell apart some worker invented disintegration so that it could happen this was the only possible response to out create with new idea something worse than what was happening to them creation gets bad name from enforced creation theres another side to it lrh has been unhappiest when hes produced so much that he gluts the market others decide theyve been outcreated and they get unhappy too thats not so upsetting whats so upsetting is not having any market for your creation observers audience etc and not having it wanted one does want ones creations to be admired if you are made to produce when you dont want to or if you think there will be appreciation of your production you will generally produce an overt product one can also think that good creation in some field will bring one into state of victimization or some unpleasant consequence in this case one retreats saying i cant or i dont have any talent or i havent been educated in 1948 the answer to why does thetan create bank was that he creates something with resonance between his own tone and what he creates in the bank this is not the whole story though an individual mocks up or doesnt in an effort to prevent his will from being overthrown on the subject of creation he gets mechanisms to inhibit creativeness in order to protect his selfdeterminism these mechanisms are what we run into in processing this is why creative processing works but it is also why some pcs eventually dreamed up that the bank gets solid the mechanism was already there methods of denying creation are the most fundamental thing youre dealing with in processing we have to figure out what the guys afraid of and disarm it on that angle so what is heafraid of hes afraid of being made to do you can substitute do for create to avoid some mine fields he considers there are bad consequences to doing he considers that you have to hit thetan to get him to create this is an oldold consideration it explains things like the high birth rate amongst the lower classes it also explains waiting until the last moment to write paper and the artistic temperament and why artists seek out sps if someone hits you youll make picture of it this explains to everyone that hes victim he has been made to create and he is following the law that the best way to keep from being hurt is to create this keeps you from being beaten the most involved point in an engram is where the fellow thinks he has mocked up the engram in full which should keep him from further injury then gets hit again by something else so he mocks that up too and then theres more injury or something which defeats him his best answer to blow was to create that used to get him off the hook then he suffers defeat and an invalidation of the mechanism of creation as defense then comes total notis of engrams which is another defeat and the disappearance of earlier engrams people with invisible fields have gotten to chronic state of believing it wont do any good to create this all sums up to the thetans responses to the accumulation of all the times his choice was overwhelmed someones choice is overwhelmed so he responds in some way in downscale attempt to make his postulates stick which he never gives up trying to do the basic assumption of thetan and the first thing he wants to do is the communication formula axiom 10 its the most fundamental game in the interrelationship of thetans anyway from there on he just wants to make his postulates stick when he fails to create an effect he will still try to create an effect by mocking stuff up routine 3 goals processing is effective because you are looking over all the powers of choice he has hoped to effect most of which have failed and running out his failed powers of choice running goals is sneaky way of getting at what postulates he would like to make stick by asking what conditions he was trying to bring about the bank is the mechanisms of all sorts that tend to defend his assertions of self though the effect of these mechanisms is to make mess of the pc the disintegration of his postulates is whats wrong with him his reaction to this is surprisingly extreme but the bank is still trying to have the effect the basic of the chain is an overt which is why overts work so well in processing someone who is obsessively protecting anything has overts on it he is still trying to make his basic postulate of effect on stick however why does he make the original overt postulate he has gotten into games condition on creation thats why he has been creating against someone else gets lose on making nothing of the opponents creation so he overts against it early on the track thetans specialized in goofy games and got into forgetting what they were doing so there seems to be something wrong in the field of postulates theoretically you could run pc on what effect could you actually create this doesnt work because it is too direct it goes straight through the mine field to the pc it seems unreal he cant do it modifying it to what decision would it be all right for you to make would be more workable thetan must have feeling that there are motions and confusions he cannot tolerate so he avoids them with mechanisms of creation if persons tolerance for motion and randomity is raised his fears of consequences of the overthrow of his power of choice are reduced most fundamentally obtaining tolerance for motion and catastrophe would wash away the fear of fear the creation of confusion is the last echelon of postulate the last echelon of confusion is the creation of confusion by omission so were on safe ground with pcs if we stress creation of confusions especially by omissions so you could use the process if you said nothing what confusion would occur or what notdoingness would create confusion cases that dont move are the roughest ones in catatonia we have the last desperate effort of thetan to make postulate stick somewhere its notdoingness theres probably such thing as thetan whod not trying to do something all thetans are busy if only trying to do things through omission thus in asking for goals we should ask for failed goals secret goals withheld goals etc since that leads straight to old postulatesa pc can be so confused on the blowcreate theory that just being talked to by the auditor can cause him to create something or below that hell mock up nothing while in session and get lots of ideas about it out of session ron handled this with short sessioning the pc would hand up his case right after session then lrh would begin new session and handle it at this level the pc is on total reverse he creates when hes not supposed to and doesnt create when hes supposed to occlusion is the last answer the last attempt to create an effect an overt of omission here you could use some far south process as what confusion wouldnt occur if you forgot this might get through to him if hes on failed forget so the dwindling spiral of creation or postulates is 1 postulate 2 failed postulate 3 creation 4 failed creation 5 creation of confusion 6 creation of confusion by omission 7 notised creation of confusion by omission tolerance of confusions problems motion etc is fine but failed postulates is what you are trying to get with goals processing you can also get this effect if you ask pc what he hopes would happen if he kept on doing what he was doing if he cant answer you can undercut it with what wont happen what shows up here will be caution which seems laudatory but hell begin to realize something will happen too as you get the notis off you could run off intentional overts with what would or wouldnt be damaged if you forgot it they are both aimed at getting the effect hes trying to produce or you could use what damage would forgettingness cause youre running ow crossed with forgettingness etc this is all at high level of theory its road parallel to the one through the minefield even if you cant get the exact road6108c04 shspec34 methodology of auditing notdoingness and occlusion its impossible to have judgment in auditing if ones trs are out and one is worried about making mistakes in application of the tech on running brackets problem may be that the outer legs of the bracket may not be real to him at first reality on these legs may develop as he runs the process this happens because of the dynamics as he is audited the pc gains reality on the other dynamics besides the first dynamic the pcs ability to reach is directly reflected in his ability to conceive of someone else having an idea or action so as you run the process the command you started with can be too narrow and limiting as the pcs ideas reach further and the commands could need to be enlarged more legs could be added each leg of the command stands as an individuated unit without interchange among legs each in fact could be run as an individual command in view of the fact that it doesnt harm anybody to run an unreality as long as they are moving towards reality it would be ok to run all legs of the bracket from the outset try to choose bracket and command wordings all of which fall remember that if you choose command that restricts the pc you limit his gains also the pc will tend to look at the legs not being run as his reality comes up he will have to withhold himself from those areas tending to put them on automatic an auditing command can be broadened it shouldnt be made more particular and specific if in doubt take the broadest form and run it from the outset running one which is too restricted can turn on somatics its legitimate to change the targets flows etc but not the basic form dont change how to when or could to would you can drop portions of the command too as long as in so doing you are removing particularization when the pc gets very free on flows you can drop out the legs and go to the simplicity of eg get the idea of verb an aberration is located as total imprisonment total individuation auditing commands resolve the degree of imprisonment and individuation as the degree lessens you may lose ta on one leg of the process but now have it elsewhere the ta ceases to move when the targets of the process are flat so the rule is before leaving the command check it out for all variations which might produce new action remember that the reactive mind is an idiot so you could miss something because of wrong pronoun or whatever the biggest barrier in dissemination is notdoingness and misdoingness there is an old unresolved philosophic question about the value of notdoingness to do or not to do which is better the active or the passive life if you do you get into trouble if you dont do you get into trouble theres confusion on either side for instance lrh had problem as writer whether to be super nasty if he was criticized or to be nice and let himself be criticized thus protecting his markets and friends there are contradictory lessons in this of course neither answer is right the missing datum is that they are both overts longest continuous overt is notdoingness have you ever noticed the randomity that can be produced by missing datum in problem false datum can cause some confusion but look at what missing datum on the subject of the mind has done how about missing beingness this is nearultimate in notdoingness the ultimate of course is forgetting youre not only doing nothing youre not there to do it and youve forgotten this really produces confusion thetan never ceases to try to have an effect on something to put axiom 10 in effect matter how many trillenia have gone by you are trying to process someone who is in the middle of 10000 continuous overts of omission doing something is apparently the least damaging type of overt thus withhold seems to be the more therapeutic side of ow its his notdoingness which weighs on his case doingness and notdoingness are not data of comparable magnitude notdo is enormously greater thats why people who stop doing even if what they have been doing is nasty crashwhen they stop thats also why men die before women underneath it all thetan knows hes important to life and knows its an overt not to participate the only greater overt is to forget this is still an attempt to create an effect so theres gradient scale of effect creation 1 you do something to have an effect axiom 10 2 you create an effect by not doing something 3 you create an effect by being absent 4 you create an effect by forgetting what degree of randomity could you produce by forgetting whole lifetime quite bit and its an overt and the fellow realizes its an overt thats the reason for whole track occlusion the overt of forgetting the law behind all this is that the thetan never ceases to have an effect on those targets he has chosen and the only thing that could ever pry him loose from those fixated effects is something like scientology he is imprisoned to the degree that he is still trying to have hopeless effect on something he is his own jailer forgetting it prevents it from ever being asised if ow can stall case how much more can it be stalled by not being there the withhold of self how much can it be stalled by withhold from self and being there and from doingness and from the subject and from any knowledge of the subject and from any communication with any beingness of the subject etc thats why the more occluded case is the harder it is to audit so you run cases on what wouldnt you mind forgetting this gets off withholds or as general pattern for command what confusion wouldcould forgettingness create weve looked on forgettingness as sort of passive thing weve looked on notdoingness as the natural state of beingness seeing them as overts opens up new zones for processing6108c08 shspec35 forgettingness the reactive mind is basically that area of occlusion which the pc is unable to contact and which contains total identification of all things with all things and until released into the realm of havingness continues to react upon the person compelling him into actions dramatizations and computations which are not optimum to survival we find in the reactive mind all the residual not asised material which the individual is seeking to avoid all the discreditable things of his existence are then contained in this area he hangs onto them the knucklehead he has various mechanisms of survival connected with this one being the justification of the aberrations he has psychology makes the error of saying that one is only able to create by virtue of ones reactive mind faculty psychology c the 1500s was an attempt to understand perception and the mind they didnt get anywhere because they dealt with the analytical sphere and got confused by the fact that men dont always react rationally behaviorism overlooks the unpredictabilities of men when they dont follow the stimulusresponse mechanisms until scientology theory about man was too precious not to be carefully guarded from attack men went to the stake to protect the theory of faculty psychology they threw away case histories to protect the theory of behaviorism the abundance or scarcity of all things applies theories were terribly scarce in scientology we are looking at an abundance of theories what we care about is what works former theorists didnt care whether their theories were workable or not they just felt they should protect the theory the cure of reactive bank is knowingness because the substance of the bank is not knowingness theres fourth postulate remember the third was forget it is senior its been stressed that one should run that rather than remember in order of making the four postulates are 0 native state potentiality of knowing everything 1 first postulate not know 2 second postulate he had to know something 3 third postulate he forgot what he knew 4 fourth postulate remember thetan does this on any given subject when you enter school you start by postulating you know nothing about the subject thats really request to find something you dont know in other schools youre asked to notknow and then learn lot of nonsense the only thing that ever blows up false theory is the workability of countertheory we know more about the unpredictable side of man than any other body of people on earth so any breakthrough we make in the area is valuable the breakthrough is in the area of forgettingness and confusion man wants things to be forgotten he not only uses forgettingness as continuous overt act he wants forgettingness to occur he wants all his evil deeds to be wrapped in the stygian darkness of yesteryear man is basically good so it his deeds are considered bad then theres only one cure for them that he knows to forget them so as an auditor you can ask what should be forgotten hell recover almost at once screaming impulse to make something forgotten and that is where his volition and the reactive mind cross his volition desires occlusion back of all his confusion is knowable volition he wishes forgettingness to occur and that wish creates reactive bank that is the postulate that comes ahead of everything he must forget so it can be reached with what should be forgotten theres danger that this will become forgotten point of scientologythe postulate it must be forgotten must be the most forgotten of all postulates so it must be the one least able to be asised and thus best suited to accumulate the concatenation of bank the hidden standard is cousin to this you can handle the hidden standard by asking what is hidden about it or what should be forgotten about it and it blows the pcs attention frees up and he knows processing works for him you can ask what would have to happen for you to know scientology works strip all the motion out of the needle and youll have list of hidden standards more details on running of this any psychosomatic or livingness difficulty person has is difficulty because theres something about it he doesnt want known and he wants others to forget it compulsive rememberingness brings about forgettingness one pulls it in with the must have on remembering which postulates the likelihood of forgetting and vice versa someone who goes off to the south seas so as to forget first tries to forget with women then with liquor dope then death but all his urgency to forget keeps it there he pushes one button and gets the other this develops an awful confusion which is then buried with death and occluded forming the stimulus response mechanism of the reactive mind because his power of choice and his postulates are being overwhelmed even if its him whos overwhelming them restoration of memory on the whole track is the index by which you can measure case gain most easily if someone doesnt think hes lived before hes heavily plowed into forgettingness while the guy who has only delusory recall on track is doing pretended knowingness of the whole track this is games condition of magnitude its denying knowingness by giving false knowingness its forgetting and remembering at the same time very confusing and irritating to confront the irritation comes from ones awareness of the games condition putting you into the position of being an unwilling opponent if it goes on long enough your own occlusion is assisted the target is to occlude your track by giving false knowingness about theirs confusion asks itself to be forgotten because it was never remembered that is it is not known thats what makes confusion confusion6108c11 shspec38 basics of auditing matter of factness lot of auditors are doing something besides auditing they are pressing through introducing something in an effort of make auditing work probably its because of lrh saying that the auditor has to make the auditing work that he should be on the ball etc certain apathy about results creates in itself grind atmosphere desperation or apathy alike are counter productive lrh audits with doubt about what hes doing withdraw question about purpose his auditing is very matteroffact because he has doubt that he can help the pc doubt about the effectiveness of the process hes going to run doubt about the fact that the process is working so he has relaxedness about auditing that gives him results five times as fast because he doesnt get in his own road the reason an auditor doesnt flatten process is anxiety to get the job done which gets in the way of getting the job done lrh doesnt artificialize the way he feels about the pc he keeps it real unlike other auditors whom he heard being stilted and artificial be effective help the pc dont be hidebound this should give faster results more easily notknow and forget would have run out engrams in 1950 if they had been used then this would have avoided lot of grinding and sweat youd use command form which includes as many dynamics as necessary eg what should remain unknown about this to the public the government family your superiors etc the occlusions that auditors were struggling with were the result of selfmotivated efforts to withhold the hangups in any engrams are from desire to make these things parts of the engram unknown or forgotten the pretense of knowing about it dubin also blows on the notknow processing running engrams should not be discounted as of benefit to the case if you get someone clear and stable they may still find themselves with an engram there it wont take long to run it since hes clear during stabilization theyre unsnarling track they are still bumping into things which can be run using notknow on it makes it run even faster since it pops the sticky point into view application of notknow to goals processing6108c17 shspec41 rudiments and valences an emeter ceases to register in the presence of an outrudiment this may fool you into thinking process is flat if you get the rudiments in the process will again move the ta and needle keeping rudiments in is the most important part of auditing you can find the rudiment because only the out rud will move the meter details on goals running valence is synthetic beingness or beingness which pc is not but thinks he is it can be duplicate of any existing beingness or synthetic beingness created by what others have said about the other beingness there is such thing really as ones own valence his own valence is just himself hes either himself or in valence valence is package graph is picture of valence and any change you got was because you shifted his valence this is very important datum the pc will not gain in any way through any effort to alter the characteristics of valence hes in the pc will only change if you change the valence as whole package because the pc takes responsibility for any of the nowimsupposedtos or the package of characteristics which is the valence all the person can reach is knowingness of the identity of the valence what does the pc use the valence for survival the road out surmounted by knowingness valence is solid knowingness body is solid knowingness valence is an effort to get someone to know you are there to get someone to recognize something therefore they are road out of unwanted areas say soldier gets hit with mortar shell he doesnt want to be there hes in the wrong valence that knowingness valence is now invalidated and becomes notknowingness so he exteriorizes and decides that the only way to fight war is to be general or war correspondent if he cant be that hell keep on trying war after war life after life finally he gets it together and becomes very successful at it then he finds all war correspondents being shot for fomenting war as he is shot he decides hell be mata hari he gets female body moves on up the line becomes mata hari in war after war then eventually he gets executed for that etc these are all efforts to solve the problem of what to do in war every valence picked up is an effort to solve problem valences are antiquated solutions so you can say these identities are antiquated solutions to confusions the goals which go towards beingness are the more definite goals they are the more profitable ones in auditing because they go toward identity person is not himself he is in different knowingness as soon as hes in valence you can fix up valences broken leg as long as its valence that isnt supposed to have broken leg which is why you can do assists on almost anyone the only person it will fail on is someone who has nowimsupposed to of valence the pc has control over this any pc is being dominatedly in given valence but may be tortured or upset by other valences which are only really the concern of the valence he is mainly in so any pcs troubles are only the troubles of the valence hes in the troubles are part of the nowimsupposedtos of this valence so theres way to remedy the difficulties on the valence because they are outside the power of the pc to touch here you get the oddity of please audit but youd better not make well thats what it looks like the valence may have somatics turning on and off as part of the package which keep the valence from becoming something else the pc will keep the somatics to prevent himself from becoming an unworkable solution to future problem dont try to take that solution away from the pc so long as it seems vital that it be solution what youve got to do is to get the pc to face up to the various factors that make that valence you cant make valence well you can move valence so any process run at random on pc has very small chance of success this preselects our bag of tricks to small bag you must ask yourself is this process going to change familiarize accustom the person to identity or is it going to handle environments which make identities vital or is it going to alter valences if so it will work and stay working if not it wontwhat makes valence stick the way it sticks lets newly define psychotic as someone who doesnt know whats going on in his environment and who doesnt know what is going on inside himself its all unknown and unobserved neurosis is when hes got some idea of whats happening in his environment and where he is but this is overbalanced by unknowingness upscale from that you know whats happening where you are but not whats happening inside someone else few feet away you dont always know whats going on with everybody that makes slight unknowingness the stuck parts of your track are the points where you knew what was going on where you were but not what was going on around you because there are points of disagreement there was know facing an unknow the unknow can get so overwhelming that one adopts valence to solve it you pick up valence which knows about these things many scientists are solely being valences of scientists theyve got it confused with the whole track beingness of technician when you see the level of pretense of valence it becomes spotted for you it seems artificial anyone whos identified himself by some set of tricks has thereby put himself in valence the fact that hes in body is an obvious valence but its the valence that hes using the body to be thats the auditing target just having body isnt necessarily valence if hes aware of having body not ploughed in below his level of consciousness as an auditing target valence is the mip package person has composed to solve the problems of existence which he knows nothing about its always easier to pick up weaker valence than stronger one so your logical target in auditing is the weaker one if your pc has bunch of chronic somatics theyre part of the valence picture not part of the pc hes got to have two counteropposed identities in order to feel pain 1957 was when this was worked out to have experience hed have to survive to survive he has to be something other than himself otherwise he cant survive experience and live you havent chance in handling this person until he realizes that he can live without the valence hes been in games condition as valence against some environment which probably longer exists women are particularly confused here because at the present time the society is in flux and has really clear idea of where women fit in so women have more problems finding the valence to solve the problem of situations theyre not really in anyway identity crisis to straighten out case youve got to move valence say fellow has toothache youve got to find out who had toothache c 1950 tech and split the valences this is more effective than putting him in comm with the tooth since its not his tooth whatever his difficulties find out who had it or would do it cf xdn wants handled rundown you could say what beingness would be good solution for tough environment you process whos valences if you want to cure toothache run it back and forth with who would want to cure toothache who would have toothache and get terminal to cure the toothache you already have the goal of course you can also use this technique for the hidden standard for long time we had the question should we handle solids or significances the answer is solids but the further answer is that you shouldnt handle conditions of valence handle the valence this is the limitation of touch assist always handle the terminal this brings prehav 13 into the limelight prehav 13 process which takes list of charged terminals and combines overt running with prehav assessment and running of brackets on levels assessed out see 6106c21 shspec17 or p 42 these notes prehav 13 will also fix up rudiments6108c18 shspec42 control of attention you might think of auditing as having hundreds of rules as long as you think of it that way you arent auditing these rules are only guideposts back of them your good heart will carry the day you are trying to help the person out all right there are certain things his mind will and wont do if that is what your rules are youre fine rituals as developed by religions represent their failure to communicate the basic truths here is what pc will not do he will not go into session with his attention fixated on something else nor will you have his interest in what you are doing all the rudiments can be covered with is your attention fixated on something is there any reason you wont talk to since these questions are little too broad you have the rudiments he can have fixation on ptp of short duration where his attention is fixed on the immediate environment in the ptp ld the pc also has his attention fixed on something in pt but he also has something subjective holding his attention something very real to him when you dont parallel what the mind is doing with auditing you fail in auditing the rate of change of attention defines relative pain and the common features of every stuck point on the track is sudden shift of attention this has been known since 1950 at least the processes being used are sufficiently strong that matter what the pcs attention is fixed on you can yank it away but doing so will result in an arc break furthermore his attention wont totally come off what it was on so you will create new identification of what he was looking at and what you pull his attention to you can of course go too far in paralleling the mind and wind up in q and lrh has never seen case progress when the pcs attention on ptps of short or long duration isnt handled if you dont handle attention fixation you eventually get an unexpected attention shift that produces an arc break it isnt the minor flub you make that really causes the arc break though it triggers it the arc break is really caused by yanking the pcs attention off his ptp and you wont find it by running ow on the auditor willing to talk to the auditor is the other requirement for the pc to be in session if the pc has an arc break or withhold his willingness is out with withhold theres another factor the pc is sitting with known where he is and an unknown where the auditor is so the auditing session is ridge in view of the fact that the pcs attention is fixed on the withhold even if only at subawareness level if you audit over it youre guilty of an attention shift the attention fix in withhold is complicated by being an outward fix with an inward pull to keep it from getting out these mechanisms take priority over all of the pcs considerations and postulates so matter what he says you cant go ahead and audit over it i order to audit him youve got to be able to put his attention where you want it if theres distracting noise outside its waste of time to ask if it bothered him you can assume it shifted his attention so ask what were you thinking of when the noise occurred until theres read and the pc feels ok about it anything that happens in the auditing session is the auditors fault if anything goes wrong in session its never the pcs fault if the auditor doesnt tell him how to get his attention off something by some acceptable gradient its not the pcs fault if he cant put it where you want it because you didnt put his attention on the things its on when he comes into session youre slow to take responsibility for taking it off but if the pc doesnt make gains its the auditors fault just as the pc must be gotten to the point where he is at cause over his life because you can get him to erase all the aberrated points in an auditing session there is another cause the auditor this is in violation of the idea that the pc is cause of all effects so youve got to be slippy because you are being cause over section of the pcs track the only way it can happen is for him to have some willingness to do what you want him to do so his cause must still bethere and your direction of his cause must be acceptable to him otherwise he wont be cause over that section of track called an auditing session and if he isnt cause over it hell make gain so to keep him at cause you audit him with all his attention on the auditing not splintered elsewhere he must willingly follow your direction and have clear view of what hes doing you assume incorrectly that the pc is delicate but in fact the only thing you can really do to pc thats bad is not to give him win which can only be done by violating his attention factors auditing in the absence of the pcs attention is noauditing how do you keep his attention keep the ruds in the earliest method of clearing was highly permissive and very delicate it amounts to this repetitive question what picture would it be safe to look at the reason it was longer being done by 1950 was this attention factor it hadnt been isolated so it couldnt be articulated also everybody kept dictating what picture the pc should look at but you could clear someone with that process and it would not be long route you can speed it up by getting him to use other perceptics eg what sound would it be safe for you to hear etc people who dont get any pictures are just stuck in pt to avoid looking at the disaster just earlier but you can work him around until he can confront the bank this approach didnt run into the attention problem because its so permissive it lets the pc put his attention where it already is it does take gentle smooth auditing and it takes quite awhile the engram necessary to resolve the case is actually just the picture the pc is stuck in so you are essentially running what picture would it be safe to look at now it goes faster you handle his attention gently unstick it from ptps and arc breaks give him wins and confidence dont get into games conditions with him on goals or terminals if the session goes awry its because you missed an attention factor try to get subjective reality on this if the pc says yow yow yow arc break you say what was your ptp6108c22 shspec43 ptps unknownnesses details on goals running normally pc is arc breaky because he is being audited over undetected ptps which he will notis in order to get auditing the auditor should suspect it for instance when auditing an executive it is problems alone which give you this terrific timelessness they show up as sticky meter an unchanging graph slow reaction time not moving around much in life problems stick and float forward in time and the guy is stuck in past moment another useful definition of problem is unknown problem is an accumulation of not knowingnesses and consideration of the person as to the value of the notknownnesses remember that the thetan is stuck to his bank valences etc by mystery mystery is the glue of life if you want freedom you must restore knowledge if you want slavery establish ignorance create notknows so common denominator of all problems is an unknown problem cannot exist in the absence of unknowingness as the dianetic axiom puts it randomity can be caused by missing datum axiom 105 an unknown datum can produce data of plus or minus randomity axiom 107 data of plus or minus randomity depends for its confusion on former plus or minus randomity or absent data mans difficulties were getting more and more involved because of the missing data technology about man based on the fundamental missing datum what is mans nature or what is man trying to do when the pc runs describe the problem he may well be giving lots of aspects of the basic unknown problem if you run unknownness on the subject of problems you cut through to this central problem rapidly thetan is mystery sandwich two way comm is an inquiry of the pc as to what is going on and an invitation for him to look at it it should be limited to such questions as how are you doing whats worrying you what is that all about processes arent two way comm process is involved in two way comm except 2wc if you start process be sure you flatten it this datum has never varied it applies to running unknownness of problems its ok to handle ptp by asking what unknown is connected with it this runs ptps fast use any version of the odd numbered postulates notknow forget doubted pretended dont use 2wc to handle problems you dont have to be repetitive get all versions of notknow off of it more details on running of ptps routine 1a consists of everything you can think of in terms of problems processes it gives total ability to confront problems without being upset by the unknownness of them man doesnt like having to confront the unknowns of life its hard to do because there is nothing there to confront were back to processing loss when you process unknowns since loss is notknow so someone with lots of problems experiences sense of loss what is so maddening about loss is that you dont know what is happening with the thing lost the pc will misassign causes of loss too because some terminal is gone and there is lots of unknownness on it the guy will go to the bottom of the prehav scale and pretend some knowingness and pretend cause the two are closely associated it makes someone who is real inventor feel strange when he gets down to the inventors club and the others know all about it and invented it two years earlier someone in that state cant duplicate if they were asked what did you invent theyd answer with some irrelevance so thats good rebuttal pretended knowingness and pretended cause are blood brothers and continually come up together this is at the bottom of the notknow scale because it is substitute know the way you handle it is not direct you go at it by way of problems the guy has had so many problems he has begun to substitute false solutions those are the pretended knowingnesses you see on the case so you dont process the pretended knowingnesses you process the problems and the pc will fly you enter at the level of reality of what problem is and the false solutions and pretended cause fade out flattening routine 1a means getting the guycomfortable confronting unknowns then he wont be obsessively escaping from them and longer experiencing lot of anxiety about them cf alan watts the wisdom of insecurity jealousy is basically an inability to confront the unknown the sickness one experiences with it is not because of betrayal it is just another aspect of the unknown of faithfulunfaithful or something they know that i dont etc why does case suddenly dive into the middle of the bank and refuse to come out the guy is unable to not ask why theres an unknown in the incident the guy gets some glimmer of the unknown and he dives into it he cannot confront an unknown and becomes hectic at the idea that an unknown exists the oddity is that all knowingnesses are invented knowingnesses with sn inability to confront the unknown you eventually get an inability to confront the known then this goes down to an inability to confront at all so any little tiny incident of the day becomes problem he dwells on so dont judge by the apparent size of the problem whether he will be stuck on it if he cant confront the unknown at all he will be totally glued into all his unknowns all along the track you could run what unknown about an auditing session could you confront would you rather not confront you will solve anybodys difficulties with auditing you could run it on an old timer who doesnt much like auditing anymore or on someone who is having trouble learning to audit etc one old timer would get every pcs somatic because its mystery he instantly snaps terminals with these unknowns this process would blow him out it is very workable specific process it could be used for anyone who has left off doing some formerly successful activity or someone who is having trouble learning something eg language what is unknown about german would handle problems with the german language the treatment of condition is an attempt to alter valence without addressing the valence and this just doesnt work so some process addressed directly at the condition unless it aimed at solids like engrams wont do it address the valence find whose condition it is handle the terminal cf again xdn wants handled rundown long lists of goals wont be that useful but long lists of valences could be out of this you could get process for ptps of long duration ww would have condition what isnt known about that person what might you have done to him what might you have withheld from him you would strip off valences and get off problems and ow at the same time if you run lots of notknow youve got to remedy havingness because the whole bank is coming ungluedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 24 may 1962 franchise q and great deal has been said about q and aing but few auditors know exactly what it is and all auditors have done it without exception up to now i have just completed some work that analyses this and some drills which educate an auditor out of it with better understanding of it we can eradicate it q and means asking question about pcs answer session in which the auditor qs and as is session full of arc breaks session without q and is smooth session it is vital for all auditors to understand and use this material the gain for the pc is reduced enormously by q and and clearing is not just stopped it is prevented the term q and means that the exact answer to question is the question factual principle however it came to mean that the auditor did what the pc did an auditor who is q and aing is giving session control over to the pc the pc does something so the auditor also does something in agreement with the pc the auditor following only the pcs lead is giving auditing and the pc is left on self audit as nearly all auditors do this auditing is the rule of the day therefore i studied and observed and finally developed precision analysis of it for lack of which auditors although they understood q and nevertheless qd and ad the qs and as there are 3 qs and as they are 1 double questioning 2 changing because the pc changes 3 following the pcs instructions the double question this occurs on rudiment type questions and is wrong this is the chief auditor fault and must be cured the auditor asks question the pc answers the auditor asks question about the answerthis is not just wrong it is the primary source of arc breaks and out rudiments it is quite discovery to get this revealed so simply to an auditor as i know that if it is understood auditors will do it right the commonest example occurs in social concourse we ask joe how are you joe says ive been ill we say what with this may go in society but not in an auditing session to follow this pattern is fatal and can wipe out all gains here is wrong example auditor how are you pc awful auditor whats wrong in auditing you just must never never never do this all auditors have been doing it and its awful in its effect on the pc here is right example auditor how are you pc awful auditor thank you honest as strange as this may seem and as much of strain on your social machinery as youll find it there is other way to handle it and here is how the whole drill must go auditor do you have present time problem pc yes or anything the pc says auditor thank you i will check that on the meter looks at meter do you have present time problem its clean or it still reacts do you have present time problem that that pc i had fight with my wife last night auditor thank you i will check that on the meter do you have present time problem thats clean the way auditors have been handling this is this way very wrong auditor do you have present time problem pc i had fight with my wife last night auditor what about flunk flunk flunk the rule is never ask question about an answer in cleaning any rudiment if the pc gives you an answer acknowledge it and check it on the meter dont ever ask question about the answer the pc gave matter what the answer was bluntly you cannot clean rudiments easily so long as you ask question about pcs answer you cannot expect the pc to feel acknowledged and therefore you invite arc breaks further you slow session down and can wipe out all gain you can even make the pc worse if you want gains in session never q and on rudiments type questions or form type sec check questions take what the pc said ack it check it on the meter if clean go on if still reacting ask another question of rudiments type apply this rule severely never deviate from it many new tr drills are based on this but you can do it now handle all beginning middle and end rudiments exactly in this way youll be amazed how rapidly the pc gains if you do and how easily the rudiments go in and stay in in prepchecking you can get deeper into pcs bank by using his answer to get him to amplify but never while using rudiment or sec check type question changing because the pc changes this is less common auditor fault but it exists even sochanging process because the pc is changing is breach of the auditors code it is flagrant q and getting change on the pc often invites the auditor to change the process some auditors change the process every time the pc changes this is very cruel it leaves the pc hung in every process run it is the mark of the frantic obsessive alteris auditor the auditors impatience is such that he or she cannot wait to flatten anything but must go on the rule of auditing by the tone arm was the method of preventing this so long as you have tone arm motion continue the process change the process only when you have run out all tone arm motion rudiments repair processes are not processes in the full sense of the word but even here the rule applies if to limited extent the rule applies this far if pc gets too much tone arm motion in the rudiments and especially if he or she gets little tone arm motion in the session you must run prepchecking on the rudiments questions and do cchs on the pc ordinarily if you run rudiments process in getting the rudiments in you ignore the tone arm motion otherwise youll never get to the body of the session and will have qd and ad with the pc after all for you will have let the pc throw the session by having out rudiments and will have let the pc avoid the body of the session so ignore ta action in handling rudiments unless you are prepchecking using each rudiment in turn in the body of the session when rudiment is used as rudiment ignore ta action when rudiment is used in the session body for prepchecking pay some attention to ta action to be sure something is happening dont hang pc up in thousand unflat processes flatten process before you change following the pcs instructions there are auditors who look to the pc for all their directions on how to handle their cases as aberration is composited of unknowns this results in the pcs case never being touched if the pc only is saying what to do then only the known areas of the pcs case will get audited pc can be asked for data on whats been done by other auditors and for data in general on his reactions to processes to this degree one uses the pcs data when it is also checked on the meter and from other sources i myself have had it bad in this auditors have now and then demanded of as pc instructions and directions as to how to do certain steps in auditing of course snapping attention to the auditor is bad enough but asking pc what to do or following the pcs directions as to what to do is to discard in its entirety session control and the pc will get worse in that session dont consider the pc boob to be ignored either its the pcs session but be competent enough at your craft to know what to do and dont hate the pc so much that you take his or her directions as to what to do next its fatal to any sessionsummary q and is slanguage but the whole of auditing results depends upon auditing right and not q and aing of all the data above only the first section contains new discovery it is an important discovery the other two sections are old but must be discovered sooner or later by any auditor who wants results if you q and your pc will not achieve gains from auditing if you really hate the pc by all means q and and get the full recoil of it session without arc breaks is marvellous thing to give and to receive today we dont have to use arc break processes if we handle our rudiments

remimeo all auditors all levels flag internes lrh comms the reason for q and q and means question and answer when the term q and is used it means one did not get an answer to his question it also means not getting compliance with an order but accepting something else example auditor do birds fly pc i dont like birds auditor what dont you like about birds flunk its q and the right reply would be an answer to the question asked and the right action would be to get the original question answered tr 4 handling origins can apply here the moment tr 4 is violated ack and return the pc to original question and the original unanswered question is not again asked the auditor just drifts along with the pc things get restimulated nothing gets really handled or run in administration the same thing can happen the executive gives an order the junior says or does something else the executive does not simply tr 4 it and get the original order done and the result is chaos executive phone mr schultz and tell him our printing order will be there this afternoon junior i dont know his number executive dont you have phone book junior the phone company didnt send one this year as our bill was overdue executive the fool goes to accounts to see what about the phone bill mr schultz never gets his call the printing order arrives but mr schultz doesnt know it example executive do target 21 now junior i dont have any issue files executive what happened to them junior mimeo goofed executive ill go see mimeo dispersal q and is simply postulate aberration aberration is nonstraight line by definition sick thetan who is all caved in cant direct postulate at anything when he tries he lets it wobble around and go elsewhere the difference between degraded being and an ot is simply that the db cant put out postulate or intention in direct line or way and make it hold good the insane are great example of this they are insane because they have evil intentions but they cant even make these stick they may intend to burn down the house but they usually wind up watering the rug or do some other non sequitur thing its not that they dont mess things up the whole point here is that they cant even properly destroy what they intend to destroy even their evil intentions wobble poor thingsbut not all people who q and are insane when person is running at effect he qs and as he is confronted by life he does not confront it he is usually bit blind to things as his ability to look at is turned back on him by his lack of beam power thus he gives the appearance of being unaware his emotional feeling is overwhelm his mental state is confusion he starts for b winds up ata other not too well intentioned people can play tricks on qer and aer when they dont want to answer or comply they artfully bring about q and example bosco does not want to staple the mimeo issue he knows his senior qs and as so we get this senior staple that issue with the big stapler bosco i hurt my thumb q and senior have you been to see the medical officer bosco he wouldnt look at it q and senior ill go have word with him departs bosco gets back to reading jesse james rides again humming softly to himself for his trouble is he qs and as with the mest universe body q and some people q and with their bodies the body is after all composed of mest it follows the laws of mest one of these laws is newtons first law of motion inertia this is the tendency of mest object to remain motionless until acted upon by an exterior force or to continue in line of motion until acted upon by an exterior force well the main force around that is continually acting on human body is thetan the being himself the body will remain at rest since it is mest object until acted upon by the thetan that is supposed to be running it if that being is an aberrated nonstraight line being the body reacts on him more than he reacts on the body thus he remains motionless or very slow when the body is in unwanted motion the being does not deter the motion as the body is acting upon him far more than he is reacting on the body as result one of the manifestations is q and he wants to pick up piece of paper the body inertia has to be overcome to do so so he does not reach for the paper he just leaves the hand where it is this would be action at all if he then weakly forces the motion he finds himself picking up something else like paper clip decides he wants that anyway and settles for it now he has to invent why he has paper clip in his hand his original intention never gets executed some people on medical lines are just there not because of actual illness but because they are just qing and aing with their bodypeople also q and with themselves they want to stop drinking and cant they want to stop or change something about themselves or their body and then disperse off onto something else freud read all sorts of dire and awful things into simple q and he invented intentions the person must have that made him sublimate all freud succeeded in doing was making the person introspective looking for wrong whys the right why was simplethe person could not go in straight line to an objective andor could not cease to do something he was compulsively doing the very word aberration contains the idea of thisno straight line but bent one the cure for this sort of thing q and with body is objective processes and very willing and bright thetan can simply recognize it for what it isnot enough push and instead of going to the mo for slight ache he just pushes on through as the ache is recoil of body q and in lot of cases the ache itself goes away as soon as one simply pushes through painters and artists buy the idea they are benefited by aberration be glad you are neurotic was trick being played by the late and unlamented psychiatrists on artists one paints because he can push into execution what he visualizes the best painters were the least aberrated greenwich village or left bank artists when they dont paint never suspect its because they just cant overcome hand inertia to push paint brush people live q and lives they never become what they desire to be because they q and with life about

flub of command for poor confronting for bad communication of command for poor acknowledgement for poor repetition of command and for failing to handle origination by coach stress that student learns to lead slightly in all the motions of walking around the room or across the room this will be found to have great deal to do with confronting in the first part of the session student is not allowed

can that would complete two cycles of action when shouting is completed then have student use normal tone of voice with lot of coach attention on the student getting the intention into the object next have the student do the drill while using the wrong commandsie saying thank you while placing in the object the intention to stand up etc next have the student do the drill silently putting the intention in the object without even thinking the words of the command or the acknowledgement the final step in this would be for the coach to say start then anything else he said would not be valid on student with the exception of flunk and thats it here the coach would attempt to distract the student using any verbal means he could to knock the student off tone 40 physical heckling would not be greater than tapping the student on the knee or shoulder to get his attention when the student can maintain tone 40 and get clean intention on the object for each command and for each acknowledgement the drill is flat there are other ways to help the student along the coach occasionally asks are you willing to be in that ashtray when the student has answered then are you willing for thought to be there instead of you then continue the drill the answers are not so important on these two questions as is the fact that the idea is brought to the students attention another question the coach asks the student is did you really expect that ashtray to comply with that command there is drill which will greatly increase the students reality on what an intention is the coach can use this drill three or four times during the training on tone 40 on an object as follows think the thoughti am wild flower good think the thought that you are sitting in chair good imagine that thought being in that ashtray good imagine that ashtray containing that thought in its substance good now get the ashtray thinking that it is an ashtray good get the ashtray intending to go on being an ashtray good get the ashtray intending to remain where it is good have the ashtray end that cycle good put in the ashtray the intention to remain where it is good this also helps the student get reality on placing an intention in something apart from himself stressthat an intention has nothing to do with words and has nothing to do with the voice nor is it dependent upon thinking certain words an intention must be clear and have counterintention in it this training drill tone 40 on an object usually takes the most time of any drill in upper indoc and time on it is well spent objects to be used are ashtrays preferably heavy coloured glass ashtrays history developed by l ron hubbard in washington dc in 1957 to train students to use intention when auditing number tr 9 name tone 40 on person commands same as 8c control student runs fine clearcut intention and verbal orders on coach coach tries to break down tone 40 of student coach commands that are valid are start to begin flunk to call attention to student error and that they must return to beginning of cycle and thats it to take break or to end the training session other statement by coach is valid on student and is only an effort to make student come off tone 40 or in general be stopped position student and coach ambulant student in manual contact with coach as needed purpose to make student able to maintain tone 40 under any stress or duress training stress the exact amount of physical effort must be used by student plus compelling unspoken intention jerky struggles are allowed since each jerk is stop student must learn to smoothly increase effort quickly to amount needed to make coach execute stress is on exact intention exact strength needed exact force necessary exact tone 40 even slight smile by student can be flunk too much force can be flunk too little force definitely is flunk anything not tone 40 is flunk here the coach should check very carefully on students ability to place an intention in the coach this can be checked by the coach since the coach will find himself doing the command almost whether or not he wants to if the student is really getting the intention across after the coach is satisfied with the students ability to get the intention across the coach should then do all he can to break the student off tone 40 mainly on the basis of surprise and change of pace thus the student will be brought to have greater tolerance of surprise and quick recovery from surprise history developed in washington dc in 1957 by l ron hubbard purpose of these four training drills tr 6 7 8 and 9 is to bring about in the student the willingness and ability to handle and control other peoples bodies and to cheerfully confront another person while giving that person commands also to maintain high

remimeo cses cs series 20 persistent fn floating needle can persist this fact tells you at once why you cannot do three major actions in row in the same ten minutes this was the bug behind quickie grades 0 to iv in one session this also occurred in power when it was run all in one day the auditor would attain bona fide full dial fn the pc was still cogniting still in big win the auditor would clear the next process command he would see an fn he would clear the next process command and see an fn but it was the same fn result was that processes 2 and 3 were never run on the case this is really what is meant by quickie grades in 1958 we got real releases you could not kill the fn for days weeks several processes had this effect todays real clear also goes this way you couldnt kill the fn with an axe by running lot of level zero processes for instance you can get real swinging unkillable fn it not only gets to the examiner it comes in at the start of the next days session now if in one session you ran all of level zero and went on up to level one you would just be auditing persistent fn the pc would get benefit at all from level one hes still going wow on level zero if you ran level zero with one process that got big wide floating fn and then ran level i ii iii and iv you would have just level zero release the pcs bank was nowhere to be found so next week he has problems level i or service fac level iv and he is only grade zero yet it says right there in certs and awards log hes grade iv so now we have grade iv who has level i ii iii and iv troubles session that tries to go beyond big dialwide drifting floating fn only distracts the pc from his win big win any big win fn dialwide cog vgis gives you this kind of persistent fn you at least have to let it go until tomorrow and let the pc have his win that is what is meant by letting the pc have his win when you get one of these dialwide fns cog vgis wow you may as well pack it up for the day gradual wideningin running dianetic chain to basic in triple you will sometimes see in one session half dial on flow 1 34 of dial on flow 2 full dial on flow 3 or you may have 4 subjects to twoway comm or prepcheck in one session first action 13 dial fn then fn ta up second action l2 dial fn then fn third action 34 dial fn fourth action full dialwide floating swinging idling fn you will also notice in the same sessionlong time for 1st action shorter shorter shorter for the next three actions now you have an fn that anything you try to clear and run will just fn without affecting the case at all if you audit past that you are wasting your time and processes you have hit an unkillable fn properly called persistent fn its persistent at least for that day do any more and its wasted if an auditor has never seen this he had better get his tr0 bullbait flat for 2 hours at one unflunked go and his other trs in and drill out his flubs for thats whats supposed to happen fns on pcs audited up to for that session persistent fn always get to the examiner if you only have small fn it wont get to the examiner however on some pcs maybe thats good enough may take him several sessions each one getting final session fn bit wider then he gets an fn that gets to the examiner after that well audited on continuing basis the fn lasts longer and longer one day the pc comes into session with dialwide floating swinging fn and anything you say or do does nothing whatever to disturb that fn its real release man it may last weeks months years tell him to come back when he feels he needs some auditing and chalk up the remaining hours if sold by the hour as undelivered or if sold by result chalk up the result if the fn is truly persistent he will have objections if it isnt he will object so have him come back tomorrow and carry on whatever you were doing summary the technical bug back of quickie grades or quickie power was the persistent fn this is not to be confused with stage 4 sweep stick sweep stick or an arc broke needle pc bad indicators while fning this is not to be used to refuse all further auditing to pc it is to be used to determine when to end series of major actions in session lrh rrrd l ron hubbard copyright 1970 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 19 april 1972 remimeo cs series 77 quickie defined the reason an auditor can say he doesnt quickie rundown and none ever say they do is because he has definition for the word quickie the word has been used to designate rundowns that were not completely and fully done it is not slang word in the dictionary you will find quickie also quicky something done or made in hurry also hurriedly planned and executed program as of studies what happens in auditing for instance is grade zero expanded is done by just doing single flow to its first fn that is obviously quickie more subtle one is to do pts rundown with ethics action to begin and check for stability holding gain and not ill week or two after the rd only if both these actions were done would one have complete pts rundown as it would give product pc longer pts so what makes quickie completion quickie is it length of time not necessarily is it fewness of processes not necessarily as power can be done quickie simply by not hanging on for the ep and only going to fn to define complete gives us the reverse of quickie complete to make whole entire or perfect end after satisfying all demands or requirements completion is the act or action of completing becoming complete or making complete so completing something is not loose term it means an exact thing end after satisfying all demands or requirements does not mean doing as little as possible or doing what one can call complete without being detected anything that does not fully satisfy all requirements is quickie so quickie really means omitting actions for whatever reason that would satisfy all demands or requirements and doing something less than could be achieved in short quickie is not doing all the steps and actions that could be done to make perfect wholestandard auditing actions required for ages that auditors cleared each word of each command yet when they went quickie they dropped this when this was dropped gains on 75 of all pcs lessened or vanished we are right now achieving spectacular wins on pcs just by clearing up commands and words on all lists we are finding that these pcs did not recover and never before had been in session even though previously audited hundreds of hours by omitting an essential action of clearing commands processing did not work because the pc never understood the auditing commands so quickie action did not save any time did it it wasted hundreds of hours quickie programs are those which omit essential steps like vital lists or 2wcs to get data fess for past errors are often omitted to slow down the torrent of quickie actions on clearing commands hco pl 4 apr 72 issue iii ethics and study tech has clause 4 an auditor failing to clear each and every word of every command or list used may be summoned before court of ethics the charge is out tech ethics has to enter in after quickie tech has gotten in because quickie tech is symptom of out ethics hco pl 3 april 72 est series 13 doing work and hco pl 4 apr 72 est series 14 ethics are vital knowhow where cs is faced with quickie actionsor flubby ones that will not cure essential quickie tech is simply dishonest auditors who do it have their own ethics out in some way to be sure their confront is down there are numerous remedies for the quickie impulse the above mentioned policy letters and plain simple tr 0 are standard remedies tr 0 properly done and completed itself usually cures it quickie study in 67 and 68 almost destroyed auditing quality lrh ed 174 int which really pushes in study tech will achieve the primary reason for quickiethe auditor didnt

copyright 1972 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 6 november ad14 remimeo franchise sthil students styles of auditing note 1 most oldtime auditors particularly saint hill graduates have been trained at one time or another in these auditing styles here they are given names and assigned to levels so that they can be taught more easily and so that general auditing can be improved note 2 these have not been written before because i had not determined the results vital to each level there is style of auditing for each class by style is meant method or custom of performing actions style is not really determined by the process being run so much style is how the auditor addresses his task different processes carry different style requirements perhaps but that is not the point clay table healing at level iii can be run with level i style and still have some gains but an auditor trained up to the style required at level iii would do better job not only of ct healing but of any repetitive process style is how the auditor audits the real expert can do them all but only after he can do each one style is mark of class it is not individual in our meaning it is distinct way to handle the tools of auditing level zero listen style at level 0 the style is listen style auditing here the auditor is expected to listen to the pc the only skill necessary is listening to another as soon as it is ascertained that the auditor is listening not just confronting or ignoring the auditor can be checked out the length of time an auditor can listen without tension or strain showing could be factor what the pc does is not factor considered in judging this style pcs however talk to an auditor who is really listening here we have the highest point that oldtime mental therapies reached when they did reach it such as psychoanalysis when they helped anyone mostly they were well below this evaluating invalidating interrupting these three things are what the instructor in this style should try to put across to the has student listen style should not be complicated by expecting more of the auditor than just this listen to the pc without evaluating invalidating or interrupting adding on higher skills like is the pc talking interestingly or even is the pc talking is part of this style when this auditor gets in trouble and the pc wont talk or isnt interested higher classed auditor is called in new question given by the supervisor etcit really isnt itsa to be very technical itsa is the action of the pc saying its this or its that getting the pc to itsa is quite beyond listen style auditors where the pc wont its the supervisor or the question on the blackboard that gets the pc to itsa the ability to listen learned well stays with the auditor up through the grades one doesnt cease to use it even at level vi but one has to learn it somewhere and thats at level zero so listen style auditing is just listening it thereafter adds into the other styles level one muzzled auditing this could also be called rote style auditing muzzled auditing has been with us many years it is the stark total of trs 0 to 4 and not anything else added it is called so because auditors too often added in comments qed and aed deviated discussed and otherwise messed up session muzzle meant muzzle was put on them figuratively speaking so they would only state the auditing command and ack repetitive command auditing using trs 0 to 4 at level one is done completely muzzled this could be called muzzled repetitive auditing style but will be called muzzled style for the sake of brevity it has been matter of long experience that pcs who didnt make gains with the partially trained auditor permitted to twoway comm did make gains the instant the auditor was muzzled to wit not permitted to do thing but run the process permitted to say nothing but the commands and acknowledge them and handle pc originations by simple acknowledgment without any other question or comment at level one we dont expect the auditor to do anything but state the command or ask the question with variation acknowledge the pcs answer and handle the pc origins by understanding and acknowledging what the pc said those processes used at level one actually respond best to muzzled auditing and worst to misguided efforts to twoway comm listen style combines with muzzled style easily but watch out that level one sessions dont disintegrate to level zero crisp clean repetitive commands muzzled given and answered often are the road out not pc wanderings pc at this level is instructed in exactly what is expected of him exactly what the auditor will do the pc is even put through few do birds fly cycles until the pc gets the idea then the processing works an auditor trying to do muzzled repetitive auditing on pc who through past therapy experience is rambling on and on is sad sight it means that control is out or that the pc never got above level zero its the number of commands given and answered in unit of auditing time that gets gains to that add the correctly chosen repetitive process and you have release in short order using the processes of this levelto follow limp listen style with crisp controlled muzzled style may be shock but they are each the lowest of the two families of auditing stylestotally permissive and totally controlled and they are so different each is easy to learn with confusion its been the lack of difference amongst styles that confuses the student into slopping about well these two are different enoughlisten style and muzzled styleto set anybody straight level two guiding style auditing an oldtime auditor would have recognized this style under two separate names two way comm and b formal auditing we condense these two old styles under one new name guiding style auditing one first guides the pc by twoway comm into some subject that has to be handled or into revealing what should be handled and then the auditor handles it with formal repetitive commands guiding style auditing becomes feasible only when student can do listen style and muzzled style auditing well formerly the student who couldnt confront or duplicate command took refuge in sloppy discussions with the pc and called it auditing or twoway comm the first thing to know about guiding style is that one lets the pc talk and itsa without chop but also gets the pc steered into the proper subject and gets the job done with repetitive commands we presuppose the auditor at this level has had enough case gain to be able to occupy the viewpoint of the auditor and therefore to be able to observe the pc we also presuppose at this level that the auditor being able to occupy viewpoint is therefore more selfdetermined the two things being related one can only be selfdetermined when one can observe the actual situation before one otherwise being is delusiondetermined or otherdetermined thus in guiding style auditing the auditor is there to find out whats what from the pc and then apply the needful remedy most of the processes in the book of remedies are included in this level ii to use those one has to observe the pc discover what the pc is doing and remedy the pcs case accordingly the result for the pc is farreaching reorientation in life thus the essentials of guiding style auditing consist of twoway comm that steers the pc into revealing difficulty followed by repetitive process to handle what has been revealed one does expert trs but one may discuss things with the pc let the pc talk and in general one audits the pc before one establishing what that pc needs and then doing it with crisp repetitive auditing but all the while alert to changes in the pc one runs at this level against tone arm action paying little or heed to the needle except as centering device for ta position one even establishes whats to be done by the action of the tone arm the process of storing up things to run on the pc by seeing what fell when he was running whats being run now belongs at this level ii and will be renumbered accordinglyat ii one expects to handle lot of chronic ptps overts arc breaks with life but not session arc breaks that being needle action session arc breaks being sorted out by higher classed auditor if they occur to get such things done ptps overts and other remedies in the session the auditor must have pc willing to talk to the auditor about his difficulties that presupposes we have an auditor at this level who can ask questions not repetitive that guide the pc into talking about the difficulty that needs to be handled great command of tr 4 is the primary difference in trs from level i one understands when one doesnt by asking more questions and by really acknowledging only when one has really understood it guided comm is the clue to control at this level one should easily guide the pcs comm in and out and around without chopping the pc or wasting session time as soon as an auditor gets the idea of finite result or that is to say specific and definite result expected all this is easy pc has ptp example auditor has to have the idea he is to locate and destimulate the ptp so pc is not bothered about it and isnt being driven to do something about it as the finite result the auditor at ii is trained to audit the pc before him get the pc into comm guide the pc toward data needful to choose process and then to run the process necessary to resolve that thing found usually by repetitive command and always by ta the book of remedies is the key to this level and this auditing style one listens but only to what one has guided the pc into one runs repetitive commands with good tr 4 and one may search around for quite while before one is satisfied he has the answer from the pc needful to resolve certain aspect of the pcs case ow can be run at level i but at level ii one may guide the pc into divulging what the pc considers real overt act and having that then guide the pc through all the reasons it wasnt an overt and so eventually blow it halfacknowledgment is also taught at level iithe ways of keeping pc talking by giving the pc the feeling he is being heard and yet not chopping with overdone tr 2 big or multiple acknowledgment is also taught to shut the pc off when the pc is going off the subject level iii abridged style auditing by abridged is meant abbreviated shorn of extras any not actually needful auditing command is deleted for instance at level i the auditor always says when the pc wanders off the subject i will repeat the auditing command and does so in abridged style the auditor omits this when it isnt necessary and just asks the command again if the pc has forgotten it in this style we have shifted from pure rote to sensible use or omission as needful we still use repetitive commands expertly but we dont use rote that is unnecessary to the situation twoway comm comes into its own at level iii but with heavy use of repetitive commandsat this level we have as the primary process clay table healing in this an auditor must make sure the commands are followed exactly auditing command is ever let go of until that actual command is answered by the pc but at the same time one doesnt necessarily give every auditing command the process has in its rundown in clay table healing one is supposed to make sure the pc is satisfied each time this is done more often by observation than command yet it is done we suppose at iii that we have an auditor who is in pretty fine shape and can observe thus we see the pc is satisfied and dont mention it thus we see when the pc is not certain and so we get something the pc is certain of in answering the question on the other hand one gives all the necessary commands crisply and definitely and gets them executed prepchecking and needle usage is taught at level iii as well as clay table healing auditing by list is also taught in abridged style auditing one may find the pc being cleaned up on list question giving half dozen answers in rush one doesnt stop the pc from doing so one half acknowledges and lets the pc go on one is in actual fact handling bigger auditing comm cycle that is all the question elicits more than one answer which is really only one answer and when that answer is given it is acknowledged one sees when needle is clean without some formula set of questions that invalidate all the pcs relief and one sees it isnt clean by the continued puzzle on the pcs face there are tricks involved here one asks question of the pc with the key word in it and notes that the needle doesnt tremble and so concludes the question about the word is flat and so doesnt check it again example has anything else been suppressed one eye on pc one on needle needle didnt quiver pc looks noncommittal auditor says all right on and goes on to next question eliminating pcs possible protest read that can be mistaken for another suppress in abridged style auditing one sticks to the essentials and drops rote where it impedes case advance but that doesnt mean one wanders about one is even more crisp and thorough with abridged style auditing than in rote one is watching what happens and doing exactly enough to achieve the expected result by abridged is meant getting the exact job donethe shortest way between two pointswith waste questions by now the student should know that he runs process to achieve an exact result and he gets the process run in way to achieve that result in the smallest amount of time the student is taught to guide rapidly to have time for wide excursions the processes at this level are all ratatattat processesct healing prepchecking auditing by list again its the number of times the question is answered per unit of auditing time that makes for speed of result level iv direct style auditingby direct we mean straight concentrated intense applied in direct manner we do not mean direct in the sense of to direct somebody or to guide we mean it is direct by direct we dont mean frank or choppy on the contrary we put the pcs attention on his bank and anything we do is calculated only to make that attention more direct it could also mean that we are not auditing by vias we are auditing straight at the things that need to be reached to make somebody clear other than this the auditing attitude is very easy and relaxed at level iv we have clay table clearing and we have assessment type processes these two types of process are both astonishingly direct they are aimed directly at the reactive mind they are done in direct manner in ct clearing we have almost total work and itsa from pcs from one end of session to another we may have only few auditing commands for pc on ct clearing does almost all the work if he is in session at all thus we have another implication in the word direct the pc is talking directly to the auditor about what he is making and why in ct clearing the auditor hardly ever talks at all in assessment the auditor is aiming directly at the pcs bank and wants pc in front of it thinking speculating maundering or itsaing thus this assessment is very direct action all this requires easy smooth steelhandinavelvetglove control of the pc it looks easy and relaxed as style it is straight as toledo blade the trick is to be direct in whats wanted and not deviate the auditor settles whats to be done gives the command and then the pc may work for long time the auditor alert attentive completely relaxed in assessment the auditor often pays attention to the pc at all as in arc breaks or assessing lists indeed pc at this level is trained to be quiet during the assessment of list and in ct clearing an auditor may be quiet for an hour at stretch the tests are can the auditor keep the pc quiet while assessing without arc breaking the pc can the auditor order the pc to do something and then the pc working on it can the auditor remain quiet and attentive for an hour understanding everything and interrupt alertly only when he doesnt understand and get the pc to make it clearer to him again without arc breaking the pc you could confuse this direct style with listen style if you merely glanced at session of ct clearing but what difference in listen style the pc is blundering on and on and on in direct style the pc wanders off the line an inch and starts to itsa let us say with clay work and after it was obvious to the auditor that this pc had forgotten the clay youd see the auditor quick as foil look at the pc very interestedly and say lets see that in clay or the pc doesnt really give an ability he wants to improve and youd hear quiet persuasive auditor voice are you quite certain you want to improve that sounds like goal to just something some ability you know youd like to improve you could call this style oneway auditing when the pc is given his orders after that its all from the pc to the auditor and all involved with carrying out that auditing instructionwhen the auditor is assessing it is all from the auditor to the pc only when the assessment action hits snag like ptp is there any other auditing style used this is very extreme auditing style it is straightforwarddirect but when needful as in any level the styles learned below it are often also employed but never in the actual actions of getting ct clearing and assessment done note level v would be the same style as vi below level vi all style so far we have dealt with simple actions now we have an auditor handling meter and pc who itsas and cognites and gets ptps and arc breaks and line charges and cognites and who finds items and lists and who must be handled handled handled all the way as auditing ta for 2l2 hour session can go to 79 or 125 divisions compared to 10 or 15 for the lowest level the pace of the session is greater it is this pace that makes perfect ability at each lower level vital when they combine into all style for each is now faster so we learn all style by learning each of the lower styles well and then observe and apply the style needed every time it is needed shifting styles as often as once every minute the best way to learn all style is to become expert at each lower style so that one does the style correct for the situation each time the situation requiring that style occurs it is less rough than it looks but it is also very demanding use the wrong style on situation and youve had it arc break progress example right in the middle of an assessment the needle gets dirty the auditor cant continueor shouldnt the auditor in direct style looks up to see apuzzled frown the auditor has to shift to guiding style to find out what ails the pc who probably doesnt really know then to listen style while the pc cognites on chronic ptp that just emerged and bothered the pc then to direct style to finish the assessment that was in progress the only way an auditor can get confused by all style is by not being good at one of the lower level styles careful inspection will show where the student using all style is slipping one then gets the student to review that style that was not well learned and practice it bit so all style when poorly done is very easy to remedy for it will be in error on one or more of the lower level styles and as all these can be independently taught the whole can be coordinated all style is hard to do only when one hasnt mastered one of the lower level styles summary these are the important styles of auditing there have been others but they are only variations of those given in this hco bulletin tone 40 style is the most notable one missing it remains as practice style at level one to teach fearless body handling and to teach one to get his

style auditing there are two ways to run listen style auditing1 as number of teams directly under an auditing supervisor and 2 as an individual auditor correct training procedure at level 0 is to have the auditor do coaudit style until confident and then train him to do the same thing individually listen style coaudit the coaudit version is merely to get the student to do auditing without having to assume too much responsibility in this version it is really the instructor who is doing the auditing he starts the session and tells the auditor to give the commands and acknowledge the answers if this relationship is understood it makes the supervision of level 0 group of teams much easier the procedure for running listen style coaudit is as follows 1 instructor gets the auditors to seat their pcs in their chairs and then sit down 2 he writes up on board the exact wording of the process to be used 3 he asks students if the room is alright for them to be audited in 4 he tells them what is going to be run in the session r factor and cleans up any questions on the part of pcs obviously stress is on getting them able to talk to anyone 5 he tells auditors and pcs that all the auditor is permitted to do is to give the command and acknowledge the answers if pc says anything that cannot be handled with an acknowledgement the auditor will put out his hand behind him and wait for an instructor 6 he tells the auditors to keep their auditors reports 7 instructor then says start of session and tells the auditors to give the command goals or rudiments are set or done notes students should be taught that before they give an acknowledgement they should understand pcs answer they are permitted therefore to ask pc to amplify an answer or to explain word so that they the auditors understand the answer if student puts out his hand the instructor goes to session and without ending it handles what needs handling and then lets session go on the instructor is careful not to become the pcs auditor completely as transference will set in and pcs will invent trouble to get more attention instructor should have meter handy so that in the case of an arc break he canquickly do an assessment in doing the arc break assessment he is of course careful not to audit the pc only to locate and indicate the bypassed charge at end of period instructor says commence ending your sessions he waits bit and then says tell your auditor any gains youve made in the session auditors write them down waits again and then says alright im going to end the session now end of session instructor then gives whatever instruction is necessary either to end the period or to get the room ready for the next period or gives break etc listen style individual this is done exactly the same as the coaudit version but in this case of course the auditor handles the session it goes like this 1 the auditor seats the pc in his or her chair and then sits down across from the pc knees few inches from the pcs table is used or just two chairs the auditors report being kept on clip board there is of course meter 2 the auditor takes the exact auditing command to be used from his text book bulletin or notes 3 he asks the pc if it is all right to audit the pc in the room and if not makes things right by adjusting the room or location of auditing 4 he tells the pc the purpose of such sessions reality factor i want to get you used to talking to another i want to improve your reach etc its the auditors goal at this level not the pcs pcs dont get chance to have goals in listen style as they would set goals they cant attain at this level and wouldnt have enough reality on auditing anyway to be sensible about it so only an r factor is usedno goals the auditor also tells the pc exactly how long the session will be 5 the auditor tells the pc that all he is going to do is to listen and try to understand the pc and that all he wants the pc to do is talk on the selected subject the auditor will give him and that if he veers off the auditor will call it to his attention 6 the auditor then quickly starts his auditors report 7 the auditor says start of session 8 the auditor gives the command from his text bulletin or notes the command must have something to do with telling people things or communicating and may also specify subject to talk about 9 further commands are given only when the pc loses track of the subject and wants to know what it was see routines for level 0 for exact handling of commands 10 when the pc says something and obviously expects response the auditor signifies he has heard using any normal means 11 when the pc says something the auditor doesnt grasp the auditor asks the pc to repeat it or amplify it so that the auditor does hear it in the fullest sense of the word see the prompters below only 4 are allowed 12 when the pc stops talking the auditor must adjudicate whether the pc is simply longer interested in the subject or has become unwilling to talk about some bit of it if theauditor believes the pc has stopped because of embarrassment or some similar reason the auditor has the prompters the only things he is allowed to use prompter have you found something you think would make think less of you prompter b is there something you thought of that you think i wouldnt understand prompter c have you said something you felt i didnt understand if so tell again prompter d have you found something you havent understood if so tell about it the student must know these prompters by heart he uses as many as needed in the sequence given to start the pc talking again the auditor must not start new subject or process just because the pc cant bring himself to go on talking the whole essence of level 0 is to get the pc up to being willing to talk about anything to anyone thus any coaxing is also allowed threats are forbidden b c or d usually handle these are the commonest reasons people cease talking mere forgetting is handled just by reminding the pc of the subject 13 new processes or new subjects in routine which are in essence new processes are started only when the pc has brightened up and become quite able by reason of getting comfortable about the last one realizing that the whole target of level 0 is to get people willing to talk about anything to others regained ability on subject governs when to start new process if the auditor can answer to himself this question in the affirmative then he can go to new process is this pc able to talk freely to or about subject of last process if so its all right to select new question from the same routine or new routine more rarely and ask it now but it is never all right to prevent pc from talking by butting in with new question one never asks amplifying questions at level 0 commentary type questions are also out the auditor listens to the questions answers and only interrupts when he truly hasnt heard or didnt grasp some point over and over repetitive use of commands is made of course as thats level one the commands are given rarely same commands but only to get the pc going again staccato repetitive commands and brief pc answers are not for level 0 14 toward the end of the auditing period the auditor warns the session time is about over well have to be ending shortly 15 when the pc has given an extra comment or two the auditor says were closing the session now time is up have you made any gains in this session 16 the pcs answers are quickly noted 17 the auditor says end of session note pcs of course often keep on talking and make it hard to end session end it anyway if this seems to shock the pc point out the time the session ended as originally set and say also youll be getting more auditing and well take that up in the next session youll always have trouble ending session if you fail to put in its time in the r factor reality factor in 4 above as the auditor notes the time in his report see 4 above he must say this session will go until________hours and minutes precisely thus he has an out for ending it an auditor must never run beyond that time set and must of course audit until it is reached this by the way does not just hold good for level 0 it is very good practice for all levels in regular sessions the only exception is the assist where one is auditing toward definite gain in general auditing one seeks to obtain general gains not sudden momentary spurtsthe auditor whether in coaudit or individual session at this and the next level will soon become impressed with this fact the more he himself says during the session the less gain the pc gets therefore aside from the above the auditor does very little in the session and is paid handsomely for it in pc gains l ron hubbard lrh jwcden copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard

accidentally in twc you can get the same bad reactions from pc that you would get on wrongly done list the reason for pc upsets in twc is hidden as it is not apparently listing process rarely gets the correction bad list would get asking who or what or which during twc after the main question can also turn it into listing and nulling process twc questions must be limited to feelings reactions significances they must never ask for terminals or locations example who upset you in twc causes the pc to give items this is list what are you upset about does the same thing which town were you happiest in is also listing question not twc question any of these results in the pc giving items they are not then nulled or correctly indicated the pc can get very upset just as he would with wrong list yet the session is not listing session so never gets corrected example how are you doing lately is an example of correct twc question it gets off charge and gets list items are you better these days than you used to be how have you been since the last session what happened is different than what illness what person what town which are listing questions repair when other things fail to locate

bulletin of 7 july 1960 fran hldrs the assessment of help you should realize at this stage that we are still feeling around for the most adequate and fastest method of running help everything which has been given to you thus far is near the mark and presessioning model session and flattening help are right on the mark however there are certain things that make auditors unhappy with running help chief amongst these is the fact that it is tremendously restimulative process when one has not had any run this means that we had better get the staff theta clearing course or staff coauditing going fast on supervised basis the second thing is that help does not flatten very easily on late specific terminal of course this is true of all processes but help is peculiar process and is slower on late terminals than other buttons and here is why help resolves cases because it is the basis of all association and as you know association leads to identification and identification is the basis of all mental upsets the action of help is not aberrative the failure to help is what does it or the lack of things to help however all valences and all identification stem from this button and other now do lights dawn and bells ring help is the button which if run settles all difficulties with association and identification and all problems of beingness thus there is something peculiar about help which is not true of any other button any help run is gain even gawdelpus if it is left wholly bogged with half hour comm lag all bits of help run are chewing away at all tangles of identification so chew away and to the dickens with it any help run is better than help run and because the pc is bundle of aberrated identifications any help run untangles some of him and any help run on any terminal tends to get at any other terminal so thats why help run in any old way will sooner or later make the grade but this is reason to believe there are not also smart ways to run help any late specific terminal being so confounded far from basicbasic on the time track runs tough and endlessly therefore as always it is better to run general terminals than to run specific terminals however in the case of ptp you can go ahead if you have to and run help on the ptp personnel but as soon as the edge is off the ptp for heavens sakes shift to the general form of the specific terminals you have been running and flatten those lot or little keep very close record of what you have run on help as the only precaution you have to take and when the pc is running toward mest clear check back with help on these terminals and make sure they are flat when lot of help has been run on basic material then of course you will find that what ran very arduously before will now run much better it is almost waste of time to run specific terminals but still you must run things that are real to the pc and if only yesterday was real to him then you are stuck with running the pc on later terminals or even specific terminals much faster way to run help than by sorting out real terminals on an emeter which is still necessary sometimes is to do an assessment on the pc using help and the dynamics and finding button that is entirely off dynamic and that the pc cant imagine helping this is trigger to case unusual results happen very fastanother way to go about this is simple questioning of the pc on the subject of his dislikes watch the meter and when you get silly reaction on dislike like rock slam or heavy drop or sudden theta bop then pick this out make general form out of it that registers like the first mention and run that on the pc this is rather loose and sometimes misleading assessment but remember that all help run leads to untangling all buttons and so it is perfectly good approach and as the pc gets run on something he is awful darn sure he ought to be run on he is often very happy and cooperative in this whereas on dynamic assessment he is made intensely curious as he didnt know he was aberrated on what you found out in other words just asking the pc what is wrong with him getting it into general form that registers on the meter and running help ow or concept help on it is good reasonably fast processing it is better than assessing for just terminal that drops or for specific late terminal that drops as comment it should be noted that help is the last thing that folds up in the dwindling spiral of aberration about the first thing that folds up is interest but when it is gone there are still three buttons left on which the person can function the next one to go is communication this becomes contest of overts as in the arc breaky case anybody below this lives his or her life this way the next one to vanish is control so dont be surprised to find somebody around who does plenty of overts and who cant stand control who can yet be run on help and who can still function in life when interest communication control and help are gone thats it you havent got person left so beware people who are below help beware of them in living but in auditing when you cant get help to bite at all and if he can talk to you you can get help to bite you have nothing left but the cchs you can make it on them too but with tremendous investment in hours and when youve got the cchs flat then you can start running help but as i said above i have not yet been able to say the perfect way of running help i am still investigating it like mad and am giving you all the gen as it comes visible however have patience with i have learned that people not only have it twisted bit theyve got it shattered and thats the majority of people so were in there slugging away and were making clears and if i get hold of any faster ways to do youll be the first to get the gen lrhjscden l

dynamic assessment on help marilynn routsong has written the following on how to do dynamic assessment on help after observing demonstration by ron once you have preclear well presessioned you are going to enter into model seasion and run help and run help and run help now there are lots of ways of running help one extremely valuable way is to clear halp on the dynamics recalling the rule on running terminals not conditions you are going to run help on terminals which he cant help that have gone out of kilter on the dynamics in other words the pc conceived at some time that he was unable to help certain terminal and he has misaligned it on the dynamics he probably misplaced it to the dynamic on whioh he felt there was some sort of help or some such the misplacement will shake out in cognitions as it is being run to discover what terminal to run dynamic assessment as follows in doing dynamic assessment you are not actually auditing but looking for terminal to audit however you will be doing 2 way communioation and you will find things blowing off with 2 way comm so some auditing will occur if it does fine what you can resolve with 2 way communication by all means do so you are looking for the terminal that 1 does not resolve with 2 way communication 2 the pc can conceive way of helping the terminal and 3 the terminal is misplaced on the dynamics example youve assessed and ended up with fish an actual 5th dynamic terminal which the pc cannot conceive of being able to help and which the pc you discover on careful questioning really thinks of as sort of spiritual thing 7th dynamic sounds odd it is you will stop being surprised after running few on your own to do dynamic assessment you are going to use an emeter the lead in per the emeter is to ask the pc about help on the various dynamics in other words you put the pc on the emeter model session and ask him what he thinks about help on the first dynamic or self or whatever terminology is necessary to get tbie idea of the first dynamic across to the pc then you ask what thinks about help on the second dynamic appropriate terminology then the third fourth and so on across the dynamics as you are asking you observe the emeter you are looking for change in needle or tone arm pattern as clue to the misplaced terminal that he cannot help now note this rising needle means you have tripped the terminal you are looking for and have missed it gone past it and are now asking the wrong question to find the terminal again continue to go through the dynamics as above until you get the one that stops the rise question closely on terminals on this dynanic pertaining to help two way communication may clear it off if so fine or it may be lock on the one you are looking for in which case it would not quite fit the conditions of help conceivable and dynamically misplaced but there would be charge on it ie on pc the rising needle stopped on fourth dynamic pc was questioned on what he thought of fourth dynamic pc said people all races of people pc was asked about help on these people pc was then thinking about brown people and was thinking that help to brown people always turned out wrong betray however note in spite of change action on emeter and the fact that it stopped rise pc could conceive of trying to help brown people and it was on the right dynamic so you blow off on this what you can with 2 way communication make mental note that it is probably lock on the terminal you are looking for now once you have assessed the dynamic and in your questioning you have found help terminal that is dynamically misplaced you are going to run some form of help on the terminal in spite of the fact that the pc cant conceive of helping it example pc assessed anddiscovered to have sun on the eighth dynamic and he couldnt conceive of helping sun pc was run on think of helping sun alternated with think of not helping sun light form of help ow the usual form of how have you helped sun how have you not helped sun would have taxed the pc heavily to answer you may expect comm lags of course and also sense of relief when the pc gets an answer to say the least you will also find the pc being very curious and interested in the terminal you can expect somatics and the pc will run through bands of forgetfullness propitiation destroy etc all the way up to free not compulsive help on these terminals at this time you will find he has null needle on help on the terminal and the terminal will be on the correct dynamic if you are running very specific terminal ie pcs mother not mother the pc may run out of answers if so you assess per the emeter what the general terminal is for this specific one and run help on the general one until the needle is null for that general terminal at any rate on any specific terminal you run you also run the general terminal now you may find several terminals that fit the category you are looking for bad off case wili hang up on many or all dynamics then it beoomee matter of auditor judgement which one to run it would probably be best to run the one that shows the greatest action on the emeter lets say now that youve found terminal and run it on help until it is null by the way at this point you will find it on the correct dynamic the next thing you do is reassess the dynamics all over again as before you will find they all assess differently than before as you will have shifted the pcs bank in running the former terminal you find another terminal and run help on it in the event you round more than one terminal in the first assessment you do not go to second terminal without reassessment after running help flat null on terminal you always to complete reassessment in doing an assessment you do not question the pc on the dynamics with an auditing type question as you are not at this time trying to put the pc in session example you would not ask how could you help yourself this is an auditing question you could say how about help on the first dynamic or other terminology denoting it or what do you think about help on the first dynamic you just want the pc to be considering help on these dynamics got the idea of course once you have assessed the terminal you use an auditing command to run the terminal you asssess find terminal he cant conceive of helping that is dynamically misplaced run it null on help assess again find it is null reassess and so on until the pc is null on help across the dynamics and you cant get blip on the emeter on any sort of discussion of help on any dynamic or any terminal on any dynamic you would only do dynamic assessment on help once the pc has been well presessioned and the dynamic assessment and running help on the terminal as assessed would be run only in model session you are in effect running out failure to help failure to help is the basic of aber ration out of failure to help stems compulsive help overt acts help betray betrayals criminality so you see where you are taking your pc when you run out his failures to help yes you are going to clear him marilynn routsong org sec washington dc revised reissued as btb by flag mission 1234 approved by the
