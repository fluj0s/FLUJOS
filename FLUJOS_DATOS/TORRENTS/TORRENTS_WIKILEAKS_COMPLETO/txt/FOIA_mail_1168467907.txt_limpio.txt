jwillebrandifmgeomarde nathan bindoff nbindoffutaseduau zhenlin chen cdccccmagovcn melinda marquis marquisucaredu dear all agree with brians new bullet i still think we will get comments about what changes with storms if this is going to lead somewhere we dont want it and cause problems then the final part is likely best removed reading it again better if we say since the 1960s about is little vague back in cru on friday i may be able to get this hotel link to work tomorrow morning cheers phil dear all to headline should be kept simple with the detail in the bullets below so i prefer the simple version with aspects of extreme weather but i guess i am outvoted on that for the first part of the bullet on the westerlies i should prefer to revert to including the shift and also using the word strengthen rather than increase number such as the speed increases midlatitude westerly winds have shifted polewards and stengthened since about the 1960s the next part on the storms is problematic i agree with kevin that we should steer clear of the causal langauage susan had used however kevins words seemed to link shift in the storm tracks with an increase in the winds also as reviewed in 353 some papers suggest that in addition to poleward shift in the storm tracks and an increase in their average intensity there is decrease in the number of storms this is probably too much for the bullet so that less specific version may be required i think the whole bullet could be midlatitude westerly winds have shifted polewards and stengthened since about the 1960s with associated changes in storms 35 brian susan solomon wrote thanks brian and kevin for the help i agree with brian about reversing the order in the headline sentence but agree with kevin that separate bullet is most helpful i suggest we keep the headline short and simple and just leave the language we have about wind patterns being one of several things changing there otherwise it could be read as putting the circulation change into very high prominence in the headline which isnt quite the emphasis we were discussing i think i tried to combine the suggestions and to keep things clear enough that governments wont complain about lack of specifics if you look over the comments you will have seen that above all they will not tolerate vague language anybody who was in shanghai or any other ipcc meeting can attest to that so please please everybody help make things as specific as we can so my suggestion for the wind pattern bullet is midlatitude westerly wind speeds have increased in both hemispheres since about the 1960s this has caused storm tracks to move towards higher latitudes 36 regarding the headline that proceeds it can we consider something like this at continental or ocean basin scales numerous changes in climate have been observed these include sea ice extent precipitation amounts ocean salinity wind patterns and aspects of extreme weather or the frequency of heavy precipitation and of heat waves the intensity and duration of drought and the intensity of hurricanes and typhoons the ice sheets have been taken out of the above because they are moving to consolidated sea level subsection to deal with several requests for that is the new option after wind patterns too specific i am little concerned that we will be challenged on that we could keep what we have aspects of extreme weather equally i am worried that they will challenge the vagueness of extreme weather so that is why you see two alternatives here thoughts susan at 854 am 0700 1907 kevin trenberth wrote hi brian do you need the first part are you rewriting the headline on spm p 5 lines 3537 or are you adding an extra bullet on circulation i thought we agreed on the latter but your piece seems more like the former if we left the headline alone and added changes in largescale atmospheric circulation are apparent and in particular the midlatitude westerly winds have shifted polewards and strengthened altering storm tracks would be an alternative approach i think it is helpful to mention storm tracks but not be specific about how they have changed what do you think kevin brian hoskins wrote susan headline 2 i suggest the following at continental or ocean basin scale numerous changes in climate have been observed midlatitude westerly winds and the associated storms have shifted polewards and strengthened other climate changes include precipitation i have taken the suggestion form spm_327 to reverse the order of the first sentence the westerly winds sentence is essentially that in headline in the ts i should much prefer not to include the bracketed itallicised phrase on storms the evidence is less strong there is some evidence for reduced numbers of storms also but room to say that it was not headlined in the chapter or the ts best wishes brian kevin trenberth email trenbertucaredu mailtotrenbertucaredu climate analysis section
