from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to solominagolru subject fwd re fwd re wg1ar4ch06 ipcc last 2000 years data date thu jan 6 101110 2005 cc jtouarizonaedueystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno olga am sending this to get you in this loop re the discussion for slimming down the 2000 year section basically in this bit the decision is to reduce the glacier evidence to very much smaller piece coached in the sense of how the glacier evidence is problematic for interpreting precise and quantitative indications of the extent of regional or hemispheric warmth and even cold issues of translating tongue position or volume into specific temperature and precipitation forcing hence i am having to remove the stuff you sent and am asking if you could consider trying to write brief section dealing with the issues i raise i also attach some initial comments by david rind on the full first draft of the chapter sent round by eystein for consideration sorry about this but presumable as you suggested earlier some of this can go in the 10k bit you can shout at and the others later cheers keith xsender jtojtoinboxemailarizonaedu date wed 5 jan 2005 122447 0700 to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk from jonathan

think david likes good debates so the main thing is to consider his comments and respond appropriately although the first priority has to be on the zod text and display items maybe you can go back over his comments after the looming deadline and further discuss things with david and others for now just work away the biggest issue is how to handle forcing and simulations ie where to put different pieces in the chapter eystein and i will help the team work through this more soon but for now just proceed as you have been proceeding there is real merit to the concept that your section is about how climate varied over the last 2ka and what caused these variations the flip side is that we need to get clear vision of how this differs from what goes into the other sections eystein and i will work more on this asap your plan re glaciers is good thats tough one but it has to be boiled way down moreover my gut is to focus on the extent to which these complicated natural archives eg complicated by ppt change support or do not support the other proxy evidenceconclusions this is why i was thinking we might think about box and to include the lonnie perspective in it eg glaciers are now melting everywhere almost we know why they are not in those places in manner unprecedented in the last xxxx years make sense see what olga says and if needbe i can help focus that stuff more thanks peck hi peck et i am considering comments including davids re last 2000 years some are valid some are not will try to chop out bits but we need this consensus re the forcing and responses bit i am for keeping the forcings in as much as they relate to the specific model runs done and results for last 1000 years as i suspect that they will not be covered in the same way elsewhere david makes couple good points but extent to which forcings different or implementation perhaps need addressing here the basic agreement i mean is that the recent warming is generally unprecedented in these simulations it will take time and input from the tropical ice core coral people to do the regional stuff well i think the glaciological stuff is real problem other than just showing recent glacial states also covered elsewhere of course difficult to interpret any past records without modelling responses as in borehole data but this requires considerable space my executive decision would be to ask olga to try to write couple of papragraphs on limits of interpretation for inferring precisely timed global temperature changes what do others think i only heaved olgas stuff in at last moment rather than not include it but of course it needs considerable shortening the discussion of treering stuff is problematic because it requires papers to be published eg direct criticism of esper et we surely do not want to waste space here going into this esoteric topic all points on seasonality i agree with but the explicit stuff on mm re hockey stick where is this ie the bit about normalisation base affecting redness in reconstructions sounds nonsense to i have to consider the comments in detail but am happy for hard direction re space and focus if concensus is forcings and model results
