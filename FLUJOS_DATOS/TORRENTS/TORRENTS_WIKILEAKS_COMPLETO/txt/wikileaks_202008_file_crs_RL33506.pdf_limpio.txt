social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33506school choice under the esea programs and requirements summary the term school choice is often used to describe the practice of parents exercising role in selecting the schools their children attend the choices available to and made by families may be shaped by many factors including their preferences for education their place of residen ce their perceptions of school qua lity their financial resources their ch ildrens interests nd abilities and public policies this report examines the role of federal policy in the area of school choice specifically selected programs and requi rements of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 esea as amended by the child left behind act of 2001 nclba the esea contains numerous progra ms and requirements that may be considered as supporting or facilitating school choice equitable pa rticipation requirements in most esea programs ensu re that children whose parents enroll them in private schools are able to benefit from federal programs to similar extent as children enrolled in public schools progra ms such as the voluntary public school choice program the magnet schools prog ram the unsafe school choice option and public school choice under title ia help creat new public school options so that parents may have the oppor tunity to transfer their children to schools that are higherperforming or that offer academic programs that are not available at their childrens assigned public schools the p ublic charter schools programs support the opening of new charter schools to provide increased opportunities for school choice report cards on school performan ce and safety help keep parents informed as they evaluate the school choices they have made or may make in the future most esea programs are authorized through fy2008 and bills to amend and extend the esea are likely to be considered during the 110th congress as esea reathorization is considere d future directions for fe deral school choice policy may be topic of debate this could involve an examination of whether the existing number and mix of school choi ce programs is optimal and if not whether existing programs should be consolid ated or eliminated or whet her new programs should be created options for esea reauthoriza tion include expanding choice options in existing programs for example to incl ude public schools in neighboring districts or perhaps private schools authorizing new demonstration or targeted choice programs and combining existing programs into block grants this report

be shaped by many factors including their preferences for education their place of residence their perceptions of school quality their financial resources and their childrens interests and abilities public policies often can have significant effect in influenc ing the school choices available to parents for example public policies determine the structure of public elementary and secondary education finance systems sc hool catchment areas required education curricula and procedures for selecting or changing schools increasingly policies and programs specifically supportive of sc hool choice are being implemented in the states these include open enrollment pr ograms magnet schools charter schools controlled choice programs sc hool vouchers and tuition tax credits while state and local governments are primarily responsible for education policy in the united states the federal government thr ough several programs and re quirements also influences the ability of parents to

in the united states school choice is exer cised in many ways one of the most common is for parents to choose thei r childrens schools by moving to neighborhood or school catchment area served by particular school the national center for education sta tistics nces estimates th at as of the 20022003 school year for public elementary and secondary sch ool students in grades k12 26 of their families had moved to their neighborhood so that they would be eligible to attend their current school not all parents however ma have the same capacity or inclination to select their childrens sc hools by moving to different neighborhood for example greater percentages of parents who are college graduates 29 or who have attended gra duate or professional school 35 chose their childrens schools

table 362educational attainment is less than hi gh school education 22 high school education or its equivalent 24 or vocationaltechnical education or some college after high school 241 school quality is often closely associated with the socioeconomic status of neighborhood regardless of whether pa rents moved to their neighborhood specifically so their children could attend the local school or for other reasons often this is because neighborhoods are coterminous or nearly so with school catchment areas schools and leas that serve neighborhoods with predominately highincome and highly educated reside nts are often better funded and able to provide students with more educational resources than school s in neighborhoods with predominately lowincome and poorly educat ed residents th differences may arise as result of many factors including stronger tax bases and greater tax efficiency in wealthy leas which can lead to higher perpupil expenditures inequitable teacher allocati on and salary differentials between lowpoverty and high poverty schools within leas and differen ces in voluntary parental and community support for schools both monetary and non monetary some sc hool choice policies and programs have been created in respons to the practice of assigning students to schools based on their place of residence and as means of providing increased choices to families with limited resources and few options according to nces the percentage of children enrolled in assigned public schools has declined since the early 1990s decreasing from 799 in 1993 to 739 in 20032 meanwhile the percentage of child ren enrolled in public schools of choice public schools other than their assi gned school has increased from 110 in 1993 to 154 in 2003 the re mainder were reported as being enrolled in private schools greater percentages of children who are black 240 or whose parents have less than high school education 197 are enrolled in public schools of choice than children on average 154 nces also estimates that the parents of more than half 514 of all students in grades 112 reported having the opportunity to enroll their children in public school of choice among students whose parents could enroll them in public schools of choi ce greater proportions of students who are black 422 from families with income s of 150 00 or less 351 or whose parents educational attainment is less than high school 351 were enrolled in public schools of choice than were white students 224 students from families with incomes greater than 75000 231 or students whose parents

capitalism and freedom chicago university of chicago press 1962 5 see for example richard d kalenberg all together now crea ting middleclass schools through public school choice washington dc brookings institution press 2001highly educated families were comparatively more likely to be enrolled in private schools of choice than were other students there is clear consensus on the goal s to be achieved through school choice policies and programs nor the means toward achieving them some suggest that school choice policies should be adopted to provide parent s with increased liberty or freedom in choosing school or educational philosophy that they believe to be best suited to meeting the needs of their child and that the role of the government in assigning students to schools and regulati ng their operation should be drastically reduced proposals toward achieving th is end include providing parents with vouchers that they could apply toward th costs of enrolling their children in public or private schools of their choosing4 others suggest that school choice policies should contribute to and enhance equity by leveling the playing field or even tipping the scales in favor of children from disa dvantaged backgrounds with special needs or who are currently assigned to underpe rforming or poorquality schools so that they have access to range of schools of the qua lity enjoyed by their more advantaged peers some supporters of this appro ach call for limiting or controlling the choices available to individuals based on their socioeconomic characteristics with an aim toward achieving systems of schools in whic h each school reflects more or less the overall diversity of its local educational agency lea5 still others believe that school choice can be means of reformin g the current system of publicly funded elementary and secondary education th rough market competition by forcing underperforming schools to compete for student s according to this approach it is presumed that schools would either impr ove to meet the demands of parents and attract students or be forced to close if the schools are unable to attract students and funding the market approach is commonl associated with voucher programs and charter schools the various forms in which school choi ce can be provided often lead to both praise and condemnation the balance between support for and opposition to school choice can turn for instance on whether school choice is perceived as providing parents with increased opport unities to select desirable schools for their children or as interjecting another level of uncertainty into one of the most important decisions parents will make for their children th ere are also differing perceptions about whether increased opportunities for school choice would likely diminish perpetuate or exacerbate existing socioeconomic ine quities between schools and leas under the traditional policy of school assignment by catchment area parents are typically guaranteed the opportunity to enroll their children in their neighborhood public school this practice confers great bene fit to families that happen to reside in desirable school catchment ar eas public school choice pr ograms can be structured so that they provide families the opportun ity to enroll their children in schools perceived to be of higher quality irrespec tive of their place of residence options often include higherperforming traditi onal public schools magnet schools and charter schoolshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33506crs4 6 this is explained by tiebout theory which is often described as voting with your feet see charles m tiebout pure theory of local expenditures the journal of political economy vol 64 5 october 1956 pp 416424school choice policies can lead to incr eased numbers of students many of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds being afforded the opportunity to attend better performing or more desirable schools howeve r even when offered the opportunity not all students parents take an active role in selecting schools under choice programs often it is the children of parents who are most alert to and better able to evaluate school choice options who transfer schools under school choice programs school choice programs can also be per ceived as both liberating by providing families with greater opportun ities to choose from range of school options and as threatening by unsettling the practice of families being able to secure desired level of school quality or peer group composition by moving to particular lea or school catchment area6 allowing families to choose schools can lead to the most desirable schools becoming oversubscribed with ss desirable schools facing declining enrollment to address cerns about overcrowding many school choice programs employ procedures such as admitting st udents by lottery or managing school enrollment to achieve certain criteria for student diversity these can lead to increased anxiety about school choice in ge neral and disappoin tment when students are not admitted in addition to providing the opportunity for parents to choose their childrens schools certain types of sc hool choice programs might also permit some schools to select or otherwise limit the number or type of students they admit for example many private schools and some specialized public schools require students to meet competitive admissions requirements many charter schools also establish enrollment caps and become oversubscribed while selective or restrictive admission practices could lead to some students being enrolled in schools bettersuited to meeting their educational needs than thei r local public school they also might lead to some students for example the mo st difficulttoeducat students or those whose parents are least wellequipped to navigate admissions processes being relegated to schools of last resort school choice can be seen as an instrume nt of reform by providing parents with the option of withdrawing their child ren from underperforming or unresponsive schools and by threatening the status quo by forcing schools and leas to respond to the demands of parents nd market forces yet it also might be seen as false hope and questionable use of scarce resour ces if children are merely shuttled from one ineffective school to another at the ex pense of also providing them with the educational resources and attention necessary to succeed in learning school choice programs in which fundi ng follows individual children from one school or lea to another are viewed by some as the most promising reform proposals although some of these programs eg intradistrict choice interdistrict choice magnet schools and ch arter schools permit parents to transfer their children from one public school to anot her others such as school vouchers and certain taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33506crs5 7 during the period when the esea and precur sor legislation was being considered groups continuedbenefits also permit the us of public funds to support the enrollment of children in private schools publicly funded school choice programs that support dir ectly or indirectly the enrollment of students in private schools particularly religious ly affiliated schools are the most controversial concerns include whether public funds should be used to support the education of children in re ligious or other private schools whether public funding for private school educa tion effectively imp roves educational outcomes and whether control over public education funding and administration should be devolved from public agencies th ere are also concerns that by accepting public funding private schools might become subject to increased regulation and oversight which potentially could detract from their ability to offer educational programs distinguishable from public schools these concerns are often particularly acute with regard to religi ously affiliated school s and where the separation of church and state also becomes an issue school choice programs in which funding remains under public control have tended to be somewh at less controversial esea programs and requirements supportive of school choice the esea contains number of prog rams and requirements that may be considered as supporting school choice and these all operate so mewhat differently the equitable participati on requirements found in many programs ensure that children whose parents enroll them in privat schools are able to benefit from federal programs to similar extent as children enrolled in public schools programs such as the voluntary public school choice pr ogram the magnet schools program the unsafe school choice option and public sc hool choice requirements under title ia help create new public school options so that parents may have the opportunity to transfer their children to schools that ar higherperforming or that offer academic programs that are not available at thei r childrens assigned public schools some esea school choice options i nvoke aspects of market competition by giving parents the opportunity to select new schools for th eir children to attend while also putting pressure on underperforming schools to re form these include the public school choice requirements under title ia pub lic charter schools programs and the unsafe school choice option the remainder of this section iden tifies and describes esea programs and re quirements that are supportive of school choice equitable participation requirements under the esea many of the benefits provided to public school children and teachers must also be made available on an equitable basis to private school children teachers and other personnel equitable participation require ments also known as child benefit requirements have always been part of the esea and are the product of significant compromise that was inst rumental to the laws enactment in 19657httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33506crs6 7 continued such as the national catholic welfare conf erence and the national catholic education association were opposed to any legislatio n that would not provide support for the education of children in parochial schools while groups such as the national education association and protestants nd other americans united for the separation of church and state opposed legislation that would perm it aid to parochial schools compromise legislation permitted federal funds to be used for the benefit of students enrolled in private schools

aid for displaced students program into the esea demonstration or targeted choice programs federal support for school choice might be designed to dem onstrate the impact of school choice in discrete number of locati ons eg specific cities or limited number of places around the country such as lowperformin g leas or empowerment zones or to target choice in similarly limited fashion to particular kinds of students or schools the most frequent examples of this type of proposal have sought to expand choice options for special groups of students eg lowincome students victims of violence on school grounds or those in certain ty pes of schools eg schools characterized by poor levels of academic performance the dc school choice incentive act is an example of such program block grants block grants are federal grants that provide an exceptionally high degree of flexibility in the ways in which aid may be use d perhaps coupled with more specific requirements for accountability in terms of desired outcomes they are frequently proposed as the outcome for c onsolidation of seve ral existing federal education programs groups of existing pr ograms might be tran sformed into block grants in selected states under performance agreement proposals under block grant school choice might be an explicitly authorized use required use perhaps of some specified portion of funding or precondition for partic

proposals sufficiently broa d authority also might be provided under block grant programs to support sc hool choice without explicit mention
