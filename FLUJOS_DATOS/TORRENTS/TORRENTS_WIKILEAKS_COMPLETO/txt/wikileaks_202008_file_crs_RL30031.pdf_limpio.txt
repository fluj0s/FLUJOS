federal agencies and more kinds of agency activities at the same time recent proposals apply to smaller fraction of promulgated rules that ar major rather than to all final r ules all highlighted proposals mandate risk analysis when environmental regulations are promulgated and the specificity of propose d requirement s grew in each congress similarly all the highlighted bills with on exceptio n mandate analysis of the costs and benefits of some new rules and thes requirements have been elaborated in each consecutive congress most of the six highlighted bills would have established economic criteria fo r evaluating and ch oosing among regulatory options four of the six bills would have directed agencies to promulgate costeffective rules four bills also would hav advised or required that benefits of rule should justify its cost other propose d criteria included flexibility to regulated entities and governments net benefits incremental costs and benefits and costs however only the bills of the 104th congress explicitly would have prohibited promulgation of rule unless economi c criteria were met three of the highlight ed proposals would have directed the executive branch to coordina and oversee regulatory analyses by agencies but limited the time fo r review and required public disclosure of re levant communications with the regulatory agency and ot hers outside of the federal government two of these bills also would have required peer review to ensure the quality of agencies analytic work l highligh ted senate bills in the 104 and 105 congresses would have suspende dth th deadlines to fa cilitate agency compliance with analytic requirements for rules most of those bills would have required agencies to review existing major rules as well as newly promulga ted rules other provisions of bills in the 104 congress that wouldth have authorized citizen petitions nd judicial review or required riskbased budgeting were eliminated or modified in bills of the 105 congress th proposed mandates for risk analysis and costbenefit analysis of environmental rules became more complex after the 103 congress as they included mor erd exceptions and caveats for analytic

appendix to crs report 98618 environmental risk analysis review of public policy issues environmental risk and costbenefit analysis review of proposed legislative mandates 19931998 introduction the 103 104 and 105 congresses considered whether to require ris krd th th analysis of environmental regulatory proposal s by the us environmental protection1 agency epa and other agencies the house and sena each approved at least one such proposal see below but so far congress has enacted requirement fo r risk analysis that would change the way all environmental or health and safety regulations are developed it is not clear whe ther any comprehensive requirement for risk analysis of environmental regulations will be considered by the 106 congressth some believe that more recently evolved proposals lack most of the provisions that historica lly have been stumbling blocks to passage and they see gatherin g momentum for legislative mandate others see waning congressional interest at some point however congress is expected to debate again an overarching mandate for risk analysis of environmental regulations many believe tha t environ mental programs could be more efficient and flexible and less costly to th regulated community if epa considered the results of risk analysis others disagree arguing that s uch analyses use scarce agency resources delay rulemaking and force decisions to conform to the analytic results regardless of the quality of underlyin g data and models the issues and legislative options surrounding the use of ris k analysis at epa are described and analyzed in crs report 98618 environmenta l risk analysis review of public policy issues proposed mandates for risk analysis must be considered in the context f existing and perhaps past mandates as well as

background on environmental protection agency mandates httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30031crs2 this report describes and compares selected pro visions related to risk analysis in key legi slative proposals introduced from the 103 through the 105 congressesrd th including the johnston amendments to s 171 bill to confer cabinetlevel status on the environmental protection agency epa and to s 2019 bill to reauthorize the safe dri nking water act both as passed by the senate in the 103rd congress s 343 as repo rted by the committee on the judiciary in the 104 congressth divisions c and d of hr 9 as passed by the house in the 104 congressth s 981 as reported by the committee on governmental affairs in the 105th congress and s 1728 as introduced in the 105 congress th the comparison emphasizes differences among provisions related to risk analysis and costbenefit analysis and mechanisms such as judicia l review or peer review that make agencies more accountable for the quality of such analyses this report focuses on the general provisions of highlighted sections of bills that are l arge and complex specific provisions that modify the general requirements of the highlighted sections may be omitted key legislative proposals 103 congressrd more than dozen bills and am endments on environmental risk analysis were introduc ed in the 103rd congress one pl 103354 was enacted but it applie d only to the department of agr iculture nine other bills were passed by one chamber or reported by the committees of jurisdiction arguably the most influential risk proposals in the 103 congress were tword amendmen ts offered by senator j bennett johnston the original johnsto n amendm ent was the first risk legislation debated on the senate floor and it wa s adopted on april 29 1993 by vote of 95 to 3 the amendment was incorporated as section 123 in s 171 bill to raise the us environmental protection agenc epa to department cabinet status in the house proposal to similarly amend bill to elevate epa to the cabinet hr 3425 w as unsuccessful however the rule for consideration of the reported house bill was defeated on the floor reportedly in part because the rule would have prevented introduction of nongerman amendments such as one on risk and costbenefit analysis during the second session of the 103rd congress senat or johnston addressed some of the key concerns of members when he introduced revised version of hi s amendment it was adopted by the senate during the may 18 1994 floor debate on senatepassed s 2019 bill to mend and reauthorize the safe drinking water act the amendment became section 18 of the senatepassed bill section 15 s 2019httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30031crs3 as passed by the senate also incl uded revised version of bill originally introduced by senator moynihan s 110 that would have required epa to rank pollutio n sources based on risk these bills did not receive house action 104 congressth three riskrelated bills wer reported to the senate in the 104 congress sth 291 s 333 and s 343 in june 1995 they were merged and introduced on th senate floor by senator dole as substitute amendment for s 343 as reported by the committee on the judiciary after two weeks of debate and three failed votes t invoke cloture the senate turned to other issues the reported bill also known as the dole bill rather than the substitute amendment is summarized in this report the house republican contract with america promised that within the first 100 days of the 104th congress risk legislation would be introduced debated an d voted upon in the house t itle iii of the job creation and wage enhancement act of 1995 jcwea one of the draft bills distributed with the house republica n contract appeared to integrate several of the proposals related to risk analysis tha t saw action in the 103rd congress including slightly modified version of the original johnston amendment with coverage expanded beyond epa to include all federa l agencies that promulgate regulations concerning human health and safety or th environment the house amended and passed these provisions in hr 9 on march 3 1995 hr 9 as passed by the house contai ned four divisions through d each division co ntained the text of bill that had passed the house prior to consideration of hr 9 division c and division d had provisions relat ed to risk analysis division c contained the text of hr 926 the regulatory reform and relief act whil division d had the text of hr 1022 the risk assessment and costbenefit act of 1995 the senate did not act on hr 9 although the 104 congress adjourned without enacting comprehensiv eth requirements for risk analysis congress did enact riskbased provisions included in major legislation addressing drinking water pl 10 4182 and food safety pl 104 170 as well as requirements for economic analysis which for environmenta l regulations requires some analysis of risks as basis for calculating risk reductio n benefits pl 1044 pl 104121 title ii none of th mandates for risk analysis is compared in this report 105 congressth the 105 congress considered various proposals that would have mandatedth analysis of environmental risks but adjourned without enacting comprehensiv regulatory reform legislation or other provisions that would have increased use of risk analysis by epa the most comprehensive bill s 981 as reported by the senat committee on governme ntal affairs had bipartisan support s rept 105188 but also faced significant opposition the senate committee on governmental affair s reporte d s 981 the regulatory improvement act of 1998 amended on may 11 1998 but the bill received floor action the majority leader introduced riskhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30031crs4 president reagan issued the first explicit mandate for regulatory risk analysis i n2 january 1985 for more information about the requirements of executive orders see cr s report 98619 risk analysis backgrou nd on environmental protection agency mandates s 1728 like the johnston amendment to s 171 in the 103 congress targets onl y3 rd rules for which the primary purpose is to address health safety or environmental risks risk characterization is the final step in risk analysis which summarizes scientific4 judgments about the existence and overall magnitude that is the incidence of adverse effects given specified levels of exposure to hazard only version of s 981 s 1728 that would have applied only to proposed and final regulations to protect health safety or the environment with potential annual cost to the economy of 100 million or more comparison of selected provisions in general bills mandating risk analysis have become more complex an d detailed since 1993 table 2 s ummarizes selected provisions of key bills in the 103 rd 104 and 105 congresses beginning on page 11th th applicability from the 103 congress to the 104 congress proposed mandates for riskrd th analysis in the federal government have broadened in scope to encompass mor agencies the johnston amendments would have mand ated risk analysis only by epa while proposals in the 104 congress would have targeted all federal agencies th including the independent boards and commissions which unlike other federa l agencies have never been required by executive order to perform risk analysis r economic analysis for proposed or final rules 2 it is not clear whether bills in the 105 congress would have required moreth or fewer risk analyses and econo mic analyses by individual agencies than those in the 104 congress the johnston amendm ent to s 171 would have applied only to finalth rules that related to human health and safety or the environment while later legislation would have mandated analysis of proposed as well as final rules and with th exception of s 1728 in the 105 congress would have covered rules for an yth regulatory purpose 3 moreover although the proposed bills generally would have affected l substantive rulemaking that is rule development for all rules covered by the notice and comment requiremen ts of the administrative procedure act some proposals in the 104 and 105 congresses would have affected additional activities for exampleth th under s 343 risk analyse s not connected with rulemaking would have been affected as well as interpretive rules or rules of agency organization procedure or practice if they had altered or created rights or obligations of p ersons similarly s 981 would have affected risk characterizations in risk assessment documents and agenc decisions as well as regulatory proposals s 1728 would have required analyse s4 when significant substitution risk resulted from promulgation of rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30031crs5 the language used to define major rule is precise and meaningful note that the5 number of rules with an effect on the national conomy of certain monetary value is likely to be much greater than the number of rules with cost of equal valueproposals in the 104th and 105th congresses would hav applied only to rules with major or significant impact on the economy health the environment or public policy in contrast the johnston amendment to s 171 in the 103 congressrd applied regardless of the impact of rule under the johnston amendment to senate passed s 2019 analysis would be required only for rules with an annual effect on the economy of 100 million or more in the 10 4 congress s 343 and hr 9 divisionth c would have applied to rules with an estimated cost of 50 million or more in year while hr 9 division d would have affe cted rules likely to cost 25 million or more in the 105 congress both s 981 as reported and s 1728 as introduced wouldth have applied to rules likely to have gross annual cost of 100 million or more definitions of major rules and significant risk assessments also varied in the amount of discretion they woul d have provided to the office of management and budget omb to designate rules as major or nonmajor rules likely to result i n major increases in costs or prices or significant adverse effects on economic activity could have been designated as major under any of the legisla tive proposals in the 104th and 105 congresses the senate bills during this perio d also would have authorizedth 5 designation of rule as major due to its effects on health safety or the environment s 981 would have given omb the authority to require risk analysis to comply with proposed requirements all of the proposed mandates except the johnston amendments authorized exemptions for certain types of rules for example s 343 hr 9 divisions c and d s 981 and s 1728 would have provided for emergencies while s 343 hr 9 division d and s 981 would have exempted from risk analysis requirements rule s approving product labels eg for pha rmaceutical drugs s 171 and s 2019 would have required epa to perform the analyses or to report the reasons fo r noncompliance in the federal register and to congress analytic requirements all of the proposals would h ave required agencies to analyze risks when they are developing rules gene rally before the risk is addressed by the regulation relative to other risks that could be addressed and after risk is managed under the rule to estimate the incremental amount of risk reduction that might be achieved fo r example the johnston amendment to s 171 would have required analyses of risks to individuals addressed by the regulation the health and environmental effects of the regulation and risks addressed compared to other risks s 2019 added requirement to analyze risks to significant subpopulations disproportionately exposed or particularly sensitive it also explicitly require d qualitative analysis as well as quantitative analysis of risks httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30031crs6 the unfunded mandates reform act pl 1044 requires federal agencies to analyze6 costs and benefits of all proposed and final rules with an expected cost of 100 million r morehr 9 and s 343 as reported in the 104 congress would have include dth requirements to analyze uncertainties assumptions the distribution of risk in population that is who is at risk sub stitution risks risks resulting from regulation and the likelihood that exposure to risks would occur all these analytic requirements were included in s 981 105th congress beginning in the 104 congress proposals specified certain principles of riskth analysis to which covered agency analyses and presentations of results would b required to conform the bills proposed various means of estimating and the n expressing risk in the 104 congress agencies would have been directed to us eth plausible or unbiased models and to presen t best estimate s 981 would have mandated weight of scientific evidence approach and expression of central and high end risk estimate and s 1728 would have required public input and statement of the most plausible risk estimates analysis of costs and benefits would have been mandated by all the highlighted bills except the bill introduced by senator lott late in the 105 congress but th eth bills differed in how they would have directed agencies to relate costs and benefits6 both versions of the johnston amendments 103 congress and s 343 104rd th congress would have required consideration of whether benefits would justify costs s 343 and s 981 105 congress would have mandated analysis of net benefit sth explicitly s 2019 and s 981 in the 1 05 congress also would have required costth effectiveness analysis additional elements of economic analysis were added to bills in the 104th congress both s 343 and hr 9 would have required analysis of the distribution of costs and benefits incremental co sts and benefits effects on small businesses and the cumulative cost to the regulated community and comparison of all these measures for all speci fied alternatives to the proposed or final rule s 343 but not hr 9 would have directed epa to assess net benefits net costs and net effects on small businesses hr 9 would have mandated analysis of whether benefits would exceed costs s 981 in the 105 congress would have added requirements to analyze theth feasibility of using marketbased mechanisms the flexibility pro vided to local and state governments and the regulated community and the quality of information s 981 like s 343 before it specified certain principles of economic analysis regulatory decision criteria except for s 1728 105 congress all of the highlighted bills would hav eth established criteria for evaluating and choosing among regulatory options based on analytic results excluding s 1728 the bills would hav established economic criteria which are summarized in table 1 both johnston amendments s 343 and s 98 1 would have directed epa to consider whether benefits would justify costs th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30031crs7 the unfunded mandates reform act pl 1044 enacted by the 104 congres s7 th requires federal agencies except for independent regulatory boards and commissions t promulgate the alterna tive that is least costly most costeffective or least burdensome or to explain why such an alternative was not adoptedjohnston amendment to s 2019 also would have required rule to be most cost effective s 343 would have required rule to be most costeffective or leastcost s 981 wou ld have required determination as to whether the rule was most cost effective or provided the greatest net benefits finally hr 9 would have mandated rules that were most costeffective or provided more flexibility and that d incremen tal benefits likely to justify and be reasonably related to the incrementa l costs 7 table 1 decision criteria employed by key proposals in the 103 rd 104 and 105

incremental benefits effect on existing law arguably the highlighted bills of the 103 and 105 congresses would trd th have superseded other provisions of federal law such as the clean air act or th safe drinking water act with regard to how epa should weigh costs and risks in developi ng regulations neither would they have authorized epa to employ risk based or economic criteria when implementing other statutes some argued nevertheless this apparent neutrality with respect to existing law was made mor explicit as time passed the amendment to s 2019 was more explicit than that to s 171 and in the 105 congress s 981 provided still greater assurance that it sth requirements would apply only to the extent that they were not inconsistent wit h existing statutes however the neutrality of proposed requirements relative t existing statutory requirements never was stated absolu tely clearly according to some observers s 1728 would not have established decision criteria so its analyti c requirement s apparently would not have conflicted with existing legal requirements in contrast s 343 explicitly would have prohibited promulgation of rul unless decision criteria were met that is benefits justified costs and the rule was thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30031crs8 most costeffective or leastcost alternative similarly hr 9 division d woul d have super seded provisions of existing laws and prohibited promulgation of major rule unless incremental benefits were lik ely to justify and be reasonably related to the incremental costs and alternatives were either less costeffective or provided s flexibility to regulated entities or local or state governments coordination and quality control execut ive oversight omb has been overseeing costbenefit analyses f regulations under the authority of executive orders since president reagan issue d executive order 12291 in 1981 in contrast omb has clear authority to oversee risk analyses except to the extent that they underlie benefit analyses for regulations under review three of the bills highlighted in this report s 343 hr 9 and s 981 would have authorized executive branch oversight of agencies regulatory analyses an d mandated issuance of guidance for the conduct of economic and risk analyses two hr 9 and s 981 would have assigned these tasks to omb only economi c analyses of regulations would have been reviewed under hr 9 but omb woul d have been required to approve or comment on final costbenefit analysis prior t promulgation of major rule s 9 81 would have authorized omb oversight for risk assessments and peer review as well as economic analyses hr 9 would hav required omb to evaluate federal agencies rulemaking procedures while s 98 1 would have directed omb to evaluate agencies costbenefit and risk analyse s periodically as check on the new statutory authority of omb to oversee regulator proposals s 981 and hr 9 would have limited the time for omb review to 90 days while s 343 permitted only 30 days but l three bills would have allowed the period to be extended in addition s 981 would have required public disclosure of an changes to regulatory proposals that resulted from the review and written record of relevant contacts omb had with the regulatory agency and persons outside th executiv branch hr 9 also required written record of relevant contacts mad with persons outside the agency peer review peer review was another mechanism proposed to ensure the quality of agencies analytic work and the scientific soundness of decisions s 343 in the 104 congress relied most heavily on peer review as it would have requiredth peer review of agencies analyses for major new rules reviews of analyses fo r existing rules risk estimates supporting database entries and cleanup plans fo r hazardous waste sites also in the 104 congress hr 9 would have required peerth review of analyses for major rules worth at least 100 million and of other analyses designated by omb in the 105 congress s 981 would have required peer reviewth only for major rules neither the johnston amendments in the 103 congress nor srd 1728 in the 105 had any provision regarding peer review or oversight by th eth executive branch of government httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30031crs9 other provisions deadlines statutory and judicial deadlines for promulgation of rules wer treated in various ways by the bills of interest the original johnston amendment was silent on the subject of deadlines risk analysis requiremen ts imposed by the johnston amendment to s 2019 and hr 9 would have been waived or deferred when there was conflicting statutory or judicial deadline in contrast s 343 s 981 and s 1728 would have suspended deadlines to allow compliance with requirements fo r regulatory analysis review of rules only s 343 hr 9 and s 981 would have require d agencies to r eview existing major rules under s 343 all existing rules would have terminated in 7 years unless they were reviewed by the administering agency citizen petitions bills in the 104 congress would have authorized citizenth petitions for judicial review of agency compliance with analytic requirements i n addition s 343 would have provided broad authority for citizen petitions to forc agencies to examine and redesign rules so that they conformed to decision criteria bills in the 103 and 105 congresses did not provide for citizen petitions rd th judicial review proposals differed widely in their treatment of judicia l review the johnston amendments in the 103 congress would not have subjectedrd either the compliance of agencies with analytic requirements nor the analyse s themselves to judicial review in the 104 congress s 343 as reported would have subjected all agencyth decisions regarding rules orders petitions licenses sanctions or relief to judicia l review and it would have established new set of standards for judicial review including that th ere is substantial support in the rulemaking file for the factual basis of agency actions hr 9 division d would have dire cted courts to consider agency actions unlawful solely on the basis of significant risk characterization or ris k analysis in the rulemaking recor d that did not substantially comply with the proposed requirements in the 105 congress s 981 as reported would have permitted review fth agency compliance with analytic requirements only in connection with review of final agency action s 1728 also would have subjected to judicial review agenc decisions about which rules are major and agency risk analyses in connection wit h review of final agency action bot h bills in the 105 congress would have requiredth only that the rule not be arbitrary or capricious or an abuse of discretion r unsupported by bstantial evidence where that standard otherwise was provided by law that the agency performed requisite analyses and under s 1728 tha t designation of rule not be clearly and convincingly erroneous riskbased priorities several of the highlighted bills would have promoted use of analytic results to prioritize regulatory efforts within agencies s 343 would have required agencies to reflect ris kbased priorities in annual budget requests hr 9 would have required that relative risks and costeffective risk reduction strategies be identified within regulatory programs and s 981 would have required agencies to inform annual budgets and strategic plans and performance plans with the results ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30031crs10 however s 2019 section 15 would require report of the relative risk of variou s8 sources of pollution and of the costs and benefits of risk reduction strategiesa study by scientific institution of relative risks and strategies for reducing them s 1728 in the 105 congress had comparable provision and the johnsto nth amendments in the 103 congress did not mention the setting of priorities rd 8 conclusion comparison of selected provisions of key legislative proposals mandatin g risk analysis and costbenefit analysis of environmental regulations indicates tha t proposals broadened in scope to enco mpass more federal agencies and more kinds of agency activities at the same time the more recent proposals apply to smalle r fraction of promulgated rule s that are major often defined as rule with an annual cost of at least 100 million most of th highlighted bills would have required economic analysis as well as risk analysis and would have established economic criteria for choosing amon g regulatory options the preferred option typically was the most costeffectiv alternati ve and one that would have produced benefits justifying costs suc h requirements became more specific and inc reased in number between 1993 and 1998 proposals also became more complex as legislators tried to ensure tha t unintended adverse consequences of an overarching mandate eg delaye d rulemaking in emergencies would be avoided thus ea ch congress considered more exceptions and caveats for analytic requirements and decision rules at the same time perhaps to compensa proposals included more mechanisms to ensure the quality of analyses compared to key proposals in the 104 congress the mor eth comprehensive proposal in the 105 congress s 981 as reported would hav eth reduced reliance on judicial review while leaning more heavily on peer review an d executive oversight of analyses executive branch revie ws of agencies rules generally would have been limited to 90 days and the substance of communications betwee n omb and the regulatory agency or between omb and anyone outside of government about rules under review would have had to be disclosed to the publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30031crs11 because the report omits specific provisions that
