current services baseline estimates and baseline estimates in general are not meant to be predictions of future budget outcomes but inst ead are designed to provide neutral measure against which to compare proposed policy changes in general they project current policy which includes future changes in law over the next 5 to 10 years their construction generally follows instructions provided in the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 dca nd the congressional control and impoundment act of 1974the budget for fiscal year 2007 background and analysis presidents submit their budget proposals fo r the upcoming fiscal year fy early in each calendar year the bush admin istration released its fy2007 budget the budget of the u s government fi scal year 2007 on february 6 2006 the multiple volumes contained both general and specific descriptions of the administrations policy proposals and ex pectations for the budget for fy2006 through fy2011 it included section on l ongterm fiscal issues facing the nation and provided limited information on the revenue and mandatory spending changes after 2011 the full set of budget documents budget appendix analytical perspectives historical tables among several other supplemental budget documents contained extensive and detailed budget information including estimates of the budget without the proposed policy changes current service baseline estimates historical budget data detailed budget authority outlay and receipt data selected analysis of specific budget rela ted topics and the administrations economic forecast1 in addition to their presentation of the administrations proposals the budget documents are an annual referen ce source for federal budget information including enacted appropriations the administrations annual budget sub mission is followed by congressional action on the budget this usually includes the annual budget resolution appropriations and possibly reconciliation bill or bills as required by the budget resolution over the course of delibera tion on the budget the administration often revises its original proposals as it inter acts with congress and as conditions change in the economy and the world the current situation the final budget estimates for fy2007 from the administration in the mid session review for fy2008 july 11 2007 included further reductions in the expected deficit to 205 billion from 244 b illion in february 2007 and continued unexpected increases in receipts cbos july monthly budget report indicated thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33282crs2 the deficit may be closer to 150 billion than 200 billion its midyear budget report will be released later in august earlier in 2007 congress adopted s upplemental appropriations for fy2007 congress responded to president bushs request for additional funding for the ongoing military conflicts and few othe r needs by passing 124 billion funding bill hr 1591 the house passed the c onference report on april 25 with the senate following on april 26 2007 hrep t 110107 the bill included about 100 billion in military funding nd approximately 24 billion in domestic spending much of which the president had not requested it also included timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq be ginning later this year the president had threatened veto because of the withdrawal timetable and the additional spending as the bill was taking shape in the house and senate on may 1 the president vetoed the bill the house failed to override the veto on may 2 the house passed second supplementa l appropriations bill hr 2206 on may 10 2007 it contained the funding for the war without the withdrawal deadline along with most of the additional domestic spending the senate amended the bill and passed it on may 17 discu ssions between the house nd senate led to further changes these were incorporated into the bill which congress passed on may 24 2007 the president signed the bill on may 25 pl 11028 budget totals table 1 below contains budget estimates for fy2007 from the cbo the administration the office of manage ment and budget omb and congress differences in totals can result from di ffering underlying economic technical and budgetestimating assumptions and technique s as well as differences in policy assumptions the dollar differences in the budget outlook resulting from underlying policy differences in the presidents pr oposals or those from congress are often relatively small for the upcoming fiscal ear compared to the budget as whole these small differences however may grow over time sometimes substantially potentially producing widely divergent future budget paths budget estimates generally should be expected to change over time from those originally proposed or estimated by the president cbo or congress budget estimates and proposals cbos first budget report for fy2007 the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 20072016 january 2006 contained ba seline and economic estimates and projections for fy 2006 thr ough fy2016 the report estimated an fy2007 baseline deficit of 270 billi on smaller than the estima ted fy2006 baseline deficit of 337 billion by fy2011 the cbo base line deficit estimate had fallen to 114 billion the next year fy2012 the increased receipts from the scheduled in current law expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cu ts produced small baseline surplus estimate of 38 billion the small surplus estimates never exceeding 75 billion or 04 of gdp persisted through fy2016httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33282crs3 under the baseline assumptions cbo incr eases discretionary spending at the rate of inflation assumes that the 2001 nd 2003 tax cuts fully expire after 2010 as required under current law nd allows the recently laps ed alternative minimum tax amt relief to remain lapsed the effects of these assumptions raise receipts in the nearterm and increase receipts by subs tantial amounts after fy2010 when most of the tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 expire under cu rrent law the declining deficit and appearance of small surpluses over the 10 years in the cbo baseline are largely explained by the baseline construction rules that cbo follows the results likely understate the nearterm future size nd persistence of the deficit as cbo acknowledges in its report table 1

fiveyear cumulative deficit by 317 billion and the 10year cumu lative deficit by 14 trillion president bushs fy2007 budget february 2006 called for extending and making permanent most of the tax cu ts adopted in 2001 and 2003 as well as extending other expiring tax provisions the budget showed extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts would reduce receipts by an estimated 179 billion between fy2007 and fy2011 and by an estimated 14 tr illion between fy2007 and fy2016 these estimates do not include the resulting higher debtservice costs resulting from the change2 the administrations total recei pt proposals would reduce fiveyear receipts by 280 billion and 10year recei pts by 17 trillion cumulative receipts over the 5 and 10year periods to tal approximately 13823 billion and 32496 billion respectively without the proposed changes the administrations budget provided limited amount of information for the years beyond fy2011 the budget did incl ude estimates of the cumulative proposed revenue changes and proposed mandatory spending changes for the periods fy2007 through fy2011 and fy2007 through fy2016 but these projections contained information for the individual years afte r fy2010 nor were estimates provided for other components of the budget or for budget totals beyond fy2011 although not included in the budget doc uments it was made available on february 9 2006 the president proposed th elimination of the reduction in or the reform of approximately 141 discretionary programs the administration reports that these changes would produce an estimated 20 billion in budget authority not outlay savings in fy2007 compared to fy2006 how much these savings would affect the fy2007 defic it was left unclear the fy2007 budget also proposed reductions mostly in the rates of increase in mandatory programs over the next five years the proposed net savings totaled 71 billion over five years but this is onl partial accounting of the presidents mandatory proposals the

for the remaining years projected through fy2011 cbo exte nded its reestimates through fy2016 showing the deficit under the administrations policies growing slightly as percentage of gdp from fy2012 through fy2016 the administration provided its annual midsession review for the fy2007 budget msr on july 11 2006 the report updated the administrations budget and economic estimates for fy2006 through fy2011 for fy2007 the changes from the february budget estimates were relatively small the deficit fell by 42 to 339 billion receipts grew by 18 to 2459 b illion and outlays grew by 10 to 2798 billion as shares of gdp the estim ates of gdp also were revised the deficit fell from 26 of gdp in february 2006 to 24 of gdp in july receipts fell by 01 of gdp to 176 of gdp outlays remained unchanged at 201 of gdp the somewhat improved shortterm budg et outlook in the administrations msr had little effect on the longterm budg et imbalance facing the country the rapid growth in receipts then expected in fy2006 was not necessarily going to continue in future years the administrations assumption about future spending restraint is also not assured even if the administrations shortterm assumptions prove correct without substantial changes to the programs that will expand rapidly as the baby boom retires or other large policy changes occur the longterm budget imbalance remained and remains in place cbos august 2006 release of the budget and economic outlook an update also showed fairly drama tic improvement in the defi cit for fy2006 but showed little change for the other years from its earlie r budget reports january and march 2006 the adoption of fy2006 supplemental ppropriation in the spring of 2006 which cbo under the baseline rules it follo ws includes in its baseline estimates for subsequent years generated much of the baseline outlay estimate increase for fy2007 in the update revisions showing higher receipts in fy2007 limited the effect of the increased outlays on the deficit with the combined changes raising the deficit by 21 billion above cb march 2006 ba seline estimate cbos august revisions showed slightly worsened longterm budget outlook under its baseline assumptions even with the improved expectations for fy2006 the cumulative deficit in cbos augu st baseline 345 tr illion was 13 trillion larger than cbos march ba seline estimates 332 trillion the initial fy2008 budget documents from cbo and omb in january and february 2007 respectively contained an improved outlook for the fy2007 budget cbos report the budget and economic outlook fy20082017 had fy2007 baseline deficit estimate of 172 billion 13 of gdp over 100 billion belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33282crs6 3 according to cbos january 2007 budget report outlays for fy2007 fell by 86 billion and receipts increased by 28 billion since cbos and ombs summer 2006 respective budget reports about half of the revenue changes and 60 of the outlay changes were technical in nature having nothing to do with policy changes adopted during the fall of 2006 4 some of the underlying components of budget estimates are known with some certainty demographics are one known component in the next decade the expected retirements in the baby boom generation will rapidly increa the spending for medicare and social security as well as other federal activities benef itting the elderly

the administr ations proposals and reestimates of cbos janua ry 2007 baseline estimates cbo estimated that the fy2007 deficit would be 214 billion using the presidents policy proposals 30 billion smaller than ombs february 2007 estimate cbos base line deficit estimate for fy2007 grew slightly by 5 billion from its january 2007 estimate to 177 billion the presidents fy2008 midsession review july 11 2007 included updated estimates for fy2007 showing continuing d ecline in the expected deficit the administration attributed the fall to higherthanexpected receipts which were primarily due to higher corporate income tax and excise tax collections the faster thanexpected growth in receipts tapers off in the estimates for subsequent years the budget report hinted that the actual defic it for fy2007 could be lower than indicated in the report subsequent cbo mont hly budget report from july 2007 expected the deficit to be closer to 150 billion fo r fy2007 the improvements in the deficit outlook and in receipts are not the result of policy changes but mostly the result of changes in economic assumptions and technical changes in the estimates uncertainty in budget projections all budget estimates and proj ections are inherently uncertain their dependence on assumptions that are themselves subject to substantial variation over short time periods makes budget estimate s and projections susceptib to fairly rapid and dramatic changes4 small changes in economic conditions particularly the rate of gdp growth from those assumed in the timates can produce large changes in the budget estimates according to cbo pe rsistent 01 increase in the real growth rate of gdp would reduce the deficit i ncluding interest costs by 58 billion cumulatively over fiveyear period nd by 272 billion over the next 10 years reductions in the rate of gdp growth w ould increase the deficit by similar amounts over the same time periods policy changes that are likely such as supplemental appropriations for operations in iraq and afghanistan but which are not included inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33282crs7 cbos baseline can also change the budg et outlook both for the current budget year and for future years the presidents fy2007 budget included chapter in the analytical perspectives volume titled comparison of actual to estimated totals the chapter examined the causes of the changes from the initial budget estimates for fy2005 february 2004 through the actual results fo r that year omb extended its analysis to find upper and lower bounds to the deficit or surplus timates over fiveyear period based on data going back to fy1982 it found that the upper and lower bounds ranged over 11 trillion at the end of fiveyear period in other words the administrations defic it estimate for fy2011 205 billion could range from surplus of approximately 300 billion to deficit of approxima tely 700 billion with 90 chance of the budget balance falling between those two numbers even the administrations deficit timate for fy2007 has 90 chance of being as small as 86 billion or as large as 622 billion budget projections are dependent on the underlying assumptions about the direction of the economy expected po licy and policy changes and how these interact along with other factors such as changing demographics that affect the budget any deviation from the assumptions used in the budget estimates such as faster or slower economic growth higher or lower inflation differences from the expected or proposed spending and tax policies or changes in the technical components of the budget models can have substantial effects on the budget estimates and projections particularly over longer periods budget action congressional committees began hearings on the presidents fy2007

alternative scenarios for spending including the assumption that there is phasedown in activities in iraq and afghanistan over number of years that total discretionary spending increases at the rate of nominal gdp growth rather than the rate of inflation and includi ng higher interest costs from the larger deficits and debt resulting from these changes and from extending the tax cuts outlays would fall from 201 of gdp in fy2007 to 200 of gdp in fy2011 before rising to 212 of gdp in fy2016 the presidents budget indicated that department of defe nse dod spending would increase by 69 from

as the starting point which was when it first articulated this goal16 the fy2007 budget showed the deficit falling below 2 of gdp by fy2008 and to 14 of gdp in fy2009 achieving the administrations deficit reduction goals would require during the five years in the budget strict limits on the growth in domestic discretionary spending if not actual reductions slowing in the growth rate of some entitlements and letting amt relief lapse after 2007 so of the presidents proposals would increase spending or reduce receipts requiring larger spending reductions in other areas of the budget to

fiscal year 2007 february 2006 p 18the longer run both omb and cbo agree that over l onger time period one beginning in the next decade and lasting for decades demo graphic pressure will so badly distort current policies as to make them unsusta inable the future under current policies will lead to growing and persistent deficits cbo report on the longterm budget outlook december 2005 states over the next halfcentury the united states will confront the challenge of conducting its fiscal policy in the face of the retirement of the babyboom generation under current policies the aging of the population is likely to combine with rapidly rising health care costs to create an evergrowing demand for resources to finance federal spending for mandatory programs such as medicare medicaid and social security attaining fiscal stability in the coming decades will probably require substantial reductions in the projected growth of spending and perhaps also si zable increase in taxes as share of the economy18 the administration indicated similar c oncerns about the outlook for the budget over the long term in the presidents fy2007 budget february 2006 the longterm picture presents major challenge due to the expected growth in spending for major entitlement programs in only two years the leading edge of the baby boom generation will become eligible for early retirement under social security in 5 years these retirees will be eligible for medicare the budgetary effects will be muted at first but if we do not take action soon to reform both social security and medicare the coming demographic bulge will drive federal spending to unprecedented levels and th reaten the nations future prosperity plausible amount of cuts to discreti onary programs or tax increases can help us avert this major fiscal challenge by 2070 if we do not reform entitlement programs to slow their growth the rate of taxation on the overall economy would need to be more than doubled19 the shortterm budget outlook can change when it is buffeted by all types of unexpected events such as the hurricanes last year or deteriorating economic conditions the longterm budget outlook although susceptible to these types of events will largely be determined by the interplay of current policy and demographics the retirement of the ba by boom generation rapidly expanding the population eligible for fede ral programs serving the elderly will put enormous pressure on the federal budget without policy changes these programs could overwhelm the rest of the budget not only will the programs them selves be stressed but their growth would be likely to impede the governments ability to meet its obligations and the ability of the econom to provide the resources needed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33282crs23
