congress summary reforming the enforcement of immigrati on law is core component of the recommendations made by the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states also known as the 911 co mmission the 19 hijackers responsible for the 911 attacks were foreign nationals many of whom were able to obtain visas to enter the united states through the use of forged documents incomplete intelligence and screening enabled many of the hijackers to enter the united states despite flaws in their entry documents or suspicions regarding their past associations according to the commission up to 15 of the hijackers could have been intercepted or deported through more diligent enforcement of immigration laws the 911 commissions immigrationrelated recommendations focused primarily on targeting terrorist travel th rough an intelligence and security strategy based on reliable identification systems and effective integrated informationsharing as congress has considered these reco mmendations however possible legislative responses have broadened to include significant and possibly farreaching changes in the substantive law governing immigration and how that law is enforced both at the border and in the interior of the united states in response to the commissions reco mmendations several major bills were introduced proposing significant revisions to us immigration law and policy the two notable bills that would re vise immigrati on laws were hr 10 the 911 recommendations implementation act as amended introduced by the speaker of the house of representatives dennis

2004911 commission legislative action concerning us immigration law and policy in the 108th congress introduction the july 2004 report of the national co mmission on terrorist attacks upon the united states also known as the 911 commi ssion concluded that the key officials responsible for determining alien admi ssions consular officers abroad and immigration inspectors in the united states were not considered full partners in counterterrorism efforts prior to sept ember 11 2001 and as result opportunities to intercept the september 11 terrorists were missed1 the 911 commission contended that there were opportunities for intellig ence and law enforcement to exploit qaedas travel vulnerabilities the report went on to state considered collectively the 911 hijackers included known qaeda operatives who could have been watchlisted presented fraudulent passports presented passports with suspic ious indicators of extremism made detectable false statem ents on visa applications made false statements to border officials to gain entry into the united states and violated immigration laws while in the united states2 the 911 commission issued several reco mmendations that directly pertain to immigration law and policy these recommendations are targeting travel is at least as powerful weapon against terrorists as targeting their money the united states should combine intelligence operations and law enforcement in strategy to intercept terrorists find terrorist travel facilitators and constrain terrorist mobility the us border security system s hould be integrated into larger network of screening points that includes our transportation system and access to vital facilities such as nuclear reactors httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32616crs2 3 for discussion of these recommendations

including the usa patriot act pl 10756 and the enhanced border securi ty and visa reform act of 2002 pl 107173 to encourage the more expeditious development of an automated entry and exit data system

and naturalization service v st cyr 533 us 289 2001 7 idgrounds for alien exclusion removal and relief from removal primary area of difference between h ousepassed and sena tepassed versions of s 2845 concerned grounds for alien excl usion removal and relief from removal as only the housepassed bill dealt extensively with these areas the immigration and nationality act ina establishes admission and removal criteria for all foreign nationals seeking to enter andor remain in the united states and also provides certain discretionary and non discretionary forms of relief from removal such as granting asylum or withholding removal to country where an alien is likely to face serious persecution or torture starting with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 pl 100690 and continuing through the antiterro rism and effective death penalty act of 1996 pl 104132 and the iirira congress has expanded the grounds of inadmissibility and deportation and the use of expedited removal while it has also restricted relief from removal and judi cial review of removal decisions subsequently the supreme cour t has held that there is strong presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative actions and therefore in the absence of clear statement of congressional intent to repeal habeas corpus jurisdiction over removal related matters such review is still considered available6 furthermore the court found that eliminating any judicial review including habeas review without any substitute form of review for pure questions of law would raise serious constitutional questions7 exclusion and removal after the 911 terrorist attacks congress further expanded the terrorism grounds for in admissibility removal and mandatory detention in the usa patriot act in re sponse to concerns that loopholes and inadequacies in the immigration laws were contributing to the ability of terrorists and their accomplices to travel to and remain in the united states housepassed s 2845 sought to broaden the scope of terrorrelated activity ma king an alien inadmissible or deportable and limit the availability of relief from removal in certain circumstances thes proposals included barring aliens who are engaged or have engaged in terrorist activity from having their removal withheld except for in cases of aliens seeking relief under regulations imp lementing the convention against torture and also denying such relief to aliens found by the attorney general to have enga ged in other terrorrelated activity ie incitement or espousal of terrorist activities housepassed expanding grounds making of terrorre lated activity ma king an alien inadmissible and deportable in cluding receiving militarytype training by or on behalf of an or ganization designated as terrorist organization at the time of training housepassed expanding the definitions of engaged in terrorist activity andterrorist organization which ar used to describe certain grounds for inadmissibility and deportability to include broader scope ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32616crs6 conduct relating to providi ng money or material support to terrorist organization housepassed providing for the inadmissibility and removability of aliens whohave committed ordered assisted incited or otherwise participated in acts of genocide torture or extrajudicial killings abroad or who have committed severe violations of religious freedom while serving as foreign government official housepassed clarifying that an alien may be re moved to his country of citizenship birth or residence unless such

immediate removal without further h earing or review by increasing the prior continuous us physical presence required for exemption from such removal from two years to five years housepassed providing that an alien currently being prosecuted for crime or serving criminal sentence is not subject to immediate removal presumably to ensure effective exercise of us criminal jurisdiction housepassed eliminating habeas review and othe r nondirect judici review for certain removal decisions and clarifying that in all immigration provisions restricting judicial re view such restrictions include habeas and other nondirect review but that such restrictions do not preclude federal appellate court consideration of constitutional claims or other purely legal issues raised in accordance with current statutory procedures housepassed and precluding courts from staying removal order pending judicial review unless the alien shows by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of such orde r is prohibited as matter of law housepassed asylum and other forms of relief from removal the united states has long held to the principle that it will not return foreign national to c ountry where his life or freedom would be th reatened aliens seeking asylum must demonstrate wellfounded fear that if returned home th ey will be persecuted based upon one of five characteristics race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opini on in addition regu lations implementing the united nations convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment her eafter referred to as torture convention prohibit the return of any person to c ountry where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being to rtured proposals to modify asylum and other forms of relief from removal include found in housepassed and senatepasse d versions of s 2845 included establishing more stringent standards for asylum applicants accused by their home countries of being i nvolved in terrorist or guerrilla related activities by requiring these applicants to demonstrate

immigration terrorist grounds for exclusion of aliens crs report rl32276 the convention against torture overview of us impl ementation policy concerning the removal of aliens and crs report rl32621 us immigration policy on asylum seekers security of personal identification documents there has been some concern that the acquisition of us identification documents by terrorist aliens may facilitate their ability to engage in terrorist activities the 911 commission noted that all but one of the 911 hijackers acquired some form of us identifica tion document some by fraudand these forms of identification would have assisted them in boarding commercial flights renting cars and other necessary activities8 accordingly the commission recommended that national standards be set for the issuance of birth certificates and drivers licenses to prevent their fraudulent acquisition the adoption of national standards for the issuance of drivers licenses and other forms of identification has long been th subject of controversy although not technically an immigration policy the concern over these forms of identification often referred to as breeder documents has often been linked with immigration legislation pursuant to 656 of the iirira congress provided standards for acceptance of state drivers licenses and birth certificates when used for federal purposes many opponents alleged that this provision was step towards the creation of national identifica tion card and it was subsequently repealed in 2000 in response to the 911 commissions recommendations however number of proposals were made to incr ease federal oversight over nd improve the security of drivers licenses birth certificates and other stateissued forms of identification proposals were also made to improve the security of social security documents and verify the identity of persons applying fo r benefits under the ina these proposals to improve identification verification pr ocedures and the security of
