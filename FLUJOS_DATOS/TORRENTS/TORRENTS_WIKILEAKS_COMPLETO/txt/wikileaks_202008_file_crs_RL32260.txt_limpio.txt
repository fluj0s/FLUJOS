assistance to the middle east1 it includes brief historical review of foreign aid levels description of specific country programs and an analysis of current foreign aid issues2 congress both authorizes and appropriates foreign assistance and conducts oversight on executive agencies management of aid programs as the largest regional recipient of us economic and military aid the middle east is perennially major focus of interest as congress exercises these responsibilities in the middle east the united states has number of strategic interests ranging from support for the state of israel and israels peaceful relations with its arab neighbors to the protection of vital petroleum supplies and the fight against international terrorism us assistance was provided to support the 1979 camp david peace accords between israel and egypt and the continued stability of the kingdom of jordan which signed its own peace treaty with israel in 1994 us funding also has attempted to improve palestinian civil society and aid officials have worked to ensure that us aid to the west bank and gaza strip is not diverted to terrorist groups since the attacks of september 11 2001 the united states has established new regionwide aid programs that promote democracy and encourage socioeconomic reform in an attempt to undercut the forces of radicalism in some arab countries foreign aid to support key us interests despite changing geopolitical conditions us foreign aid to the middle east has historically been function of us national security interests in the region the united states has pursued foreign policy that seeks stability in region with abundant energy reserves but volatile interstate relationships policymakers have often employed foreign aid to achieve this objective foreign aid has been used as leverage to encourage peace between israel and her arab neighbors while strengthening bilateral relationships between the united states and israel and 1 for the purposes of this report the middle east region or near east is defined as an area stretching from morocco in the west to the persian gulf in the east but not including turkey 2 for assistance with foreign aid terminology and acronyms please see the glossary appended to this report crs2 between the united states and moderate arab governments foreign aid has worked to cement close military cooperation between the united states and governments in the region discouraging local states from engaging in uncontrollable arms races economic aid also has had an underlying strategic rationale as us funds have been employed to promote development in an attempt to undercut radicalism in partner countries the degree to which foreign assistance has contributed to the achievement of us objectives in the middle east is difficult to measure but the consensus among most analysts seems to be that us economic and security aid has contributed significantly to israels security egypts stability and jordans friendship with the united states the promise of us assistance to israel and egypt during peace negotiations in the late 1970s enabled both countries to take the risks needed for peace and may have helped convince both countries that the united states was committed to supporting their peace efforts excluding iraq israel and egypt are the largest two recipients of us aid respectively there is debate over using foreign aid more aggressively to pursue various objectives in the middle east some critics of us policy would like to see additional conditions placed on us aid to egypt for example to achieve greater respect for democracy and human rights in that country others favor using the aid program more assertively as leverage to restart the middle east peace process some might urge that aid should be conditioned on demonstrable progress in extending full political and economic rights to women and religious minorities others however assert that the overt use of aid or the threat of aid reductions to promote democracy and reform in the middle east region could lead to backlash against the united states critics of us aid policy particularly some in the middle east have argued that us foreign aid exacerbates tensions in the region many arab commentators insist that us assistance to israel indirectly causes suffering to palestinians by supporting israeli arms purchases another common argument asserts that us foreign aid bolsters autocratic regimes with similar strategic interests to the united states some observers have called us aid policy contradictory accusing the united states of bolstering its ties with autocratic regimes through military assistance while advocating liberalization in the region with less funds dedicated to reform and development aid as noted above however other analysts believe aid has helped protect israels security and stabilize the region crs3 table 1 decade of us assistance to the middle east fy2000fy2009 request regular and supplemental

reconstruction assistance by curt tarnoff israel3 overview since 1976 israel has been the largest annual recipient of us foreign assistance and is the largest cumulative recipient since world war ii strong congressional support for israel has resulted in israels receiving benefits that may not be available to other countries for example israel can use us military assistance for research and development in the united states and for military purchases in israel4 in addition all us foreign assistance earmarked for israel is delivered in the first 30 days of the fiscal year other recipients normally receive their aid in staggered installments at varying times former israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu told congress on july 10 1996 that israel would end its dependency on us economic assistance at the time israel was receiving 12 billion in grant economic assistance and 18 billion in grant military assistance annually in 1998 israel and the united states agreed to reduce us economic assistance by 120 million per year and increase us military assistance by 60 million per year over 10year period beginning in 1999 leading to complete phaseout of economic assistance but increasing military assistance to 24 billion by 20085 in august 2007 the bush administration announced that it would increase us military assistance to israel by 6 billion over the next decade the agreement calls for incremental annual increases in fmf to israel reaching 31 billion year by fy2018 military analysts speculate that the increase in us assistance will facilitate potential israeli purchases of the most sophisticated us equipment including possible sale of the f35 joint strike fighter jsf under the terms of the agreement israel will still be able to spend 26 of us assistance on israelimanufactured equipment 3 in addition to us foreign assistance israel also receives funds from annual defense appropriations to support the research and development of new military technologies such as the arrow antimissile system see crs report rl33222 us foreign aid to israel by jeremy m sharp 4 in fy1977 the israeli government for the first time received special permission to use fmf for research and development in israel on the merkava tank after this precedent was established israel has been allowed to spend set percentage of its annual fmf inside israel 5 this agreement is noted in

quarter of its fmf funds as cash grant to pay for israeli defense purchases in israel since 1990 congress has provided for israel to receive its fmf aid in lump sum during the first month of the

the past congress has earmarked aid to egypt in annual foreign operations legislation with an accompanying statement calling on egypt to undertake further economic reforms in addition to reforms taken in previous years7 in july 2007 as part of larger arms package to the region the united states announced that it would provide egypt with 13 billion in military aid over tenyear period since egypt has already been receiving approximately 13 billion year in military assistance the announcement represented major change in administration policy toward egypt 6 for additional information on us aid to egypt see crs report rl33003 egypt background and us relations by jeremy m sharp 7 in fy2006 egypts fmf earmark was excluded from the senateapproved version of the annual foreign aid bill but was later reinstated by conferees crs6 economic assistance the united states has significantly reduced its economic aid to egypt over the last decade as many observers believe that us economic assistance may be phased out entirely in the years ahead there are several reasons for the reduction in us assistance overall us economic aid to egypt has been trending downward due to tenyear agreement reached in the late 1990s known as the glide path agreement in january 1998 israeli officials negotiated with the united states to reduce economic aid and increase military aid over 10 year period 3 to 2 ratio similar to total us aid to israel and egypt was applied to the reduction in economic aid 60 million reduction for israel and 40 million reduction for egypt but egypt did not receive an increase in military assistance thus the united states reduced esf aid to egypt from 815 million in fy1998 to approximately 411 million in fy20088 with the expiration of the glide path agreement the continued expansion of egypts economy growing desire for more usegyptian trade and reluctance by egypt to accept conditions on us aid us and egyptian officials have expressed desire to graduate egypt from us bilateral economic assistance9 however neither the united states nor egypt seem to agree on how aid should be reduced over the coming decade egypt would like to establish an endowment to jointly fund development projects10 some analysts believe that the proposed endowment which reportedly would be matched by the egyptian government on dollarfordollar basis would serve as substitute for the annual appropriations process and shield egypt from potential conditionality agreements mandated by congress so far the administration has moved ahead with its own plans for reducing economic aid to egypt for fy2009 the administration is requesting 200 million in esf for egypt notable decrease from previous fiscal years according to the us state departments fy2009 congressional budget justification fy

assistance as part of the fy2003 iraq emergency supplemental appropriations act pl 10811 it included 300 million in esf for egypt which could be used to cover the costs of up to 2 billion in loan guarantees the loan guarantees were to be issued over three years 9 crs conversation with us and egyptian officials january 9 2008 10 the senate version of the fy2008 foreign operations bill hr 2764 contained an amendment entitled the united statesegypt friendship endowment that would have provided up to 500 million in esf to establish an endowment to further social economic and political reforms in egypt crs7 military assistance the administration has requested 13 billion in fmf for egypt in fy2009 the same amount it received in fy2008 fmf aid to egypt is divided into three general components 1 acquisitions 2 upgrades to existing equipment and 3 followon support maintenance contracts according to us and egyptian defense officials approximately 30 of annual fmf aid to egypt is spent on new weapons systems as egypts defense modernization plan is designed to gradually replace most of egypts older soviet weaponry with us equipment that figure is expected to decline over the long term due to the rising costs associated with followon maintenance contracts egyptian military officials have repeatedly sought additional fmf funds to offset the escalating costs of followon support egypt also receives excess defense articles eda worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually from the pentagon egyptian officers also participate in the imet program 13 million requested for fy2009 in order to

significantly further increases in us aid to jordan began in fy2003 in view of jordans support for the war against terrorism and us operations in iraq since fy2003 jordans total assistance package has

in the gaza strip and its contentious relationship with palestinian moderates after the 2006 hamas victory in palestinian authority pa elections us assistance to the palestinians was restructured and reduced after hamas took over the pa in march 2006 the united states halted direct foreign aid to the pa but continued providing humanitarian assistance and democracy promotion and private sector support funds to the palestinian people through international and nongovernmental organizations ngos the ban continued during the brief tenure of the hamasled unity government from february until june 2007 us policy makers demanded that hamas us state departmentdesignated foreign terrorist organization fto renounce among other things its commitment to the destruction of the state of israel and the use of terrorist violence hamas did not comply with these demands in june 2007 intense palestinian infighting ended with hamas in complete control of the gaza strip abbas reacted by dissolving the unity government the bush administration and the israeli government viewed the ouster of hamas as an opportunity to return to diplomacy and the united states announced it was resuming its foreign assistance program to bolster the abbasled palestinian authority in the west bank 14 see also crs report rs22370 us foreign aid to the palestinians by paul morro for details on usaids program in the

since the signing of the oslo accord in 1993 the us government has committed more than 2 billion in bilateral economic assistance to the palestinians15 approximately 80 of us funding for the palestinians has been channeled through usaid contractors and 20 through private voluntary organizations pvos according to annual foreign operations legislation congressionally approved funds for the west bank and gaza strip cannot be used for the palestinian authority pa unless the president submits waiver to congress citing that it is in the interest of national security16 us assistance to the palestinians has been averaging about 130 million year since fy2002 during the 1990s us foreign aid to the palestinians averaged approximately 75 million per year direct aid to the palestinian authority the united states has provided direct assistance to the palestinian authority on seven occasions including the following in19931994 the united states provided 36 million through the holst fund at the world bank for direct assistance to the palestinian authority and an additional 5 million in cash and equipment for the palestinian police on july 8 2003 the united states announced that it would provide 20 million out of 50 million fy2003 supplemental allocation as direct aid to the pa for infrastructure projects on december 8 2004 president bush again approved 20 million in direct assistance to the pa the 20 million was used to pay off overdue palestinian utility bills to israeli companies17 following pa president mahmoud abbas may 2005 visit to the white house president bush announced that the united states would transfer an additional 50 million from unobligated fy2005 esf funds to the palestinian authority18 however after the 15 the usaid program in the west bank and

department notified congress of the presidents intent to reprogram up to 86 million in prioryear funding to support efforts to reform and rehabilitate palestinian civil security forces loyal to president abbas19 however the house appropriations committee placed hold on these funds seeking more information on where and why the money was to be spent after the palestinians reached agreement on the fatahhamas power sharing arrangement other members of congress reportedly expressed further doubts fearing the money may end up with hamas in march 2007 secretary rice told house appropriations

jordan had come under severe criticism freedom house the organization whose annual index of freedom is drawn upon for two of the ruling justly indicators had urged the mcc board to bypass countries that had low scores on political rights and civil liberties it argued that countries like jordan that fall below 4 out of possible 7 on its index should be automatically disqualified jordan however did well on three of the six other indicators in this category several development analysts further argued that jordan should not be selected because the mca is not an appropriate funding source they assert that jordan already is one of the largest recipients of us aid has access to private sector capital and is not democracy in selecting jordan the mcc board appears not to have been swayed by these arguments jordans threshhold assistance is being used to accelerate political reforms and allow jordan to qualify for the mccs larger compact funding program according to the mcc the jordan

surfaced usaid conducted an internal audit of its anti terrorism procedures and concluded it cannot reasonably ensure that its money does not wind up in terrorist hands35 in response to continued demands by congress that usaid tighten its vetting procedures the agency is revamping its oversight of us assistance programs to the west bank and gaza strip36 usaid has increased its use of intelligence databases for clearance of all contracts and funds according to henrietta fore usaid administrator and director of us foreign assistance currently the program that we have for the west bank includes in it the vetting of the top few board members for any contract that is going to be receiving money so the current vetting system has this in it and your strong support and vigilance has encouraged that the new vetting system that we are now talking with members of congress staff and the private voluntary organization community about would be even stronger which is why our intention would be to begin pilot and to begin it in west bank it is important that we roll this out in the area of highest risk our current programs the ig has come back to look at second time and feel that they are adequate currently but we think that we would like to go step deeper we are also working with other agencies department of state and other federal agencies because we as the united states

international development february 27 2008 crs22 the debate over us assistance to egypt38 in recent years egypts aid program has drawn increasing scrutiny from some lawmakers concerned over egypts poor human rights record some lawmakers believe that us assistance to egypt has not been effective in promoting political and economic reform and that foreign assistance agreements must be renegotiated to include benchmarks that egypt must meet to continue to qualify for us foreign aid others have periodically called for restrictions on us aid to egypt on the grounds that egypts record on religious freedom is substandard the administration and egyptian government assert that reducing egypts military aid would undercut us strategic interests in the area including support for middle east peace us naval access to the suez canal and usegyptian intelligence cooperation us military officials argue that continued us military support to egypt facilitates strong militarytomilitary ties the us navy which sends an average of close to dozen ships through the suez canal per month receives expedited processing for its nuclear warships to pass through the canal valued service that can normally take weeks for other foreign navies in addition some us lawmakers argue that cutting aid particularly military assistance harms the united states since all of egypts fmf must be spent on

egypt crs24 historical background us assistance to the middle east since 1950 19501970 even when adjusted for inflation annual us assistance to the middle east in the decades following world war ii was only small fraction of current aid flows to the region under vastly different geopolitical circumstances us policy was geared toward supporting the development of oilproducing countries maintaining neutral stance in the arabisraeli conflict while supporting israels security and preventing soviet influence from gaining foothold in iran and turkey us policymakers used foreign aid in the 1950s and 1960s to support these objectives us aid to israel was far less in the 1950s and 1960s than in later years39 although the united states provided moderate amounts of economic aid mostly loans to israel at the time israels main patron was france which supported israel by providing it with advanced military equipment and technology40 in 1962 israel purchased its first advanced weapons system from the united states hawk antiaircraft missiles41 in 1968 year after israels victory in the six day war the johnson administration with strong support from congress approved the sale of phantom fighters to israel establishing the precedent for us support for israels qualitative military edge over its neighbors42 between 1950 and 1967 the united states courted egypt using foreign aid as bargaining chip cold war competition for egypt was fierce during this time period as egypt received steady stream of surplus us wheat shipments under the food for peace program pl480 despite these measures offers of additional economic aid failed to convince egypt to abandon parallel relationship with the soviet union as egypt pursued strict arab nationalist and neutral policy that shunned close alliances with western powers and cooperation and peace with israel internationally after 1955 egypt obtained military aid mainly from the soviet union beginning in 1965 foreign assistance levels to the region began to decline considerably culminating in an almost 80 drop in economic aid to the middle east by 1970 host of factors most notably the june 1967 war and the rising cost of the war in vietnam led congress to cut funding for number of countries egypt which had already seen its annual aid reduced lost food aid entirely after it severed relations with the united states during the 1967 war jordan and other arab states also saw 39 in 1948 president harry truman who sympathized with the plight of israel in its early days placed an arms embargo on israel and her arab neighbors in order to keep the united states neutral in the ongoing arabisraeli conflict 40 france supplied israel with military equipment mainly to counter egyptian power in the region in the 1950s and early 1960s egypt antagonized france by providing arms and training to algerian fighters in algerias war for independence against france 41 americas staunchest mideast ally christian science monitor august

foreign assistance to the middle east after the us withdrawal from south vietnam the middle east as whole began to receive more us foreign aid than any other region of the world trend that has continued to today us foreign aid programs became more comprehensive in nature driven by large assistance packages to israel and later to egypt and other arab governments largescale us assistance for israel increased considerably after series of arabisraeli wars created sense among many americans that israel was continually under siege43 consequently congress supported by broad us public opinion committed to strengthening israels military and economy through large increases in foreign aid in 1971 the united states provided israel with military loans of 545 million up from 30 million in 1970 also in 1971 congress first designated specific amount of aid for israel an earmark economic assistance changed from project aid such as support for agricultural development work to the commodity 43 between 1967 and 1973 israel and its arab neighbors fought the june 1967 war the ensuing war of attrition 1969 and the october 1973 war israel also was engaged in continual low level guerrilla warfare with the palestinian liberation organization and other guerilla groups which had bases in jordan and later in lebanon the 1974 emergency aid for israel following the 1973 war included the first us
