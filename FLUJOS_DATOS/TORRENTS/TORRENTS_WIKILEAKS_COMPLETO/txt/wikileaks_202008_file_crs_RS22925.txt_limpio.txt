august 1 2008 covered bonds an alternative to securitization for funding mortgages edward vincent murphy analyst in financial economics government and finance summary covered bonds are relatively common method of funding mortgages in europe httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22925 but uncommon in the united states covered bond is recourse debt obligation that is secured by pool of assets in this case mortgages the holders of the bond are given additional protection in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the issuing lender they have some features such as pooled mortgages that resemble securitization but the original lenders maintain continuing interest in the performance of the loans because some believe that the subprime mortgage turmoil may have been influenced by poor incentives for lenders using the securitization process some policymakers have recommended covered bonds as an alternative for us mortgage markets treasury secretary paulson has said that covered bonds could bring more certainty and more competition to mortgage markets because issuing banks do not sell mortgage assets to securitization trusts accounting features of covered bonds may provide more readily accessible information to potential purchasers of the covered bonds and to the shareholders of the banks issuing the covered bonds some features of american banking regulations may have to be clarified to facilitate covered bonds the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic for example issued new rule clarifying its obligations to the holders of covered bonds if an fdicinsured institution is placed in fdic receivership or conservatorship this report will be updated as conditions warrant the equal treatment for covered bonds act of 2008 hr 6659 would define covered bond as nondeposit recourse debt with term to maturity of at least one year and secured by specifically identified assets hr 6659 also calls for rulemaking regarding covered bonds to be conducted jointly by financial regulators in response to recent mortgage market turmoil the treasury department and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic have considered rulemaking to encourage the use of covered bonds as an alternative to mortgage securitization the volume of privatelabel mortgage securitizations in which mortgages are pooled into trusts and then divided into securities for sale to investors declined significantly following the subprime crs2 mortgage turmoil1 in typical privatelabel securitizations neither the original lender nor the mortgagebacked security mbs issuer has continuing duty to the purchasers of the securities it might be argued that this divorce of mortgage funding from loan origination contributed to weak underwriting standards in us mortgage markets2 covered bonds which are more common in europe especially the german pfandbrief market also pool mortgages but the issuing banks continue to stand behind the performance of the loan pool on march 13 2008 treasury secretary paulson suggested the increased use of covered bonds as one option to restore confidence in mortgage finance covered bonds which allow banks to retain originated mortgage loans while accessing financial market funding are another alternative worth considering covered bonds may address the current lack of liquidity in and bring more competition to mortgage securitization rulemaking not legislation is needed to facilitate the issuance of covered bonds through clarification of covered bonds status in the event of bankissuers insolvency the fdic can reduce uncertainty and consider appropriate measures that will protect the deposit insurance fund these httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22925 steps would encourage covered bond market in the us similar changes in europe have resulted in more covered bond activity3 financial structure of covered bonds covered bond is bankissued debt that is backed by pool of loans often mortgages in financespeak covered bond is thus recourse debt obligation that is secured by pool of assets unlike typical private securitizations in the united states the bondholders claims extend to the issuing banks assets if the underlying mortgages default if the underlying mortgages continue to perform but the issuing bank becomes insolvent the bondholders retain full claim on the pooled mortgages in subsequent bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings the bonds are covered by both the pledged mortgages and the issuing bank table 1 compares selected features of covered bonds to typical private securitization of us mortgages 1 privatelabel

issuing bank as whole mortgage pool source vinod kothari securitization financial instrument of the future new jersey john wiley sons 2006 p 357 the structure of covered bond may encourage transparency unlike typical private securitization of us mortgages the issuing bank of covered bond does not sell the mortgages to passthrough trust administering the payments to the investors because there is sale the issuing bank continues to report the loans on its balance sheet when evaluating the riskiness of covered bond rating agency must account for both the quality of the underlying mortgages and the financial condition of the issuing bank that covers the bonds crs4 compared to securitization the structure of covered bond simplifies the relationship between mortgage pools and mortgage servicers for covered bond the issuing bank continues to service the pooled loans or contract out servicing in the same manner as it would for loans that it has not issued as covered bonds this preserves the issuing banks discretion to modify loans in times of distress in securitization however the discretion of servicers to modify loans can be limited by loan servicing contracts that can be difficult to adjust in changing circumstances4 fdic rulemaking affecting covered bonds although the covered bond market has long tradition in europe the united states has much less experience in june 2007 bank of america became the first us depository institution to issue domestic covered bond with 2 billion offering since then industry specialists and policymakers have been evaluating american banking regulation to see what kinds of modifications might be required to adapt this european debt instrument to us financial markets in the united states financial problems of banks with insured deposits are often httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22925 resolved through actions of the fdic in order to adapt covered bonds to the us system therefore fdic rules for resolving claims against insolvent banks that have outstanding covered bonds might have to be modified the fdic issued financial institution letter fil 342008 fdic policy statement on covered bonds on april 30 2008 fil 34 provides more regulatory clarity by giving expedited access to covered bond collateral if the issuing institution fails or is placed in conservatorship and meets certain criteria its expressed intent is to reduce market uncertainty and allow for evaluation of the benefits and questions about covered bonds as the market develops in the united states the fdic issued its policy statement for covered bonds on july 15 2008 the policy statement defines covered bond as nondeposit recourse debt obligation of an idi insured depository institution with term greater than one year and more than thirty years that is secured directly or indirectly by perfected security interests under applicable state and federal law on assets held and owned by the idi consisting of eligible mortgages or aaarated mortgagebacked securities secured by eligible mortgages if for more than ten percent of the collateral for any covered bond issuance or series5 the fdic limited the covered bond policy statement only to those circumstances in which the covered bonds would comprise more than 4 of the issuers total liabilities the fdic statement did not require that issuers of covered bonds use special purpose vehicle spv which was common financial device used in securitization 4 crs report rl34386 could securitization obstruct voluntary loan modifications and payment freezes by edward vincent murphy 5 covered bond statement fdic july 15 2008 available at httpwwwfdicgovnews newspress2008pr08060ahtml crs5 equal treatment for covered bonds act of 2008 hr 6659 hr 6659 the equal treatment for covered bonds act of 2008 was introduced by congressman garrett on july 30 2008 the definition of covered bond is similar to the definition used in the fdic rulemaking the bill defines covered bond as nondeposit recourse debt obligation of an insured depository institution with term to maturity of at least 1 year which is secured by specifically identified assets which are performing in accordance with the terms of the contracts which created the assets section 2b although similar to the fdic definition hr 6659 does not require that covered bond be used for mortgages or for aaarated securities also the bill does not limit the term to maturity of the assets to 30 years which would allow covered bonds to fund 40year mortgages the bill also specifies the regulatory authority of federal financial regulators for covered bonds section 2d in order to be applicable to covered bonds federal banking regulations must be jointly prescribed by the secretary of the treasury the board of governors of the federal reserve system the comptroller of the currency the director of the office of thrift supervision and the board of directors of the fdic of the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22925
