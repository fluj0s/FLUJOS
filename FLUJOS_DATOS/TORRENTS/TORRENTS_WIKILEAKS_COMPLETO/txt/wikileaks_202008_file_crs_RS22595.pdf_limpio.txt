equipped with the aegis combat systeman integrated combinat ion of sensors weapons computers software and display systems that was named for the mythological shield carried by zeus the aegis ships are multimission ships for conducting missions such as air defense which the navy calls antiair warfare ballistic missile defense bmd antisubmarine warfare antisurface warfare naval surface fire support for forces ashore and tomahawk cruise missile strikes the navys aegis ships include ticonderoga cg47 class cruisers and arleigh burke ddg51 class destroyers total of 27 cg47s were pr ocured for the navy between fy1978 and fy1988 the ships entered service between 1983 and 1994 the first five which were built to an earlier technical standard were judged by the navy to be too expensive to modernize and were removed from service in 20042005 the navy plans to keep the remaining 22 ships in service to age 35 total of 62 ddg51s were procured for the navy between fy1985 and fy2005 the first entered service in 1991 52 were in service as of the end of fy2007 and the 62 nd is scheduled to enter service in 2011 the navy until recently had planned to keep them in service to age 35 but is now considering extending their service lives to 40 years between 2011 when the 62 nd ddg51 enters service and 2021 when the first of the 22 remaining cg47s reaches age 35 the navy plans to maintain force of 84 aegis ships22 cruisers and 62 destroyers these 84 ships equate to about 27 or more than onequarter of the navys planned total force of 313 ships1 aegis ships are to account for the majority of the navys cruiserdestroyer force until about 2032 and the last of the 84 ships are to remain in service into the 2040s

objective of the aegis ship modernization effort is to improve the ships combat capabilities so that the ships will remain missioneffective to the end of their intended service lives second major objective is to make the ships less expensive to operate maintain and modernize over the remainder of their lives the modernization itself is not intended to extend the ships expected lives from 35 years to some higher figure such as 40 years additional maintenance work would be needed to extend the ships lives to 40 years or some other higher figure

mechanical and electrical hme equipment and modernization of their combat systems in both areas the navy plans to install new systems or components that are more capable than the ones they are to replace some of the planned changes are intended to permit the ships to be operated with smaller crew thereby reducing their annual operation and support costs planned changes to the ships combat systems are intended to among other things begin shifting their aegis computers and software to more open architecture oa meaning in general terms an arrangement that uses nonproprietary computers and software the navy believes that moving to an aegis open architecture will permit the aegis system to be updated over the remainder of the ships lives more easily and less expensively using contributions from variety of firms in august 2008 it was reported that the navy has decided to expand the scope of the ddg51 modernization program to include the installation of bmd capability so that all ddg51s would eventually be bmdcapable and that the navy has not committed to similarly expanding the scope of the cg47 modernization program due to financial constraints 3 equipping all ddg 51s with bmd capability would significantly expand the previous program of record for sea based bmd platforms which called for total of 18 aegis ships 3 cg47s and 15 ddg51s to be bmdcapable 4 g5g152g156g157g561 the navy estimated in 2007 that modernizing the first 8 cg47s would cost an average of about 221 million per ship table 1 shows annual funding for the aegis ship modernization

issue for congress concerns the total estimated cost of the aegis ship modernization program what is the navys total estimated cost and how was this figure affected by the navys reported decision in 2008 to expand the scope of the ddg51 modernization program to include the installation of bmd capability g17g159g142g155g138g149g149g561g24g146g156g146g152g151g561g4g142g145g146g151g141g561g15g152g141g142g155g151g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g561g18g149g138g151g348g561 some industry sources question the navys logic behind the aegis ship modernization program arguing that the navy lacks sufficiently thoughtthrough overall visiona desired endpointfor the surface combatant force and that in the absence of such vision the navy is planning to spend money on aegis ship modernizations in scattershot manner without knowing whether this will lead to the bestpossible future surface fleet for the navy these sources argue that before spending money on aegis ship modernizations the navy should develop more fully considered overall vision for the future of the surface fleet that looks at the surface force and the navy as whole as parts of larger network of defense capabilities involving other us military forces one potential alternative to the navys plan would be to forego some or all of the aegis ship modernizations accelerate the planned procurement of new cruisers and destroyers and replace the unmodernized aegis ships with the accelerated replacement ships 7

modernizations to gdbiw and ngsb with each firm receiving onehalf of the sh ips these sources argue that this would reduce the cost of the ddg51 modernizations by permitting the two firms to achieve sustained learning curve benefits in the program and also support the shipbuilding industrial base by providing additional work to the two yards that have built all navy cruisers and destroyers procured in recent years competitive pressure on gdbiw and ngsb these industry sources argue can be maintained by using profit related to offer p ro bidding under which the two yards would bid prices for performing the modernizations allocated to them with the lower bid winning higher profit margin 6 this issue and the subsequent potential issues for congress are based in part on crs interviews conducted in january 2007 with several major defense firms that have an interest in the aegis ship modernization program 7 the navy plans to replace the 22 cg47s with 19 cgx cruisers to be procured

ddg51 modernizations with ddg 51s currently under construction followed by whatever ddg51s are scheduled for depotlevel maintenance others argue that the navy should upgrade the combat systems on younger ddg 51s when they come into yards for periodic overhaul and repair work while modernizing older ddg51s at the same time

modernizations in various ways to further increase the ships capabilities or further reduce their crew sizes and operating costs one proposal would add some electricdrive propulsion equipment to the ships existing mechanicaldrive propulsion systems to more fully interconnect the mechanicaldrive components which could reduce the ships fuel use and create other operational advantages 8

program would be to expand its scope to include work that would be needed to extend the service lives of the aegis ships from 35 years to higher number such as 40 years extending the aegis ships service lives to 40 years could permit the navy to maintain higher numbers of cruisers and destroyers in future years the navys report on its fy2009 30year shipbuilding plan submitted to congress in early february 2008 incorporates new assumption that the service lives of all 62 aegis destroyers will be extended from 35 years to 40 years 9 subsequent to the submission of this report however navy official was quoted as stating that the navy had not yet officially approved the idea of extending the service lives of those ships10

aegis system arguing that it will not shift the aegis ships to truly open architecture or do so quickly enough 11 for firms that make navy surface ship combat systems or parts of them the issue of how to implement open architecture on aegis ships and other navy surface ships has potentially very large business implications potential candidates for the basis of an eventual common openarchitecture

plan to extend ddg51 service life to 40 years as very high risk questioned whether the navy has fully evaluated the option of performing the ddg51 modernizations in the yards where the ships were built and directed the navy to submit report on this option and on the navys plan to perform the work through msmo contracts the report discussed the navys plan to move toward an aegis open architecture on pages 121123 the committee expressed concern regarding the navys rate of progress in achieving this goal and directed that more than 50 of fy2009 funding authorized for certain navy research and development work on surface ship combat systems may be obligated until 30 days after submission by the secretary of the navy of tailed program plan for implementing oa for the aegis
