leadership postponed floor action on both bills however reportedly in the face of opposition from democrats republican moderates and so republican appropriators12 brief analysis and overview of legislative provisions although some commentators have referred to the carf arelated legislation as providing for sunset commission the carf arelated provisions do not use the sunset concept of automatic termination of agencies and programs on periodic basis unless the agencies or programs are reauthorized by law instead the carfarelated proposals would establish commission that in turn w ould develop legislati on to be considered by congress under expedited procedures that provides for the realignment or elimination of agencies and programs that the commission decides fit certain criteria the legislations proponents have seen this mechanism as being analogous to the base realignment and closure brac process that has been used for military installations however there are number of significant differences between the brac process and carfa proposals as discussed elsewhere13 if s 3521 or either of the initially intr oduced versions of the carfa legislation ie s 1155hr 2470 were enacted the majority of commission members would in twoparty political system be appointed by members of the same political party as the sitting president 9 out of 15 under s 3521 8 out of 12 under s 1155 and all 12 under hr 247014 each of the three versions of ca rfa would require the commission to 1 review most or all executive agencies and programs15 according to listed but

all the bills the commissions proposed legislation would recei ve expedited congre ssional consideration thereby prohibiting amendments in either chamber and filibusters in the senate proponents of different versi ons of carfa have often co mpared the proposal to the brac commissions that focused on military installations17 except that the proposed carfa legislation would focus on most or all agencies and programs of the rest of the executive branch of government proponents ve also argued that the mechanism would eliminate ineffective or outdated programs18 address out of cont rol spending and move toward balancing the budget19 critics of different versions of carfa have argued the proposal would give too much power to the pr esident and in twoparty political system to the political

differences between the carfarelated proposals and hr 5766 as ordered to be reported with an amendment in the nature of substitute by the house committee on government reform some of which are discussed here whereas the carfa proposals would creat single commission hr 5766 would authorize the establishment of one or more federal review commissions without limitation as to number by executive order from the president or enactment of joint resolution by congress in this way h r 5766 resembles the ad ministrations proposal for results commissions and provisions in hr 3276s 1399 discussed earlier the membership of federal revi ew commission would be appointed by the president with four of seven members appointed in consultation with c ongressional leaders if these consultations resulted in the president appointing the commission member recommended by congressional leader then as with the carfa proposals in twoparty political system the majority of each federal review commissions membership would be appointed in effect by memb ers of the same political party as the sitting president another difference between hr 5766 and the carfa proposals is that hr 5766 does not provide for how federal revi ew commissions legislative proposal to reorganize consolidate abolish expand or transfer the federal programs and agencies reviewed by the commission would be consider ed in the senate this section was left blank apparently in anticipa tion of senate cons ideration and amendment of hr 5766 other differences between the carfa proposals and the proposed authority to establish federal review commissions include in hr 5766 duty for the president to submit to congress schedule under whic h federal review commissions shall be established to review all federal agencies and programs which has analog in the carfa proposals in hr 5766 different nd less detailed criteri for commissions recommendations in hr 5766 explicit refere nce to duty to consider an agencys existing rules promulgated by the agencies to carry out the programs and in hr 5766 absence of language that appears to ca ll for use of the administrations part under hr 5766 the scope of review of federal review commission includes all federal agencies according to the bills definition of agency in the proposed section 1001k the scope of review would be the finition of agency that was operative under presidential reorganization authority 5 u sc 9021 which expired in 1984 as noted earlier the carfa proposals would pr ovide for differing scopes within the executive branch using the
