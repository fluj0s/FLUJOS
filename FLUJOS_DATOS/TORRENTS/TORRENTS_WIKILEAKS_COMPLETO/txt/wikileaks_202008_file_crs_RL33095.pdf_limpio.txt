department of defense is the resource only of last resort may also require reexamination as with most natural disasters the role of the national guard is critical in the maintenance of civil order the provision of logistical support and the coordination of rescue and relief effort the nati onal guards ability to respond through the emergency management assistance co mpact may be proven to have been exemplary given the extent of regional struction neverthele ss number of issues may attract attention the fact that th national guard may act under state control or may be federalized and brought unde r command of active duty forces at the presidents discretion creates decisionpoint with political cost and coordinationcommand implications they pres ent core concern in the balance of state and federal control in disaster situations another issue that has attracted significant attention is the question of whether the demands of overseas operations in iraq and afghanistan in any way affected the quality of response of both active duty nd national guard forces both dod and the national guard have denied any dele terious effect however there is some evidence that equipment shortages am ong national guard units and the non availability of some active duty units could be attributed to overseas deployment activities the national guards equipment levels and deployment policies may be of particular interest gi ven its dual responsibilities bot h domestically and overseas in examining its roles missions and capabilities it is likely that the controversies surrounding the federal response to katrina will affect dods consideration of its respons ibilities and its ability to execute them though katrina was natural disaster many of its effects could be enc ountered in an intentional attack consequently less ons learned from the katrina experience may carry long term relevance for dods civil support planning this report will be update d as events warrant

required every able bodied white male to participate in the common defense of his town or locality was the backbone of colonial military power gradually as the colonial population grew and military threats waned distinction arose between the unorganized militia those members of the militia who were potentially liable for military service but who did not actively participate in military training and the organized militia those members of the militia who regularly trained for war and who responded first to military threats 16 see us constitution article i section 8 clauses 15 and 16 and

fixed wing aircraft13 role of the national guard14 the national guard is descended from the colonial militias15 which existed prior to the adoption of the constitution with the adoption of the constitution the federal government acquired authority to organize arm and discipline the militia and to call the militia into federal service in order to execute the laws of the union to suppress insurrection and to repel invasion16 additionally federal laws passed in the early 20th century designated part of the militia as the national guard and transformed it into federal reserve of the army enhancing federal authority over the guard inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33095crs7 17 the most significant pieces of legislation in this transformation were the dick act of 1903 and the national defense acts of 1916 1920 nd 1933 later with the advent of the air force the national guard was organized into land force the army national guard of the united states that was federal reserve of the army and an air force the air national guard of the united states that was federal reserve of the air force they are distinct from the army reserve and the air fo rce reserve which are purely federal entities as are the naval reserve marine corps reserve and coast guard reserve the navy marine corps and coast guard have national guard components 18 the national guard of the united states is made up of 54 separate national guard organizations one for each state and one ach for puerto rico guam the us virgin islands and the district of columbia while the district of columbia national guard is an exclusively federal organization and operates under federal control at all times the other 53 national guards operate as state or territorial organizations most of the time in this capacity each of these 53 organizations is identifie d by its state or territorial name eg the california national guard or the puerto rico national guard and is controlled by its respective governor 19 historically this authority has been used mo st frequently in response to natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes forest fires floods etc it has also been used to quell domestic violence and to control or disperse crowds additionally in the aftermath of the september 11 terrorist attacks number of governors called up members of the national guard to protect critical infrastructure in thei r states such as nuclear power plants water treatment facilities and bridges from potential terrorist attacks 20 for example search and rescue clearing ro ads delivering supplies and providing medical assistance 21 the posse comitatus act 18 usc 1385 along with other related laws and administrative provisions prohibits the use of the military to execute civilian laws unless expressly authorized by the constitution or an act of congress congress has made number of exceptions to the act which permit m ilitary involvement in w enforcement for example congress has enacted number of stat utes which authorize the president to use military forces to suppress insurrections and domestic violence 10 usc 331335 if these statutes were to be invoked the president could use active or reserve components to put down rebellion or to control domestic vi olence another important exception relates to the coast guard which congress has vested with broad law enforcement authority under these statutory provisi ons the coast guard and coast guard reserve can participate in the enforcement of maritime customs and certain other federal laws for more continuedcertain respects17 as result of this history the national guard is neither purely state nor purely federal organization rather it is both state and federal organization state active duty normally the national guar d operates under the control of state and territorial governors18 in response to disasters and ci vil disorders governors can order national guard personnel to perform fulltime duty comm only referred to as state active duty19 in this state capacity nationa l guard personnel operate under the control of their governor are paid according to state law can perform typical disaster relief tasks20 and are not subject to the restrictions of the posse comitatus act that is they can perform w enforcement functions21 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33095crs8 21 continued information on the posse comitatus act see crs report rs20590

lawsnational guard personnel calle d to assist with disast er relief operations for hurricane katrina were originally called to duty in state active duty status by their respective governors interstate agreem ents allowed nationa l guard personnel from states outside the hurricane affected area to deploy to louisiana and mississippi and assist with disaster relief22 by september 3 there were more outofstate national guard personnel serving in louisiana and mississippi than there were from those states own national guards see table 1 for summary of national guard force levels in louisiana and mississippi in the early days of the relief operation these outofstate national guar d personnel remained on state active duty in their respective home states after arriving in louisiana and mississippi and received the pay and benefits provided by their home states laws but were placed under the operational control of the gove rnors of louisiana and mississippi later almost all of them were converted to title 32 status see below and were therefore authorized federal pay nd benefits title 32 status another way in which national guard personnel can be ac tivated and remain under the control of their governor is unde r the authority of 32 usc 502f this provision of federal law provides that member of the national guard maywithout his consent but with the pay and allowances provided by lawbe ordered to perform training or other duty in addition to inactive duty for training or annual training the advantage of using this authority is that the national guard personnel called will receive fe deral pay and benef its and are entitled to certain legal protections23 as though they were in federal serv ice but they remain under the control of their governor and are therefore not subject to the restrictions of the posse comitatus act this is the provision of law which was used to provide federal pay and benefits to the nationa l guard personnel who provided security at many of the nations airports in the aftermath of th terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33095crs9 24 gordon england acting deputy secretary of defense memorandum for secretary of the army acting secretary of the air force subject hurricane katrina relief efforts sept 7 2005 25 joint legislative liaison national guard bureau compensation under state law may be more beneficial to some national guard personnel than compensation under federal law for example delaware state law specifies that while on state duty on account of an emergency specified in law members of the delaware national guard shall receive sum equal to twice the per diem pay and allowances that military personnel of like grade and length of service in the united states army would be entitled to receive for similar period of service delaware code title 20 secti on 181 iowa state law specifies that officers and enlisted persons while in state active duty shall receive the same pay per diem and allowances as are paid for the same rank or grade for federal service however person shall not be paid at base rate of pay of less than one hundred dollars per calendar day of state active duty 2005 iowa code 29a27 th is minimum rate effectively guarantees higher rate of pay to most enliste d personnel and some junior officers 26 joint legislative liaison national guard bureau 27 10 usc 311 states the militia of th united states consists of all ablebodied males at least 17 years of age and except as provided in section 313 of title 32 under 45 years of age who are or who have made declar ation of intention to become citizens of the united states and of female citizens of the united states who are members of the national guard b the classes of the militia are 1 the organized militia which consists of the national guard and the naval militia and 2 the unorganized militia which consists of members of the militia who are not members of the national guard or the naval militiashortly after katrina the chief of the national guard bureau lieutenant general blum reportedly asked the secretar of defense to approve the retroactive transfer of all national guar d personnel participating in ka trinarelated disaster relief operations from state active duty to duty unde r title 32 the purpose of this request was to equalize pay and bene fits for all national guard personnel rather than having their compensation based on disparate state and territorial laws on september 7 acting deputy secretary of defense gordon england signed memorandum approving the use of federal funds for use of the national guard in title 32 us code status to support hurricane katrina disa ster relief efforts retroactive to august 29 200524 shortly thereafter the army and air national guard issued implementing instructions to convert national guard pers onnel participating in the katrina relief operations from state active duty to title 32 status however iowa and delaware have reportedly opted not to convert thei r national guard personnel to title 32 status given the more beneficial rate of compensation provided by state law25 national guard personne l responding to hurricane r ita were either already in title 32 status after having served in louisiana in support of hurricane katrina recovery efforts or were directly ordered to duty in that status26 federal status national guard personnel can so be activated in purely federal status for example the president can invoke th insurrection act 10 usc 331335 which allows the president to call the militia which includes the national guard27 into federal service for certain purposes including the suppression of insurrection against state government at the request of that govern ment 10 usc 331

disaster 10 usc 12302 would probably be the authority that would be most useful for calling large numbers of national guard personnel and other reservists to federal active duty for an extended period of time although 10 usc 12301b and 12301d would lik ely be useful as well historically however 10 usc 12302 has only been used fo r national security purposes and it could be controversial to use this

permits the president to call members and units of the national guard into federal service to repel invasion suppress rebellion or execute th laws of the united states orders for this latter type of call up must be transmitted through the appropriate governor in this federal status national guard personne l operate under the control of the president receive federal pay and benef its and can perform law enforcement duties the president may also order national guard personnel to federal active duty under several other provisi ons of law including 10 usc 12301a 12301b 12301d 12302 nd 12304 under these authorities national guard personnel operate under the control of the president receive federal pay nd benefits and are subject to the posse comitatus act however it is unclear how useful these authorities would be for responding to disa ster as they have traditionally been used for national security or training purposes and have constraints which limit or prohibit their use for disaster relief operations for example 10 usc 12301a can only be used in time of war or of national emergency declared by congress or when otherwise authorized by law activa tions under 10 usc 12301b are limited to 15 days and for national gu ard personnel require the consent of the affected governor 10 usc 12301 d permits voluntary activ ation of national guard personnel but not involuntary activation and also requires the consent of the affected governor national guard personnel may be involuntarily activated under 10 usc 12302 but only in time of national emergenc declared by the

dealing with disasters under state active duty and title 32 activations governors retain control over their national guar d personnel which is consistent with principles of federalism and the traditional role of stat governors in responding to disasters moreover duty in these statuses poses obstacle to the use of national guard personnel in law enforcement capacity however in the case of catastrophic events involving multiple jurisdictions and vels of government state control of the national guard can potentially interfere with the effective coordination and utilization of resources fe deralizing national guard for ces on the other hand could increase the efficiency of major disast er response effort however it would do so by stripping state governors of one of thei r most valuable emergency response assets additionally calling national gu ard personnel into federal service requires that the president either invoke statutory exceptions to the posse comitatus act such as the insurrection act which might be inflammatory or that the national guard personnel refrain from acting in law enforcement capacity in an effort to eliminate some of these tradeoffs congress revised the statutes governing national guard officers called into federal service in the national defense authorization act for fy2004 pl 108106 prior to this revision all national guard personnel called to fu lltime duty in the active milita ry service of the united states were automatically relieved from duty in the national guard of their state section 516 provided an exception to this general rule

of commanding unit composed of both active duty and reserve component personnel to retain and exer cise their army or air national guard state commissions if authorized by the pr esident and the

pascagoula mississippi are on the base closure list that the president submitted to congress on september 15 2005 the second katrina supplemental pl 10962 also permits dod to transfer up to 6 million to cover the costs for residents who were evacuated from the us naval home in mississippi retirement home for certain retired military personnel to the us soldiers and airmens home in washington dc the dod funds are appropriated to oper ation and maintenance defensewide set up as transfer account where dod can move monies to other accounts depending on the type of expense eg to pay military personne l costs operating costs procurement family housing and defe nse health funds that turn out not to be needed may be returned to the account and then transferred elsewhere the appropriators approved the amount requested in both supplementals but added language that requires that the armed services and appropriations committees in both the house and senate be notified in writing within five days of when and where funds are transferred this requirement is importa nt to clarify which funds in the various accounts are for hurrican erelated expenses as opposed to those for military operations and re gular peacetime activities httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33095crs14 36 prepared by steve bowman specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade divisionissues for congress36 timeline of response the issue that has attracted the most attention in postkatrina discussions has been the speed of rescue and relief operations as noted northcom began its alert and coordination proce dures significantly before katrinas landfall and the subsequent levee breaches prior to r eceiving requests from fema dod made its own assessments of what resources woul d be useful and began moving towards deployment prior to katrinas landfall however it was not until after the presidential declaration of federal catastrophic emergency and the subsequent declaration of an incident of nati onal significance on august 30 that many deployments began this is in keeping with the national response plan and dods homeland security doctrine though it ma have slowed arrival of needed dod assets in the affected region another factor that affected deployments is simply that most relief assets must be kept out of the storms path until it passes to avoid their own destruction it is possible however that an earlier and pha sed deployment could have brought assets closer to the affect ed region in more timely fashion relief assets approach was also slowed to some extent by damage to airportsairbases highways and the concern about underwater obstructions in the new orleans port area even after the activation of jtfkatrina on august 30 dods response appears incremental responding to an in creasingly deteriorating situation the hospital ship uss comfort was not dispatched from baltimore until august 31 additional active duty ground forces 82nd airborne 1st cavalry did not begin deploying until september 3 arriving on september 5 again transportation challenges in the affected area may have played some role in slowing these troops arrival structural or admi nistrative failures congress may wish to examine whether the shortcomings in katrina relief efforts are the result of structural problems with federal and agency disaster plansdoctrines the failure of administrative officials to execute effectively or both are the national response plan and dods joint homeland security doctrine too procedurebound with too many decision poi nts and approvals re quired or were provisions for expediting responses inade quately utilized with regard to dod particularly the fundamental principle that it is almost always supporting agency and the resource of last resort may serve to encourage reactive rather than proactive mode of operation this principle exis ts because for dod disaster relief is secondary to its primary missi on of national defense and there has been traditional concern that any greater emphasis on ssentially civilian or nonmilitary operations would detract from its preparedness for its primary mission nevert heless absent the development of greater civilian capabilities in disaster response the expectation will remain that dod will provide substantial if not massive assistance in instances of catastrophic disasters current doctrine re quires that state cal and other federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33095crs15 agencies be overwhelmed before dod re sources are requested the question then arises whether the agencies and authorities that have been overwhelmed are indeed capable of making the incident asse ssments and informed resource requests necessary to obtain dod assistance in assessing the response to katrina one of the more difficult tasks is determining what are reasonable expectations in the face of disaster of unprecedented scale what shortcomings in relief efforts could have been avoided with better planning and execution and wh at were simply unavoidable given for instance the regional destruction of communication and transportation infrastructure another consideration is the question of predictability though many sources have predicted the possibility or probability of hurricane with katrinas effect on this region and on new orleans in particular repeated warnings followed by near misses over the years may have contributed to less proactive response to warnings about katrinas pred icted effect on this occasion federalization of the evacuationcommand of the national guard there has been considerable discussion of louisiana governor blancos refusal to permit dods jtfkatrina to assume control of the evacuation efforts and to assume command of the nationa l guard personnel in louisiana this controversy has highlighted the possible political elemen t in the conduct of relief operations if state authorities wish to retain control of the national guard which may be the largest resource at their co mmand at what point can or should presidential authority be invoked to override state authority both president bush and senate armed services committee chairman warner have indicated desire to explore expanding the authority of the department of defense in disaster response part of this may be review of the socalled posse comitatus statute and subsequent dod directives which limit the situations in which federal military personne l may conduct law enforcement activities eg search and seizures arrests it is not clear if the use of active duty federal troops would or could have mitigated the incidence of violence in katrinas aftermath given the earlier availability of nati onal guard troops in the region with law enforcement authority it also appears that early estimates of violent crime in the region may have been overstated what is not clear to date is exactly what effect retention of state control of national guard personnel d upon the conduct of relief operations what operations could have been executed more expediti ously with unified command structure were the command and contro l breakdowns between the military components of the relief effort or between ci vilian and military components the answers to these questions may provide guidance for future operations however it is noteworthy that command coordination is often highly dependent upon the personalities and relationship of the re levant commanders httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33095crs16 37 department of defense press briefings august 31 sept 6 2005

sept 6 2005 p 1impact of overseas deployments on dods response it has been suggested that the substa ntial overseas deployments in iraq and afghanistan affected the ability of both the national guard and active duty forces to carry out relief operations this contention has been repeatedly denied by both the dod and national guard leadership37 though dod has sought to focus this question on the number of personnel that re mained available for relief operations there is anecdotal evidence that particularly for the national guard the issue centered more upon the availab ility of equipment rather th an personnel it has been dods practice to have many units that depl oy to iraq leave their equipment in iraq when they return so that it can be used by subsequent units as result for example it has been reported that national guard units responding to katrina did not have adequate numbers of tactical radios or high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles hmmwvs adapted for high water operations because this equipment was in iraq another example noted is that of the 101st air assault division based in ft campbell ky this division which has th largest number of transport helicopters of any army unit was not deployed to katrina operations because it is in the process of deploying to iraq38 impact of katrina on the quadrennial defense review the department of defense will release its quadrennial defense review qdr congressionallymanda ted examination of the departments roles missions and capabilities in early 2006 the controve rsies surrounding the adequacy of the federal response to katrina are expected to have an effect on dods consideration of its responsibilities and capab ilities with regard to catastrophic incidents though katrina was natural disaster many of its effects could be encountered as result of an intentional attack eg destruction of communicati on transportation and flood control infrastructures mass casualties or civil unrest with the likelihood that dod leadership will continue to maintain its emphasis on overseas operations as the primary mission for active duty forces it is the future role structure forcelevel and equipping of the national guard that may receive the most attention as result of katrinas demand upon dod resources it has been suggested before that the national guard be reorganized to focus on domestic missions in preparation of the 1997 qdr army leadership suggested reducing the combat role of national gu ard units and stressing support functions eg logistics communications military police and engineers this was strongly opposed by the national guard bureau and the recommendation was not included in the final qdr in 2000 one of the recommendations of the united states commission on national security21st cent ury hartrudman commission was to reduce the national guards emphasis upon potential overseas combat deployments and increase its attention to domestic in cident capabilities this was again opposedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33095crs17 39 katrina likely to fuel debate over guards combat homeland defense roles inside defense sept 9 2005by the national guard leadership whic h continued to defend the importance of maintaining its combat capabilities39 this argument by the guard has received substantial support from dods evidenced need to use substantial numbers of national guard troops in iraq regardless of whether civil support re mains responsibility divided between active duty and national guard forces it is likely that questions of personnel levels and equipping for both elements of the armed services will be addressed it will then be necessary to determine what level of investment will be required to meet civil support expectations though the study of katrina relief operations may have an effect on qdr recommendations it will be nece ssary to examine to what extent the demands of such an extraordinary catas trophic event should be used as baseline guidance the extent of the resources needed to deal with the consequences of hurricane katrina on top of the requirements for co mbat operations in iraq and afghanistan raises the question of what resources woul d be available in the event of another almost simultaneous catastrophic event t hough some have suggested that disaster like katrina increases potential vulnerability to opportunistic terrorist attack the approach of hurricane ophelia along the eastern seaboard shortly after katrinas strike also demonstrates the potential for sequential natural disa sters it could be useful to examine what resources were marshalled in response to the threat of hurricane ophelia and how these efforts we re affected by ongoing operations on the gulf coast
