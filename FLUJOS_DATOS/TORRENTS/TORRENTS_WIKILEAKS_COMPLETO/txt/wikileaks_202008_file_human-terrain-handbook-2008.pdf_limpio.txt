terrain teams htts are five to nineperson teams deployed by the human terrain system hts to support field commanders by filling their cultural knowledge gap in the current operating environment and providing cultural interpretations of events occurring within their area of operations the team is composed of individuals with social science and operational backgrounds that are deployed with t actical and operational military units to assist in bringing knowle dge about the local population into coherent analytic framework and bu ild relationships with the local powerbrokers in order to provide advice and opportunities to commanders and staffs in the field htts are regionallyfocused modul ar special staff that brings capabilities that exist outside of organic battalion bct and division structure they deploy as trained and organized teams attached to usmc regimental combat teams army brigade combat teams and division corps and combined joint task force level hqs each team is recruited and tr ained for specific region then deployed and embedded with their supported unit the htts are comprised of mix of soldiers and department of the army contractors that provide mix of senior military specialists and academicians with strong social sciences credentials an htt integrates into the unit staff c onducts unclassified opensource and field research and provides opera tionallyrelevant human terrain information in support of the plan ning preparation execution and assessment of operations fundamental condition of irregul ar warfare and counterinsurgency operations is that the commander and staff can longer limit their focus to the traditional mission enemy terrain and weather friendly troops and support available and time the local population in the area of conflict must be considered as distinct and critical aspect of the commanders assessment of the situation this human terrain team handbook us unclassified 3 was codified in army doctrine with the publication of fm 30 in june 2007 with modification of mettt to metttc adding civil considerations the nature of full spectrum operati ons requires commanders to assess the impact of nonmilitary factors on operations because of this added complexity civil considerations has been added to the familiar mettt to form metttc all commanders use metttc to start their visualization staff estimates may address individual elements of and add to the commanders visualization in an irregular warfare envir onment commanders and planners require insight into cultures per ceptions values beliefs interests and decisionmaking processes of individuals and groups and should be evaluated according to their society social structure culture language power and authority and interests1 the human dimension is the very essence of irregular warfare environments understanding loca l cultural political social economic and religious factors is crucial to successful counter insurgency and stability operations and ultimately to success in the war on terror in stability opera tions and irregular warfare the human aspect of the environment becomes central to mission success information on social groups and thei r interests beliefs leaders and the drivers of individual and group behavior is needed to conduct effective counterinsurgency operatio ns the expertise for conducting research and analysis to provide valid and objective information on these topics are highly specialized in the social sciences social science research of host nati ons population produces knowledge base that is referred to as the hu man terrain or the element of the operational environment encompa ssing the cultural sociological political and economic factors of the local population2 this handbook is designed to provide base of knowledge for future human terrain team members to understand and utilize their capabilities as well as learn from previous deployments of other team members in order to integrate them into their training and employing them when in the field 1 fm 324 december 2006 2 human terrain system conop july 2008 human terrain team handbook chapter 2 overview the human terrain team mission mission statement conduct operationallyrelevant opensource social science research and provide commanders and staffs at the bctrct and division levels with an embedded knowledge capability to establish coherent analytic cultural framework for operational planning decisionmaking and assessment there are three key points to the human terrain team mission statement the first is social science research htts are unique in that they embed social scientists who are expert at developing and executing field research the htt takes the units campaign plan and develops research design th at accounts for the commanders pir and ccir as well as perceive d gaps in the units cultural knowledge this research sign identifies the knowledge requirements that the team can then address through specific missions amongst the population the research methods used to illicit this required human terrain informati on include classic anthropological and sociological methods such as semistructured and openended interviews polling and surveys text analysis and participant observation both qualitative nd quantitative methodologies are used based on the re search required second is making the gathered data operationallyrelevant the human terrain information gathered by the team through the execution of their research design is analyzed and collated by the team but if it is not distributed and briefed in relevant manner it is worthless data one of the key functions of the team leader and research manager is to take that da ta from the social science research and couch it in terms familiar to military audience making it not significantly timeconsuming and insure it is operationallyrelevant to the units operations and problemset finally is creating an analytic cultural fr amework for operational planning decisionmaking and assessment the team must not only conduct relevant research and make it usable to the unit they must also insure it is incorporated in to the continuous planning processes us unclassified 4 human terrain team handbook conducted by the commander and staff human terrain information is of use to the unit unless it is integrated into the continuous planning and decision making processes the team must be tied into all planning processes incl uding relevant working groups assessment boards etc that can utilize human terrain data and socio cultural awareness sources of human terrain information there are many sources that team members can leverage in order to ascertain human terrain information within their area of operations and support unit planning these sources provide framework for analysis and are result from the culmination of study from variety of sources and require assi duous persistence to maintain sound cultural linguistic and histor ical understanding is the teams foundation of understanding but contemporary research and knowledge will place these understandi ngs in their proper current context there is degree of latitude in how the team maintains their understanding of the human terrai n but the following are possible sources by means exhaustive they can turn to in order to remain current in their regional and local situational awareness field research through unit patrolsmissions engaging the locals and observing their customs and habits personally is indispensable to collecting accurate data there is some information that can only be collected by the team interacting in person with the local residents the units patrols and missions into the operating us unclassified 5 human terrain team handbook us unclassified 6 environment are prime opportunity for the htt to collect this information census type data that are relevant to the needs of the unit unemployment literacy educati on etc and local perceptions is information that can be very diffi cult to collect systematically in dangerous areas and could be coll ected while on these missions additionally the team will find that they are able to collect great deal of unintended information as they make observations while accompanying the unit in the area collecting data and information directly from the local residents will buttress the credibility of their analysis collecting data in this fashion will require that the team members be comfortable with inte rviewing techniques and the use of interpreters accompanying units on patrols will allow the hta to know realistically what informa tion the soldiers interpreters auxiliary personnel etc have access to in order to generate questions and avenues of exploitation for the unit themselves to pursue quite often soldiers find themselves id surrounded by local residents some that know english and not re ally sure how to take advantage of the opportunity because they dont have any specific direction the htt will be able to draft up reasonable list of questions for the unit to focus their attention on ra ther than discussing superfluous information local unit reports the supported unit generates variet of reports articulating current activity in all phases of the units operations inte lligence updates assessments and traffic analyses human intelligence humint reports situation reports sitre ps from the various branches psyop civil affairs iqatf etc the reports generated by the individual units red team assessme nts and regionconflictspecific reports ie sectarian report hos t nation law enforcement evaluation reports etc detail aspects of the conf lict that are relevant to the unit much of the units tasking will derive from the issues identified in these reports and the htt benefits from being familiar with their contents to ask intelligent and info rmed questions when that tasking does come news sources news sources are an excellent way to stay abreast of local regional and international events trends and attitudes there are number of ways to acquire this information from online news feeds to hard human terrain team handbook us unclassified 7 copy subscriptions there is vast availability of news and the htt may choose to sample sources from variety of ideologies formats languages to achieve their obj ective compilation of news summaries is the most efficient means of assimilating great deal of information in limited time if an item seems particularly pertinent to the htts operational environment oe they can devote more time to it some regions locally produce compilation of salient regional news items from arab medi and translate them into english ie the baghdad mosquito these products provide convenient means for the team to remain current and understand regional perceptions when reviewing ne ws items team members should focus their attention on specific i ssues and events it may be worthwhile to compile list of sign ificant issues relating to their oe and the region and find news items th at deal specifically with those issues certainly new issues will arise and previously significant issues will become obsolete but as the teams time is limited in this regard only those items that direct ly pertain should be attended to external agency reports number of research organizati ons think tanks ngos and the us government conduct analysis on topics of regional interest these reports address wide range of issu and are useful in considering all factors that may influence cal and regional perceptions and behavior brookings the center for strategic an d international studies parameters rand the small wars journal long war journal foreign policy strategi c studies institute congressional research service and the intern ational journal of middle east studies are sample of some of th organizations that conduct this analysis many of the aforementi oned organizations conduct analysis on issues spanning the globe not ju st that pertinent to iraq and afghanistan several tiers of the american military in country also conduct onsite analysis and much of this useful to the htt unit and external agency meetings meetings provide an interface betw een organizations that are not articulated or summarized in reports this dialogue allows the team glimpse at the units priorities nd operational evolution the htt can use these opportunities to determ ine the kind of cultural analytic support the unit could benefit from the units hold variety of meetings that cover local governan ce economics security forces human terrain team handbook us unclassified 8 intelligence updates nonlethal targeting and information operations general knowledge of current status of these aspects of the conflicts round out the teams situa tional awareness loca l meetings are also useful source of situational aw areness teams may be able to accompany units to attend these mee tings as the units themselves normally attend meetings addressi ng essential services security reconciliation the repatriation of internally displaced persons idps local governance meetings and business expos can provide the htt with an understanding from the perspective of the local population facilitati ng the communication of this perspective in their analysis scholarly literature the teams social scientist through academic channels may have access to sites that store scholarly literature this resource provides regional assessments and analyses conducted by academic specialists this resource can best be used fo r historical context and longterm research as scholarly literature is not necessarily the most current information debriefinginterviews the htt will not be able to particip ate in every worthwhile patrol to gather the information they may n eed to support their research and it will be necessary to acquire that information from garrisoned units and individuals the unit staff themselves have some of the information the htt needs to answer their research questions many times these individuals have in formation they do not consider particularly valuable or they never think to report because it is not individually relevant to anything gathered properly and from the right people this information paints comprehensive picture of the operating environment organic resources variety of resources are availabl to the htt within the unit they supports the units branches offices and subordinate units are able to provide many answers to the questions the team need answered these offices will have compiled historical data for their respective areas and frequently the team will ne ed to go further to collect the required information some of thes attached or subordinate units human terrain team handbook us unclassified 9 conduct patrols among the local populat ion regularly and are able to escort team members or will have the information already these resources include civil affairs ca psychological operations psyop information operations io embedded provincial reconstruction teams eprt the unit assisting the security forces in forensic matters united states agency for international development usaid military training teams mtt national police trainingtransition teams nptt specialized branches the reconciliation officer the contracts officer etc interpreters and other specialized military and governmental offices in the region upon receipt of tasking the htt will determine which if any of these resources could be solicited to satisfy the tasking requirements local resources the team will also have access to number of local organizations individuals and offices from which they will be able to gather information as american forces continue to engage the local population individuals and organi zations will step forward to facilitate their efforts indi viduals from government offices businesses law enforcement and military units community organizations contractors etc may be able to provide the htt with their information collection the nature of the relationships between american forces and the local popula tion will differ from area to area and the team will need to asse ss these relationships prior to consideration of their use as source of information liaison with subordinate units the htt can establish extremely beneficial relationships with subordinate units these units have intimate localized knowledge of their respective areas and this in formation is often required in broader assessments subordinate its tend to have greater need and more appreciation for the services an htt can provide and will generally ask for assistance or in formation more frequently as htts do not have their own trans portation assets th subordinate units are necessary for the htt to travel off military bases the team may want to take the opportunity to assess the cultural knowledge gaps and undeclared needs of the unit and offer their respective services the subordinate units as they spend significant portion of their time among the local population can benefit from the kind of cultural awareness training the h tt could provide the more human terrain team handbook exposure the unit has to the kind of information the team deems important in the field the more willing and proficient they will become in collecting similar inform ation for the benefit of the team and for their own benefit the structure of the team reflect s the unique nature of human terrain team and how they conduct research also the way in which an htt addresses and levera ges the sources of human terrain information is based on the organi zation of the team and each team members roles us unclassified 10 human terrain team handbook chapter 3 organization and structure the human terrain team consists of five to nine military and civilian personnel each team will include at least one team leader one social scientist one resear ch manager and two human terrain analysts more robust team is preferred due to operational constraints and the need for the team to both take part in the planning and decision making processes at th unit headquarters and push team members out among the population to gather human terrain information to feed that process the optimum composition of the team would include at least one member of the team will speak the language of the area of operation one member will be subject matter expert of the area and one team member will be female to allow the team access to the 50 of the population frequently overlooked in military operations figure 1 human terrain team composition social scientist social scientist research manager human terrain analyst research manager human terrain analyst human terrain analyst human terrain analyst team leader us unclassified 11 human terrain team handbook us unclassified 12 human terrain team leader tl the human terrain team leader tl is the commanders principal human terrain advisor they are responsible for focusing and supervising the teams effo rts based on the units needs and integrating the collected information into military staff decision making processes at minimum the tl is an active duty or retired military officer with experience advising o6o5 level commanders and has experience as principal brig ade or higher staff officer the key task for tl is to successfully integrate the htt into the unit in an effective manner becoming th commanders trusted advisor team leader mission essential task list act as the commanders human terrain advisor direct all aspects of htt activities serve as the primary interface between the htt and the unit commander insure the integration of human rrain into the planning processes provide human terrain mapping and estimates to the commander before analysis brief staff on pertinent cultural effects in the operating area evaluate the human terrain agai nst friendly enemy courses of action assist the bct staff velop courses of action represent the human terra in during unit planning analyze orders to determine the co mmanders intent in reference to the human terrain approve and disseminate cultural products monitor team requests for research figure 2 team leader metl social scientist ss purpose the social scientist is th unique member of human terrain team they advise the commander and staff in all human terrain matters and in particular the research methods required to collect that necessa ry information functions the ss manages ethnographic and socialscience research tying the teams resear ch design with the units campaign design or operational concept and conducts ethnographic and social human terrain team handbook us unclassified 13 science analysis based on information gathered the ss is an academically qualified maphd cultural anthropologist sociologist international relations political science or economics expert duties tasks responsibilities the ss assists the team and unit to create common operating picture in relation to the human terrain they achieve this by using pattern analysis to detect underlying cultural assumptions about the wo rld and using cultural operational knowledge to keep units away from mistaken policy and practice and prevent the misapplication of fo rce they also support the commanders decisionmaking process by recommending options for the use of nonlethal effects to bu ild trust form partnerships and apply informed cultural knowledge to problem solving and building solutions all while mapping the human terrain of the unit area of operations as well as the local populations social scientist missio n essential task list advise the htt and staff on th cultural components of the environment conduct manage ethnographic research and analysis participate in the planning processes coordinate the cultural preparati on of the environment and cultural data collection activities analyze cultural data assist in the development of information operation plans identify cultural data and knowledge gaps identify specified and implied cultural data requirements analyze the operating area against cultural data brief staff on pertinent cultural effects in the operating area assess other characteristics of th battlefield leaders population demographics social ethnic and religion etc assess how the population sees th coalition and the adversary assess the local populati ons interests and issues and what impact planned activities might have identify areas of contention within society provide local area interpretati on of collected human terrain information organize and manage focus groups with locals figure 3 social scientist metl human terrain team handbook us unclassified 14 research manager rm purpose the research manager is an in tegral part of any hts team and is primarily responsible for knowledge management information tracking product dissemination re search strategy development and implementation and developing da ta processing techniques and standards functions the rm works closely with th social scientist ss to develop draft explain and implem ent research designstrategy for given mission or research project this is critical for successful mission and for good longterm continuity the rm is also responsible for information track ing and storage eg requests for research final products data files field notes etc this function allows for information flow by developing standard operating procedures for official requests for information data processing compilation and dissemination dditionally the rm works to incorporate cultural knowledge into the brigade bde or battalion bn staff duties tasks responsibilities the research manager has many duties tasks and responsibiliti that cover broad range of categories the rm participation in mission planning is to develop document and integrate the research strategy into the mission activities of the human terrain team htt and into that of the unit with which the team will embed the research plan is not single plan but series of contingencie s it is vital that contingency strategies be developed because the mission and the research opportunities can change without notice the rm is involved in working groups which gives htt voice and allows for the potential to help shape future operations by aiding in the cultural preparation of the nvironment the rm is involved in these working groups based on his or her background as well as field experience this assembly provides htt an opportunity to interject cultural knowledge into future operations across all lines of operations it also provides an opport unity to established focus to the working group small goals with cult ural influences in mind can be established that will lead to the development of sound foundation the rm is not the only participant in these meetings but is certainly in the position to provide valued input additionally by attending these meetings the rm can get better understanding of the bdes human terrain team handbook us unclassified 15 intent and potentially discover new areas that demand research action from the htt the processing storing dissemina ting and tracking of data are critical responsibilities of the rm developing standard operating procedures sop for file management data processing dissemination and tracking will allow the team to easily locate archived information these sops will also allow for smoother intra team operations through uniformity additionally the means by which these are accomplished may differ amongst hts organizations but the importance is that each team has an sop for these actions the rm should also design means to capture team duties roles and activities for continuity purposes all team members may not always be present which means that each person will acquire extra duties from other team positions thus continuity and transfer of knowledge is crucial to team succe ss developing continuity book is duty that must be created as soon as possible the rm is also potential collector of data from field research this means that he or she must become very familiar with the research process and ethnographic interviewing these skills are also vital in the development of the research strategy research manager mission essential task list integrate human terrain collec tion plan with unit intelligence collection plan maintain the human terrain com ponent of the common operating picture using the cultural prep aration of the environment develop human terrain information requirements secondary collector of human terrain data from coalition elements collect and develop opera tionallyrelevant info rmation pertaining to human terrain manage the teams requests for assistance from subject matter experts the reachback research center and intheater resources analyze available sources of local cultural information figure 4 research manager metl human terrain team handbook us unclassified 16 human terrain analyst hta purpose the human terrain analyst hta is the human terrain teams htt cultural regional and in some cases linguistic expert certain forbidding areas have been cl osed to direct social and cultural research for decades the availability of social scientists with extensive field experience in these areas is presently lacking until time when social science can be co nducted more freely in regions where htts are deployed the hta supplements the social scientists methodological expertise with cultural and regional expertise the hta provides the htt resource of situational awareness and deeper understanding of how the culture influences the battle space the htas primary function is data collection and the assessment and analysis of that data this data and its subsequent analysis support the social scientist in satisfying the requirements of the unit they support functions derived from unit and t eamdriven tasking the hta conducts open source research interviews debriefs accompanies units on patrols attends unit nd local meetings reads reports engages with individuals of local influence reviews scholarly literature and any other means nece ssary to collect the information required to satisfy the tasking the hta assesses this information for relevance conducts analysis to extract themes and draw conclusions and compiles it in form that is sensible and usable to the social scientist or unit the hta also advises and trains as called upon to do so role within the htt structure the hta assumes much of the dutie s pertaining to data collection initial assessment and analysis the tasking is communicated to the hta through the research manager there will be occasions where the hta will need to collaborate with the social scientist the team leader and the research manage r but the htas daytoday functions will require coordination w ith just the research manager team meetings will be the ideal ve hicle for this collaboration and the hta social scientist team leader and research manager will work together to formulate resear ch and data collection plans among the different positions on the htt the hta will spend more time collecting data from the field interacting with local residents and gathering information from individua ls within the supported unit human terrain team handbook us unclassified 17 duties tasks responsibilities the hta plays critical role in providing cultural and linguistic support to the research dir ected by the social scien tist this role will be balanced with tasks assigned di rectly to the htt by the supported unit the hta will participat in collecting data conducting research analyzing the data and drafting reports in support of unit requests for information rfis the tasking of the social scientist and selfinitiated projects th hta may also be called upon to conduct training for and advise the supported unit to maximize hisher efficacy as resource of cultu ral and regional expertise it is imperative that the hta develop and sustain sound situational awareness this will allow the hta to address wide range of topics with confidence situational awareness situational awareness is the htas greatest asset current situational awareness provides framework for analysis and it results form the culmination of st udy from variety of sources and requires assiduous persistence to maintain sound cultural linguistic and historical understa nding is the htas foundation of context but contemporary situ ational awareness will place these understandings in their proper modern context there is degree of latitude in how the hta maintains hisher regional and situational awareness but the following are possible sources by means exhaustive the hta could tap to rema in current in their regional and situational awareness analysis once the hta has collected and compiled the information it will need to be subject to analysis invariably each hta will apply their own individual style of analysis to the data but despite stylistic differences the hta should consisten tly consider certain guidelines the following is not exhaustive but are techniques to consider when applying the collected da ta to analysis human terrain team handbook us unclassified 18 determine relevance to tasking once the data has been collected the hta will need to sort through it to determine was is directly relevant to the tasking analysis should be conducted on only that information which pertains directly to the request to retain its coherence and the requestors attention in the course of collecting data the ht is going to encounter lot of interesting information information that would benefit the unit in its mission and objectives this informa tion if not directly relevant to the tasking should be reserved for parate analyses individuals of the supported unit are already read ing several oper ational reports each day and dont typically have time to read tangential additions to reports interpreting data once the relevant data has been isolated and compiled the hta will interpret the whole body of info rmation according to certain guidelines some primary consid erations in interpreting this information relate to the htas understanding of the request its relevance within the broader c ontext national obj ectives how the information fits in human terrain frame and how the information is relevant to the needs and success of the supported unit understanding the tasking the hta must ensure that heshe understands the intent behind the request the hta will normally rely on the research managers efforts to narrow down and clarif the request so appropriate information is collected and conclusions are drawn when interpreting data this must be primary considera tion in order to focus the analysis and conclusions on the desire of the requestor this will also be consideration when the hta sifts through the data to determine if it is re levant to the tasking situational awareness the hta will have the advantage of placing the body of information within the broader context of hishe r situational awareness the big picture will often determine the true nature of localized phenomena and isolated events the hta will re ly on the totality of information they have accumulated to determ ine the essence of the unitlevel human terrain team handbook us unclassified 19 snapshot they are analyzing role and objectives the nature of the units involvement role and objectives will also color the htas conclusions and recommendations the htas interpretation will vary according to the units role whether that be counterinsurgency nation building occupation peace keeping kinetic operations or combination of these roles as the american militarys focus and training continue to revolve around kinetic operations it is likely there are still units deploying that have aspirations of filling nonkine tic role and most units dont understand the principles of their ro specifically with regard to counterinsurgency even if they did want to conduct it the more educated the hta is in these nonki netic roles the more heshe will be able to provide useful analysis and recommendations human terrain human terrain comprises the entire spectrum of society and culture this should be the focus of the ht as interpretation in nonkinetic roles the population is the primar battlefield and the hta will have considerable knowledge of this aspect the hta will need to determine how to win the support of the local population how certain coa will mitigate distrust between the local population and will use their extensive familiarity w ith all aspects of the local society and culture to make t hose determinations so what regardless of the task the hta should be continually asking himselfherself this question the hta needs to bear in mind how their analysis or conclusions are re levant to the needs and success of the unit and how their analysis nd conclusions satisfy the tasking this is particularly important in selfinitiated products like assessments and media summaries critical thinking critical thinking is perh aps the most underrated aspect of analysis because it is difficult to look bus while thinking those that do engage in this activity are seen as lazy or spacey htas should be human terrain team handbook us unclassified 20 given some latitude in how they conduct their activities focus should be on results rather than on how they are achieved thoughtful analysis requires liberation pondering assessment reflection and speculati on activities that are discouraged in high paced environments manipulating data w ith software tools in order to make sense of some of the data collected and to minimize the amount of time the social scie ntist will need to interpret and incorporate the htas data the hta will need to use software applications to organize collate c onsolidate and explain the data submitting the data and analysis in form usable to the social scientist will facilitate its incorporation into finished product and avoid confusion procedural employment of methods and strategies task assignment and coordination though tasking should normally be communicated through the research manager or the team lead er for the sake of order and simplicity and to avoid any confusion the hta will often receive requests from individuals units or offices when taking request the hta should relay the tasking di rectly to the research manager for normal processing and clarificat ion upon receipt of the request the research manager will assign it to the hta with the greatest aptitude to fulfill the requirements of the task the team leader social scientist research manager and appointed hta will collaborate on researchdata coll ection plan they will discuss the context of the request the need s of the requestor and clarify any ambiguities or logical gaps in the request the team leader is uniquely positioned to translate m ilitary rfis into tasks understood by those not familiar with army protocol and back into military speak for the requesting individual the social scientist will understand the academic and methodological requirements to accomplish the task the research manager will be the active liaison between the social scientist and the hta to ensure the tasks are clearly understood the data collection is relevant to the request and that the data collection is abidi ng by time requirements established by the requestor the research manager will also act as liaison between the htt and the requestor clarif ying the tasking if necessary and human terrain team handbook us unclassified 21 reporting the htts progress in co mpleting the task the team leader social scientist research manager and appointed hta will collaborate on researchdata coll ection plan they will discuss the context of the request the need s of the requestor and clarify any ambiguities or logical gaps in the request researchdata collection plan from the tasking the social scie ntist research manager and hta will devise plan to collect all th data and conduct all the research necessary to fulfill the tasking th ey will determine what data needs to be collected how it is to be co llected the sources from which it will be collected and what their limitations are in collecting the data they need depending on the experi ence of the hta certain degree of autonomy will be granted the hta to plan and conduct hisher research as deemed suitable to accomplish the task however the social scientist and research ma nager will generally have more expertise in how to manage resear ch and collect data and the hta will normally defer to them in these matters as the htas are typically the cultural and regional experts they will occasionally need to assist the research ma nager in understanding the tasking from cultural perspective the team will determine if the request warrants the services of the rrc and the research manager will coordinate those requests for the t eam team collaboration is always the most propitious method for effective data collection interpretation and analysis individual research plan and management subsequent to team collaboration to determine the htas tasking the hta will need to develop more detailed individual research plan the hta will narrow the broader tasks down to manageable duties to facilitate collection the hta will list specific sources and methods to obtain the information that may in clude things such as individuals in the unit attendance of specific it meetings internet sites that contain pertinent information cal contacts past rrc reports drawing on previous experience th ink tank reports etc the hta will list every source that could satisfy his individual tasks tracking the sources accessed and tasks completed will allow the hta to organize hisher work and comm unicate progress to the research manager human terrain team handbook us unclassified 22 coordinating transportation and scheduling the htas individual research plan may contain number of local and unit sources and meetings as htts dont have their own transportation assets they will need to rely on other units for that accommodation the hta will be responsible for making these arrangements with the individual units the hta will also make arrangements personally or through the respective units to meet and communicate with local contacts if debriefings and interviews are necessary to acquire the needed information the hta will need to schedule those with the appr opriate individualsunits coordination and communication with rm the hta will need to be in c onstant communication with the research manager to ensure that the data being gathered corresponds to the tasking that it is being gath ered appropriately that deadlines are being met that any additional clarification of tasking is being communicated that the hta understa nds the nature and context of the tasking and that it is being put in form usable to the social scientist this communication will allow the hta to update the research manager on hishe r progress and pass along any immediately pertinent information th at may assist the unit or social scientist in their ongoing efforts assessing collected data once the hta has completed the colle ction of the required data and information heshe will need to ma ke preliminary assessment of the data to determine the datas relevance according to hisher understanding of the tasking and situational awareness some information gathered will not direc tly pertain to th essence of the request and the hta will need to recognize what should be excluded from inclusion in any assessment or analysis the hta will assemble the information and draft it into report or form suitable to the needs of the social scientist or unit this may require the manipulation of the data with soft ware tools and applications the hta may want to include the softwa re tools and applications that may facilitate assessment or analysis in hisher individual research plan the hta should carefully cite all sources used throughout the processes of collection and analysis and include those sources with the finished product human terrain team handbook us unclassified 23 standardized format storage and dissemination of products for the purposes of continuity and organization the format of all finished products should be standa rdized specific logical naming convention should be applied to ev ery report or team product the

to c onduct cultural pr eparation of the environment cpe this conti nuous process is similar to the traditional intelligence preparation of the battlefield ipb but instead of focus on threats the cpe is focused on the sociocultural information of the area of operations the team prior to and during the deployment researches the area of operations during the deployment cpe consists of collecting atmospherics conducting polling surveys and interviews of the local population the longer the team is on the ground the clear er the cpe will become fusing of the cpe and commanders pir as well as httidentified cultural knowledge gaps in the units campa ign plan the team creates research design this research design will address those knowledge requirements and help the team c oordinate their cultural research activities across the unit staff and maneuver units the second key task of the htt is to integrate human terrain information into the unit planning processes once the team has developed research design they formulate collection plan that will meet the information requirements identified during the research design development this task occurs before specific operations being planned incorporating the cpe into the units mission analysis proposing nonlethal courses of ac tion identifying the second and third order effects of possible cour ses of action and taking part in wargaming from the population perspective the third key task is providing s upport to current operations during an operation being conducted by the unit an htt is invaluable the team takes part in the operation by both monitoring events and on the ground assessments which then provide the commander and staff human terrain team handbook us unclassified 25 with cultural decisionadjustment points and the outcomes of possible responses these quick adjustments and mitigating strategies to the operation could be the key to sway ing the population away from local threats monitoring of events and taking part in the operation by assessments on the ground then feed the cultural aspect of the commanders common operating picture cop by the htt examples of htt support to cu rrent operations are commander preparations for key leader engage ments building relationships that facilitate meaningful engageme nts with local power brokers ethnographic interviewscollect ion during medcapsvetcaps civil affairs missions or humanitari an assistance missions all of these events create an opportunity fo r the team to gather local cultural information that help shape the units operational planning the fourth key htt task is evalua ting the human terrain effects of the area of operations during c ontinuous fullspectrum operations the htt is continually assessing wh at effect our operations as well as threat operations are having on the local population every effect we try to attain against our threats and every effect they in turn take against us affects the local populace the htt s job is to not only assess what effect is occurring bu t also to predict the second and third order effects of possible futu re operations in support of the unit the htt also assesses the information operations measures of effectiveness and performance recommending adjustments andor outcomes of the current assessment fr amework in turn the team also evaluates the effects the human rrain is having on our operations and threat operations finally the htt supports the it by training all elements on relevant sociocultural issues this is effective on the bctdiv staff but is most effective at ba ttalionlevel and below since they have the primary responsibility for the operational area and have the most contact with the local population the most basic training involves cultural awareness

team provide s the commander backbrief andor report describing an independ ent analysis of the human terrain information gathered at the engage ment and cultural cues spoken and unspoken identified throughout th event and thei r significance support to reconciliation the htt can be key resource in promoting the reconciliation process by building relationships with local power brokers particularly actors previ ously viewed as irreconcilable by building relationships through th exploration of exis ting relationships by following the local tribal and religious cultural structures the team can bring the required local leaders to the negotiation table the information through which the team identifies the power brokers is based on local social economic and political data within the area of operations social data related to re conciliation exists on three levels the neighborhood in which the reco ncilers operate possesses certain demographic characteristics this includes population density family size education levels tribal affiliations and sectarian identity once this census data is collected potential reconcilers can then be situated by their sectarian tribal and family connections these connections can be mapped the resu lt of which is picture of the social network the social level also includes in stitutions these may be mosques and churches recreation centers criminal gangs womens groups human terrain team handbook us unclassified 44 and nonprofit organizations indi vidual ties to each of these institutions can be identified in addition to the demographic level and the institutional level there is the level of peoples perceptions and attitudes people behave in ce rtain ways and adopt certain habits as result of their upbringing and th eir experiences knowledge of these habits and perceptions can be brought to bear when trying to understand what is promoting and what is hindering the reconciliation process if reside nts of the neighborhood do not come out publicly and support reconciliat ion it may be due to the prior patterns of survival adopted during pr evious regimes rather than due to any opposition to reconciliation understanding this behavior pattern can then assist in tailoring the reconciliation process in such way such that it is viewed as neutral and nonthreatening rather than being perceived as favoring one party or anothe r reconciliation can be conducted by impartial mediat ors the reconc iliation message might work better if it is couched in terms of benefiting everyone rather than just the reconcilers other connections occur at the econo mic level one can begin at the demographic level by mapping the income levels in the neighborhood layered on top of th at is representation of the economic institutions in the neighborhood these include businesses such as restaurants movie theate rs coffee houses banks etc each neighborhood experiences patterns of money flow both into the neighborhood and out of the neighbo rhood as resident the person in our example is plugged into this money flow question that can be asked is what is the source of wealth generated by this individual that is contributing to the nei ghborhoods economic resources and what is the destination of wealth this individual extracts from the neighborhood when reconciliati on is perceived as supporting neighborhood development then more people are likely to support it this perceptual is also important when it comes to what people say about reconciliation is it ne w trick by high level government officials to make money or is it chance for businesses to thrive in an environment of stability another process that occurs in any neighborhood is the creation and destruction of social economic nd political obligations people do favors for each other they help th eir friends kids succeed in school they give out loans to each other they let their relatives use their cars they vote for the candidate fa vored by their tribe all of these exchanges of favors and resources ar part of the cultural landscape human terrain team handbook us unclassified 45 of the neighborhood by mapping th is landscape decisionmakers can make more informed decisions about how to encourage participation by those who might be helpful to reconciliation finally power plays an important role in every neighborhood there are some groups that have more power and some groups that have less reconciliation may empower those who are weaker if the individual in this example belongs to weaker tribe reconciliation may be path to empowerment on the other hand he may be associated with powerful political party reconciliation may be threat to their power if they oppose it so the partys support for reconciliation may give this indivi dual an incentive to support it as well additional factors can be weighed in as well many tribes subscribe to process of mediation ie sulh shura etc mediator can bring together two tribes that ve been fighting each other in circumstances where the tribes w ould not engage in negotiations on their own4 support to information operations the htt can provide

and like all othe r crafts takes practice practice and more practi ce some of th is practice should come from your training but th more you conduct in theater the more proficient the team will become remember you should never expect to do perfect research ju st expect that each time you do research project you will bring more and more experience to the effort and that your abilities to gather and analyze data and write up the results will get better and better 5 there are several chapters in his book research methods in anthropology qualitative and quantitative approaches 4th ed team members

significance of the project an accompanying document is written outlining how the research will comply with the protection of human research subjects accordi ng to 45 cfr 46 to ensure the research falls within acce pted ethical guidelines therefore the activities of each human terrain team will be guided by an ethnographic research design like all wellplanned research these designs will be based on research problems phrased in terms of thesis the problems themselves will refer to particular social theory these problems are test ed through hypotheses which enable the researcher to test their explanatory force the data that result are 6 drawn from recommendations from dr marcus b griffin htt iz2 human terrain team handbook us unclassified 56 used to validate or refute hypotheses demonstrate the validity of the thesis statement and by doing so affirm the overarching social theorys utility as way of understanding the social world as part of the research we will eventually use the organization of cultural materials schema in order to contribute our research results to an existing database of cultura l practices and social systems known as the human relations area f iles hraf housed at yale university this practice allows us to provide significant abundant and contemporary sociocultural information that others around the world may use in their own research this practice will also allow us to tie into the hraf database and compare the existence of one social practice symbolic system or historical process in our area of operations with others elsewhere in the world such crosscultural analysis enables us to get closer to explaining causation and make weak assertions of what will likely happen in the population in the near future this approach allows hts to be proactive and transparent we rightfully claim to be qualitatively different from what entities like civilian affairs intelligence psy op and information operations do and we are subsequently impervious to claims that we engage in clandestine research the results of our research provide nontarget data that suggests courses of action to the commander and his staff our research is performed in the same manner in which academic social scientists conduct their res earch and is similarly rooted in theory and complete with ethical re view boards significant benefit is that we enter the field with plan for our daily activities and are not waiting around for someone in th unit to ask us to do something that may be of an intelligence na ture that compromises our ethical integrity and claim

with which the htt embeds educate ourselves on the area in which we will be operati ng and then develop methods and tools to gather organize and anal yze the information we gather in order to present our findings to the customer the first step of this process is combing through our collection of data in order find out what we alr eady have on the area it is very important to do premission data pu ll before requesting information products from the reachback research cell rrc the rrc can be of assistance if they are given enough time to develop product 7 created by tom garcia htt af1r human terrain team handbook us unclassified 58 this second step is the key to st epping off with the correct foot focusing htt research creating or tailoring intervie w techniques and tools in order to gather the desire d information and data from those whom will be interviewed this step also requires lot of coordination in order to set up the meeting with the host unitelement it is most beneficial to accomplis h this as far in advance of the mission start date as possible th at sounds like common sense but it can sometimes be pushed aside inadvertently the intent of this step is to ali gn the proverbial ducks in row thus understanding the customer their needs and on what the htt should focus the initial question should be in the effort of understanding what the customer wants to know and what they are trying to know understand andor achieve typicall the question is simply asked directly what is your goal what do you want to know or understand what are the desired ffects you are trying to achieve please be mindful that very importa nt part of what we htt do is to identify and foresee the tertiary effects of the actions that have been or may be taken it is being able to identify these items which allow us to present our informati on in such manner as to support future plans or discourage those actionsshaping the battle space our role in that effort is rooted in our ability to bring different perspective to the table we unders tand what our customer wants we develop methods and tools to gather the information we organize analyze and report our findings rela tive to the area of operations and overarching objectives of the battalion and the brigade the third step this process is come together as group to identify themes from the customer based on the premission known in this whiteboarding session we attempt to identify the salient topics of interest however it must be kept in mind that this is what the customer thinks he wants the customer may always be right in business but the customer does not always know exactly what he wants therefore our goal in th whiteboarding ssions is not only to identify the themes but also to attempt to understand what they customer needs based on what he thinks he wants are you tracking for instance the maneuver commander wants to know about the tribal dynamics when economics is much more larger and important item to

more detailed cultural perspective sample research plan can be found in appendix c methods the methods chosen to address the t eams research plan are dictated by two factors where the research request is coming from and the timeline available to acquire the necessary information research questions can come from two principle sources until units become familiar with how an htt works and where they fit into the planning processes the teams prim ary avenue of research questions are developed by the team itself addressing what they view as the sociocultural knowledge gaps of the unit based on the commanders priority information requirements and the focus of operations the teams can ascertain areas in which they can best affect the unit the second source of rese arch requests come from the unit itself generally tasked by the co mmander based on need he sees the team can fill the selfdirected research is benefi cial because it allows the htt to affect planning and operations wher they know their capabilities can best be used however fusing that information into the units processes is more difficult and ne eds to be sold to the commander and staff after plan ning has already begun human terrain team handbook us unclassified 62 in contrast directed research places constraints upon the team possibly not using all of their capabili ties or not to their full potential it is beneficial however in that by tasking them within the current planning and informationgathering efforts the team will get their thoughts and recommendations into th planning processes earlier making quicker impact the time available for research also falls into two categories long term and shortterm longterm res earch is the more favored of the social sciences and therefore the htt the longer team can observe and research issues and populations the more defined picture becomes and greater the und erstanding can affect planning shortterm projects can be turned into longterm but are primarily short due to operational constraints in fullspectrum operations the units planning is constrained and th erefore input must be timely and relevant to make significan t impact the htt must be able quickly and accurately address shor tterm research questions while populating longterm research with information that will more significantly affect unit pl anning in the longterm ethnographic research there are three ways to conduct eth nographic research for the unit 1 conduct individual fieldwork by accompanying units that conduct operations within the local populat ions 2 train local national informants to ask survey questions in lieu of or conjunction with the htt on the ground and 3 trai n company commanders platoon leaders and their soldiers to see the world from social science perspective so they can conduct ong oing collection of the populations in their areas collecting and s ynthesizing all the information from these various sources assists the t eam to create more indepth picture of the local populations for the commander and his staff interviewing8 interviewing skills are extremely im portant for member of human terrain team interviewing can also be one of the most challenging tasks you will face most people do not have much experience conducting interviews even seas oned interviewers are always 8 garcia tom interviewing 101 for the human terrain team march 2008 human terrain team handbook us unclassified 63 learning new techniques enhancing their skills and developing their personal interviewing style we gather the majority of our information from interviews in the field or on base and it is for this reason that one must work very hard to develop good interviewing styleand overcome any fears bout interviewing you may have you can learn the basics of inte rviewing by reading about them but actually applying the techniques is very different the only way to learn how to conduct an intervie w or improve your skills is by practice every interv iew session will be different even if you are following structured interview survey form the dynamics in interviewing come from you and your informant or respondent key person interviewee etc gathering information from local knowledgeable sources lks is the primary means by which you will employ develop and enhance your interviewing skills the information you gather regardless of the method or type can be used for qualitative or quantitative products qualitative and quantitat ive methods and products are very different animals that serve diffe rent purposes and are used for different audiences however us ing both during an interview can and shouldappear to be seamless simple explanation of qualitative and quantitative can be reduced to this qualitative research is descriptive in nature whereas quantitative research focuses on num bers or quantity qualitative research seeks to describe relationships the observed environment processes etc quantitative res earch seeks to re present the same information by transforming the inform ation into statistical data and using that data to provide visualsta tistical representation in the form of graphs scatter plots network analysis etc all interviews about single subject have comparable units of analysis cua it is these little ge ms that can result in the most beautiful visual depictions of your efforts that can be incorporated into powerpoint presentation the language of the military human terrain team should us mixed methodology using both qualitative and quantitative techniques both of these techniques are necessary to fully and effectivel communicate our message to our audience the challenge here is simply learning how to incorporate both techniques into research design and your interviewing techniques human terrain team handbook us unclassified 64 field notes are another important skillset that member of the human terrain team must devel op though there is not single proper or correct method or format for taking field notes there are several key items that will make postanalysis and writing much easier it is also important that consistency is implemented the main point to keeping in mind about taking field notes is this field notes are all that you will retu rn with from mission you will develop all postmission products ba sed on field notes field notes are everything planning and organization success of any project depends on proper planning and organization the same is true for any htt research project or mission identifying what you want to researchdiscoveror what your customer the unit with which you will embed wants to learn is where planning begins for example prt commander says that he does not understand the tribal dynamics of the area and that he would also like to know the pulse of the population how are you going to answer his questions during the mission as well as postmission what areas will you focus on in order to answer the tribal dynamics what questions will you ask of the prt commander do you know what the pulse of the population means is your definition the same as the prt commanders does your definition really matter defining and understanding the goals of the mission leaders is very important htt as whole shoul d understand what the objective of the mission is and what effects are trying to be achieved clear definition of what your customer wa nts from you is must clear understanding of your customers verbiage terms phrases and specific military terminology is also very important planning starts with your understanding of your customers needs and goals it must also be understood that you may not and more likely will not be able to completely answer all of your customers questions with detailed information however what you can do is scratch the surface provide your customer new perspective bring to light something of which your customer was unaware provide your customer with cultural perspectiv or provide your customer with recommendations to positively impact the population of an area this list is by means allin clusive of what you may be able to provide customer but is some of the more common inputs that htt provides human terrain team handbook us unclassified 65 once you understand the needs of your customer you as team should brainstorm the possible approaches to gathering the necessary information that will allow htt to provide the customer with best possible product you will also have to break down the research topics to their lowest common deno minator remember that you can aggregate data that has been collect ed in the smallest possible unit but you cannot breakdown data that has been collected in large or broad categories for example if you collected only the gender of your informants and not their age you have limited your quantitative analysis potential by reducing the nu mber of comparative units of analysis you can only compare ma to female whereas if you had collected the ages of informants you could have compared responses by age groups ie 2025 2630 3140 etc which could potentially pinpoint specific trends to specific age group an example let us look at surveyin g education it would be better quantitatively speaking to collect the total number of years someone has gone to school rather than si mply asking did you graduate high school did you attend college do you hold college degree if you incorporate or ask how many year s did you go to school and also ask any of the other questions you have given yourself multiple comparative units of analysis you can group the number of years and compare them for whatever instead of only being able to compare yes or response organizing your approach is the next step that must be considered this is where you begin to intert wine qualitative and quantitative research methods his mix methodology can come in many forms and is really only limited by your creativity and maybe your informants willingness to provide you with an answer bit of standardization in your interviewing will be necessary but should also be transparent to the informant in any type of interview unstruc tured semistructured structured you can ask all your informants particular number of exact questions for example you can ask each informant their age number of years of education place of residence and favorite color the comparative units of analysis can be anything but remember the smaller the unit the better in the above example you have on the surface minimum of four comparable units of analysis however in reality you have dozens you can compare responses based on those who chose red as their favorite color to any of the other units human terrain team handbook us unclassified 66 you can create age categories and compare favorite colors among are groups and years of education or place of residenceor any combination of units you coul d also aggregate the place of residence to county dist rict state province or region and compare any one those to any of the age cate gories compared to all informants who chose yellow as their favorite color now you can design your interview regardless of the type to always retrieve comparative units of anal ysis that can later be used to produce visualstatistical representa tions that will support and enforce your research findings and conclusi ons ask yourself which of the following would have more impact report that states that young males who ate pickles for breakfast were found to have medulla oblongata which was smaller than aver age or report that states of 100 patients that were examined 85 of those who ate pickles with at least 33 of their breakfast m eals had medulla oblongata that was 22 smaller than the normal average size found in adult males from 2030 years of age combine this with visualstatistical representation and you have some real impacta stand alone product planning is the key to good resear ch organization of your questions research outline research goal and c hoice of the type of interview is where the information gathering pr ocess begins having too much information is not possible you ca n be selective and only use the information that directly relates to your current mission goals and keep the remaining information for future research the more information you have the bett er the postmission product interview techniques there are several research techniqu available but there are few broad categories into which these techniques fall unstructured semi structured and structured variatio ns of these three techniques are virtually infinite and are only limite d to your imagination be free step outside the box there are three things that are the most important elements of interviewing asking listening and remembering these three elements are certainly not the only things you must do during an interview but if you only did thes three things you could consider your session successful interview there may courses of action you human terrain team handbook us unclassified 67 can take that will gr eatly improve the level of success for your interview it just takes practice the ability to accept critiques the ability to critique yourself and the ability to learn how to improve on your shortcomings as member of human terrain team your research and fieldwork will be partially comprised of many techniques participant observation unstruc tured semistructured etc additionally much of your time ga thering data will be done in rapid assessment mode unlike traditional anthropological research projects we do not have the opportunity to spend year or more in one area studying the inhabi tants our missions will provide us anywhere from thirty minutes to couple of days you may have the opportunity to return to location but most often the reality of the situation is that you will only have the opportunity to visit village once during mission and only for few hours it is not uncommon to visit two or three villages in single day this translates into about 90 minutes per village and minimum one hour of transit time to and from the village even in this timelimited environment htt manages to use combination of structured semistr uctured and structured interviews as well as participant observation it all depends on what your focus is the mission goals and the needs of your customer as well as the planning and organizing you did before the mission typical interview may also be combination of two or three interview tasks eg cpi tribal dynamics and pow erbrokers as well as doing visual observation of the area and noting simple description every mission you can expect to be highly occupied and engaged unstructured interviews are essent ially an openended interview and what you discover is up to you and the lks you begin the interview and then follow the lead of the lks or you can direct the lks along path after topic is brought up for example you are interviewing wood merchant j ob with which you are completely unfamiliar hello my name is tom and i work with the human terrain team which is group that studies and learns about culture i am interested in learning about the wood industry and what you do would you teach about what you do after the person agrees to be your teacher what kind of things might you expect to hear the answers co uld be any of thousand it is human terrain team handbook us unclassified 68 expected that the lks will mention things to you that will certainly need to be clarified you may as k something like you mentioned one maan what is that he would ll you that it is common unit of measurement that is equivalent to 7 kilograms though this may very slightly by region this type of interview is best used in domain discovery learning about subjec t you know nothing about but want to categorize and understand completely this technique will allow you to learn and understand such things as cover terms native language procedures outcomes and problemseverything about subject or domain this technique will also allow you to gain framework of domain which will allow you to focus on particular areas of the domain though this chnique is qualitative you can obtain quantitative data for example you can learn about average daily quantity processed sold or sh ipped from particular area this can be compared to wood merchants in other areas you may also be able to collect the average age of employees or daily wageearnings etc there are many things you can compare however you must frame the question in such manner as to obtain the quantitative data case in point the wood merchant tells you that he normally ships two truck loads each day you should cl arify this answer by asking what size of trucks and how much weight or amount each type of truck carries what is considered full load these types of questions will provide you with numerical data that you can use to define and compare units of analysis remember comparable units of analysis are good phrases which describes productenhancing data the semistructured interview starts with framework of questions this type of interview can also be used for domain discovery as guideline for questions your stions can be structured in manner that will elicit specific information about the domain you are researching these types of questi ons may be included in order to expedite the domain discovery qua ntitative questions can also be included semistructured interviews provide an excellent means to learn about topic ie customer needs mission priorities etc rapidly these types of interviews can be done by all members of the team that are in the field which will further expedite the discovery as you will obviously have larger num ber of participants and thus more data it is also important to note that an n number of participantsrespondents of 30 is c onsidered to be valid statistical quantity for saliency or prominence among population that is to say that if you interview 30 random people their responses can be human terrain team handbook us unclassified 69 considered statistically sufficient to identify trends patterns and correlations among population even though n30 is considered statistically relevant meaning that you can use this as basis for projection estimation etc larger n is better and will provide more accurate results consider an n30 for population of 100 versus n30 for population of 5000 obviously the first n quantity will be more representative of the tire population than the second n size structured interview is essentially survey there are some instances where survey format is necessary especially with the limited time we often have in an area structured interviews are typically employed in order to obtain information abou t specific topic in particular format keep in mind that structured interviews leave room for deviation and do not allow the respondent to speak freely about what is most import to his or her at that moment for example you may want to gather information about the wood industry and the respondent is answering your questio ns but he is also telling you about recent hardships in the villa ge which is more important what do you do in my opinion it is matter of time if you have enough time tell him that you would l ove to talk about the hardships because they are important and that you have enough time to talk about that after you learn about the wood industry or maybe you decided his posture simply mands that you learn about the hardships which topic would have more meaning for the mission maybe one has any idea about th hardships this village is experiencing you will have to determine how to handle the situation best each village and population is diffe rent as is each mission you can do some things every time you arrive at location or ask standard questions every time in order to ob tain comparable units of analysis but sometimes the lks will cause you to deviate from your research plan taking you down an unexpected path where you will learn about something that is highly salient or simply point of contention the beauty of this is that you are vi rtually unlimited in your areas of study you are in the field to learn about those topics that are of interest to the customer but they may not be aware of all the things that could be of interest to them human terrain team handbook us unclassified 70 field notes field notes are not merely motion you go through while you are in the field field notes are everything while there is not single correct method for writing field notes there are some key methods to structure your notes that will aid in the coding analyzing and pulling information from your field notes in order to draft final products first field notes are your field notes and you write them in whatever manner you wish you and you alone will have to be able to decipher them at the end of the mission coding allows the element of anonymity the names of your lks s hould not been written anywhere in order to protect that persons iden tity there is an exception to this rule which applies to public offici als as lks since their names are already known and the subject is not controversial it is considered practical to use their real name s this is the only exception the next item to consider is struct ure there are several items that aid in drafting the postmission repor ts as well as developing an assessment of an area one is the acronym spiie op this construct highlights the minimum information we would like to compile and overall focus for each village there are additional villagefocus topics for which you should gather information but these are more specific in nature spiie op security population infras tructure issuesfriction points economy opportunities for engagement perceptionsinteractions security research the security situation ask everyone you talk to about the security situation and how it is compared to last year find out why it is better or worse than last year ask for examples population observe the population see how they are dressed and the state of their cl othes look at their general state of health look at the men women and children present are there lot of children are the women that you see pregnant ask for the tribal information from what tribe is the informant what is the tribe composition of the village which other villages in the area are of the same tribe with which villages do they interact and why any disputes how do the residents live do they farm do they raise animals for consumption andor sale human terrain team handbook us unclassified 71 infrastructure look at the houses observe how the houses are built are they singlefloor homes do they have security wall how are the homes built are they large do they have windows are there shutters is paint used what is the security gate like metal decorated are there signs of prior ngo activities types of animals electricity wells irrigation issuesfriction points discover if there ar prior or existing issues with the coalition forces local army local police other tribes within in the tribes other villages etc discover if there are past incidents with the coalition for which the residents harbor any malcontent economy discover the primary source of income outof country employment are ther lot of men who work out side of afghanistan where does the village grow enough food to sell or trade or do they only grow enough for their own subsistence do people have to borrow money how much how often what are the terms and consequences of the loan from whom do they borrow money from where does that persons money come opportunities for engagement look for ways that things can be improved look for economic opportunities or projects the government can bring that will benefit the greatest number of people quick impact project s longterm sustainment projects perceptionsinteractions discover how people feel about things in the village area or in the government try to find out how they feel about the coalition and local forces how do they perceive things to be compared to last year better worse why it will be very helpful in postmission activities to keep spiie op in mind while writing organizing and pr ocessing your field notes it will to input your field notes into the field notes database much easier it will also allow you to organize your notes by themes which will also assist with analysis this process is by means mandatory but is merely suggested as guide that will help ease the pain of postmission processing of field notes as well as ease of analysis and product development each category of spiie op is meant to be the large umbrella topic which is then followed my specific subcategories also spiie op was created as way to collect the same information about each location visited in an effort to velop current snapshots as well as human terrain team handbook us unclassified 72 historical information that can be used for comparison as means to develop more indepth understand ing of an area district or province the information can also be used as baseline and thereby become gauge to track change in an area finally spiie op is multipur pose tool for htts to collect information in semistructured manner it is meant to act as starting point for gathering information that will produce broad brushstroke and refined microlevel vi ew depending on data and the refinement analysis correlation and collation thereof this tool also offers way to task ourselves when we get bootsontheground it is impossible to believe that one pe rson in brief period of time can collect enough data about every location in order to draft representative snapshot however by task organizing we can break up the responsibilities and allow for more focused research at each location you will most likely gather more information than you originally set out to gather but that is the nature of the beast by having an idea about what to gather you should be able to use this as springboard and means of finding t opics to drill down for more indepth information drilling down drilling down is term for delving d eeper in an effort to discover the root basis of matter the analogy is much like someone looking for treasure you begin your advent ure or discovery mission with map or basic idea of where you ar going and what you want to find once you arrive at your location you examine the environment and scratch the surface then you disc over clues and lead you to start digging deeper there have been many instances wher htts have realized that an opportunity to drill down and possi bly discover spectacular nugget was missed most of the time it was simply the team member focusing too much on one particular topic to notice the opportunity how do you know you missed nuggetdiscovery opportunity usually you learn of your missed oppor tunity later that evening or even days later when you are re viewing your notes or recorded interview improve your techni by reviewing your interviews notes and recordings and learni ng from these missed opportunities human terrain team handbook us unclassified 73 in order to capture these opportuni ties when they arise you can use several techniques one technique is descriptive questioning approach which could possibly involve using specific or guided grandtour questions or you can use specific or guided minitour questions9 you can employ one or combination of these techniques in order to have your lks uncover the information

with interpreters working with interpreters can be very challenging endeavor which can lead to great interview or leave you filled with frustration there are several things that you should consider before working with an interpreter prebrief fi eld activities voice tense and your own sentence structure all aff ect the success or failure of your interview as with everything practice makes perfect and if you have not worked with an interpre ter before you practice as much as possible before going to the field interpreter prebrief this is the foundation of your interview how do you feel being thrown into situation without the sl ightest clue of what is about to occur your interpreter is diffe rent pay them the courtesy of explaining to them what it is your are wanting to ask how you are going to ask it the importance for accurate and unbiased translation from them as well as setting the tone of the interview the more your interpreter knows about what you are trying to achieve or acquire the more they will be able to assist you in that endeavor this will allow them to prepare for the mission the first time your interpreter sees the questions you wa nt to ask should not be in the field that should be done at prio r in order to discover if you are asking the right questions in or der to solicit th information you desire or if the question is being asked correctly small example is when asking about powerbrokers we as americans have the tendency to ask who is the most powerful person in order to discover who the important people are in the area however the more culturally appropriate ques tion might be who is the most important person in the area culturally importance is synonymous with power but not vice versa it is good idea regardless of your background or experience to ask the interpreter if the questions are framed and being asked correctly this simple step will save you much frustration and disappoi ntment once you have run the potential questions past the interp reter try interviewing fob workers this serves four purposes in terview practice testing your questioning work more with the inte rpreters and gathering data from our local population in the field human terrain team handbook us unclassified 75 once you arrive at your mission ar ea you should again brief the interpreters about what is going on and inform them of any changes that may have occurred you should also review the mission with them as it may have changed you should also review and adapt your security and mission plans as they will probably need to be modified interviewing once you arrive at your mission locati on inside or outside the wire you are off to the races however team security and integrity are extremely important follow your plan as best you can be warned you will have to adapt to the changes and the environment once you link up set off on your mission when you find your first lks introduce yourself and explain who and what you are the interpreters should have worked out good way of explaining this if not describe it as cultural study team that is working with the coalition in order to better understa nd the local population we are students and want to learn as much about the cultural as possible we are also teachers and must take the cultural information we receive and teach the coalition including th local security forces what we learned this usually sets good tone you should also ask permission to take notes record ndor take any photos prior to doing so provide an explanation as to why you want to do these things people usually do not have problem with these actions but occasionally someone will decline your request that is when you must rely solely on your memorization skills be fluid pay attention to the an swers you are receiving be mindful of opportunities and stru cture your questions succinctly and clearly the latter is extremely important if you get funny look from the interpreter or he asks is that question you should stop determine what you are asking and ask it in simpler terms this is to alleviate the chance for deviation and confusion on the part of the interpreter as well as the lks you must pause between thoughts in order to give your interpreter an opportunity to translate your statements as well as any responses for the lks pause and let them translate so they can convey your message as completely and accurately as possible this adds time to the interview and will certainly take conscious effort on your part but it will prove more fruitful human terrain team handbook have the interpreter translate things in the 1st person this changes the tone of the interview in many ways it gives the interpreter place of importance makes thing less confusing and is more active adding

to regions consisting of several htts and the information gathered and tailored to one htts operating envi ronment with minor adjustment can be easily applied to anothe r drafting executive summaries

how to effectively brief periodically the team must communi cate information to commanders and staffs through military briefings briefings are means of presenting information to commander s staffs or other designated audiences the techniques employe d are determined by the purpose of the briefing the desired response and the role of the briefer this tab describes the types of military briefings and gives briefing formats for each type there are two types of military briefings that are used by an htt information and staff information briefing the information briefing is intended to inform the listener and to gain his understanding the briefing does not include conclusions and recommendations nor require decisions the briefing deals primarily with facts and provides informa tion in form the audience can understand the briefer states that the purpose of the briefing is to provide information and that decision is required the briefer provides brief introduction to define the subject and to orient the listener and then presents the information examples of an information briefing are informa tion of high priority requiring immediate attention information of complex nature such as complicated plans systems statis tics or charts requiring detailed explanation and controversial in formation requiring elaboration and explanation human terrain team handbook figure 11 format for an information briefing staff briefing the purpose of staff briefing is to coordinate unit efforts by informing the commander and staff of the current situation the person who convenes the staff briefing sets the agenda staff representatives each present relevant information from their functional areas staff briefings may involve exchange of information announcement of decisions issuance of directives or presentation of guidance they may have char acteristics of information briefings decision br iefings and mission briefings attendance at staff briefings varies with the size of the headquarters type of operation and commanders preferences generally the commander deputies or assistants ch ief of staff executive officer and coordinating and sp ecial staff officers attend representatives from major subordinate commands may be present the chief of staff us unclassified 92 human terrain team handbook us unclassified 93 executive officer usually pr esides the commander usually concludes the briefing but may ta ke an active part throughout it in garrison or on an extended deploy ment staff briefings sometimes called staff calls are often regul arly scheduled in combat staff briefings are held as needed th presentation of staff estimates culminating in commanders decisi on to adopt course of action is form of staff briefing that in corporates aspects of decision briefing in this type of briefing staff representatives use the staff estimate for their functional area as an outline format for staff briefing 1 general the staff briefing is form of information briefing given by staff officer ften it is one of series of briefings by staff officers 2 purposes of staff briefing the staff briefing serves to keep th commander and staff abreast of the current situation b coordinate efforts through rapid oral presentation of key data 3 possible attendees the commander his deputy and chief of staff b senior representatives of the primary and special staff commanders of subordinate units 4 common procedures the person who convenes the staff briefing sets the agenda b the chief of staff or execut ive officer normally presides c each staff representative presents information on his particular area d the commander usually concludes the briefing but may take an active part throughout the presentation figure 12 format for staff briefing human terrain team handbook us unclassified 94 briefing steps briefings have four steps 1 analyze the situation this in cludes analyzing the audience and the occasion by determining who is to be briefed and why how much knowledge of the subject does the audience have what is expected of the briefer before briefing an individual the first time the briefer should inquire as to the particular officials desires the briefer must understand the purpose of the briefing is he to present facts or to make recommendation the purpose determines the nature of the briefing the time allocated for briefing will dictate the st yle physical facilities and the preparatory effort needed the availability of physical facilities visual aids and draftsmen is consideration the briefer prepares detailed presentation plan and coordinates with his as sistants if used the preparatory effort is car efully scheduled each briefer should formulate briefing outline the briefer initially estimates the deadlines for each task he schedules facilities for practice and requests critiques 2 construct the briefing the construction of the briefing will vary with its type and purpos the analysis provides the basis for this determination th following are the major steps in preparing briefing collect material know the subject thoroughly isolate the key points arrange the key points in logical order provide supporting data to substantiate validity of key points select visual aids establish the wording rehearse before knowledgeable person who can critique the briefing human terrain team handbook us unclassified 95 3 deliver the briefing successful briefing depends on how it is presented confident re laxed forceful delivery clearly enunciated and obviously based on full knowledge of the subject helps convince the audience the briefer maintains relaxed but military bearing he uses natural gestures and movement but he avoids distracting mannerisms the briefers delivery is characte rized by conciseness objectivity and accuracy he must be aware of the following the basic purpose is to present the subject as directed and to ensure th at it is understood by the audience brevity precludes ngthy introduction or summary logic must be used in ar riving at conclusions and recommendations interruptions and questions may occur at any point if and when these interruptions occur the briefer answers each ques tion before proceeding r indicates that the questions will be answered later in the briefing at the same time he does not permit questions to distract him from his planned briefing if the question w ill be answered later in the briefing the briefe r should make specific reference to the earlier question when he introduces the material the briefer must be prepared to support any pa rt of his briefing the briefer anticipates possible questions and is prepared to answer them 4 when the briefing is over the briefer prepares memorandum for record mfr this mfr should record the subject date time and place of the briefing and ranks names and positions of those present the briefings substance is concisely recorded recomme ndations and their approval disapproval or approval with modification are recorded as well as any instruction or dire cted action this includes who is to take action when deci sion is involved and doubt exists about the decision makers intent the briefer submits draft of the mfr to him for correcti on before preparing it in final form the mfr is distributed to staff sections or agencies that must act on the decisions or in structions contained in it or whose operations or plans may be

agricultural projects ca nnot begin in 9nissan because squatters are living on fields needed for crops current plan by nac is to forcibly relocate these peopl as soon as possible to plant crops before december 1 this will lead to further trauma for already displaced persons that could led to increased violence and hatred for human terrain team handbook us unclassified 111 government officials which coul d also led to an engagement opportunity for insurgent groups for recruitment this inturn will increase antiidp attitudes questions wherehow is the nac going to relocate these people how many idps reside in the area possible recommendations that could result from data encourage the farmers to hire labor from idps produce crops as opposed to fodder are labor intensive crops requiring lots of field hands encouragement could be linked to coalition disbursements of aid ie if you want this you have to hire x amount of idps as day laborers secondary benefits traditional produce is high in nutritional vitamins and essential minerals this will promote increased health care among idps leading to increased childhood wellbeing decreased maternal issues ie birth defects increase cognitive

out of camp taji iraq weve been in iraq nearly 9 months of projected 15 month t our our brigade operates across approximately 1700 sq miles of mostly rural terrain we st and north of baghdad as part of multinational division baghdad our area of operation is distributed across bot h sunni and shia sects and is strongly tribal in tradition and in fluence we work over four governmental qadas roughly analogous to us county governmental entity and partner with four iraqi army brigades and several thousand iraqi police on personal note this is my second tour in iraq having served here in 20042005 as stryker infantry battalion commander in mosul weve been supported by human terrain team since our arrival last december in summary the team has become an indispensible asset in helping understand the comp lexities of tribal and political relationships and assess the potential results of variety of lethal and nonlethal actions our employment of the htt has progressed and modified as weve grown as unit and gained an improved understanding of the complexities of the environment initially the htt provided us basic cultural overview of tribal and familial relationships so important in an arab society this level of contribution was appropriate to our entry level of knowledge and experience over time their cont ribution has extended to detailed assessment of tribal political and cultural interactions that have allowed us to be much more preci in our operational approaches and objectives the relationships the htt has established with an extensive network of local tribal personalities has been indispensible to our engagement strategy i have relied on the htt to penetrate the cultural gap between coalition elements and sensitive issues to better facilitate our accomplishing or objectives as the htt program matures i believe well see even better interaction with bcts and larger return on the armys investment human terrain team handbook us unclassified 120 into the program as an army we have developed deeper understanding of the impor tance of cultural awar eness and its impact on military operations i would welcome further development of the htt to provide more habitual support to the brigade through predeployment tr aining and operations we are quickly improving our integration of the htt into our broader staff processes and exploring its doctrinal role in the staff structure in summary the human terrain team is an integral and critical element that i rely on daily as part of my engagement and assessment strategy in executing counterinsu rgency operations in an environment characterized by huma n terrain the htt provides dedicated educated and responsive information and assessments that allow this brigade to accomplish its objectives i welcome their input
