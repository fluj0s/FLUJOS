and its power ppeal to it for relief to their wants and address the president as their great father3 eventually in the late nineteenth century the trust relationship was viewed as source of federal power4 the court virtually refused to fi nd any federal legislation aff ecting indian property to be unconstitutional and saw the power to abrogate indian treaty rights as political and not subject to judicial control5 courts longer invoke the plenary authority of congress in indian affairs and the trust relationship as source of plenary federal power but have delineated limits on congressional power to deal with indian property in united states v sioux nation6 for example the court focused on how congress mu st act as trustee of indian propertyit may change it from one form to another eg from land to money but it may not take it for public purpose without meeting the fifth amendments just compensation requirement similarly the supreme court has held unconstitutional as confiscatory federal legislation that permits escheat transferring title to tribes of fractionated shares of indian allotments that ve passed through multiple in testate successions resulting in maximum fractionalization of interests7 although the court seems to be moving aw ay from viewing the trust relationship as source of federal plenary power it has not dopted the view that the trust relationship completely incorporates the comm on law of trusts in 1983 in nevada v united states8 the supreme court indicated that the trust obligations assumed by federal government agencies with respect to indians or indian property are unlike the obligations of private fiduciary or trustee with respect to the issu of conflict of intere st the case involved situation in which the united states represented both an indian tribe and reclamation project in water rights litigation the c ourt noted that when congress calls upon an agency to represent more than one benefi ciary or imposes conf licting obligations on it strict fiduciary duties are not required sayi ng the government does not compromise its obligations to one interest that congress obliges it to represent by the mere fact that it simultaneously performs another task for another interest th at congress has obligated it by statute to do9 under what is known as the indian tucker act 28 usc 1505 the united states

legislation cite d by the lower court11 the general allotment act 25 usc 332 et seq to create an express trust respecting timber management on remand12 the lower court found that the indian timber statutes13 established trust relation allowing recovery for breach of trust because they created acorpus of indian property to be controlled by trustee the federal government for the benefit of beneficiary indian owners and that congress in tended the benefit be financial the supreme court agreed in united states v mitchell 463 us 206 219 1983 mitchell ii the court examined the statutes cited by the lower court to see whether they can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation for damages sustained as result of breach of the duties they impose it traced the history and scope of the timber management legislation and concluded that it unlike the general allotment act gives the federal government full responsibility to manage indian resources and land for the benefit of the indians and th ereby establish fiduciary relationship 14 white mountain apache and navajo nation on march 4 2003 the supreme court decided two cases involving assertions by indian tribes that the united states had breached its trust obligations the decisions articulated the same standard as announced in mitchell ii but found trust obligation in only one of the cases united states v white

united states v mitchell 463 us 206 218 1963needed for that purpose16 the appeals court had noted that the fort apache legislation conveyed complete control nd did not require as in mitchell ii that the property be administered for the benefit of the indian s nonetheless it found that when the government chooses to use trust property ex clusively for its own purposes it becomes subject to the duties of common law fiducia ry and therefore must act reasonably to preserve the trust property17or to be liable to the tribe in money damages this ruling was contrary to that of the trial court which had held that mere control was insufficient for trust obligation to attach18 writing for the supreme court in an opini on in which justices stevens oconnor ginsburg and breyer concurred justice souter rejected the argument that the united states had raised as to the high standard to be applied to any statute interpreted as imposing fiduciary obligation on the united states breach of which is to give rise to compensable damages19 the court found that the indian tucker act20 met the standard for clear waiver of sovereign immunity and that statute creating substantive right within that waiver requires merely the standard identified in mitchell ii thatitbe reasonably amenable to the reading that it mandates right of recovery in damages21 the court recognized in the language of mitchell ii that this is not to be lightly inferred but said that fair inference will do22 the court found that the language of the 1960 act in white mountain apache created more than bare trust even thoug h it did not impose specific management and control duties similar to those of the timber management statutes at issue in mitchell ii it held the statutory authorization for the united states to use the trust property carried with it duty to maintain the property and not to permit it to deteriorate duty imposed upon common law trustee the court remanded the case to the court of federal claims for trial on the issue of damages assessm ent of damages may involve knotty issues such as whether damages will be assessed only for those improvements on the trust property used by the united states or for all th deterioration of this historic site and what interplay there will be with th trust law principle that the trustee use trust assets for expenses incurred in administering and maintaining

the context of the department of the interi ors role in the negotiation and approval of reservation coal leases the fact situation includes ex parte communication between the secretary of the interior and the lessee th at was not disclosed to the nation and that resulted in withdrawing an administrative decision that would have imposed higher royalties than were ultimately obtained by the navajo nation the issue was whether the mineral leasing statutes24 are such that they can be fairly interpreted as mandating monetary damages for breach of trust if actions by the department of the interior could be shown in future trial to have resulted in an econo mic disadvantage to the tribe at the trial court vel the court of federal cla ims had ruled that although the united states acting through former secretary hodel violated the most basic common law fiduciary duties owed the navajo na tionthe trust relationship necessary for jurisdiction does not exist and these vi olations do not mandate monetary relief25 that court found the dual purposes of the indian mineral leasing statutes maximizing economic returns for the indian beneficiarie s and fostering indian selfdetermination as undermining the necessary intent to permit money damages this decision was reversed at the appellate level26 the arguments that the united states raised in the supreme court drew contrast between the mineral leasing statutes that give the tribes the authority for mineral leasing subject to the approval of the secretary of the in terior with the timber statutes in mitchell ii which the court found conveyed to tal control to the secretary of the interior it also raised various factual matters that indicate the possibility that the final lease which the navajo nation submitted for approval may have been on the whole equal to that which would have b een mandated had the secretary not intervened finally the us characterized the navajo nations case as calling for the imposition of common law trust duties thereby expandi ng potential liability beyond the mitchell ii standard and beyond what would be inferred by fair reading of the statutes at issue the supreme court in navajo nation found language creating trust in the indian mineral leasing statutes nor did it find that the statutes or implementing regulations conferred the kind of control from which fiduciary obligations were held to flow in mitchell ii the secretary had only the author ity to approve leases negotiated by tribes subject to the sole standard that royalties not fall below minimum level established in the regulation dissent wh ich was written by justice souter the author of the opinion of the court in white mountain apache drew different implication from the requirement of secretaria l approval of coal leases on tribal lands relying on legislative history relevant to the purpose of the secret arial approval requirementto maximize tribal returns from mineral estatesand cases in the early part of the 20th

balances periodic r econciliations of trust fund accounts adequate controls over receipts and bala nces and periodic statements to account holders the trial court during the course of protracted
