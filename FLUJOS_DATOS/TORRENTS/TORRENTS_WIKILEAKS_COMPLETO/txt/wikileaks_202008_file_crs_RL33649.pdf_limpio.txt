the department of education stated that we have elected to construct one comprehens ive freestanding document that incorporates virtually all requirements from the new law along with the applicable regulations rather than publishing regulation that does not include statutory provisions the rationale for doing this is to create single reference document for parents state personnel school personnel and others to use rather than being forced to shift between one document for regulations and separate document for the statute 10 the organization of the final regulations differs from the previous regulations with the final regulations generally following the structure of pl 108446 subpart of 34 cfr part 300 discusses the purpose and applicability of the regulations and includes definitions subpart b contains provisions relating to state eligibility and includes requirements for fape the least restrictive environment private schools state complaint procedures and department

provided to children with disabilities under this act as embodied in regulations in effect on july 20 1983 particularly as such protections related to parental consent to initial evaluation or initial placement in special education least restrictive environment related services timelines attendance of evaluation personnel at individualized educa tion program meetings or qualifications of personnel except to the extent that such re gulation reflects the clear and unequivocal intent of congress in legislation 12 this listing of areas in the statute is helpful in determining what changes congress might have interpreted as lessening the protections available to children with disabilities but it is not determinative as the list is illustrative not limiting it is worth noting as the regulations are examined that some of the provisions carried over from prior regulations are included due to the requirements of this section in addition in at least one situation an argument by commenter that proposed section of the regulations would violate this statutory requirement led ed to remove the section 13

cognitively disabled can be held to alternative achievement standards 19 that is special education teachers at the elementary level can meet the standards by passing rigorous state subject matter and teaching skills test and speci education teachers at the middle sc hool and high school level can pass such test or earn degree or take minimum number of courses in the relevant core subject or

teachers and meets all the requirements for housse for regular education teachers 34 cfr 30018e the statute declares that there is right of action based on an employee not meeting the highly qualified requirements of the act 28 the regulations reiterate this provision in addition the regulation clarifies that parents still have the right to file complaint related to staff qualifications under state complaint procedures under 34 cfr 300151 and 30015329 as noted above the definition of highly qua lified teacher differs depending on whether the teacher is new to the profession or not the regulations clarify situation in which regular teacher subsequently becomes certified as special education teacher even though such teacher is not new to the profession he or she is considered new special education teacher for the purposes of the highly qualified teacher definition as it applies to special education teachers30 as suggested above the idea definition of highly qualified with respect to special education teachers for the most severely cognitively disabled children appears to differentiate between such teachers at the elementary level and those teaching students above the elementary level for the former teachers whether they are new or veteran teachers the statute crossreferences the housse alternative in the esea definition for the latter teachers the statutory language does not explicitly reference the esea housse alternative but states the following or in the case of instruction above the elementary level has subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction being prov ided as determined by the state needed to effectively teach to those standards31 for this second group of special education teachers the regulations do reference the esea housse alternative as follows 27 the regulations at 34 cfr 30018g clarify that requirements for highly qualified teachers do not apply to private school t eachers hired or contracted by leas to

with disability may also be unilaterally placed in private school by his or her parents in the latter situation the cost of the private school placement is not paid by the lea unless hearing officer or court makes certain findings however idea does require some services for children in private schools even if they are unilaterally placed there by their parents exactly what these services are or should be has been contentious subject for many years the 1997 reauthorization of idea expanded the private school provisions and the 2004 reauthorization includes several changes to the provisions relating to children with disabilities who are placed in private school by their parents 35 generally children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private schools are to be provided special education and related services based on where the private school is located not on where the child resides36 this provision was changed from previous law which made the lea where the child resided responsible for providing services thus the lea responsible for providing services to parentally placed children with disabilities has changed from the lea of residence to the lea of attendance the senate report described this change as protecting leas from having to work with private schools located in multiple jurisdictions when students attend private schools across district lines37 pl 108446

final regulations track the statutory requirements and add provisions to address some issues raised by comments on the proposed regulations the regulations reiterate that it is the lea of attendance that is responsible for locating identifying and evaluating all parentally placed children in private schools within their geographic boundaries the so called child find requirement the regulations stipulate that the lea of attendance is responsible for child find and proportional provision of services even if the child resides in another state 38 the regulations clarify that children with disabilities ages three to five are considered to be parentally placed only if they attend private schools that meet th definition of elementary school contained in the act39 as noted above the highly qualified teache r requirements do not apply to private school teachers providing services to parentally placed children with disabilities40 the regulations follow the act in requiring that an lea use share of its idea grants in proportion to the number of parentally placed children with disabilities in private schools within the lea to provide equitable services for these children in addition the regulations present hypothetical example of how proportional share of an leas idea grant is to be calculated 41 again following the language of the statute the regulations exclude the cost of child find from this proportional share while requiring consultation on the child find process and the provision of services as the statute requires the regulations specify that parentallyplaced private school child with disability has an individual right to receive some or all of the special education and related services that the child would receive if enrolled in public school 42 in addition the lea makes the final decisions about the nature of services and the lea is responsible for devising service plan for every parentally placed child with disability receiving special education or related services some commenters proposed that the lea where the private school is located to provide sic the district of residence the results of an evaluation and eligibility determination of the parentally placed private school child43 ed is concerned that the privacy rights of the child be protected and added the following requirement if child is enrolled or is going to enroll in private school that is

are provisions protecting the rights of parents and children with disabilities regarding free appropriate public education fape and include notice of rights mediation resolution sessions and due process procedures section 615 has been continual source of controversy especially the provisions relating to the discipline of children with disabilities the changes made by pl 108446 include adding provisions relating to homeless children adding twoyear statute of limitations for the filing of complaint and twoyear statute of limitations regarding requests for hearing adding additional requirements for hearing officers changing the mediation provision and specifically allowing the local educational agency not just the parents to file for due process hearing the discussion of the provisions of pl 108446 in this report regarding procedural safeguards and discipline is not comprehensive there were significant changes made by the new law in areas such as attorneys fees which are not discussed here as the regulations do not make significant additions to the statutory language one of the major changes was the addition of resolution session this is preliminary meeting between the parents and the lea and iep team held within 15 days of receiving the parents complaint the reason for this addition was to attempt to resolve disputes prior to the more adversarial due process hearing the house report noted that the resolution session is intended to improve the communication between parents and school officials and to help foster greater efforts to resolve disputes in timely manner so that the childs interests are best served 49 if an agreement is reached during the resolution session the parties must execute legally binding agreement signed by both parties and

contentious issue during the 2004 reauthorization50 although pl 108446 made significant changes to 615k it did keep many of the provisions of the previous law one of the changes was the addition of provision allowing school personnel to consider on casebycase basis any unique circumstances when determining whether to order change in placement for child with disability who violates code of student conduct another major change was in the language regarding manifestation determinations the concept of manifestation determination originated in policy interpretations of idea by the department of education the theory is that when behavior even inappropriate behavior is caused by disability the response of school must be different that when the behavior is not related to the disability the concept of manifestation determination was placed in statutory language in the 1997 reauthorization and amended in 2004 by pl 108446 pl 108446 reauthorization provides that within 10 days of decision to change the placement of child with disability because of violation of code of student conduct the lea the parent and appropriate members of the iep team shall review all relevant information in the students file including the iep teacher observations and any relevant information provided by the parents to determine if the conduct in question was caused by or had direct and substantial relationship to the childs disability or if the conduct in question was the direct result of the lea s failure to implement the iep if the lea the parent and relevant members of the iep team determine that the conduct in question was caused by or had direct and substantial relationship to the childs disability or if the conduct in question was the direct result of the leas failure to implement the iep the conduct is determined to be manifestation of the childs disability except for situations involving weapons drugs or serious bodily injury when the conduct is manifestation of the disability the child shall return to the placement from which he or she was removed unless the parent and the lea agree to change of placement as part of the modification of the behavioral intervention plan 51 g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g138g149g561g21g138g143g142g144g158g138g155g141g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g156g561

statutory language in pl 108446 however the regulations do make several additions for example regarding the procedural safeguards notice ed clarifies that procedural safeguards notice must be provided upon receipt of the first filing of state complaint or request for due process hearing in school year not just the first request at any point in the childs education 52 in addition ed attempts to reduce the confusion about the distinctions between due process complaint and complaint under the state complaint procedures by requiring that the procedural safeguards notice explain the differences

that if the mediator is not selected on rotational basis from the list both parties must be involved in selecting the mediator 55 the new regulations keep the listed requirements but also require that the sea must select mediators on random rotational or other impartial basis and delete the language regarding involvement by the other party56 ed noted in its discussion of this section that these provisions are sufficient to ensure that the selection of the mediator is not biased while providing seas additional flexibility in selecting mediators selecting mediators on an impartial basis would include permitting the parties involved in dispute to agree on mediator 57 the final regulations eliminate provision relating to the signing of confidentiality pledges prior to the commencement of

several commenters on the proposed regulations suggested that the final regulations permit party in due process hearing to be represented by non attorney advocate in order to allow more uniform access to assistance across all socioeconomic groups and decrease the formality of hearings59 ed responded by noting that this issue of nonattorney representation in due process hearings had been considered in light of state rule s regarding the unauthorized practice of law ed further commented that notice of proposed rulemaking is anticipated in the near future60 another issue raised by commenter concerning nonattorney advocates was whether court could award fees to lay person who accompanied and advised the parents at due process hearing ed stated that lay advocates are by definition not attorneys and are not entitled to compensation as if they were attorneys61 ed also noted that the supreme courts recent decision in arlington central school district board of education v murphy62 held

regulations state that unless the parties have jointly agreed to waive the resolution process or to use mediation the failure of the parent filing the due process complaint to participate in the resolution session will delay the timeline for the resolution session and due process hearing until the resolution session is held64 if the parent refuses to participate in the resolution session the regulations provide that the lea may request that the hearing officer dismiss the parents due process complaint 65 similarly parent may seek intervention by hearing officer if the lea fails to hold the resolution meeting within 15 days of receiving notice or fails to participate in the resolution session66 the regulations also specifically discuss when the timeline for the due process hearing starts67 one of the issues commenters on the proposed regulations had raised concerning the resolution session was whether the discussions were confidential ed declined to discuss this issue in the

determined at the local level by school personnel who know the individual child and all the facts and circumstances regarding childs behavior and therefore ed did not include more detailed discussion in the regulations71 however in the comments to the regulations ed did observe that certain factors such as childs disciplinary history ability to understand consequences expression of remorse and supports provided to the child prior to the violation could be unique circumstances72 the 2006 regulation also states in part that the ability of school personnel to remove child with disability is to be applied to the extent those alternatives are applied to children without disabilities and as long as the removals do not constitute change in placement73 g22g142g151g561g6g138g162g561g21g158g156g153g142g151g156g146g152g151g156g561 although the statutory language giving school personnel the authority to suspend child with disability for not more than 10 school days is similar in both the 1997 idea and pl 108446 the 2006 regulations make several changes from the previous regulations the 2006 regulations add subsection stating that where child has been removed for more than 10 school days in the same school year and the current removal is for not more than 10 consecutive school days and is not change of placement school personnel in consultation with the childs teacher or teachers determine the extent to which services are needed so as to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum 74 the regulations also provide that child subject to this removal must continue to receive educational services as provided in 300101a which is the regulatory provision guaranteeing fape75 ed commented while children with disabilities removed for more than 10 school days in school year for disciplinary reasons must continue to receive fape we believe the act modifies the concept of fape in these circumstances to encompass those services necessary to enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the childs iep an lea is not required to provide children suspended for more than 10 school days in school year for disciplinary reasons exactly the same services in exactly the same settings as they were receiving prior to the imposition of discipline however the special education and related services the child does receive must enable the child to continue to participate in the general curriculum and to progress toward meeting the goals set out in the childs iep 76 g11g151g157g142g155g146g150g561g3g149g157g142g155g151g138g157g146g159g142g561g7g141g158g140g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g21g142g157g157g146g151g144g561 pl 108446

agency has the burden of proof in arguing that removing child is necessary because maintaining the current placement is substant ially likely to result in injury to self or others79 the idea statute is silent on this issue and ed declined to address it in the regulations however ed did observe that the burden of proof in idea proceedings was at issue in schaffer v weast 80 recent supreme court decision the court held there that the burden of persuasion in hearing challenging the validity of an iep is on the party seeking relief noting the supreme courts decision ed stated that where the public agency has requested that hearing officer remove child to an interim alternative educational setting the burden of persuasion is on the public agency 81 the 2006 regulations add new section specifically allowing school district to seek subsequent hearing to continue the child in an interim alternative educational placement if the school district believes that returning the child to the original placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others82 g7g161g153g142g141g146g157g142g141g561g22g146g150g142g149g146g151g142g156g561 pl 108446 provides for expedited timelines for hearings under the disciplinary procedures83 the regulations reflect the statutory language and also shorten time lines for the resolution session process when expedited hearings are

1 08446 changed the stayput requirements and the regulations reflect that change for example ed observed if childs parents oppose proposed change in placement at the end of 45day interim alternative educational placement during the pendency of the proceeding to challenge the change in placement the child remains in the interim alternative educational setting pending the decision of the hearing officer or until the expiration of the time period for the disciplinary action whichever occurs first unless the parent and the public agency agree otherwise 90

for special education and related services and who have engaged in behavior that violates code of student conduct however several changes are made regarding when an lea is deemed to have knowledge that child is child with disability generally an lea is deemed to have knowledge that child is child with disability if before the behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action the parent of the child expressed concern in writing to supervisory or administrative personnel of the lea or the childs teacher that the child is in need of special education and related services the parent has requested an evaluation or the teacher of the child or other lea personnel has expressed specific concerns about pattern of behavior directly to th director of special education or other supervisory personnel 91 although the proposed regulations had required that the teacher or other lea personnel must express concerns regarding childs pattern of behavior in accordance with the agencys established child find or special education referral system the final regulations deleted this requirement since not all states and lea s have child find or referral processes that permit teachers to express concerns directly to the director of special education or other supervisory personnel ed encouraged states that do not permit this direct referral by teachers to change these processes to meet this requirement 92 88 pl 10517 615k7 89 20 usc 1415k4 90 71 federal register 46726 august 14 2006 91 20 usc 1415k5 92 71 federal register 46727 august 14 2006

benefit from their guaranteed public education for some children benefitting from or even attending school depends on healthrelated services for example child dependent on ventilator for life support could require inschool staff to ensure the proper operation of the equipment in order to attend school for such child idea requires that necessary staff and services be provided while idea mandates special education and related services it is not intended to pay for the total cost of this education and these services one approach congress has taken to ease the burden on states and school districts of fulfilling the requirements of idea is to allow the use of funds available under medicaid federalstate entitlement program providing medical assistance to certain lowincome individuals to finance health services delivered to special education students who are enrolled in medicaid prior to 1988 medicaid did not pay for coverable services that were listed in childs iep since special education funds were available to pay for these services and because generally with few explicit exceptions medicaid is always the payer of last resort congress changed this connection between idea and medicaid in 1988 section 411k13 of the medicare catastrophic coverage act of 1988 pl 100360 amended medicaid title xix of the social security act at section 1903 as follows c nothing in this title shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting or authorizing the secretary to prohibit or restrict payment der subsection for medical assistance for covered services furnished to child with disability because such services are included in the childs individualized education program established pursuant to part b of the individuals with disabilities education act or furnished to an infant or toddler with disability because such services are included in the childs individualized family service plan adopted pursuant to part h of such act 93 section 612a12 of idea reflects this provision as follows if any public agency other than an educationa l agency is otherwise obligated under federal or state law or assigned responsibility under state policy pursuant to subparagraph to provide or pay for any services that are also c onsidered special education or related services that are necessary for ensuring free appropriate public education to children with disabilities within the state such public agency shall fulfill that obligation or responsibility either directly or through contract or other arrangement 94 93 the 1997 idea amendments pl 10517 redesignated part h as part c the

child participates to provide or pay for services required under this part as permitted under the public benefits or insurance program 300154d1 based on certain requirements although the current idea provisions related to public insurance such as medicaid are virtually the same as those in the 1997 idea amendments and although the 2006 final idea regulations track the 1999 regulations implementing the 1997 amendments the final regulations add requirement that has raised some concerns parental consent must be obtained each time that access to public benefits or insurance is sought 300154d2iva 95 ed justifies this new provision which was added to the final regulations based on maintaining the confidentiality of personally identifiable data as required by the family educational rights and privacy act of 1974 ferpa section 444 of the general education provisions act gepa and by section 617c of idea according to eds discussion of comments on the proposed regulations in order for public agency to use the medicaid or other public benefits or insurance program in which child participates to provide or pay for services required under the act the public agency must provide the benefits or insurance program with information from the childs education records eg rvices provided length of the services information from childs education records is pr otected under the family educational rights and privacy act of 1974 20 usc 1232g ferpa and section 617c of the act under ferpa and section 617c of the act childs education records cannot be released to state medicaid agency without parental consent except for few specified exceptions that do not include the release of education record s for insurance billing purposes we believe obtaining parental consent each time the public agency seeks to use parents public insurance or other public benefits to provide or pay for service is important to protect the privacy rights of the parent and to ensure that the parent is fully informed of public agencys access to his or her public benefits or insurance and the services paid by the public benefits or insurance program 96 some observers have expressed concern that this provision will result in undue paperwork and basically bring the medicaid claiming process to halt according to cathy griffin president of the national alliance for medicaid in education if we have to get consent each time you send claim in that would be nightmare 97 alexa posny former director of eds office of special education programs noted that parental consent must be obtained every time public benefits or insurance is sought whether it be within the same year or month98 according to posny the intent is to inform parents of the number of times their benefits are being accessed more recently posny clarified the intent of the requirement which she claims is not to create deluge of paperwork if child is supposed to receive three hours of occupational therapy each week for 95

proposed regulations have argued that other disabilities should be included in the definition of other health impairments ed has denied these requests with one exception tourette syndrome ed declined to include various neurological disorders such as bipolar disorders in the definition because these conditions are commonly understood to be health impairments however we do believe that tourette syndrome is commonly misunderstood to be behavioral or emotional condition rather than neurological condition therefore including tourette syndrome in the definition of other health impairment may help correct the misperception of tourette syndrome as behavioral or conduct disorder and prevent the misdiagnosis of their needs 101

cochlear implant must be properly mapped in order for the child to hear well in school the mapping does not have to be done in school or during the school day in order for it to be effective the exclusion of mapping from the definition of related services reflects the language in srept 108185 p 8 which states that the senate committee did not intend that mapping cochlear implant or even the costs associated with mapping such as transportation costs and insurance copayments be the responsibility of school district 107 at the same time the regulations do not free leas from all responsibilities related to surgically implanted devices for example the regulations do not prevent the routine checking of an external component of surgically implanted device to make sure it is

accompanying the house bill explained the rationale for such pilot reducing the paperwork burden of the act is one of the committees top priorities for the reauthorization of the act studies from the department show that the nation is facing significant shortage of special education teachers and many special educators leaving the field cite the burden of unnecessary paperwork as one of the primary reasons for their departure the bill includes pilot program to allow states to demonstrate innovative and creative measures to reduce the paperwork burd this program is not meant to decrease any of the rights children have under the act but is intended to allow those states who choose to participate to think creatively and innovatively about how to best meet the demands of the act while reducing

c of idea authorizes grants to states to develop and maintain early intervention programs for infants and toddlers with disabilities the idea infants and toddlers program has parallels with the provisions and requirements of part b however these provisions and requirements differ in important respects from those of part b because this disabled population differs in significant ways from the mainly schoolaged population served under part b for example while part b eligibility is based on categories of disabilities 6023 eligibility for part c programs is often based on diagnosis of development delay that requires early intervention services 6325 instead of an iep part c programs have individualized family service plans ifsps 636 in recognition that services must be provided to the family as well as to the infant or toddler because infants and toddlers are served in variety of locations including the home part c services are to be provided in natural environments in which children without disabilities participate 6324g to the maximum extent appropriate 635a16a the 2004 reauthorization of idea pl 108446 maintains the overall purposes and structure of part c with some additions and revisions arguably the most extensive addition is the option for states to adopt policies that would permit parents of child receiving part c early intervention services to extend those services until the child is eligible to enter kindergarten 635c under previous law and in states that choose not to adopt such policy these children would likely transition into preschool program

regulations examples include definitions of elementary school free appropriate public education fape local educational agency lea and state educational agency sea these are examples of general strategy to include in part c regulations provisions currently in other parts of the statute and other idea regulations that also apply to the part c program in addition the proposed regulations add and modify definitions to reflect changes and modifications in the statute resulting from pl 108446 for example definition of ward of the state would be added to reflect the addition of that definition to the act 60236 examples of modifications to existing definitions include the following adding provisions related to cochlear implants in the definition of health services adding to the definition of an infant or toddler with disability child previously served under part c who is eligible for services under the preschool program but who at the states discretion continues to be served under part c until he or she enters kindergarten or elementary school to reflect the provision added by pl 108446 adding registered dieticians and vision specialists to the list of qualified personnel in the definition of early intervention services and eliminating the terms nutritionist and nurses from the definition and adding clarifying language to the definition of parent which was expanded by pl 108446 to specify that the biologicalnatural parent is considered the parent unless judicial order or decree identifies some other individual this clarification is similar to that in the part b

above an important change resulting from the 2004 idea amendments was to authorize states to adopt policies that would permit parents of child receiving part c early intervention services to extend those services until the child is eligible to enter kindergarten 635c the proposed regulations would provide requirements for implementing this state option in many cases the proposed regulations repeat language in the act in addition they would add further requirements for example 303211a2 would require state plans to specify the age range to which these services will be made available whether it is ages 3 to 5 inclusive or shorter time span such as from age three until the beginning of the school year following the childs fourth birthday 303211a2ii

that are in the statute 635a5 the proposed regulations would add exceptions to prohibitions against reducing the level of expenditure that the act provides for leas under part b 141 for example if the number of infants and toddlers with disabilities decreases 303225b2i throughiv state could reduce its level of expenditure without violating the 141 note that these exceptions under part b apply to

provision in this regard in part c of the act 303225c of the proposed regulations would add language that would prohibit part c lead agencies142 from charging indirect costs unless approved by the agencys cognizant federal agency or by the secretary of education143 in addition the proposed regulations state that the lead agency may not charge rent occupancy or space maintenance costs directly to the part c grant unless those costs are specifically approved in advance by the secretary 303225c3 g18g138g155g142g151g157g138g149g561g20g146g144g145g157g156g561 the proposed regulations provide for procedural safeguards for parents and their infants and toddlers these include confidentiality provisions 303401303417 provisions for parental consent notice and surrogate parents 303420303422 and dispute resolution options 303430303439 the confidentiality provisions incorporate the provisions in part b in order to make it easier for parents to access information 144 the provisions relating to parental consent and notice and those relating to surrogate parents are largely unchanged from existing regulations the proposed regulations contain requirements for ensuring that parental consent is obtained before administering screening procedures providing an evaluation and assessment providing early intervention services using public or private insurance and exchanging personally identifiable information among agencies 303420 if parental consent is not obtained the proposed regulations provide that the lead agency may use the due process hearing procedures to challenge the parents refusal for an evaluation and assessment but may not use these procedures to challenge the parents refusal to consent to the provision of an early intervention service or the use of insurance 303420c the proposed regulations contain various dispute resolution options including mediation state complaints and due process hearing procedures the mediation requirements are largely unchanged however the proposed regulations add that if mediation resolves complaint the parties must execute legally binding agreement that is signed by the parent and an agency representative who has authority to bind the agency in addition the agreement is to be enforceable in state or federal court 303431 g7g6g561g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g142g156g561 303230 through 303236 of the proposed regulations add detailed departmental procedures which parallel those in part b regulations 300179300183 regarding the secretary disapproving states application including requirements for notice and hearing before initial and final disapproval decisions are made 142 part c requires that the governor of state select lead state agency to oversee and carry out the part c program 1435a10 this agency may be the sea

pay for services provided under part c for example the state would be required to obtain parental consent to use public insurance or program benefits of parent or child enrolled or participating in public insurance or public benefit program similarly states would be able to use private insurance if parental consent is provided parental consent would not be required if the state has enacted certain statutes related to the use of private insurance for part c services eg that the use of such insurance cannot be the basis for increasing the health insurance premiums of the infant or toddler with disability or the childs family 303520b2iii g18g142g155g150g146g157g157g142g141g561g8g142g142g156g561 part c permits states to charge fees for some part c services under certain circumstances
