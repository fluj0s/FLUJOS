finance division march 1 2006 abstract this report examines the accuracy of past forecasts of economic growth by omb cbo and the blue chip economic indicators beginning with 1985 for the most part the three forecasts did about equally well the one exception seems to be that ombs mean errors were less than those of the other two in all three cases the forecasts on average tended to err on the pessimistic side but because ombs forecasts were optimistic relative to the other two they had smaller mean error interestingly mean errors were actually larger in year 1 forecasts than they were for year 5 forecasts there seemed to be tendency for errors to increase the farther into the future the forecasts gohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31140congressional research service the library of congresscrs

effects of the economy on the budget policy decisions regarding the overall levels of spending and taxes require some idea of how the economy is likely to perform for this reason both the c ongressional budget office cbo and the office of management and budget omb prepare twice year set of economic projections on which to base consideration of budget policy economic growth affects both spending and taxes faster economic growth means higher tax receipts because of the interaction of higher incomes with progressive personal income tax rates faster economic growth reduces outlays because the debt and interest payments on that debt are smaller than otherwise would be the case in the short run fast er economic growth also means lower rates of unemployment and thus re duced income support payments the longrun growth rate of the economy is primarily deter mined by the growth rate of the labor force and the rate of growth of productivity labor force growth can be estimated from data regarding the age di stribution of the population and is fairly straightforward projecting produc tivity growth is more difficult economists have an incomp lete understanding of the factors that contribute to productivity growth past variations in productivity growth ve yet to be fully explained many economic m odels take productivity grow th as given something that is determined outside of the m odels themselves often projections of productivity are simply extra polations of recent trends which may be adjusted to reflect the relative optimism or pessimism of the forecaster this paper examines the accuracy of past forecasts of economic growth by omb cbo and the blue chip economic indicators beginning with 1985 for the most part the three forecasts did about equally well cbo and the blue chip forecasts tended to be slightly pessimistic on average but there was evidence of statistically significant bias in any of the forecasts neither was there any tendency for errors to increase the further into the future the forecasts go slower expected economic growth reduces projected revenues and increases projected outlays the effect on revenues is substantially larger than the effect on outlays but over five years just 01 slower growth increases the cumulative projected deficits by 38 billion this report will be updated annuallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31140contents p r j c t i n

the federal budget affects and is aff ected by the performance of the economy because of the effects of the economy on the budget policy decisions regarding the overall levels of spending and taxes require some idea of how the economy is likely to perform for this reason both the congressional budget office cbo and the office of management and budget omb prepare twice year set of economic projections on which to base consideration of budget policy economic growth affects both spending and taxes slower economic growth means lower tax receipts because of bot h lower incomes and progressive personal income tax rates slower economic growth increases outlays because the debt and interest payments on that debt are larger than otherwise would be the case in the shortrun slower economic growth also means high er rates of unemployment and thus increased income support payments because the conduct of fiscal policy depends on the outlook for the economy these forecasts are important this report examines the accuracy of both cbo and ombs projections of real economic gr owth over successive fiveyear periods beginning in 1985 specifically the projecti ons are those that are released at the beginning of each calendar year to coincide with the release of the presidents proposed budget those forecasts are co mpared to private forecast the blue chip economic indicators the blue chip forecast is an average of about 50 private economic forecasts because it is cons ensus forecast it is good standard against which to assess the accuracy of the cbo and omb forecasts the blue chip forecasts here were released in march of each of the years examined the projections examined here are of yearoveryear growth in real economic output for the years 1985 through 1991 the pr ojections refer to real gross national product gnp for 1992 and thereafter they refer to real gross domestic product gdp measures of both gnp and gdp have been subject to multiple revisions over the years which presents the problem of which vintage of data should be used to assess the accuracy of the forecasts the actual data used in this analysis are the most recent available as published by th bureau of economic analysis of the department of commerce projecting longrun growth rates as rule when omb and cbo make longterm projections of economic growth they do not attempt to predict the ups and downs associated with the business cycle if the economy is at full employme nt at the time of the forecast then the projection is based on an timate of the likely longt erm trend rate of economic growth this is the rate of growth believed to be consistent with stable inflation andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31140crs2 full employment if the economy is less than fully employed then the projection typically shows the economy gradually achieving full employment and then continuing at the estimated longrun trend rate of growth the longrun growth rate of the economy is primarily deter mined by the growth rate of the labor force and the rate of growth of productivity labor force growth can be estimated from data regarding the age di stribution of the population and is fairly straightforward projecting produc tivity growth is more difficult economists have an incomp lete understanding of the factors that contribute to productivity growth past va riations in productivity gr owth have yet to be fully explained many economic m odels take productivity grow th as given something that is determined outside of the m odels themselves often projections of productivity are simply extra polations of recent trends which may be adjusted to reflect the relative optimism or pessimism of the forecaster some events that may have both shor t and longterm ec onomic consequences simply can not be predicted such as the oil shocks of the 1970s the asian financial crisis terrorism and the war in iraq thus while some forecasting error may be attributable to less than perfect unders tanding of the economy some error will always be due to the events that can never be fully anticipated measures of forecast error in order to compare the accuracy of the three forecasts over an extended period of time three summary measures of error are calculated these measures attempt to characterize the relative accuracy of the forecasts in an individual statistic the three measures are mean error mean abso lute error and root mean squared error individual errors are calculated by subtracting the actual data from the forecast positive error indicates excessive optimism and negative error indicates excessive pessimism mean error is the simple arithmetic aver age of all the individual errors because positive and negative errors tend to offset one another large mean error could be indicative of tendency towards overly optimistic or pessimistic forecasts mean absolute error is the average of the absolu values of each of the individual errors taking the absolute values of the indivi dual errors before averaging them prevents positive and negative errors from offsetting one another and indicates how far off forecast tended to be whether it was too high or too low root mean squared error is calculated by taking the s quare root of the average of the squares of the individual errors squaring the errors prevents positive and negative errors from offsetting one another it also places larger weight on larger errors this measure helps to indicate those forecaste rs who when wrong tended to miss by lot table 1 shows these summary measures of error for each of the three forecasters the statistics are broken down by year separate error measures are shown for 1 2 3 4 and 5year out forecasts the year 1 forecast is for the calendar year following the year in which the forecast was published in other words for the forecast released in early 1985 year 1 refers to the forecast for 1986 year 2 refers to the forecast for 1987 and so on year 1 forecasts in clude those releasedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31140crs3 1 mean absolute errors are the averages of the absolute values of the errors that is mean absolute error indicates how far off forecast tended to be regardless of whether it was too optimistic or too pessimisticas recently as 2004 all forecasts for whic h actual data are available are included in the summary measures of error table 1 summary

the three forecasts did about equally well cbo and the blue chip forecasts nded to be slightly pessimistic on average but there was evidence of statistically significant bias in any of the forecasts neither was there any tendency for errors to increase the farther into the future the forecasts go mean absolute errors ranged be tween 103 and 124 percentage points1 thus when not taking into account whether the for ecasts were too high or too low they were consistently off by over percentage point interestingly the mean absolute errors in the first year were about the same as in the fifth year for all three forecasters the root mean squared errors were larger but were similar for each ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31140crs4 2 root mean squared error emphasizes larger errors thus it can be used to identify forecast which when it missed tended to miss by lotthe three forecasters2 based on these statistics it woul d be hard to argue that one of the forecasters did significantly better than either of the others budget implications these errors can tran slate into substantial effect s on projections of the budget cbo has published estimates of the effects on projected budget totals of changing the underlying economic projections these timates may also give rough indication of how much the actual budget might chan ge if the economy does better or worse than the economic forecast on whic h the projected budget is based table 2 shows cbos most recent estima tes of the sensitivity of budget projections to changes in the underlying economic assumptions the table shows how much projected outlays revenues nd the unified budget surplus would change if real economic growth were to be 01 slower than th current baseline projection this assumes reduction in the trend rate of economic growth and not cyclical decline in other words it is attr ibutable to slower productivity growth table 2 estimated effect of 01 slower economic growth on the budget all figures in billions of
