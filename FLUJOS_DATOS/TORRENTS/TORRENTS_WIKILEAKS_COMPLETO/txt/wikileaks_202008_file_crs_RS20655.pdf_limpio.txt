its traditional role as rubberstamp legislature3 qiao was the chairman of the eighth npc standing committee from 1993 to 1997 but he failed to retain his position with the commencement of the ninth congress in 1998 during his tenure qiao who was also highranking member of the ccp became known as an advocate of reforms which included greater autonomy for the legislature more power for lowerlevel peoples congresses rapid economic liberalization and establishment of the rule of law4 while qiaos objectives were not clear he did lead an increasingly assertive congress he was successful in enacting variety of economic legislation on corporate law labor urban real estate contract law and ethical competition in the market place5 through his national and international tours he also worked to add legitimacy to the npc in march 1995 an unprecedented 365 of npc deputies voted against appointing ccp politburo member to deputy premiership because they considered him to be poorly suited for the position6 the same session was marked by up to third of deputies voting against or abstaining from key governmentsponsored legislation involving state council control over the centra l bank education law and reports of the supreme court and the supreme procurators office7 also under qiaos leadership of the congress several senior ccp leaders including li peng were humiliated when they received numerous negative votes during confirmation hearings8 such incidents were almost unheard of in previous congresses9 the ninth congress the tenth congress begins in 2003 held its first session in march of 1998 as chairman of the npcs standing committee li peng who is also the second ranking ccp politburo member is the leader of the ninth congress under li peng who is considered conservative

resolutions that were backed by the communist party10 recent npc actions appear to confirm the remark li peng made during the session that all items of legislation and supervisory work undertaken by the npc completely and thoroughly follow the line and policies of the chinese communist party11 economic reform was focus of this years congress for example the legislature addressed adjusting agriculture laws in preparation for entry to the world trade organization it also addressed the issue of restructuring stateowned enterprises12 the sensitive topic of political reform did not receive any mention13 other prominent topics that the ninth congress addressed included corruption falun gong the congress passed law banning and criminalizing socalled cults and entry into the world trade organization one of the largest issues facing the npc is corruption on july 31 2000 the former vice chairman of the npcs standing committee cheng kejie who served as vicechairman until april 2000 was sentenced to death for accepting about 5 million in bribes14 cheng is the most senior prc official to receive this sentence since 1949 when the communists came into power prc president jiang zemin has used the highlevel sentencing as basis for reinforcing party loyalty through an ideological campaign of selfcriticism and study of his speeches on corruption15 this insecurity within the congress over corruption firm leadership by ccp leader li peng and other top ccp leaders who continually stress party loyalty together with long history of the npc acting in relative unity with party leadership work to keep the npc in its role as rubberstamp congress description of the npc the prcs constitution names the npc as chinas highest organ of state power16 in reality however the congress mostly acts as reflection of ccp policies and decisions li peng the current npc chairman is the second highestranking official in the chinese communist party the highestranking ccp official jiang zemin is also president of the prc general secretary of the ccp and chairman of the central military commission in the prcs oneparty system the ccp exercises control over the npc as it does all other
