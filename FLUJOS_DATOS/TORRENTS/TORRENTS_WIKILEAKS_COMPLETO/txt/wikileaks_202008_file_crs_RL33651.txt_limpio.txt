credit rating agency regulatory reform sidebyside comparison of hr 2990 and s 3850 summary credit rating agencies assess the probability that securities issuer will default by failing to repay principal and interest on the security globally there are about 130 agencies but moodys and standard poors sp combine for about 80 of overall market share with fitch accounting for about 15 share in 1975 the securities and exchange commission sec issued the net capital rule which set new capital requirements for brokerdealers and required them to take larger discount on their bond holdings deemed to be below investment grade by rating agency that it recognized as nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro since then growing number of federal state and foreign government statutes and regulations have adopted nrsro ratings as reference points or triggers however there is statutory definition of an nrsro when rating agency requests nrsro status it applies to the sec division of market regulation for nrsro designation decisionmaking process that is often both uncertain and of an indefinite time span currently five rating agencies have nrsro designation fitch moodys sp the am best company which rates insurance and reinsurance firms and the dominion bond rating service limited canadianbased firm like other providers of financial market analysis the major nrsros play critical role as financial sentries or gatekeepers whose assessments can help warn against corporate meltdowns their record however is imperfect for example in 2001 moodys sp and fitch issued favorable credit ratings of worldcom bonds three months before the company declared bankruptcy additional concerns exist over the way in which the nrsro process may impede nonnrsros access to more profitable segments of the rating industry in the 109th congress two legislative responses to the perceived shortcomings of the nrsro protocol are hr 2990 fitzpatrick the credit rating agency duopoly relief act of 2006 which passed the house on july 12 2006 and s 3850 shelby the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 which was voted out of the senate banking and urban affairs committee on august 2 2006 both bills would scrap the current nrsro designation process and instead would allow entities with at least three consecutive years as rating agencies to register with the sec as nrsros s 3850 would permit the sec to reject rating agencys application for nrsro registration if it determined that the rater lacked sufficient financial and managerial resources whereas hr 2990 would impose such test each bill if enacted would be likely to significantly expand the number of nrsros this report provides sidebyside comparison of the bills major provisions it will be updated as events dictate contents introduction 1 list of tables table 1 comparison of major provisions of hr 2990 and s 3850 3 credit rating agency regulatory reform sidebyside comparison of hr 2990 and s 3850 introduction credit rating agencies assess the probability that securities issuer will default by failing to repay principal and interest on the security two rating agencies dominate the rating industry moodys and standard poors sp who combine for about 80 of the overall market share fitch ratings has about 15 share globally there are about 130 agencies in 1975 the securities and exchange commission sec issued the net capital rule which set new capital requirements for brokerdealers and required them to take larger discount on their bond holdings deemed to be below investment grade by rating agency that it recognized as nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro since then growing number of federal state and foreign government statutes and regulations have adopted nrsro ratings as reference points or triggers but there is statutory definition of an nrsro when rating agency requests nrsro status it applies to the sec division of market regulation for nrsro designation and through what is known as the noaction letter process1 the division can take an indefinite amount of time to determine whether to grant the designation decision that is significantly based on whether the applicant is nationally recognized issuer of credible ratings currently five rating agencies have nrsro designations fitch moodys sp the am best company which rates insurance and reinsurance firms and received nrsro status in 2005 and the dominion bond rating service limited canadianbased firm that was granted nrsro status in 2003 in addition to other sources of financial market analysis like securities analysts the major nrsros also play critical role as financial sentries or gatekeepers whose assessments can help warn against corporate meltdowns their record however is imperfect in 2001 moodys sp and fitch issued favorable credit ratings of worldcom bonds three months before the company declared bankruptcy moodys and sp provided favorable bond ratings for enron corporate bonds just before the firms bankruptcy the collapse of these firms eventually cost investors billions of 1 noaction letter is an sec communication stipulating that the agency does not object to course of action proposed by registrant they are generally issued after an applicant has made request crs2 dollars and provoked widespread criticism of the agencies both in and out of congress these concerns to which the nrsros respond that they were themselves the victims of corporate deceit exist alongside criticism that the nrsro selection process is an anticompetitive mechanism that impedes nonnrsros access to the more profitable segments of the rating industry the congressional response to the perceived problems surrounding the nrsro process and its potentially undesirable consequences has led to the introduction of two bills in the 109th congress hr 2990 fitzpatrick the credit rating agency duopoly relief act of 2006 passed the house on july 12 2006 in vote closely divided along partisan lines soon afterwards on august 2 s 3850 shelby the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 was voted out of the senate banking and urban affairs committee with significant bipartisan support both bills would scrap the secs current noactionletterbased nrsro designation process with its central focus on whether an agency is nationally recognized as an issuer of credible ratings and with its indefinite decision making time frames both would amend the securities exchange act of 1934 to allow interested entities with at least three consecutive years as rating agencies to register with the sec as nrsros which would involve the submission of performance measurement statistics description of their rating methodology details of ethics policies and disclosure of conflicts of interest under both bills once the sec received credit agencys application to register as an nrsro it would have up to 120 days with the possibility of an extension if deemed necessary to determine whether to deny or grant the registration s 3850 would allow the sec to reject rating agencys application for nrsro registration if it determined the applicant lacked sufficient financial and managerial resources hr 2990 has such requirement s 3850 would require nrsro applicants to provide written certifications from at least 10 of their institutional customers to the sec applicants would also have to provide list of their 20 largest issuers and subscribers by the amount of net revenues received in the previous year neither provision is part of hr 2990 s 3850 would also direct the sec to issue rules on nrsro conflicts of interest and the misuse of nonpublic information conflicts of interest provisions that are absent from hr 2990 either bill if enacted would be likely to significantly expand the number of nrsros from the current five this report compares the major provisions of the two legislative proposals key differences between the two bills have been italicized
