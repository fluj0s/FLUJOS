routine 3ga part ii lecture given on 24 july 1962 okay this is lecture two saint hill special briefing course 24 july ad 12 another lecture briefer one on routine 3ga the way you detect whether or not person is running well on routine 3ga is as follows theyve got tone arm action and the tone arm is routinely and regularly coming down as well as going up the pc looks good and the pc is not very arc breaky and the want line gives the pc an occasional somatic by which i mean pain pc wants to know what pain is take pin and shove it in him thats pain sometimes pc will tell you yes i have somatics and by that they mean sensation or dull thump or twitch see now we want pain actual pain pain on the want line occasional pain on the want line and nothing else on the want line senno sensationyou know wogwog dizziness and that sort of thing and on the pull back from the goal occasional pains see thats the old notwant line and on the oppose the goal line sen winds of space wog bzmmbzmm twitches thumps see but not pain i would say so far as maybe occasionally why the pc get mixed up and name the wrong terminal and they get small pain on that line but it would be wogwog mugmug and the who or what would pull back the opposition to the goal on that fourth line or whatever the thirdline three of listing is also bit of sensensation dizziness motion that sort of thingthat occasionally turns on or winds of space momentarily not to any great excessive degree now thats what happens when pc is going right and the auditor can read the meter and its the right goal and the lines are being listed okay and the mid ruds are being kept in and so forth thats what should happen if that isnt happening there are certain things going wrong and i will tell you what those things are on the whole of routine 3ga in moment but let tell you what happens if 3ga is going wrong it doesnt matter whether it is inat what stage of listing the goal these things happen or at what stage of nulling or something of the sortthat is nulling goalsyou havent found the goal yet dont you see so the only thing that can be wrong before you find the goal is actually bad sessioning and bad metering thats all that can go wrong see thats the only thing that can go wrong on finding them there is something wrong with session formwell tr 2 is bad tr 1 is horrible auditor cant read the meter this sort of thing and i can give you lot of other materials to make sure that that goes right but if that is really going wrong then it is just bad sessioning or bad metering and pc isnt arc breaky nothing is really going haywire if yourif your sessioning is all right and your metering is all right you know but lets take after the goal is found lets take after the goal is found and you start listing it and now were going to find several symptoms if it is the wrong goal and these things are very very important for you to know because by george pc ever went clear on the wrong goal because you list the wrong goal and its just more alteris and more alteris and more alteris there are four things out which can make goal read its the wrong goal but itll readboy will it read beautifully every time something has been suggested on the goal something has been suppressed something has been invalidated or something has been failure to revealsomething has not been revealed you in actual fact only have three of these which are capable of making goal read that isnt the goalonly three of thembut the fourth is supplementary to it suppressed because the wrongness you see wont read if youve suppressed an invalidation you dont get the invalidation to read dont you see so youve gotthats right you suppress an invalidation you can suppress failed to reveal you can suppress suggestion and you cant get the thing to read so you get suppress in first first you get in suppress and then you get in suggestedif you want to know the actual apple pie order hereand then you get in invalidated and then you get in failed to reveal now this is quite elementary because anybody can tell failed to reveal its the dirty needle its the little tiny minute rock slam that little agitated rock slam multiple read you say the goal and you get multiple read you say the goal and you get multiple read you getsay the goal and it goes bzztbzztbzzt well thats failed to reveal you can always identify failed to reveal failed to reveal never reads any other way it can be such tiny bzzt that at first glance it might look like tick but even that is rare usually its aits bzzt usually about at sensitivity 16 that is about an eighth of an inch wide or something like that if you can imagine rock slam an eighth of an inch wide well thats that dirty needle and thats something hasnt been revealed so that leaves only two things that will make goal ticktick and one is suggestion which is evaluation our old two first lines of the auditors code for gods sakes way back then and the other is an invalidation the two tions and thats the only thing oddly enough that can make goal go tickticktick like goal when it isnt the goal now any goal on the list any goal on the list can be made to read like the goal by knuckleheaded auditorany goal on the list weve got goal to catch catfish and it is more the pcs goal see than climbing clouds is see but the auditor looks very hard at this goal and he says to catch catfish to catch catfish to catch catfish say you know that reads every time to climb clouds to climb clouds to climb clouds that doesnt read and so on down the list now he comes back through and so help pete to catch catfish tick to catch catfish tick to catch catfish tick itll go right on through till the end of the session too itll go right on through to the end of the goals list too huhhuh why there was hidden invalidation along with the evaluation the auditor seemed to give the goal an isness the auditor in any way at any stage even at the end misreads his meter or hes got an invalidated goal thats already invalidated and looks up brightly and looks like hes found the goal and he says well thatthatthat reads that reads every time now just prior to that as the auditor went over the final list let us sayusually this is condition happening on final lists because the goal has to be little bit sticky to get into this shapeas the auditor went over it the pc might have said to himself to catch catfish thats silly damn goal hoho on the next pass around on the nulling the auditor saysof course now the thing will tick every time because the pc has invalidated itnow lets really hang this thing up but good lets just drive it in with spikes and make this thing look just like goal the auditor says well hahhhhh that reads every time to catch catfish to catch catfish to catch cat the pc has already said that isnt my goal the pc says are you suresee invalidation number two see the auditor says oh yeah yeah it reads to catch catfish to catch catfish it reads every time hahahaha pc says my god that doesnt sound like my goal invalidation number three evaluation invalidation evaluation inval get the idea bang bang bang bang wow this thing will check out by any knuckleheaded checker and you start listing ithere we go the tone arm will start going up and stop moving maybe this is after ten or twelve hours of listing dont expect it to happen right away usually four and half five something like that sticks pc starts to look awfully bad blablaglaaglaa and so on and sort of caved in in session they are arc breaky as hell when youre trying to list yapyapyapyapyap chopchopchopchopchop you just cant keep your rudiments in during listing and the somatics are wrong if you get any pain at all which is highly unlikelyso unlikely that you say an absence of pain equals wrong goal pain wrong goal the pc gets sensation dizziness and so forth on the want line who or what would want goal and now the pc after while after ten or twelve hours starts going wogwogwogwog gets sensation winds of space if there is any pain at all occurs it will occur perhaps on the opposewhich is highly unlikely that any will occurbut oppose is more comfortable to run than wantwant line the other two just compound the felony oddly enough pc very often if its anywhere close to his goal at all will run it with great apparent satisfaction will go around and tell people this is his goal will figure out his life by it although there are some blank sections that dont quite add up but he wont be unhappy with it he wont be going around telling you its wrong goal matter of fact may even get mad at you when you try to tell him it isnt his goal because hes so anxious to have goal dont you see any goal is better than goal it gets him off the horror of search search search for the goal dont you see hes more likely to hold on to it than he is to give it up and those are the only symptoms high ta that sticks pc looks bad pc arc breaky and the somatics are wrong they are reversed if they exist at all theyre all opposition somatics actually opposition somatics are sensation dizziness winds of space that sort of thing and anything he lists gives him those now if you keep going in this direction youre adding more and more alteris to the bank and the bank gets heavier and heavier and thicker and thicker and the pc feels all bowed down and crushed now in actual listing of the right goal there is certain amount of bank gets thicker there is certain amount of wog there is certain amount of these other things so very often pc will persist hoping that they will go by and they will run out but they do not they get worse and they get worse and they get worse and they get worse and they never get any better and that is the difficulties of running wrong goal now wrong goal is found by bad sessioning and bad metering and by not hitting the thing right or checking the goal out right at the end its pretty easy to find right goal now ive told you what is the symptoms of bad 3ga are somebody doing 3ga wrong after the goal has been quote found unquote you get those manifestations that i have just given you those things occur in the pc and the remedies of 3ga are these in listing on goals the goal is unrevealedits unrevealed yetso get list complete or find out why pc wont give it thats highly generalized statement these are the things that you asif you were d of p or something like that and somebody said well i just cant find the goal and so forth you know thats number one that you would tell him see well your list is incomplete so go on listing and get the goal you see thats that thats what youd tell him just automatically there arent any other reasons except this one bad metering we assume the fellow is running 3ga dont you see lets not get picky as to whether or not when he reads the emeter he is holding his pinkie at exactly fiftythree degrees from the horizontal while he shifts the tone arm you understand that is not whats wrong see thats not whats wrong its the goal isnt on the list or the metering is bad see that its elementary my dear watson thats the only two things that really go wrong assuming that the guy sits in the chair and goes through model session and gets the goals listed and nulled you are not even assuming thats good and you are not going to find fault with it particularly thats not what you are going to pick on you are d of ping some auditor and he just cant seem to get to first base and he cant ever find the goal then you are going to tell him two things well the goal isnt on the list so get it complete or your metering stinks its one or the other and of course bad metering would have missed the goal prepcheck would have revealed wrong goal you see all that would have beenbeen remedied actually in thein just the standard rundown of 3ga so only these two things stand out as being things that could be wrong with trying to find somebodys goal and those are the things that are wronggoal hasnt been revealed or the metering is bad one or the other could be both you know too and the next one is when the goal has been found and the pc is turning up with these upper symptoms which ive just given you and the goal has been found then this is what you do there are only three things that can be wrong in listing from goal the only thing that can be wrong is the goal or the lines or the metering now thats all that can be wrong and if you were d of ping somebody and he was listing on lines and the pc was starting to get high tone arm and it was sticky and the pc looked bad lets just say thats enough nothing else going on the pc isnt particularly screaming andand the somaticswell hes not getting anything he really cant tell about the somatics he isnt getting any sensation or something like that and yet youre listing and this is what youd pick on or if the pc was screaming arc break session after session after session he just couldnt hold any rudiments in at all these three things are what you do you recheck the goal and recheck the lines and remedy the bad metering see and if the somatics didnt exist there was pain of any kind whatsoever and there was plenty of sen sen sen and the bank getting thicker and thicker and bearing the pc down harder and harder and more and more and all that sort of thing then its these three lines that you would check see these three things is recheck the goal recheck the lines and remedy the bad metering thats all youd tell this auditor dont tell him anything else dont say well weve got to reform the lines and i think the best thing that we can do in the reformation of the linesiithink youre betterperhaps its your tr 4 or maybe the pc has missed withhold ill tell you missed withhold pc had who was very arc breaky in session one of the lines was wrong and auditor would listen to him it was missed withhold it was totally missed on and on and on and the pc only required few more hours of listing to go clear after the line was corrected which is quite interesting see missed withhold so we just dont go into those things dont go into the mechanics of anything theres only three things wrong if 3ga starts wrong and thats you recheck the goal and you recheck the lines and you check the metering thats it now its very fortunate for you that nothing else can be wrong with 3ga thats all that can be wrong because we assume the fellowthe auditor can sit in the chair we assume that he can go through his model session we can assume that his tr 1 is understandable see we can underwe can assume all of these things because they vary in degree from auditor to auditor and it isnt their varying in degree which causes the pc to have high ta to look bad to be arc breaky and have sensation instead of pain see it isnt those things doing it so dont ever look for anything small now you think youre jumping off for something adventurous when you try to find out pcs goal thats nothing compared to jumping off for listing his lines because you have now hit the silk and it is in the lap of the gods whether the chute opens or not see its just that youve jumped off into nowhere youre committed because if you are wrong the next time you try to find the pcs goal its going to be much more difficult than it was and supposing you found two wrong goals on the pc one after the other and listed both of them well the thing youd do would be to findtry to find the right goal again and you take third one and supposing that was the wrong goal how hardermuch harder do you think the goal will be found next time well i know whereof i speak because ive had five wrong goals found on in the name of research i could go on the mother plea you know what i have suffered for you children you know but actually i know what i am talking about here very much on the groove both from watching you subjective reality experimentation on it it has not been easy to pioneer this particular track into 3ga because the gpm is nothing to stand up and box with man and i would say this i have been standing up and boxing with it without any information about it at all originally and its got teeth man the things got teeth boy you never felt some of the somatics like can turn on when you do it completely wrong lets really be wrong with it man thats matter of waking up screaming im not trying to exaggerate this 3ga is pretty good but you mishandle the gpm you mishandle auditing you let auditors start auditing goals and finding goals on pcs that dont knoweven know how to sit in chair youll regret it i can hear it now two oclock in the morning your telephone will be ringing my god what do i do well the pc after theyve been wrong listed for while are not in state of mind to have another goal found on them because any auditing at this point starts to beef up the bank now that the bank has started to beef up anything goes on from there and beefs up the bank further and they dont want to be audited and that is another little manifestation that you can put down goal that has been wrong and it has been listedthat person will then pretty well routinely tell you they dont want any auditing and the only hope in hell for them is some good auditing so you see im not trying to make you scared of the gpm im not im not because i go on the basis that if i could stand up and box with some critter you can and it wont kill you dead youll just wish you were but youll come out all right now how do you go about these various operations well im not trying to give you summary lecture of all of 3ga youve already got the parts of 3ga i want to give you few little modifications and changes and some stuff that ive dug up here in the last few weeks on 3ga that will be of great value to you you must complete the list ive already told you that it takes about 850 goals plus to get complete goals list pc can do this on his own and actually id keepif i had pc id just keep kicking him in the head till he gave goals list 850 long why because its unembarrassing for him to sit in the quiet of the evening with nobody around and write down these appalling goals you see in fact you are more likely to get the goal on the list see he isnt embarrassed by your presence or she isnt embarrassed by your presence you know they write down the goals that occur to them so you want about 850 plus thats absolute minimum 850 but what makes minimum goals list it is not for your benefit because youve been having hard time establishing this an absence of ta action take that as matter of course its actually an absence of needle action you want goals list so complete that when you read series of goals on that list to the pc five or six goals half of them will give you twitch at all another one will twitch maybe once in three reads another one will possibly twitch once and one will twitch twice to stay in and that would be about it its aboutactually six is an unhappy numberits more likemore like ten you want about one in in ten now this violates datum youve had for long time that if the needle stopped twitching on goalsyoure going to get twitch anyway someplace or another i find recently on very careful experimentation that you can list the goals list down so completely that goal after goal read after read three reads per goal and you get single twitch for three and four goals in row and about the time you decide the middle rudiments must be out out out why all of sudden one ticks you say well thats nice you get tick so you know the pc is still reading on the meter but thats about all it would tell you on first nulling you get three in per pageper sheet and on second nulling why you get almost scrub it goes down to about thirty goals now thats how complete list can be these ticks that you get are specific ticks if you get little tiny rock slam when you read goal as an instant readof course theyre classic instant reads none of this slightly early or anything like that man you really got to watch that with goals you see you could leave something in if you werent sure dont go beating your brains out because it isnt important whether or not you leave it on the list the first time but dont go to the point of leaving them all on the list the first time because the pc has constant dirty needle thatd be nonsense but youve got all of these goals and theyre falling off left and right and theyre nulling down bangetybangetybangetybangetybang an occasional tick is all you require to tell you that the pc is still reading on the meter goals lists can be complete enough to leave completely limp goals list now if that goals list doesnt add up to complete limpness make absolutely sure that it isnt your rudiments that are giving you action rudiments might be wildly out you see make sure your rudiments are in well when youre reading that list dont be alarmed if two or three times page particularly early in sessioningif your meter reading is good this can happen to youi mean even if your meter reading is good this can happen to youthat early on on nulling of goals list your pc goes bzzt allevery once in while and tick tick tick tick and slash slash and then constant dirty needle and oh dah and random and dont be upset if the pcs needle goes to hell you just get competent in straightening out pcs needles thats all now ive seen pcs needle straightened out in many different ways the easiest way to straighten them out is get fast check on the middle ruds that is the most predictable and easy way now you can introduce lot of corny rudiments and dream ups of one kind or another you can introduce lot of extraordinary activities here to clean this thing up but fish and fumble of just sitting back is something that you are eventually sometimes driven to you cant get it in with the middle ruds and you dont know what the hell it is youre just in drift well sit back and say well im going to see what this is doing and just do it by steering fish and fumble you see the needle go bzzzt and bzzzt and over again you say what did you think of then whatcha looking at there there there oh nothing ii justjust the pattern of the table here in front of thats all i keep looking at its just like my mothers boudoir table you know bzzzt bzzzt bzzzt you know and you say well anybody miss withhold about that or something like this see oh yeah i broke all of her perfume one day haha i nearly forgot about that and so on the needle is fine goes thats kind of an extraordinary solution but i have been driven to it pcs needle becomes utterly unreadable it doesnt matter whether you are reading goal to them or not reading goal to them it just keeps going bzztbzztbzztbzzt you dont know whether its falling on this or falling on that and its just gone dirty in the process of reading the goals matter how limp the list was doesnt mean the list was charged the pc gets kind of anxious the pc goes out of session and remember those goals are awful doggone restimulative and they kick in prepcheck chains and they do all kinds of weird things but dont go on struggling against reading goals with pcs needle dirty enough to be washed by the empire laundry see dont do that dont keep trying to read through dirty needle what the hell are you doing that for the pcs out of session you dont know what the goal is reading on even though the pcs rudiments are in the pc is out of session as long as that needle is ticking on other things that youve got nothing to do with because you are not talking to the pc the pc isnt rethe pc isnt reacting to the things you want him to react to so therefore the pcs out of session so you keep going and you keep going oh god theres that dirty needle again lets see to catch catfish all right its equivocal ah to catch thats it its still doing it im not saying anything in this sessionyou are shortly going to see change for goals processing in the middle rudiments by the wayis there anything you have suppressed suggested invalidated failed to reveal or been careful of that read careful of whats that whats that oh im just careful not to think ive been sitting here concentrating carconcentrating on not thinking and you say good thank you ill check that on the meter all right in this session is there anything you have been careful of yeah just not to think haha good thank you ill check that out in this session is there anything you have been careful of thats clean do you agree thats clean do you agree thats clean all right thank you very much to catch catfish to catch catfish to catch catfish see to hit polar bears to hit polar bears to hit po okay if its all right with you there well because the second you started to say to hit polar bears it started going all the way across after youve done this for fifteen or twenty minutes with pc then all of suddenyouve cleaned it up two or three timesthis starts happening the auditor will say to catch catfish tick tick to catch catfish tick to catch catfish yeah well thats out once in while be bright enough to stay in twoway comm with your pc because very often the omission of twoway comm means the intermission and intervention of tremendous amount of middle rudiments this is the way to handle something like that this is the kind of answer you get you say whats going on whats happening haha knew when you read that slow that my needle had gotten dirty and i was worrying about what i might be stuck in now you say thank you and the needle clears right up see twoway comm is always marvelous twoway comm has this limitation if you cant find out by asking once you shut up and do something else that is the rule back of twoway comm you can always ask any question of the pc its not metered question dont you see in the line of twoway comm cut comments to minimum the more you comment the worse off the pc will get dont comment thats an evaluation of sorts but you can ask the pc any kind of question you want to you can ask how are you getting along you see dirty needle start up you cant read through it how are you getting along oh ive been very nervous the last few minutes ever since you read that goal to hit lions ive had feeling here like i havent got any top to my body all right you say thank you dirty needle continues get in your middle ruds see dont go on and on and on well what about this lion when did you first think about this lion have you always been troubled with lions you are not running session having to do with running engrams connected with lions and you go on and violate this rule of its all right to ask him anything once you violate that rulethats good rule you can ask pc anything onceyou violate that rule and youll find yourself running engrams and whole track and god knows what and all messed up and then running an engram so that you can clean up his needle oh man its just getting dirtier and dirtier and stickier and stickier and messier and messier and of course the less auditing you do the less auditing he gets the more anxious the pc gets the dirtier the needle gets you see how it defeats itself because youre doing an alteris you are jamming him up in the bank you see just goes on the basic principles of what the gpm is so the more you alteris what your intention is hereyour intention is to find the guys goaland the more you depart from that why the unhappier the pc gets now its when the pc begins to realize that you can read meter youre not leaving him hanging or her hanging in midair you know do you have present time problem the pc is about to say yes as matter of fact i was sued for thousand dollars today and as matter of fact the court is going to hold in contempt and let hes about to say something like this you see the pc says ahhh and the auditor says do you agree thats clean pc goes into little bit of state of shock see hes been notised see trmeter tr 4 is very poor at this point you only have to make few of those mistakes and the pc doesnt have any confidence in you anymore now you make him straightway you make him you know calling it every time calling it every time right on the button never miss read you know bangbang pc eventually forgets about the meter and his problems he knows youll take care and hell sit back further and further and relax more and more and life is wonderful and he sure doesnt get in your road in ain goals assessment see and after youve been assessing him for day or two and hes learned that you are to be trusted and that sort of thing the needle doesnt dirty up but the more extraordinary solutions the more meter goofs why the dirtier the pcs needle is going to get thats for sure and after youve been doing goals on pc for couple of days couple of days and you find out his needle is getting worse than it was then that means that every time you put in the mid ruds you must have driven half of them out see thats it thats it you just miss miss miss miss miss i mean there isnt any argument with this it isnt because your tone of voice is this or youre that its just bad metering thats the end of it bad metering is what makes the needle go bzztbzzt all right enough of that berating the point im trying to make here is you want to audit the right goal that is desirable that is productive of live thetans that doesnt leave you in the embarrassing position of the pc all of sudden cant use his legs and cant hear by reason of the auditing session that doesnt leave you in the interesting position of having pc with siren going off hour after hour that you cant hear but he sure can theres substitute for the right goal it is thoroughly recommended now how do you find out if youve got right goal and ill tell you exactly how to do fast check on right goal this is an instructortype check but you can pull this thing off in ten or fifteen minutes rather than make yourself look silly there is real reason to give prepcheck every five sessions mathematically theres reason at all to do so there is every reason to give prepcheck every time youre having trouble with the pc that might be oftener than five sessions and if youre that smooth it might go up to ten or twelve you understand five sessions was given as an arbitrary figure entirely and completely arbitrary just to make sure that you did prepcheck the pc but theres real reason to do it oftener than is necessary because it can amount to auditing for the pc and can give you roughedup needle because of the anxiety of the pc and you come out the other side of the prepcheck with rougher needle than you start into it see all right now the way you do fast check is based on the data i gave you earlier goal reads on itself as itself on its own charge in the bank or it doesnt read because of invalidations or evaluations that is true goal or goal reads because it has been invalidated and after you have cleaned it up it for moment doesnt read and then starts to read again on its own but the only thing that make acan make goal read wrong are suppress suggestsuppress because of course you dont get thethe needle actionsuppress suggest invalidate failed to reveal see those are the four things there are others there isnt concentrate upon shift of attention you see and there arent whole bunch of other buttons of these only two can introduce goallike read failed to reveal introduces minute rock slam which is quite recognizable but suggestwhich is evaluateand invalidate can either of them introduce goallike read which is indistinguishable in size frequency and magnitude from true goal indistinguishable you can take wrong goal evaluate for the pc on it and make it go tick tick tick which after that if you did not if you did not check it if it wasnt checked out well would look like the pcs goal and thereafter would be as wrong as confederate sevendollar bill and thats how people get on to wrong goals so heres fast check that tells you whether the goal is the goal or not you read the goal to the pc bark bark bark you know and you say that reads now read of goal at sensitivity 16 is never more than about half division it can be cleaned up to point where it might register little bit more half of division but you are really priming you are really pouring the petrol and alcohol into the cylinders you know youre not adding to its power but it is so clean that itnothing can stay that clean and five minutes later itll slump but that is the most it reads and it always reads with fall it never reads with rise now if announced however against rising needle it will cause stick and against very fast rising needle will cause slow but in actual essence its action is fall tick and that tick iswell you just wont see one more thanmore than one and onequarter dial divisions here meaning about i dont know threeeighths of an inch thats big see and the one that you will normally see when you first see it is about sixteenth of an inch fall instant fall you say the goal and right on the last letter of the goal the last letter in the whole line itll go ticksixteenth of an inch that can be as small as thirtysecondth of an inch it can be as small as stick depending on how much invalidationevaluation is on it and if there is tremendous invalidation and evaluation on it it cannot read at all in other words the true goal can be squashed right out of existence and not read so false goal can be made to read with an invalidationevaluation and true goal can be made not to read oddly enough if you invalidate false goal enough it will cease to read again in its turn and real goal invalidated enough will ceasewill starstart reading in its turn once more on the false reads for which you can make it go through the cycle you can make bad one go through the cycle of read not read read not read read not read just with repetitive evaluations and invalidations dont you see and you canwhether the goal is right or wrong it will go through those cycles now theykeep that in mind that those are the only four things that have to be remedied to make sure that goal does read properly you can recognize the failed to reveal but youre going to use it in the check anyhow the suppress does not give tick but can make the evaluate or the invalidate squash out of sight so that you cant find them so you have to use suppress so you compose repetitive prepcheck which simply contains these four things and the name of the goal now ill go through this thing fairly rapidly for you just on demonstration you say to the pc all right imim going to give this goal fast check and i want to read tothe goal to you few times and then im going to carefully get in the four goals middle rudiments and then im going to see if the goal reads and then im going to give it fast check and then read the goal again and then well know for sure what that is what do you say to that and the pc says i dont want that and you go ahead and do it the pc very often says he doesnt want this you have to persuade him say wouldnt it be much better to have your mind completely at rest the goal is at rest you know the goal is to be active and the pc says under circumstances do i want my mind at rest you know so you say to the pc to catch catfish to catch catfish to catch catfish that read thank you very much we are now going into the repetitive rudimentssensitivity 16 you see of courseand you say on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suppressed thats run repetitive you see and same question same question same question the pc finally says and you say all right i will check that on the meter and you look at the meter and you do and you find another read and you look back at the pc and you give him the more repetitive and you finally get all the suppress suppress that you can possibly get off this goal and then you go tearing in and that suppress is good and clean thats polished up like dutch cleanser see thats bright so we move over then into our next one which of course is suggested and we run suggested on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suggested over and over and over until the pc says and lets check it on the meter and you find one you look back at the pc and you ask him again over and over and over until he finally says again you check it on the meter something like that anyway this thing is eventually clean similarly you handle the word invalidated has anything been invalidated and you handle that till that is clean and polished by the way it is very good policy at this time to be in state of operating meter where you miss reads ever and you miss cleans ever see thats optimum in fact its the only way this check will work so you go through that and then failed to reveal andsee how that would be worded is there anything you have failed to reveal is the best wording there on the goal to catch catfish is there anything you have failed to reveal all right lets get that all clean by repetitive and so forth all right thats that dont bother with careful of now lets go through this thing and we say all right im going to read the goal to you now to catch catfish to catch catfish to catch catfish and tell the pc whats happening see tell him well that reads it possibly will if its the real goal to catch catfish three times see bang thats it you say all right thats reading thank you now im going to have to do fast check of these same rudiments and check the goal and this is what condition youve got to get those first four repetitive questions in so that you get read pshaaaw right across them you see all right you do it just like this on the goal to catch catfish has anything been suppressed suggested invalidated or nonrevealed wrong wording to catch catfish to catch catfish to catch catfish see if its not the goal if theres read anywhere on that line thats it man but you get the trick here dont go puttering around picking geraniums dont give him any opportunity to invalidate or evaluate or breathe while you are saying that sentence just rip that thing right off brrrrrrrrrr see even omit the acknowledgment who cares ordinarily you would say thank you to catch catfish to catch catfish to catch catfish see bangbangbangbang thats the goal if none of those read if none of those midtype ruds read and the goal read the chances are thousand to one that thats the goal and if none of those read and you by repetitive check had found answers you know your meter is active on the pc and none of them read and the goal didnt read it isnt even cousin to the right goal and thats how you do fast check on goal and you tell the pc very muchthank you very much actually thats about athats really in actual practice thats about fifteen twenty twentyfive minute fast verification of goal and thats the way goal has to be verified if goal wont beformperform this way its not the goal now you understand that if youve got read on invalidated and ignore it and read the goal you are going to read the read for invalidated and it will be just exactly like the goal tick if theres an evaluate theres read on suggest or suggested see and theres read on the goal thats suggested reading on the goal and if the goal reads with dirty needle its simply aits missed withhold on the goal the goal iswithheld it from somebodyhas been withheld thats all now thats the way the pendulum swings and thats how you verify one of these things and this is how you tell if it is the goal and if it isnt the goal actually theres arguments about this i mean that is the way it is you see and you could do it that easily and that well but remember you have to read your meter perfectly you have to read your meter every time and when you read off that last sentence brrrrr you have to read that without lot of halts or gulps if you read it something on this fashion on the goal to catch catfish is ah thereanything ah that ah youno i mean ah that you have suggested why it then reads see you say nono nono i mean suppressed excuse see well dont be so confounded upset if youve done your tr 1 that poorly that to be surprised if you get reads on these things when you just cleaned them because the reads just happened the pc invalidated your reading of it or something like that thatll now read so now you have to go into it and you have to clean up those rudiments see now this is what happens if you read that across the line you got read on some you clean it up on fastcheck basis see and you clean it all up on fastcheck basis until youve got all of them and then you dont read the goal after this until youve got them all clean on fastcheck basis see then when youve got them all clean on fastcheck basis you read that goal to catch catfish to catch catfish to catch catfish thank you thats his goal you see what happens there now on the actual goal oddly enough the read will disappear off of the goal and appear over on the invalidate and the suggest and when you take them off the evainvalidate and suggest it will reappear on the goal and when youve got this thing over hereyouve got wrong goal reading with read youll find invalidate reads or suggest reads and you take the reads off invalidate and suggest clean that all up see what happened to the goal where did he go charley which way did they go where where thats dead easy to get wrong goal dont be upset about that you come tearing down the last summation sheet and youve just gone across to bully potatoes and the pc says what the hell was that you know you go tearing down the line and then you come back to it after youve nulled everything else and you say well ive got two left in to bully potatoes and to soar gracefully and to bully potatoes to bully potatoes to bully potatoes that reads every time to soar gracefully to soar gracefully doesnt read that doesnt read now well i guess we got it hahaha guess we got it reads every time to bully potatoes brother its going to take an artist to pull that thing apart see boy thats in there because hidden is the invalidation of the pc and whats apparent you see is the evaluation of the auditor and those two things will lock against each other and you try to clean this up first youll get invalidate read and then youll get evaluate read and it may be lost clear back there during the assessment sometime and pretty occluded and suppressed the pc said well i really want goal at this time and he said so and hes good auditor and who am i to argue you see and suppressed it and then casual inspection of this doesntdoesnt locate it then you find yourself listing wrong goal and then the tone arm rises and goes up to 45 or 50 and the needle gets very sticky pc starts looking terribly bad gets very arc breaky in the sessions and the somatics are all wrong and backwards and obviously your lines are right and your metering seems to be okay what is it cant be wrong goal because we get read every time we say has it been suggested must be the right goal you see i keep asking him has it beenwould you suggest this as goal you know and i get read every time you know and i keep telling him its his goal and he justhe finally has accepted it and it does it reads every time now the funny part of it is that heavily invalidated goal will read better than real one because it doesnt blur out it doesnt have nasty tricks it doesnt fade and dull things like that it just keeps on going bangbangbang every time thirtysecond of an inch never varies nothing does anything to it except the second you pull the invalidationno goal all right theres one more thing i could say about it is that ä goal routinely and normally fades out when the rudiments go out and comes back in when you get the rudiments in now when during listing goal starts to disappear is very hard to say but it probably isnt until the last threequarters that its totally gone and then the read is still detectable at the end of the lines but an awful lot of listing has to be done before that goal goes so that you cant check it anymore and it never starts reading early and latent and other screwball things if the goal starts to read screwball it isnt the goal the real goal when the rudimentsthe four i just gave youare cleaner than wolfs tooth fires every time fires every time except at very fast rise because the impulse of the fire you see merely gives it tiny slow and you might not see that tiny slow if youve got fast rising needle you wont see this every time but every time the needle can be influenced by the goal and not fast rise youll get that snap snap snap its just marvelous to watch one of the things fire if you want to know what goal looks like and if you want to get very very critical and investigate it very thoroughly get ahold of somebody and pick up the goals list take goal at random and say which one do you favor on this sheet and the fellow looks at it and finally says well actually to kiss blonds you know well that isnt actually your type of goal i know by experience actually here is goal here to whistle at men now thats reallyi think thats better goal lets put you on the meter here for moment to whistle at men to whistle at men toit reads every timeto whistle at menreads reads reads every time you knowto whistle at men then you can sit back and just by the hour say to whistle at men to whistle at men to whistle at men you will get exactly what goal looks like and until you suddenly turn around to the pc and say has anything been suggested on this goal and hell say yes damn it so and so and so and so anything been invalidated yes i said to myself every time it cant be you see and yap yap yap yap yap yap yap you get it all cleaned up and so forth and you say to whistle at men whistle at men whistle at men theres nothing you can make any goal read if you want to know what goal looks like reading every time just invalidate the hell out of somebodys offbeat goal and youll see goal read interesting isnt it all right well thats 3ga you want to continue your list until the ticks youre getting are about the sizeand if you do continue list that long hit it at sensitivity 16 for the whole list if you can get list that long first crack out of the box or if youve been adding to list thats been well nulled and that sort of thing do all the rest of it at sensitivity 16 because you wont get any other reads if the list is that limp and id say list done as ive been telling you and so forth listed completely should be thoroughly completely and all of it done at sensitivity 16 now i know of other immediate changes okay thank you good night
