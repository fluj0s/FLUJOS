three decades ago title ix of the education amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs or activities1 although title ix bars recipients of federal financial assistance from discriminating on the basis of sex in wide range of educational programs or activities both the statute and the implementing regulations have long permitted school districts to operate singlesex schools in 2006 however the department of education ed issued title ix regulations that for the first time authorized schools to operate individual classes on singlesex basis 2 the issuance of these regulations has raised number of legal questions regarding whether singlesex classrooms pose constitutional problems under the equal protection clause or conflict with statutory requirements under title ix or under the equal educational opportunity act eeoa3 g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 under title ix person shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance 4 although the statute prohibits broad range of discriminatory actions such as bias in college sports and sexual harassment in schools title ix does contain several exceptions one of these exceptions provides that with respect to admissions title ix applies only to institutions of vocational education professional education and graduate higher education and to public in stitutions of undergraduate higher education unless the latter has traditionally admitted students of only one sex 5 as result title ix does not apply to admissions to nonvocational elementary or secondary schools nor does it apply to certain institutions of undergraduate higher education this means that title ix permits public or private singlesex elementary and secondary schools as well as some singlesex colleges this exception for singlesex schools has existed since the legislation was enacted and the legislative history indicates that congress excepted elementary and secondary schools from title ix because of the potential benefits of singlesex education6 less clear is whether congress intended to permit coeducational schools to establish individual classes on singlesex basis as eds regulations now allow

private elementary and secondary schools but not to vocational schools specifically the regulations permit recipients to offer singlesex classes and extracurricular activities if 1 the purpose of the class or extracurricular activity is achievement of an important governmental or educational objective and 2 the singlesex nature of the class or extracurricular activity is substantially related to achievement of that objective8 in its regulations ed identified two objectives that would meet the first requirement 1 to provide diversity of educational options to parents and students and 2 to meet the particular identified educational needs of students according to the regulations any schools that choose to provide singlesex classes must meet certain requirements designed to ensure nondiscrimination for example participation in single sex classes must be completely voluntary recipients must treat male and female students in an evenhanded manner and recipients justification must be genuine these latter requirements mean than schools use of overly broad sexbased generalizations in connection with offering singlesex education would be sex discrimination thus recipients are prohibited from providing singlesex classes on the basis of generalizations about the different talents capacities or preferences of either sex in addition although schools must always provide substantially equal coeducational class in the same subject they are not always required to provide singlesex classes for the excluded sex unless such classes would be required to ensure nondiscriminatory implementation if recipients can show that students of the excluded sex are not interested in enrolling in singlesex class or do not have educational needs that can be addressed by such class then they are not required to offer corresponding singlesex class to the excluded sex although schools must offer classes that are substantially equal these classes do not have to be identical in comparing classes under the substantially equal requirement ed will co nsider range of factors including but not limited to admissions policies the educational benefits provided including the quality range and content of curriculum and other services and the quality and availability of books instructional materials and technology the qualifications of faculty and staff the quality accessibility and availability of facilities and resources geographic accessibility and intangible features such as the reputation of the faculty in order to ensure compliance with the regulations recipients are required to periodically conduct selfevaluations and students or their parents who believe the regulations have been violated may file complaint with the school or with ed ed also has the authority to conduct periodic compliance reviews according to the national association for single sex public education there are currently at least 514 public schools in the united states that offer singlesex education in the form of singlesex schools or classrooms 9 g21g157g138g157g158g157g152g155g162g561g11g150g153g149g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 as noted above the enactment of the new regulations raises questions regarding whether ed has the statutory authority under title ix to authorize singlesex classrooms and whether the regulations comply with the statutory

g345g561g22g146g157g149g142g561g11g26g561 although title ix explicitly authorizes singlesex schools the statute is silent with respect to the question of singlesex classrooms within schools that are otherwise coeducational as result it is possible that the regulations could face legal challenge on the grounds that ed exceeded its statutory authority any court ruling as to the validity of eds regulations would hinge on the level of deference paid to the agency decision by the reviewing court the standard for judicial review of such agency action was delineated in chevron usa inc v natural resources defense council 10 there the supreme court established that judicial review of an agencys interpretation of statute consists of two related questions first the court must determine whether congress has spoken directly to the precise issue at hand if the intent of congress is clear the inquiry is concluded since the unambiguously expressed intent of congress must be respected11 however if the court determines that the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue at hand the court must determine whether the agencys answer is based on permissible construction of the statute12 it is important to note that the second prong does not require court to conclude that the agency construction was the only one it permissibly coul d have adopted to uphold the construction or even the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in judicial proceeding13 the practical effect of this maxim is that reasonable agency interpretation of an ambiguous statute must be accorded deference even if the court believes the agency is incorrect14 ultimately given title ixs silence with respect to singlesex classrooms its possible but not certain that court could dete rmine that the statutory language was ambiguous enough to support eds interpretation of the statute g7g154g158g138g149g561g7g141g158g140g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g17g153g153g152g155g157g158g151g146g157g162g561g3g140g157g561 although the eeoa contains congressional finding that the maintenance of dual school systems in which students are assigned to schools solely on the basis of race color sex or national origin denies to those students the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment 15 the statutes prohibition against the deliberate segregation of students applies only to segregation on the basis of race color or national origin but not sex16 therefore eds regulations regarding singlesex classrooms do not appear to conflict with the eeoa over the years several courts have considered the question of whether singlesex education violates the eeoa although these cases which are few in number have contemplated singlesex schools rather than singlesex classes they are instructive for example in vorchheimer v school district of philadelphia 17 the court of appeals for the third circuit considered challenge filed 10 467 us 837 1984 11 id at 84243 12 id at 843 13 id at 843 n 11 14 id at 845 15 20 usc 1702 16 id at 1703a 17 532 f2d 880 3d cir 1976 affd by

student who was denied admission to an allmale public high school in philadelphia because the statute did not explicitly prohibit the segregation of schools by sex and because the corresponding allfemale high school was found to provide equal educational opportunities for girls the court rejected the eeoa challenge in united states v hinds county school board 18 however the fifth circuit held that the eeoa prohibited mississippi school district from splitting the four schools in the district into two allmale schools and twoall female schools the court distinguished the case from the vorchheimer decision noting that vorchheimer involved two voluntary singlesex schools in an otherwise coeducational school system while the mississippi school district in question involved the mandatory sex segregation of all of the schools and therefore all of the students in the system read together these cases indicate that the eeoa may permit singlesex schools as long as coeducational options are available such an interpretation would mean that the new title ix regulatory requirements are consistent with the eeoa

schools that offer singlesex classes under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment19 which prohibits the government from denying to any individual the equal protection of the law governmental classifications that are based on sex receive heightened scrutiny from the courts laws that rely on sexbased classifications will survive such scrutiny only if they are substantially related to achieving an important government objective20 currently there are only two supreme court cases that address the equal protection implications of sexsegregated schools although both of these cases occurred in higher education setting they provide some guidance that may be applicable to the elementary and secondary education context in the earlier case mississippi university for women v hogan 21 the court held that the exclusion of an individual from publicly funded school because of his or her sex violates the equal protection clause unless the government can show that the sexbased classification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives because the court found that the state had not met this burden it struck down mississippis policy of excluding men from its statesupported nursing school for women the courts most recent constitutional pronouncem ent with respect to sex discrimination in education occurred in united states v virginia 22 in that case the court held that the exclusion of women from the virginia military institute vmi public institution of higher education designed to prepare men for military and civilian leadership was unconstitutional despite the fact that the state had created parallel school for women although the court reiterated that sex based classifications must be substantially related to an important government interest the court also appeared to conduct more searching form of inquiry by requiring the state to establish an 18 560

persuasive justification for its actions23 according to the court this justification must be genuine and must not rely on overbroad generalizations about the talents capacities or preferences of men and women in applying this standard the court rejected the two arguments that virginia advanced in support of vmis exclusion of women namely that the singlesex education offered by vmi contributed to diversity of educational approaches in virginia and that vmi employed unique method of training that would be destroyed if women were admitted in rejecting vmis first argument the court concluded that vmi had not been established or maintained to promote educational diversity in fact vmis historic and constant plan was to offer unique educational benefit to only men24 rather than to complement other virginia institutions by providing singlesex educational option with respect to virginias second argument the court expressed concern over the exclusion of women from vmi because of generalizations about their ability while the court believed that vmis method of instruction did promote important goals it concluded that the exclusion of women was not substantially related to achieving those goals after determining that vmis exclusion of women violated constitutional equal protection requirements the court reviewed the states remedy separate school for women known as the virginia womens institute for leadership vwil unlike vmi vwil did not use an adversarial method of instruction because it was believed to be inappropriate for most women 25 and vwil lacked the faculty facilities and course offerings available at vmi because vwil was not comparable singlesex institution for women the court concluded that it was an inadequate remedy for the states equal protection violations and vmi subsequently became coeducational in light of the vmi case it appears that schools that establish singlesex classrooms under eds title ix regulations may face some legal hurdles but are not necessarily constitutionally barred from establishing such classes consistent with the courts ruling the title ix regulations require schools that wish to establish singlesex classes to demonstrate that such classes serve an important governmental objective and are substantially related to achievement of that objective what is unclear is whether the objectives approved by the title ix regulationsto provide diversity of educational options to parents and students and to meet the particular identified educational needs of studentswould be sufficiently important to pass judicial review although the virginia court rejected vmis diversity rationale it did so because it found that vmis justification was not genuine as result the court has not ruled on whether diversity is an important governmental objective in cases involving sexbased classifications although the court which stated in the vmi case that it does not question the states prerogative evenhandedly to support diverse educational opportunities may be inclined to uphold the diversity rationale with regard to the new title ix regulations 26 moreover the virginia court ruled that the parallel school virginia established for womenvwilwas not sufficient remedy for the exclusion of women from vmi because it lacked the faculty facilities and course 23 id at 533 24 id at 540 25 id at 549 26 id at 534 n 7 see also id at 535 singlesex education affords pedagogical benefits to at least some students and it is not disputed that diversity among public educational institutions can serve the public good notably the court has also upheld racial diversity as an important goal in recent education case grutter v bollinger 539 us 306 us 2003 however the court has never decided whether the particular identified educational needs objective is an important governmental goal for purposes of justifying sexbased classifications httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22544g22g146g157g149g142g561g11g26g561g138g151g141g561g21g146

schools that offer single sex classes to provide substantially equal classes to the excluded sex while its not clear whether the court would view the substantially equal requirement as sufficient to pass constitutional muster judicial resolution in given case would most likely depend on the specific facts surrounding schools singlesex class offerings indeed organizations such as the american civil liberties union aclu regularly file lawsuits against schools that provide singlesex education27 for example the aclu has filed lawsuit alleging that singlesex classrooms in breckenridge county
