succession and leadership issues in china implications for us policy summary in 2002 and 20 03 the pe oples republic of china prc will be making key leadership changes within the government and the communist party number of current senior leaders including party secretary jiang zemin premier zhu rongji and national peoples congress chairman li peng are scheduled to be stepping down from their posts and it is not yet clear who will be assuming these positions from among the younger generation of lead ers the socalled fourth generation comprised of those born in the 1940s and early 1950s it is expected that new leaders will be ascending to positions at the head of at least two and possibly all three of the prcs three vertical political structures the chinese communist party the state government bureaucracy and the pe oples liberation army pla during period likely to last into 2003 the succession process remains very much in flux some who follow beijing politics have raised questions about how vigorously chinas current senior leaders will adhere to their selfimposed term limitations party secretary jiang zemin for instance is expected to try to keep his position as head of chinas military on the grounds that the global antiterrorism campaign and internal challenges to chinese rule create special need now for consistent leadership some reports even have hinted that jiang and others may be interested in keeping their party and gove rnment posts as well even should this occur members of the prcs next genera tion are likely to be moving into other positions of power and ruling the country for the rest of the decade and beyond more so than before chinas potential leaders differ from predecessor generations while they are better educated all are university graduates they also have more diverse backgrounds and experiences than previous leaders and lack the kind of unifying formative experience that maos long march contemporaries had having come of age in the political and so cial chaos of the cultural revolution they may be more cynical about politics more di sillusioned with the experiences of their own party and thus less committed to or respectful of past ideologies some suggest this may make them more willing to expe riment with new or untried methods on the other hand this generation is largely product of maos isola tionist years its members were not educated abroad as we re many members of maos generation and as result they may be more parochial and nationalistic in their views than previous leaders current speculation is focusing on co llection of fourthgeneration front runners sometimes referred to in the chines press as crosscentury successors for key positions those potentially moving up in clude hu jintao now vicepresident wen jiabao wu bangguo li changchun zeng qinghong and luo gan as all of these men are associated with specific current leaders the ultimate outcome of the succession process may also provide clue s as to

leaders the third generation political succession and leadership issues in china implications for us policy introduction at the 16th party congress beginning novemb er 8 2002 and at the subsequent meeting of the national peoples congre ss in march 2003 the peoples republic of china prc will be making key leadership changes within both the government and the communist party number of the prc s current senior leaders including party secretary jiang zemin and premier zhu rong ji are scheduled to be stepping down from important posts and it is not yet clear who will be assuming these positions from among the younger generation of lead ers the socalled fourth generation comprised of those born in the 1940s and early 1950s whoever the successors will be members of the prcs four th generation are likely to be ruling the country for the rest of the decade and beyond this pape r provides an overview of the prcs current government and party leadersh ip structure discusses nd assesses pendi ng leadership changes the succession process itself and the implications for us policy and provides information about key four th generation successor candidates1 overview and background the political structure of the prc is comprised of three separate vertically integrated systems the chinese communist party ccp the state government apparatus which is headed by the st ate council and the pe oples liberation army pla whose highest decision making body is the central military commission in terms of formal position chinas current foremost leader jiang zemin sits at the top of all three pillars as party secretary he heads the chinese communist party and presides over the party politburo as presiden t of the country he is the titular head of the state government and as chairman of the central military commission he is formally the head of the pla practically speaking the state government apparatus is run by premier zhu rongji and the central military commission is comprised of senior pla leaders who also exercise influence and power within the military along with jiang until the 1980s there was such redundancy among these systems structures functions and personnel that they often were indistingu ishable party and state structures closely parallele d one another with party groups the highest decisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30990crs2 2 party congresses in the prc are held approximately every 5 years at these crucial meetings the communist party makes the party and government leadership choices and sets the countrys policy direction for the next five years the 16th party congress is expected to be held late in 2002 3 how an issue becomes sensitive in china is not clearly understood it may be an issue of vital importance to the chinese leadership such as the taiwan issue or anything involving major country or trading partner such as russia or anything involving us china relations it may also be an issue that the leadership perceives as having an impact on either the partys legitimacy or on an indivi dual leader or group of leaders such as the falun gong spiritual movementmaking entities at every state level senior government ministers and pla leaders exercised little effective independence from party control this situation began to change in the 1980s under the reform coalition led by deng xiaoping in an attempt to inject more pragmatism practical experience and efficiency into decision making processes reformers in the 13th party congress2 in 1987 instituted political reforms aimed at parating party and st ate structures and removing the party from most administrative duties while allowing the party to retain its supremacy in defining broad policy goals and making final decisions on sensitive issues3 as result of these and other reforms government ministries now are more likely to be independent opera tors and cabinetlevel minister today functions more like chief executive officer over his or her agency still answerable ultimately to board of direct ors the party politburo but otherwise with wider latitude in decision making than be fore the dominance of economic factors and proliferation of research groups and other actors in the po litical system have further decentralized decision making and administrative processes despite these changes some determining factors have remained the same personalities are still of vital importance with position or title likely to derive from personal connections rather than the reverse this means that formal institutions of power are still less important than informal power arrangements in prc decision making there is still leadership co re surrounding paramount leader from 1978 until shortly before his death in 1997 the paramount leader was deng xiaoping today it is party secretary jian g zemin although he is regarded by most observers as wielding less power over stat and party apparatuses than did deng the party is still preeminent or as the 1982 party constitution puts it the communist party of china is the vanguard of the chinese working class the faithful representative of the interests of the people of all nationalities in china and the force at the core leading chinas cause of socialism factional politics are still potent force in behindthescenes maneuvering nd finally despite the official formalized power structure much about chinas deci sion making processe s remains mystery to outsiders chinese communist party leadership the politburo and the politburo standing committee at the top of the chinese communist partys political structure is the 21member party politburo considered the most important formal political institution in china althoughhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30990crs3 officially the politburo in beijing is the chief political decision making body its relatively unwieldy size its inclusion of members who live in cities other than beijing and its lack of known formalized meeting schedule all suggest that the full politburo is only marginally involved in routine policy decisions full involvement of the politburo is more likely when the stakes are high as when considering major policy shifts dealing with crises or when formal legitimization of particular policy direction is necessary it is the seven members of the politburo standing committee who are considered to wield real decisionmaking power of the seven members currently on the politburo standing committee only li peng was on the standing committee at the time of the tiananme n square crackdown of june 4 1989 in the past given the personalitybased nature of politics in china even politburo membership or the lack of it was not necessarily the basis of leaders political legitimacy key example is ng xiaoping who remained the paramount leader even after he had resigned all his official positions in 1987 deng played his key role in supporting the 1989 tiananme n square crackdown despite being member of neither the politburo standi ng committee nor indeed of the politburo itself nevertheless politics in china have changed since the early days of the dengist reforms begun in 1978 and even since the tiananmen square crackdown of 1989 there is for instance one comparab to deng in the current prc political scene that is paramount leader without portfolio and most senior leaders of significant power hold politburo membershi p despite its continued position at the apex of chinese political life the po litburo and its standi ng committee are not thought to be able to dictate policy decisions as much as they once did instead the chinese political process has become infused with much greater number of bureaucratic and noncentral govern ment actors than ever before these include more muscular state sector including government ministries that are significantly more responsible for policy imp lementation than they have been in the past provincial and local officials that have more autonomy than before an increasing body of official and quasiofficial policy res earch groups and think tanks that feed proposals directly into the polic process collecti on of state sector multinational and even private business interests that bring more pressure to bear on policy decisions newly vigorous academic and university community and more robust and more diverse media that info rms public opinion in addition chinas approximately 3000member na tional peoples congress npc largely symbolic organization for much of its existence s begun to eschew its rubberstamp identity and become somewhat more assertive in recent years the secretariat another important vehicle fo r the chinese communist party is the secretariat officially listed as imme diately under the politburo the role of the secretariat has been inconsistent in communist chinese history originally the supreme decisionmaking body in the 1940s the secretariat today is intended to be subordinate to the politburo under ch inas 1982 constitution the secretariat is described as an administrative rather th an decisionmaking body and this is s till considered to be its functi on its role is to oversee the implementation of decisions made by the politburo httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30990crs4 4 in conference paper presented in 1998 one scholar cited the 1982 example of thenparty secretary hu yaobangs pronouncement at the 12th party congress that china would pursue an independent foreign policy and make decisions based on the merits of various international issues it was up to the ministry of foreign affairs to interpret that general pronouncement and turn it into an effective sustainable policy paper by lu ning the business times singapore entitled supraministry coordinating bodies state council ministries and party departme nts

streamlining was also discussed at the eting some observers inferred that vice president hu jintaos attendance at the meetin g is further sign of his imminent succession to president jiang zemin cheung ray bureaucracy sheds 15 million jobs in south china morning post june 21 2002 the chinese government the second tier of the chinese political structure coming under the purview of the state council is the entir chinese state or governmental apparatus if one takes narrow definition of the state council one would be speaking of only those individuals within the state council itself this would include the premier vice premiers state councillors s ecretary and deputy secretar ies general and several directors but broader definition encompassing the entire government apparatus would include not only the state council itself but all of chinas gove rnment ministries such as the ministry of communications ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation moftec ministry of foreign ffairs and ministry of public health in addition the state council includes ma ny special agencies and commissions including bureaus such as the general administration of customs the national tourism administration the state education commission the hong kong and macao affairs office and the china welfare fund for the handicapped and number of research institutes and thinktanks such as the china institute of contemporary international relations and the chinese academy of social sciences despite its effective subordination to the party the government apparatus wields decisive tactical influence over policy by virtue of its role in interpreting implementing and overseeing what centr leaders often broadly and somewhat ambiguously define as chinese policy goals4 since he is both president of the chinese state as well as party secretary jiang zemin is the formal head of the chinese state apparatus in addition to heading the chinese communist party in practice however it is premier zhu rongji who presides over and actively directs the st ate council bureaucracies in march 1998 chinas central leaders announced their inte nt to shrink the government bureaucracy with one of their goals being to reduce th 40 ministries of the state council as result of this 4 Â½ years of restructur ing and reorganizati on premier zhu announced in june 2002 the government has cut its bur eaucracy by nearly 50 and reduced the number of central government nd provincial employees by 15 million5 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30990crs5 6 deng xiaoping who did have military experience and who was formerly head of the ccp cmc relinquished its chairmanship to jiang zemin in 1989 after jiangs selection as party secretary following the tiananmen square crackdow n it is thought that deng took this step to help bolster jiangs power base both within the party and particularly within the military 7 for instance one chineselanguage article on military leadership issues in china in referring to ccp cmc vicechairman zhang wannian said he would mainly be in charge of the work within the army and as memb er of the secretariat of the ccp central committee will communicate the armys internal affairs to the center and receive relevant instructions from the latter see kuan ch achia beijing holds enlarged meeting of central military commission foreign broadcast information service fbis december 22 1997 fbis online the military ccp central military commission the third vertical system in chinese governance is the peoples liberation army pla whose highest decision making body is the elevenmember chinese communist party central military commission ccp cmc with status comparable to the politburo standing committee and the state council it is believed to meet regularly to address routine administrative matters and to formulate policies the ccp cmc is chaired by jiang zemin position as the head of the pla which is almost mandatory for the communist party secretary but which jiang may fulfill uneasily compared to ng since he has military background6 jiang is thus placed in the most senior position at the top of all three vertical systems in china the ccp cmc is in supreme command of military and defense affairs including the formulation of military strategy symbolizing the communist partys control of the military it is significant that the highest military policymaking body has party identity although the ccp cmc appears to have governmental counterpart in the parallel state ce ntral military commission scmc theoretically separate d ecision making body within the governmental bureaucracy in practice the scmc is relatively meaningless entity since its eleven members are the same eleven members comprising the ccp cmc likewise the ministry of defense the principal state bureaucracy for dealing with foreign militaries is considered weaker body that is subordi nate to the ccp cmc apart from the policy formulation and decision making ro of the ccp cmc itself key members of that body appear also to serve br idging function between central communist party leaders and the state and military pillars7 power relationships among party state and military while systems of power in china appear distinct and separate many in chinas central leadership wear multiple hats holding positions concurrently in all three vertical systems thus as suggested by the table below the influence that the military has within party or state decision making bodies may be base d less on institutional relationships than on having senior milita ry leader sitting on the appropriate body and viceversa this adds to the diffi culty of knowing more about the process of chinese decision making in addition even supreme decision making bodies at the highest level are hierarchical on an informal level their members are not necessarilyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30990crs6 8 cheng li professor of government hamilton college chinas political succession four

wellknown to the respective parties involved although it is not always apparent to outside observers the succession process and curre nt leadership dynamics although it is broad american perception that little or political liberalization has taken place in the prc since 1978 prc leaders have continued to make incremental reforms in the countrys party and government systems these reforms have contributed to the building of political institutions and mechanisms that differ notably from those associated with the days of chairman mao among other changes the prc leadership has implemented the following term limits for toplevel positions in the party and government unofficial retirement age requireme nts for party cadres at senior levels of leadership regular rotation of provincial and military leaders equal representation and voting status for each province on the ccpcentral committee multiplecandidate choices for some party and governmental seats 8 while these and other political reforms have brought more rationality to the political process they have their limitations they have not for instance led to the establishment of opposition political partie s opened political nd policy processes to broader public debate or provided predictable nd regularized methods for selecting the next top leaders despite the above reforms then the process of political succession in the prc is still characterized by uncertainty decisions on succession will be made through combination of internal campaigning behindthe scenes manipulation negotiation and co mpromise among approximately 30 top senior leaders these mach inations undoubtedly have been ongoing for much of the period since 2000 and they are likely to continue and intensify as the preparatory work continues for the 16th

of variables are likely to c ontinue influencing political succession arrangements and awareness of their importance will provide degree of insight into the decision making process greater constraints on decisionmaking in the past the chinese communist party was dominated by an allpowerful single leader such as mao or deng with sufficient clout and leverage to work his will on the political process with little or constraint but with the passi ng of mao and the other founders of the chinese communist party the decentraliz ation of decisionma king processes under deng xiaoping and the greater diversity and complexity that economic reforms and other changes have brought to the chinese social and political fabric single leader in china now holds such predominant pos ition chinese leadership in the third generation has been more nearly collective process requiring compromise trade offs and consultation while political mach ination and factiona l politics still play important roles the diffusion of power that has occurred at the highest levels over the past decade places increasing constraints on senior leaders and has corres ponding policy implications for succession arrangements generational differences current speculation is focusing on collection of fourthgeneration frontr unners sometimes referred to in the prc press as cross century successors for key positions more so than in the past chinas new generation of leaders differs from predecessor generations while they are better educated all are university graduates they also have had more diverse backgrounds and experiences than previous leaders and they lack the kind of unifying political formative experience that maos long march contemporaries had10 having come of age in the political and social chaos of the cultural revolution they may be more cynical about politics more disillusioned with the historical experiences of socialism and thus less committed to or respectful of past ideologies they are largely products of maos isolationist years and for the mo st part none was educated abroad as were many members of maos gene ration thus members of the fourth generation may be more parochial and nationalistic in their views than previous leaders factional politics always critical part of chinese political life in the past factional politics still plays an important role in succession

age limit for continuance in power periodically he has reaffirmed publicly his commitment to step down after just one term 13 constitution of the peoples republic of china 1992 article 79 specifies term limits for the state president and vicepresident article 66 specifies similar limits for the chairman of the national peoples congress power in the prc of the twentyfirst cen tury however some observers stress that single faction now can dominate the political process as was the case in the past corruption rampant official corruption within party state and military apparatuses also has implications for l eadership succession arrangements prc leaders are under increasing public pressure to crack down on corruption and senior officials who are publicly linked to graft bribery or other corruption scandals are unlikely to advance and may be subject to discipline11 moreover official corruption at lower leadership levels may inflict collateral damage on leaders at more senior levels this is thought to be true in the case of senior leader li peng one of whose protÃ©gÃ©es cheng kejie former vice chairman of the national peoples congress was executed for corrupt practices in 2000 moreover uncoveri ng and publicizing corruption may even serve as tactical tool among factions contending for leadership positions leaders who may st ep down in 20022003 party secretary jiang zemin vicepre mier li peng and premier zhu rongji the top three in the prc leadership are all slated to step down in 2002 and 2003 respectively from their current positions their departure would be in keeping with relatively recent internal term limitations th prc leadership has set out for itself an agreement apparently made at the 15th party congress in 1997 that leaders should step down after reaching age 70 policy pus hed at the time by jiang zemin and an internal dictum reputed to have been put forward by deng xiaoping in the early 1980s that senior leader should serve more than two terms in his position12 in addition the prcs constitution specifies th at senior state fficials as opposed to party officials shall serve more than two consecutive terms13 not only are chinas three senior leaders slated to step down from their present offices they are also thought to be relinquishing their positions on the sevenmember politburo standing committee and on the politburo itself

of 2002 however suggested that leadership negotiations not only were continuing but were becoming increasingly difficult many western observers speculated that ji ang was maneuvering to stay on as head of the central military commission and was attempting to secure the s upport of senior military officials for this15 others believed that jiang was even trying to serve one more term as party secretary althoug h his aspirations to do so do not appear to be supported by other politbur standing committee members16 some have suggested that senior leaders may try to resolve their succession differences by agreeing to switch jobs in political game of musical chairs17 they say that senior leaders may for instance argue that china has special need now for consistent leadership given the present difficulties in uschina relations and perceived domestic challenges such as th falun gong relations with taiwan and wto accession there has also been sp eculation that senior leaders may be exploring the notion of trying to temporar ily extend their current terms for one year or possibly more18 jiang zemin currently holding the senior positions in chinas three political tiers as party

china morning post five of the seven politburo standing committee members expressed reservations about promoting zeng chinese language report of december 6 2000 in the hong kong economic journal speculated that the failure to promote zeng meant that jiang was losing meas ure of control over the politburoof the shanghai communist party municipal committee his lowkey handling of similar democracy demonstrations at the time in shanghai was widely praised at the time and catapulted him to senior national leadership positions he was elected general party secretary in june 1989 and elected chairman of the cmc in november 1989 his connections with shan ghai and his patrona ge of others with that connection has led to his being dubbed the leader of the shanghai faction by modern chinese standards jiang has served long time in his leadership roles the jury is out as to his future after the 16th party congress some reports suggest that he may be trying to retain at least one of his positions as cmc chairman is most often suggested while others claim he will be stepping down from all of his positions including the politburo standing committee19 according to one school of thought jiang would lik to emulate deng xiaoping and remain predominantly influential as retired elder senior statesman this would be facilitated if jiang could be assured that several of his protegees would be elevated to senior levels and in fact number of the fourth genera tion frontrunners have strong jiang connections but speculation about jiangs continuing influence illustrates the difficulties in predicting the future course of prc l eadership decisions he has had trouble promoting his most trusted advisor and protegee zeng qinghong to the politburo standing committee necessary step if zeng is to advance in the leadership some news reports late in 2000 sp eculated that this represen ted serious political setback to jiang and challenge to his party control20 more recently zengs name has been put forward on some lists of potential new politburo members but not consistently suggesting that jiang still has not solved whatever problem he has with other standing committee members in another uncertainty some have suggested that jiang has staked his personal prestige on successfully stamping out the falun gong spiritual movement policy that some f eel is not widely supported by other senior leaders and that failure to do so ma adversely affect him in some way another factor in jiangs political maneuvering may be his desire to ensure his historical legacy by having the party fo rmally adopt in its charter his own political theories putting him in the same league as his predecessors mao zedong and deng xiaoping jiangs political contribution dubbe d the three represents is that the chinese communist party represents not onl the fundamental in terests of all the people but also advanced culture and advanced productive forces in other words capitalists

chinas fourth generation is product of maos insular isol ationist years they have also matured politically at time dur ing the 1990s of continued sinous difficulties over taiwan trade human rights and other contentious issues thus washington policymakers may have to deal with beijing government that is morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30990crs16 nationalistic in its views of how to solve chinas problems new prc leaders may be less likely to look to the west for political or economic models and so less interested in seeking out or valuing us contact and cooperation than their predecessors in beijing yet they may be politically disillusioned as well with their own tumultuous experiences with socialism as result they may be more willing to experiment with untried ideologies or methods making it more difficult for american policymakers to predict the future course of chinese policy over the near term communication and understanding ma become more problematic between american policymakers who stress values and moral issues and chinas fourth generation culture of nonideological technocrats and problemsolvers in combination these potential circumstances may make uschina relations even more problematic convincing elements on both sides that the united states and china share few common interests and th at the other is not to be trusted on the other hand ideologues in the am erican political process appear to have been temporarily marginalized by the more pragmatic us political demands of the global antiterrorism campaign geopolitical realists in the bush administration therefore may find some communion with th pragmatic problemsolvers that make up much of chinas fourth generation lead ership contenders when combined with the events of september 11 and with new american policy priorities chinas impending transition to new generation of leaders could strengthen the hand of those in the american policy process who have argued that the engagement policy of the past ten years is productive and appropriate approach toward the prc in such an environment it would seem difficult for the bush administration any time soon to resurrect the strategic competitor approach toward china that it articulated when it first assumed office washington may see chinas leadership transition period as an opportunity to move the relationship forward into more positive territory in addition us officials may be persuaded to maintain low profile partly to minimize chances that the united states itself could become factor in chinas political successi on since it is widely thought that prc official who hopes to benefit in the succession process can be seen as being soft in dealing with washington during difficult times
