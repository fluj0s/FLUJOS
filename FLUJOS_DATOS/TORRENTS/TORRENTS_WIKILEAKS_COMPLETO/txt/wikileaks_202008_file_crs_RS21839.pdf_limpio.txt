political unrest insecurity high illiteracy and eroding natural resources among other problem s these factors contribute to low levels of business investment impedin g development and leading to economic decline in an effort to improve haitis ec onomic conditions congress s been considering and in late 2006 passed legisla tion that loosens existing restrictions on the origins of the components of apparel sewn to gether in haiti and exported to the united states and b effectively allows most of those exports to enter duty free such changes could have large potential benefit for itian manufacturing but poor c onditions in the country and some of the effects of the wto january 2005 textile quota phase out may well preclude any significant nearterm benefit this re port will be updated when warranted by events haiti is very poor country and it is ge tting poorer its per capita gross domestic product is 195th in the central intelligence agency s cia ranking of 233 countries1 and haitian manufacturing value adde d per capita in 2003 was less than 3 of the average for all latin american and caribbean countries2 the countrys per capita gross domestic product in constant do llars has fallen for at least two decades3 little or change in these conditions is expected in the near future4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21839crs2 for the sake of clarity it should be noted that this report defines the term textile industry as including apparel manufacture assembly common although not universal usage moreover such definition is essentia l in the present context inasmuch as apparel making constitutes nearly all textile manufacturing in haiti thus in most cases the word textiles in this report includes apparel articles proposed and enacted economic assistance bills were introduced in the 108th and 109th congresses that would loosen existing restrictions on the origins of the component s of apparel sewn to gether in haiti and exported to the united states and b allow some of those exports to enter the united states duty free 108th congress s 489 and hr 1031 would ve amended the caribbean basin economic recovery act cbera to allow specified apparel articles made of cloth to be imported from haiti subject to quantitative limitations into the united states duty free if haiti satisfied the economic and democratic reforms required by the bills which are noted below the substantive provisions of s 2261 and hr 4889 were the same as those in s 489 and hr 1031 except for key qualitative differenc that is the covered apparel included articles wholly assembled or knittoshape in haiti from any combination of fabrics fa bric components component s knittoshape and yarns with regard to the country of origin of the fabrics components or yarns all were called the haiti economic recovery oppor tunity act hero act following senate passage of s 2261 july 2004 the house ways and means trade subcommittee held hearing on whether to provide special trade preferences for haiti on the impacts on haitian economic developmen t and trade and on the impacts on the us textile and appare l industries us textile produ cers contended that permitting duty free entry of haitianasse mbled apparel regardle ss of country of origin of the components would result in caribbean and central american apparel makers moving to haiti where they would be able to use chinese and othe rnation yarn and fabrics and access the us market dutyfree after the hearing the subcommittee produced draft alternative never introduced the haitian hemispheric opport unity through partnership encouragement act of 2004 the hope act which required apparel compone nts to originate in the united states or in countries to which th us grants trade preferences with some exceptions us importers objected saying it would not provide enough benefits to attract new business to haiti there was further action on trade preferences for haiti before the session ended 109th congress on and off attempts to deve lop compromise legislation in 2005 failed and virtually identical b ills s 1937 and hr 4211 of the 109th congress were introduced that essentially were iden tical to s 2261 and hr 4889 of the 108th congress also called hero bills they would have limited the quantity of articles to which such preferential treatment would be extended in the initial 12month period and seven succeeding 12month periods to amounts equal to increasing percenta ges of all apparel articles imported into the united states the haitian hemispheric opportunity thr ough partnership encouragement

president on december 20 2006 to become pl 109432 in contrast to hr 6142 apparel articles th at are wholly assembled or knit to shape in haiti from any combination of components regardless of country

quantity of articles to which such preferential treatment is applied is limited in the initial 12month period to an am ount equal to 1 of the aggregate square meter equivalents of all apparel articles imported into the united states in the most recent 12month period for which data are availa ble this limitation rises by 025 percentage points each of the following four years the preferences end after the fifth year us textile interests again objected strongly asserting that the lenient rules of origin would result in caribbean and central american apparel makers moving to haiti where they would be able to use chinese and othern ation yarn and fabrics and access the us market dutyfree as with the hero bills haiti qualifies for preferential treatment under the hope act only if the us president certifies to congress that haiti has established or made progress toward establishing large number of economic legal and political institutions and policies these include marketbased economy minimum gove rnment interference that protects private property rights the rule of law the elimination of barriers to us trade and investment economic policies to reduce poverty system to combat corruption and bribery and protection of internationally recognized human and worker rights haiti has tried to enact such reforms over the past decade but has had difficulty making or maintaining progress in any of these areas current haitian textile manufacturing and trade there is too little quantitative information available on haitian textile manufacturing to provide reasonably comple quantitative picture of the industry however it can be said that based upon va lue about 80 of all haitian exports went to the united states in 20045 also in the first eleven months of 2006 textiles

that geographical proximity may provide haitis industry probably is too small to be majo r factor any time soon in the first seven months of 2006 us imports of apparel from haiti accounted for 06 of total us imports of apparel mo reover after increasing 24 between 2004 and 2005 haitian exports of apparel to the united states in 2006 are only 3 greater than the comparable 2005 period in 2005 the value of us appa rel imports from haiti equaled 02 of the value of shipments by textile and apparel manufacturing in the united states11 international trade law nd haitian trade preferences in analyzing the impact that the hope act could have on the haitian and us textile industries it is important to take into account existing in ternational trade law and us trade preferences applicable to haiti with respect to international trade law key negative development for haiti was the final pha sing out of quotas on textiles and apparel on january 1 2005 this was mandated by the agreement on textiles and clothing concluded during the uruguay round of trade negotiations and appli cable to all member nations of the world trade organization haiti is one as widely expected some countries that were subject to quotas have increased their ex ports of apparel to the united states china and india are considered to be major threats to compete against and potentially crowd out haitianmade apparel haiti is beneficiary count ry of the caribbean basin trade partnership act cbtpa title ii pl 106200 as amended the cbtpa provides certain special trade preferences to goods produced in qualifying

one or more beneficiary countries during the sixyear period beginning with october 1 2001 if the cost of the usmade fabric components used in th eir manufacture by th eir individual producer during the preceding year is at least 75 of their customs value potential benefits of the hope act given the allowance to use third country sources of components trade preferences provided to haitian tex tiles under hope act appear to be broader than those that would have been provided by the early hero bills and are provided under cafta about half of haitian exports of apparel and accessories to the unite d states already enter duty free under the cbtpa the fact that the hop act allows subject to the quantitative limitations and increasing domestic cost thre sholds dutyfree impor ts of apparel made from fabrics components or yarns originating in any country contrasts sharply with the cbtpa rules of origin abse nt other considerations th hope act may have potential benefit to the haitia n textile industry based upon hr 6142 some have argued th at significant relaxation of existing restrictions of the country origins of com ponents used to assemble apparel in haiti could set the stage for tripling apparel production nd employment in the initial years of the proposed new regimen this is derived from th fact that haiti initia lly would be eligible to export dutyfree quantity of apparel equal up to 15 of total us apparel imports in the previous year whereas haiti accounts fo r 05 of total us apparel imports value basis tripling would raise employme nt in the industry to 7500090000 three times 25000 or 30000 if haitian appare l exports to the united states reach 35 of total us imports in later years it could mean haitian apparel manufacturing employment of at least 175000 seven times 25000 the enacted bills lower quantity limitations would seem to reduce such expectations should apparel production and employment gains take place there would be in addition indirect positive effects on other pa rts of the haitian economy as the increases in personal and business incomes from expanded haitian apparel manufacturing stimulate other parts of the haitian economy12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21839crs6 13 violence by police and peacekeepers as well as by gangs has been reported aaron mate policeun killings in haiti znethaiti october 10 2005 viewed on

2004haitis political and business climate among other considerations in analyzing the impact that the proposed legislation would have on haitis textile industry are haitis politi cal and business climates access to basic services and public safety13 while some progress is noted14 one can question haitis ability to make progress in the near future toward establishing political pluralism and the rule of law protecting human nd worker rights and reducing corruption the business climate is marred by inadequate protection of private property and considerable red tape that greatly slows tr ansactions and procedures such as importing equipment purchasing fact ories and incorporating15 inadequate protection of private property raises the question of availability of insurance for entrepreneurs without which investment would not occur in addition re liable and sufficient elect ric power is lacking in many areas roads are poor and inadequate security tends to preclude businesses from adding night shifts as workers ca nnot be assured of safe trips home on the positive side haitis production co sts are reported to have become very favorable relative to those of other caribbean apparel producers16 the country has large number of unemployed and underemployed pe ople who constitute labor pool readily available for training and incorporation in the haitian textile industry work force the free trade zone with the dominican republic is open and operating and some have perceived that the new government is eager to create positive environment17 observation the proposed trade preferences containe d in the hope act could have large potential benefits for haiti par ticularly in view of the propos ed easing of restrictions on the country origins of components used in iti to make apparel th at would be exported duty free to the united states to the extent that haitian exports of apparel would increase in future period haitian appare l manufacturing and associated employment would increase and stimulate activity in the rest of the haitian economy however the several negative factors in haitis political and business climate noted above taken together weigh heavily and may well preclude significant nearterm gains moreover haiti will not have had window of opportunity to gear up production capacity and develop markets before textile and apparel quotas ex pired on january 1 2005 to be able to compete for us markets more intensively with goods from other tex tile producing countries
