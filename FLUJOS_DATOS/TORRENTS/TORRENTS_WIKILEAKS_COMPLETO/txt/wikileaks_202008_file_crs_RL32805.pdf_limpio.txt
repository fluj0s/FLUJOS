hospital sectors share of total rn employment will remain stable at about 62 percent employment settings closely asso ciated with service to the elderly are projected to increase their share of the total demand for rns for example the demand for rns in nursing homes is projected to increase from 8 percent of total demand in 2000 to 10 percent in 2020 similarly growth in the home health care sector will result in an increase in mand for rns from 65 percent to 9 percent of total rn demand these increases will naturally be offset by corresponding decline in the proportion of demand in
