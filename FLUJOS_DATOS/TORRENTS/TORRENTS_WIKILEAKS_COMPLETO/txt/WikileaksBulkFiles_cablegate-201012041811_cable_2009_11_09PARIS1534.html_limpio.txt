classified by andrew young political counselor reason 14 b and d 1 c summary mfas af assistant secretaryequivalent stephan gompertz denied that frances approach to africa is backsliding into the patterns of previous administrations francafrique he insisted that france is not interfering in african countries internal politics he said that in the recent examples of gabon niger and guinea france has supported democratic change gompertz admits the insider influence of robert bourgi and laments that france is still not focused on more strategic approach to africa at the same time he claims somewhat questionably that it is the mfas leadership that is driving the gofs relations in africa in our view france remains committed to its stated policy of developing transparent partnerships with africans but when pressed by circumstances may resort to the more opaque ways associated with francafrique when doing so is in frances national interest end summary 2 c during november 17 meeting with pol minister counselor the mfas af assistant secretaryequivalent stephan gompertz disputed the assertions made in november 13 new york times article that france still pulls the strings in francophone africa ill will grows in former colonial regional as france consorts with the powerful by adam nossiter as well as similar commentary offered in recent weeks by the french media gompertz strongly denied that france interferes in countrys internal politics and asserted that sarkozy remains serious about moving away from the paternalistic and secret dealings of frances francafrique era note see reftels for detailed analysis of frances changing africa policy end note recent criticisms are unfair 3 c responding to specific cases cited in the nossiter article gompertz said the selective information presented was unfair he first seized on the example of gabons recent presidential elections and insisted that france would have supported different electoral outcome than ali bongo if the opposition had organized themselves to achieve victory having received almost 60 percent of the vote it was the splintered and uncoordinated opposition that allowed bongo to win not france gompertz added that in his personal view bongo was more credible candidate than the two main opposition leaders and asserted that bongo has done pretty good job so far especially on addressing gabons endemic corruption 4 c for niger gompertz said that we are troubled the day before with af das fitzgerald gompertz said that france was embarrassed by the situation in niger gompertz claimed however that france led the international charge trying to stop president tandja from changing the constitution and holding elections for third term he was bothered that the ny times piece showed an old photo of sarkozy and tandja together without explaining that sarkozy later publicly advised tandja to respect nigers constitution and not stand for third term gompertz added that after tandja succeeded in his constitutional referendum state secretary joyandet and later foreign minister kouchner publicly and privately encouraged tandja to postpone his election in order to work out more democratic solution gompertz acknowledged that france had important interests in niger in particular its uranium concessions and that france was very concerned about aqim threats in the country still it is unfair to describe frances efforts in niger were not sincere gompertz said 5 c the ny times article also commented on the situation in guinea but gompertz stressed that fm kouchner was the most vocal and active critic of the regime after the september 28 violence according to gompertz kouchner pushed for the establishment of the international contact group persuaded the eu to take firm stand and pursue sanctions against guineas ruling junta and it was kouchner who convinced senegalese president wade to evacuate injured opposition leader cellou diallo to dakar 6 c gompertz noted that senior french officials both at the mfa and in our experience at the elysee routinely meet with african opposition leaders both in paris and overseas adding that joyandet was scheduled to meet with paris 00001534 002 of 003 cellou diallo that afternoon frances africa policy does have problems 7 c gompertz admitted that frances africa policy does have problems most notably that france continues to focus most of its efforts on its former colonies even though they are not necessarily the most strategically important gompertz hopes to push for stronger engagement with anglophone and lusaphone africa note gof officials frequently cite nigeria angola and south africa as three of frances key emerging partners in africa gompertz was departing the same afternoon for morocco and south africa end note similarly too much of frances political and cooperation resources in africa are designed to reinforce its partnerships within the international francophonie organization gompertz cited the example of burundi where english is replacing french as the most popular foreign language but he said this is understandable given burundis important trade links in the east african community at the same time he related that while he was ambassador to ethiopia there was strong demand for french language teachers but france was not responsive in helping meet this need 8 c targeting more closely the topic of francafrique gompertz said he regretted that lawyer and presidential advisor robert bourgi touted by the french press as the new standard bearer of the old francafrique was sarkozys friend but thats fact of life while admitting that bourgi operates in the shadows and has influence on frances approach to africa gompertz stated forcefully that policy for subsaharan africa is led by kouchner joyandet and comment and analysis 9 c the sincere and mildmannered gompertz almost worked up dander in defending frances approach to africa as well as the importance of the mfas leadership however though not entirely at odds with gompertzs assertions the gofs africa policy hands increasingly suggest frances need to contrast the importance of stability in volatile region with nobler democratic ideals as has been shown in niger mauritania madagascar and perhaps now in guinea unfortunately there was not time during this meeting to ask about other notorious francafrique hotspots such as the republic of congo togo cameron and equatorial guinea also by downplaying the role of bourgi and by not commenting on the important role of the presidencys secretary general claude gueant also friend of bourgi in shaping frances relations with african leaders gompertz perhaps unwittingly revealed his own concerns about philosophical division between the elysee and the mfa on africa policy 10 c clearly there is much jostling between the mfa and presidency for africa policy leadership remi marechaux one of the stafflevel africa advisors at the elysee scoffs whenever the issue of resurgent francafrique is raised he pointedly notes that during francafriques heyday under the legendary jacques foccart the africa cell at the presidency numbered about 80 including its own intelligence unit marechaux contrasts that with todays africa cell at the presidency consisting of himself romain serman soon to be replaced by clement leclerc and their recentlyarrived boss and deputy diplomatic advisor andre parant who replaced bruno joubert marechaux bristles at the notion that the three of them are pulling strings the way their 80 predecessors did marechaux says that the role of the elysees africa cell is to channel the policy ideas of president sarkozy admittedly influenced by bourgi gueant special advisor henri guaino and sarkozys other close associates and that the mfas role is to do what bureaucracies traditionally do either implement those ideas or explain with bureaucratic thoroughness why those ideas are not feasible 11 c our own view is that there is wide range of policy approaches available to the french spectrum running from the more ideal approaches sarkozy expressed in his early days in office reftels to the more opaque but possibly more expedient approaches conforming to the old francafrique model circumstances and the unpredictable sometimes violent nature of events in africa may at times tempt or even force the french to act less ideally than they may want form of behavior familiar to every other government in the paris 00001534 003 of 003 world when decisions are based on need to further the national interest in the most effective way possible even when the most effective way may not be the prettiest way we find the gofs professional cadre of africa hands accessible open and wanting to find common ground with the us in many situations gompertz appeared as man with burden lifted when he was reminded of the new york times november 17 article asserting largescale corruption by equatorial guinean minister and the presidents teodoro nguema obiang reportedly frequent visitor to and investor in the us 12 u conakry and tripoli minimize considered pekala
