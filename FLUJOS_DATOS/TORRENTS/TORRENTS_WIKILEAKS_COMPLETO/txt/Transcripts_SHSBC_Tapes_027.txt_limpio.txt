subject shsbc 27 date 21 mar 2000 223256 0000 from anonymousremailerseecommentheader fzba organization mail2newsnymaliasnet newsgroups altclearingtechnologyaltreligionscientology routine iaproblems lecture given on 3 july 1961 this is the 3rd of july and i told you today that i was only going to talk to you three days week but i was sitting upstairs and i got lonesome besides you have something new has been added now you go ahead and add things you know youre always adding things to processing i see somebody was doing goals assessment on some pc somewhere along the line is was something on what success have you had thank you what success have you had thank you oh that was too bad what success have you had thank you you know weird so anyhow if you want to add things well i might as well be able to add things too and there is place for another routine actually there are places for many other routines and itll probably go up like the cchs did you know get all complicated and then be cut back to simplicity this is routine 1a is what im talking about and ill call to your attention that we did not change differentiate or invalidate routines 1 2 and 3 theyre pretty good as far as im concerned theyve stood the tests all the crisscross tests of time but there is case that should be run on cchs that cant be run on cchs there is such case now lets look this over there are three things which can hold up cases present time problem big withhold or an arc break arc breaks normally stem from withholds there is process on arc breaks which is recall an arc break it is not an unpowerful process it is quite process if not flat it becomes quite process thats just that one process its just one repetitive command recall an arc break that exists and if arc breaks are taken separately or under the heading of overts and withholds to which theyre intimately connected it gives you either two or three things that could be wrong with case that isnt progressing you see it could be present time problem withholds and arc breaks or it could be present time problem and ow you see they both amount more or less to the same thing so youd say there are fundamentally two things then which are productive of three things all of which mean case deterioration or progress the two things of course are problems and withholds and these are productive of problems withholds and arc breaks you see but by running just the two of them you can cure three ordinarily the person who arc breaks badly and so forth is normally staggering along under lots of withholds and lot of unkind thoughts and that sort of thing arc breaks should come under the heading of ow in any event because thats the way you cure an arc break with the pc the pc is arc breaky you run ow and thats it but there is nothing viad that will cure withhold except getting rid of the withhold and there is nothing that cures problem but getting rid of problem do you see that youre looking little bit blankly at it i wonder why because this is terribly terribly basically simple if case isnt progressing in an hgc you immediately assume that the case is either being audited on ptp or the case is being audited with tremendous withhold see these two things is what you immediately assume and thats what you should assume so how about the cchs walking uphill against tremendous present time problems theres way to get rid of the present time problems if youre running the cchs because there are rudiments and your rudiments processes probably wouldnt work on this pc anyway quite interestingly they dont work very well so this leaves us room for routine 1a now routine 1a would take care of just these two factors the problem and the withhold just these two factors would be cared for that would be all you wouldnt do anything else then but run problems process and security check problems processes and security checks and problems processes and security check you got the idea well the only reason 1a could come to fruition so suddenly is that i had nice blue flash it was about from here to that oak tree down in the middle of there and it turned the air little bit ozonish for just few minutes and suddenly realized that all this work that has been done on problems which began in earnest about 55 and saw the light of day in 56 and its been heavily stressed ever since had not been simplified to its lowest level of simplification and that lowest level of simplification is the process recall problem it runs all legs of the bracket itll run thirtytwo legs of the bracket if you let it see it doesnt say whose problem youre supposed to recall of course the person usually recalls their own problems for while and then they realize that theyre problem to somebody else and so forth and this gets this thing of problems something you do something about problems not necessarily fast process but there are several things that i should tell you about problems in order to understand the handling of this particular thing and i finally have found out what it is that makes problem so deadly in processing well problem is postulate counterpostulate problem is ordinarily two ideas counteropposed its an indecisional proposition one cannot decide because there are two things one could decide and when these things become even faintly in balance one of course gets his attention on two data this of course is almost impossible as situation so one doesnt see the amount of confusion on it and the confusion tends to ball up and pile up you see and the confusion starts mounting around each one of these data and you get two separate zones of confusion and the stable data ill give you an idea mary says let us go to the movies and john says let us play checkers now if these two things are of equal magnitude as to what we should do we cannot look at the idea of movies and we cannot look at the idea of checkers because you see theres deciding between these two things then of course movies start to ball up as confusion you see because were going to go to the movies but were not going to do it do you know were going to do it but were not going to do it thats just an insane situation you see now were going to play checkers but were not going to play checkers so we get two of these confusion and the stable datum there are two of them there not one see there isnt just the confusion and the stable datum which is the ordinary spin that person gets into and gets out of theres two of them and you mustnt look at either postulate and you dont look at either confusion so nothing gets asised so problem tends to persist and the common denominator of problem is persistence of all things that endure problem is the enduringest problems endure longer so people become impatient with problems and they solve them now problem that is solved is problem that is notised not problem which is asised in the ordinary solution now people go along solving problems all the time now the solution of problem at the finest reductio ad absurdum is of course an overt against problem see problems cant just be problems they have to be solved and so much is so that everything there is in this universe is cure for something else which is to say solution to some other problem and this is basic factor in the persistence of the universe this isnt the only reason the universe persists mechanically there is another reason but as far as thinkingness is concerned we get the oddity that everything is cure for everything else and that all cures deteriorate and in their turn become the new problem all cures become the new problems now jan and dick one time when i was discussing this in lecture they went home and figured out what time and space and matter and energy and so forth were in time in terms of cures and they got it pretty good i had big rack of cures of various things in the lower order so they pushed it over into the sixth dynamic to see what they were cures for and sure enough they figured out that time was cure for space and you get the idea and energy was cure for time everything was cure for that ive never investigated this very thoroughly but it was quite interesting just the concept that these very elements with which we deal were cures for other things but the basic thing is that nearly everything is cure for something else all right lets look this over then if thats the case lets take good notion here as to what this is all about and we find that alcohol just about century and half ago was curing things it was curing things there is doubt about it ill tell you that naval vessel like the uss constitution wouldnt carry threequarters of its stores in potable beverages unless it was good for something and somebody would get tired you see and theyd take drink and theyd feel better and life at sea was pretty miserable in those days and theyd get cold and wet or have cold coming on or something and they would take drink and that would cure it it really would cure it you see it was smooth it really did work and nowadays you take drink and you get tired and we have disease called alcoholism see it itself is disease now bacteria itself that causes disease at one time or another cured something and you can figure out most diseases on the basis of what they cured which is quite amazing to figure out well you take an organization that is hammer and tongs on the subject of creativeness the roman catholic church is propaganda in this at all its just the fact that they do really have the hatchet out on the second dynamic you know i mean theyre real frothy on this subject they dont think any creation ought to be done that can possibly be prevented you realize that from their literature and they actively oppose any material being segregated which in any way shape or form informs about cures or asises or has anything to do with the eradication of venereal disease because they think its good thing and vd programs in new york city in the recent decade or so ran into the heavy heavy heavy weather of anti well catholic propaganda they were just hot on this they wouldnt let anything be shown to educate people into vd educate them as to what it was or how to take care of it or anything else they spent enormous sums of money i see youre looking very blank about it but this i guess im telling you something thats news to you this is not news to anybody in the medical profession they as matter of fact are quite hot on the subject that somebody would prevent the public from knowing actively how to take care of themselves on the subject of vd of course condemns the rest of the population to contagion unwitting contagion and so forth its just somebody is idiotically explaining how cancer is all right you know its okay you know its good cure well of course vd is cure for sex thats all it is actually theres terrifically heavy incidence of vd amongst military personnel why well i dont know for some reason or other people get into armies and navies and so forth and they dont run into any women i think its very unenterprising of them never had the trouble myself but they do they get into camps and things like this and there are women you see and they get on board ships and theyre gone for some time at sea and theres women i dont know who perpetuates this weird idea i know i wrote the navy department in 1942 and said we could use seven or eight girls on board they didnt actually it would have been good thing having nothing to do with the second dynamic because we couldnt get any sailors to man the guns because we had to do all the cooking and yeoman work and so forth with fighting men you see but i got interested in this one day because we had innumerous numerous cases of vd very unlovely subject and of course these cases would sort of wind up on my docket as something i had to do something about and when youre working in expeditions or corvettes or something like this you seldom have doctor or the doctor is dead drunk or something you sail out of port and youve got seven out of crew of hundred men totally incapacitated that can be very serious when youre already shorthanded you see vd so of course you break out the knockout drops and the sulfathiazole and the penicillin and so on and you let them have it well what was very interesting to little jewish boy he was terrific terrific terrific yeoman he was marvelous and he must have been all of about eighteen something like this he was quite little guy name was hymie and hymie came down with roaring case of vd out on the pacific coast thats very interesting because all hymie had to do was think of girl you see and hed practically go up through the funnel and we went out to rescue careless pilot who had mistaken the middle of the pacific for his landing field and hymie was hauled off the ship by the local medic and hymie in tears came by as they were dragging him away literally dragging him away you see because here was his ship going to sea my god you know and here he was being hauled over on the dock and he says to he says but captain he says i have never had anything to do with woman never in my whole life how could i have venereal disease and they dragged him over on the dock there was doctors are suspicious lot and we came back having not found the aircraft the army i think they forgot to dispatch it or something and everybody is educated by the movies you know into believing you know that an aircraft goes up and if its unreported for fifteen and half seconds that there are rescue squadrons all over the place you know and people talking efficiently on phones and the coast guard talking to this and merchant ships at sea being alerted in all directions you know and you have very nice music backgrounding all this up you know and so forth and that isnt the way its done at all all of sudden youll hear plaintive cry someplace or another and it sounds like very faint mayday and somebodys going down somewhere and you take radio fix on him and you instantly radio base someplace the nearest aircraft base and you say is one of your planes missing and they say well we dont know oh you dont know well we dont count planes taking off from here you think were crazy or something and well is one of your aircraft missing well uh oh i dont know well find out in the next few days do you have to know and you say well theres somebody out here yelling mayday and oh probably isnt from our base thats an actual experience i never did find any aircraft base that knew where any of its aircraft were so that was pretty good its all propaganda im afraid i dont suppose they abandon all of them i suppose occasionally when the press boys are around they suddenly send out somebody to crash and get rescued or something here we had thats cynical attitude but theyre cynical people im just qandaing with it so i pulled in alongside of the dock and were all disgusted and theres nothing has happened and were all beat up and thoroughly dusted by the cruel cruel sea and we pull up alongside the same dock and theres hymie see and hes standing there with his kit bag you know and hes looking very happy and very cheerful and he comes aboard and he says to he says skipper he says heck i didnt have it i didnt have it they told it was something called nonspecific i talked to the medicos about this and they said oh yes we get lots of those lots of those he said theres bacteria present theres nothing present and so forth its just tremendous discharge he says lot of boys get very very worried about this sort of thing i got to thinking about it later i was going over this subject here few years ago and it occurred to that obviously venereal disease stops sex so if sex is stopped you get venereal disease got the idea see sex equals venereal disease because venereal disease equals sex and it goes both ways and you only get this high incidence of vd amongst very sexstarved people and you get these nonspecific venereal diseases you see amongst groups of people who havent anything to do with sex at all quite interesting huh of course prostitution and so forth is about as close as you can get to sex you just ask men around london how close you can get to sex at all and they tell you prostitution i actually conducted campaign on this some time ago thats also sort of nosex proposition you see so this combines up in various ways and weve got sex and we get over here nosex condition so thats probably what vd is anyhow because it very often doesnt even exist as bacteria you got the idea its got all the symptoms and somebody could be worried to death but it isnt well theres case of cures suddenly emerging and arising you see now sex is cure for bodies see thats what sex is cure for and then if you get bodies of course why you get cure for sex get how weirdly and tortuously and involvedly all of this works out get the idea i mean the cure becomes the cause becomes the cure becomes the cause you know the illness becomes the cure becomes the illness becomes the cure you see how all this is now you havent got pc whose ideas about horses sleeping in beds who hasnt cured something with that idea quite factual every aberration hes got was cure for something lets take his motionlessness this is why withholds work so well his motionlessness is cure for having killed so many people see thats cure if he doesnt move he wont kill anybody all right so you pick up the withholds on killing and all of sudden he can move again see because he isnt under this tremendous compulsion but what was killing killing was cure for something get the idea killing was cure for hating people if there werent any people around of course you didnt have to hate well what was hate well that was cure for associating with people to some way or another or that was to keep one from associating with people because one was liable to damage people so weve come back to the same cure see hating people was cure for liable to damage people and then of course damaging people was cure for people being people and then motionlessness was cure for damaging people you see how this works out on the withhold line its all this nonsense of one thing goes to another goes to another goes to another and guys will get some mighty weird wild and wonderful ideas on what theyre liable to do and how they should restrain it or whats liable to happen and how they should solve it and as long as you see perfectly logical to us solutions why you think this is all right its only when you see these oddball solutions you see that you say well what is that cure for and you dont understand its cure for anything and of course it isnt so therefore you say its an aberration you might say an aberration is cure that you dont understand or an aberration is cure that doesnt cure anything or aberration is cure that cures some craziness now you get all of this weird concatenation of illness is the cure and the cure becomes the illness and all these things get entwined and so on and all these things go this way so irrationally because basically they are problems it all goes back to the confusion and the stable datum one kind or another now you get two confusions and two stable data and these are counteropposed and you dont dare do one and you dont dare do the other one and therefore you dont confront one you dont confront the other one you get an endurance because it is never asised and the endurance goes along the line on and on and on and on and on why because you never asis the thing it is always solved you see you do something else so these pcs for instance that have via plus via plus via plus via plus via to run an auditing command inherit it simply on this basis of they run into problem you see and then theyll go up through the solutions through very serie series of vias and the basic thing wrong with them is the problem thats basic theyve got problem of some kind or another and this problem they have never frontally attacked they have never looked at it as problem and not looking at it as problem of course gets them into some interesting states now when you say problem of comparable magnitude youve put the via of cure the problem youve taken it off of automatic you see so youre getting the person to covertly look at the problem look at the problem look at the problem and youve seen it be quite effective and all of sudden the problem disappears well why because youve made him look at the problem look at the problem look at the problem but basically problems have terrific endurance and they just run on the track forever so therefore certain conditions which are designed to cure other conditions snakes venom is the thing which causes the snake to be antipathetic and it is cure for the antipathetic character of people toward snake you see you dont like snakes because they have venom well they have venom you see because they people dont like them you get how idiotic this is always this idiotic it all comes down to some idiocy and we get the basic thing of qanda is simply that the questions answer is always the question the answer to question is the question you see you say to well why dont you stand pc on his head in the corner in order to process him and of course the answer to it is why dont you stand pc on his head in the corner to process him see its of course the perfect duplication see that is the answer to that question you got the idea thats the idiots delight thats the duplication but of course that question is not prompted by that question it is prompted by some other confusion so by simply replying to it why dont you stand the pc on his head in the corner to process him and you say back why dont you stand pc on his head in the corner to process him this is very unsatisfactory people dont like to have this happen to them well thats because theyre trying to solve basic confusion they have but the confusion will be something very fundamental about something very fundamental theres fundamental datum about scientology or something awry they have confusion on someplace else and you havent reached that and one of the ways of teaching very skilled method of teaching is to try to arrive at where this guy is wound up dont give him an answer to why you on silly question like why dont you stand pcs on their head in corner to process them dont give them try to solve the thing for them just try to find out how where he where he got that lineup that would wind up with this you see as the satisfactory solution and youll find out hes got some basic and fundamental confusion on axioms 1 to 55 see theres something going wrong here whenever you hear of one of these things and hes trying to cure confusion and then when you answer him or give him sensible solution you very often are trying to cure his confusion but as long as you try to cure confusions the confusions continue thats why man drops back to threat of duress and punishment all the time he is despaired of correcting this criminals juvenile lifetime as the of millionaire or something you see his terrible period of childhood is something thats totally beyond anybodys reach and of course he got very fundamental confusions about human relationships in that childhood oh everybody recognizes that these days but hardly anybody tries to do anything about that instead of that they arrest the guy and put him in jail boy thats sure stable datum isnt it that is motionless enclosed its location that isnt going to change and that is cure for what bunch of confusions about people well there are now people there hardly at all you cant be confused about people because there arent any people there well that seems to to be terribly terribly drastic in other words thats heavy action which is borne out of despair and it is only faintly cure for criminality because you find most criminals that are confirmed criminals or real bad criminals have been to jail several times in jail they get educated into hating people you see its like the snakes venom they get the idea people dont like them so therefore its perfectly all right for them to bite people you see and youve just moved them further and further out by curing this broad thing called criminality and i mean advisedly this offbeat idea of curing criminality youd have to get rid of somebodys basic confusions about life before he would cease to be criminal all right clarifications of ones own background knock out all of these confusions and there is way of making fundamental attack upon this this is frontal attack these confusions very often stem from withholds so you give something like joburg security check and you get the withholds off the case all right you get the withholds off in the process of getting the withholds off have you ever noticed the pc appears confused at times you know kind of spinny and confused and so forth well actually what youre doing is asising some of these fundamental confusions he wonders why the devil did i do that hes trying to find the problem that he solved with it well lets take further look at this and well see then that the most fundamental confusion there could be would be two counteropposed data each surrounded by confusion and nobody could put his mind on either one of these two data and nobody could put his mind on either of these two confusions of course those confusions would tend to persist all the more wouldnt they because thats what you call multiple confusion so problem is multiple confusion its more than one confusion if you dont believe that examine the anatomy of problem someday your pc has problem just find the two confusions and youll find out there are two confusions not one confusion there are two and there are two solutions or two ideas involved in this each one with its own confusion its an encysted encysted confusion because theres solution to it here and theres solution to it here but of course you cant do solution and do solution b and you cant do solution b and do solution you see and each one has its own confusion so you just try to back off from this and of course you cant back off from anything actually so as result it follows you and you get this oddity of problem moving in on somebody every time you get him to solve it and moving out on him every time you get him to look at it you see hes trying to escape an idea and the idea is with him and the faster you try to back off of one of your ideas you know well experimentally get an idea that all lions are dangerous now consider that as very dangerous idea consider youre lion tamer or something they like to be called lion trainers i just remembered and consider that all lions are dangerous would be very dangerous idea for lion trainer to have see so you shouldnt get that idea should you that would put an end rather to the aplomb with which you go in to the arena so get the idea of getting the idea all lions are dangerous now do this right now get the idea all lions are dangerous now decide that is dangerous idea and decide youre going to back off from it dont forget it or anything just try to back off from that idea of all lions are dangerous does an odd thing doesnt it has tendency to collapse trying to escape your own ideas you know is very very interesting its like trying to play checkers on your own coattail and that is the mechanism on which problems move in on one is one gets an idea he shouldnt have the idea so he moves off from the idea but of course the idea is his idea and where is there to go well one thing one cant hide from is his own ideas of course you get sort of an idea of withholding though as you try to back off from one of your own ideas because youre trying to get away from it you see so as you move back from these things of course they follow you in and therefore you ask pc he tells you he has problem you say where is it hell very mysteriously say quite ordinarily that its out there about ten feet see or five feet or its right here in his head and ask him to get problem of comparable magnitude to it or just think of problem of comparable magnitude to it and then say where is it now and hell say well its out there twenty feet see and think of problem of comparable magnitude moves out there forty feet fifty feet sixty feet as long as you run that one now you say solve it thank you solve it thank you solve it think of solution to it thank you where is the problem now its right here you say all right think of another solution to it where is it now he says its right in the middle of my head and you say okay all right now think of problem of comparable magnitude to it good think of problem of comparable magnitude to it good think of problem of comparable magnitude to it good think of problem of comp where is it now its out there about thirty feet well you keep that up and of course you say well where is it now well its gone over the horizon and disappeared and you can actually get him to confront this sort of problem long enough that this happens then you say all right get an idea that solves that problem get an idea that solves that problem get an idea that solves that problem where is the problem now he says place in other words you havent brought it back in well why havent you brought it back in because in the think of problem of comparable magnitude you have actually got him to asis it the confusions of it disappeared got the idea you got him on via and so on so he did confront it on via and then he confronted it directly and of course as soon as he did that it disappeared so you cant say endlessly to somebody he tells you he has an awful problem with his wife you see or something like that and you say where is the problem this would sound at first statement like its an idiotic question where is it well she is home and hes here so obviously it is either home or here but he never answers that you dont get that answer he says its right there and you say well wheres right there he says well its fifteen feet out in front of or something like this that is his response in actuality if hes going to locate it for you and providing hes high enough up the line that he can see ridges lot of people are below being able to see ridges they only see lines some people have lines going all over the room darnedest concatenation you ever saw the old reality scale way back l7th acc anyhow so you cant endlessly say all right this problem with your wife all right think of solution to the problem think of solution to the problem think of solution to the problem think of solution to the problem have it arrive right here in his head and then say think of problem of comparable magnitude thank you think of problem of comparable magnitude thank you and have it move out and then say think of solution to that problem think of solution to that problem think of solution to that problem have it move in and then say think of problem of comparable magnitude think of problem of comparable magnitude think what problem this actually disposes of the confusion it doesnt just endlessly yoyo and last forever you see that but problems have endurance so you could say on thought level that thought mass is basically problems if thought mass is enduring then it is basically composed of problems if ridges are enduring then they must be problems why would problem endure unless the thing the problem is the two confusions and the two stable data counteropposed and one doesnt look at either of them or asis either of them so you get an endurance of energy masses in the mind some pc complains to you that ridges are about to knock her head off or some pc says to you that they have terrible pressure in their chest or some pc coughs all the time whats this this must be persistent mental mass right and mental mass is mass there is doubt about that it has weight very tiny but it has weight it actually has size and shape and so forth all right this person tells you they have persistent difficulty with their leg now that isnt quite mental mass because its materialized in the physical universe and all of these conditions that i have just enumerated all add up to the fact that the person has problems now if you get this going enough the person will be problem and of course inevitably will dramatize being problem and quite ordinarily they say problems are unsolvable or these problems are much too much for them so of course the problem that theyre sitting in is going to be much too much for you too everybody sees to that got the idea so you start you keep worrying about this pc because this pc is problem and then you keep trying to solve this problem then one day you got facsimiles of the pc do you see how that would work but the pc will actually get to point where they dramatize being problem now if you ask around and ask people if the case has made any progress the people that say even when their profile is changed of course are doing what theyre simply dramatizing being problem well whats wrong with them problems are persistent they have terrific endurance and this person is sitting right in the middle of problem which is from lord knows where when or how or what you see but there it is and theyve been so overwhelmed by this problem that when theyre asked about problems they are the problem so they present themselves to you as problem and when somebody says he has gain he has said the same thing to you as is im problem to you solve now of course your chances of solving it on any oblique line are quite poor why are they poor well because problems are the one thing that have the heaviest endurance theyre the most enduring things there are because theyre postulate counterpostulate each one with separate confusion so one can make neither head nor tail out of problem because he cant put his mind on confusion without getting hit by confusion b and he cant try to asis or consider answer or stable datum b without having answer strike him as the best thing you see so he tries to put his attention on one he gets the other one he tries to put his attention on the other one he gets the one and he finally says i will back off from this so he adds curtain across this whole proposition called confront pcs which have consistently rising needles you know anything you ask them why the needle starts rising at the drop of the hat the needle starts rising you got the idea and it rises and rises and rises and rises and rises its good for reading because you cant tell what theyre not confronting but i can tell you what theyre not confronting now i didnt know few weeks that i could you know say it just bang that would communicate well but theyre not confronting problem so thats what rising needle is all about theyre not confronting something thats for sure well we could never say what they werent confronting but we can say it in generality now theyre not confronting problem and after you audit this person for while this person will find out that this person has problems only they didnt know they had these problems see but anytime you ticked anything that had anything to do with his problems you of course put them on confront and youd get some oddity like this youd be talking to the pc and youd say well now hows tricks and hows it going and has anything happened between this last session i gave you and this one now and the pc will say and all of sudden the needle starts rising like startled gazelle and the tone arm starts going up and you say well what is this and something did happen and they say oh nothing happened and you check it down and youre finally forced to do something you really shouldnt do but you cant take somebody who has got very wildly different tone arm read between sessions this was acquired and go on and process him if you expect to get anyplace because something has happened but they will quite normally its like fishing for fish in sea where there are none its like these resorts that get you down there that promise to sell you bait and boats and youre going to catch all the fish in the world and the only thing you get is sunburn you know you just apparently just cant find what this is you know for long time its like drilling for oil in barren rock then all of sudden well theres nothing happened except i had an automobile accident last night thats all i mean couldnt possibly be anything oh yes it was yes as matter of fact i was guilty as matter of fact i i just remembered i have the ticket from the police in my pocket now im supposed to appear as summons and lose my license at two oclock you know i mean it could get this nutty but factually you see it was problem and they backed off and they didnt confront it and then now they cant tell you about it why cant they tell you about it because they cant confront it thats why but i can tell you the common denominator of all confronts is problem confront problem persistence problem all these things add up now the cchs can cut and saw through this remarkably well considering but this is where you get your slow gain this is your slowgain case this is the case that doesnt take off like startled gazelle and run to clear in hurry this case is mired in problems and this is probably the answer to slow clearing this is why slow clearing occurs okay now you need the answer to that why is slow goals why does it take forever to get somebodys goals well hes sitting in problem now youll notice that case that is slow in gain is heavy on comm lag or if they are talking arent talking quite on the line of what we should be talking about got the idea either the confusion is withheld or inverted in other words the communication is withheld or inverted the comm lag stems from the confront and then this can get so bad that they dont even confront what youre asking them but disassociate slightly and talk about something else every time you ask them question you got that in other words you can back off from problem to such degree that theres place to go and then you have to go on complete disassociated via because everything is associated with this problem well now what caused the pc to react dumbly the pc sat down they were apparently okay the tone arm wasnt too high and you said to them has anything happened since the last session and of course this clicked it but they went on confront so they cant tell you it clicked and put them on confront they were all right right up to the point when you asked them if they had problem and this is the phenomenon that youve run into consistently of somebody being very upset with you because you asked them if they have problem youve asked them to confront something they cant confront and theyre liable to get fall so they know they cant run it because they know they cant do anything about problem dont you see and theyd rather get on with the auditing havent you ever noticed this one well this is their confession when they have this type of reaction to problem that theyre sitting in the middle of some godawful problems none of which theyre confronting see well you might say the clue to slow gain or odd behavior in pc is problem and not one but multiple series of problems which compose themselves into ridged bank so you get your invisible field your black field your field with small rockets and then of course on an inverted basis field with little trains that run by and give you the dope see this is way to communicate without looking at anything you put them all on little toy trains see and this explains these various field mechanisms and ive never given you good explanation for them before i couldnt put it well but there it is its basically problem they start to confront they get confront thats because its an indecisional situation wholly indecisional now all this is prelude to very very simple process it is so idiotically simple that you will begin to wonder when it halfkills your pc because it will itll turn on somatics that are fabulous itll turn on aches and pains and sore throats and bad ears that you never heard of before you know but every one of these things is whats keeping the pc from going up the line so you could make direct frontal attack on the nochange case not with change but with problems ive known for years that that stuck profile was the fact that the pc had problem while he was being audited see well now lets reduce this to point where the pc is pc where all problems are life and life is problem that theyre being audited is problem that theyre there is problem that they are alive is problem that theyre going to die is problem that they have car is problem that they dont have car is problem do you see its all problem now and apparent solution to anything and reactively it becomes very dangerous to them to solve anything and they dont solve anything they have an awful time terrible time problems sniper on the right sniper on the left if you duck to the left side of the tree you get hit by one sniper if you duck to the right side of the tree you get hit by the other sniper well what you going to do if you do either one youre wrong so you take up religion see its just thud just like that you know youll find that it is in the fields of stress and duress of life where religious cults make their finest harvest heres skidrow george you know stumbling down and he knows if he doesnt drink wood alcohol that hes going to get the dts and thats terrible see because hell start coming out of it and if he does itll kill him and its that much further to come out of it see whats his answer salvation army standing there on the corner he all of sudden helps them beat the drum hes arrived at exactly nowhere see hes gone into think hes gone out of confront into figure see and youll find youll find afterwards the thing to do is to beat the drum you know and you say didnt you used to be an alcoholic has nothing to do with what the case is he wont say anything about his life as an alcoholic itll cut in on some kind of level and then i took up religion and i was longer liability to myself or others got the idea hell hang in the middle just ask him sometime you can hang him right in the middle if he doesnt say yes except as it sort of comes out as propaganda yes i was an alcoholic i remember well lying around in barroom and there was this bartender there and he gave job sweeping out and i was lying there on the barroom floor and he picked up the bar broom and he swept out instead and i was lying there in the gutter in the rain and this cop came by and took over to the hospital and i had devil of time in the hospital i had dts and everything else none of the story never goes that far because theres not that much confront in the man it will go something like this and the bartender picked up the broom hell get that far and i realized then i was on the wrong course and ive been beating the drum ever since see he does depart he never finishes the engram only next time that you ask him about when he took up religion or you say to him something on the order of having been an alcoholic he tells you an entirely different tale about the moment he decided he was up this mast in ninetymileanhour gale and he realized there wasnt much to life and that it was all very perilous and all there was was really god see and it was at that moment that he suddenly did and the next time you ask him about anything about his being an alcoholic hell give you another story which is entirely different and of course all of these things are fictitious nonconfronts of one character or another because he cannot confront the problem of having been an alcoholic because hes now solved it which is matter of hes sitting right in the middle of being an alcoholic being the solution to being an alcoholic see thats why alcoholics anonymous do what they do i always thought this was pretty good organization one of their members convinced otherwise down in south africa he told what their texts were all about their first tenet is there is cure for drunkenness theres absolutely cure for alcoholism one must make up his mind to it i didnt believe the guy but since that time ive read some of their literature they sell person absolutely hypnotically hundred percent with sledgehammer on the idea that he can never be anything but an alcoholic that is his first line what he must learn to do is to overcome it in some fashion or another realizing all the time that he is an alcoholic i mean you talk about finding guy in the mud and then using his head for stepping stone thats it its not so good see i thought they were doing something about alcoholism theyre not theyre saying nothing can be done about alcoholism thats why they never cooperate with us i never understood why before but they never do its always little token cooperation and then they find out that we say that you can do something about alcoholism and theyre off us like shot thats because theyve got an opposed datum is theres nothing you can do about alcoholism all right alcoholism is problem and to them it is problem of tremendous endurance and enormous magnitude and theyre saying you cant confront any part of it see so therefore youve got to walk around being solution to it so join alcoholics anonymous nice mechanism isnt it man is evil he is terrible problem theres nothing you can do about it become monk see this these are the concatenative thoughts that all wind up in the same order now youre in there somebodys come into scientology saying well theres nothing you can do about life ill sit here and not confront anything and their case doesnt make any gain they arent many dont think youre one of them because theyre only people who get case gains to amount to anything got the idea then their withholds and their problems their problems actually come about through their withholds and then their withholds come about through their problems you see and then the more they withhold the more problems theyve got and then the more problems theyve got the more they withhold you see and the less confront there is in them so they get foggier and foggier and mistier and mistier about the whole thing and what are they doing theyre flinching from themselves theyre there where else is there to go there isnt anyplace else to go the atomic bomb you say theres place to hide thats lie i know of lot of satellites asteroids the moon various planets even jupiter if you like to swim in seas of liquefied air these are places to go and i dont mean getting out on the broomstick that they send off at cape canaveral i im talking about the fact so they knock you off you go someplace or before the atomic bombing comes why you die of something and go to jupiter or something you know whats the difference there is someplace to go but there is one thing that you never can get away from and that of course is yourself because youre there and as long as youre there youre there and as soon as you start getting away from yourself of course you try to pretend you are not where you are and you get some kind of dispersed locational situation you get buttered all over the universe see the guy is everywhere at the same time you see he permeates everything without being anywhere well hes just somebody whos trying to escape himself why because he himself has problems and these problems all carry as common denominator confront so just as you get the idea that lion taming is dangerous thinking of yourself as lion tamer try to back up from the idea of course where are you going to go youve put motion and action into thought process and as soon as you do that of course the two become inextricably entangled only inextricably short of scientology all right these ridges and all that sort of thing that people run into and that theyre having difficulties with and so forth actually surrender on this one command they do but i am not telling you lie when i say its actually hell to run it is it is rough because it turns on some nice horrendous somatics and from session to session in the early stages of it it does not move rapidly do you see why it does not move rapidly it appears to be very gluey and the pcs liable to tell you theyre getting all gummed up in the glue of it all you know and that its all stacking up and its getting worse and worse and so on well the cchs are moving this same thing through but you ask somebody to recall problem youve said what youve said confront something youre not confronting so you have to be very careful to get the auditing command answered so secondary question very often should be interjected you said recall problem and he says mmhm and you say what problem was that and youll very often catch him out he just has generality of life hes just thought of generality called life yes hes recalled problem its generality you see and this great generality has sort of spread all over the place and he hasnt told you problem and when he says well um yes well urn i didnt i just uh didnt didnt really think of one i thought of and you say well ill repeat the auditing question recall problem you have to make sure that he does recall specific problem because on this particular process more questions go unanswered than in any other known process more questions can be dogged than any other one so you have to be quite sharp on that what was that one you know recall problem mmhrn thats great yeah mmhm what does this mmhm mean its probably agreeing with your auditing command it isnt that he did it till you say what problem was that and you very often get the immediate confession that it was just generality it didnt have anything to do with any particular problem anyplace anywhere at any time now man goes through or girl goes through nonconfront like this like mad and these various ridges that are hounding them and making them cough and pushing their noses into the back of their heads and all that sort of thing are simply problem ridges and thats all there are theyre confusions which have centered around counteropposed data between which nobody could make up his mind except to confront them and they havent confronted them they have backed up from being lions are dangerous they backed up and of course they there is place to back to so there they are so they begin to have the sensation then of being pushed or being pressed upon or being infiltrated or being entered or having terror stomachs or facial somatics or sinusitis or bad eyes or pains in the head or migraine headaches or something like this and of course it feels to them like some exterior pressure is at operation on them see theres some kind of an exterior pressing demanding thing that is evidently being levered against them from some other quarter well the other quarter of course is not another quarter theyre trying to back up from where they are you see but every time they back up they carry what they have with them naturally its like fellow with an armload of kindling and he keeps backing up to get away from the kindling but he never looks at the kindling or lets go of it and of course hell get the sensation after while that something is busting his ribs what is it it is very mysterious well it is not very mysterious it is problem but dont think of it in terms that if you could just find the one problem of the mans life youd have his whole case solved you could find the basicbasic problem that started all of his confusions on the track you could find various vintages of problems which would then start concatenation and ripup of problems you could find lot of considerations that move problems into tough category and so forth but it is just this one consideration really that theres an unconfrontability between two counterpostulates its like its like you belong to the greek army and you were having lot of fun knocking off persians and you got exteriorized in battle and so on getting your mockup knocked off so you picked yourself up persian see i say you picked up persian you kind of marched off with the persian hordes you know and you picked up somebody in persia and then they all of sudden say well those damn greeks are coming over the line and we and youre conscripted and youre part of his majestys dariuss cavalry or something and there you are you see and youre looking at all these greeks this gets to be an interesting problem you should be on the greek forces but youre not the confusion to the greek forces is the persian forces you see but youre in the persian forces and confusion to the persian forces is the greek forces theres only one answer to that go take up lecture circuit on the subject of peace because you will land halfway in the middle of the battleground see you cant be greek and fight the persians and you cant be persian and fight the greeks unconfrontable both of them are wrong well you run pc whos in this situation and you find out he was persian before he became greek it wasnt the other way to see he was persian before he became greek and then he again became persian and youve got that all solved and you say well that was the answer and that was the problem and then you find out actually he was an egyptian you see fighting the persians and then exteriorized into the persians thats how he got there and you say well weve got that one now weve finally sorted that out and the pc will tell you hes got that all sorted now and then you find out he was persian before he was an egyptian you see and they keep running this way on the track and pc as he runs this actually will tend to come up with some interesting solutions you find him sitting there and all of sudden hell have very interesting solution its solution to what well he wont be quite sure but its an awfully interesting solution and hes more than thought of it and it becomes terrible problem to him well itd be awful to put that into effect you know well ive just decided to go to the movies he says ive just decided to go to the movies and the finest thing i could do is go to the movies and were all set and so forth get your hat and coat here we go to the movies oh to hell with it ive seen the picture before where are you going what are you doing with your hat and coat see you say this guy is nuts this guy isnt nuts this guy had solution he was feeling bored that evening and so he solved being bored that evening by going to the movies and then on little threeminute fourminute fiveminute comm lag why he of course does the other flip and solving it was dangerous so going to the movies is boring proposition see he was bored so he solved boredom by doing something interesting but then the interesting thing he decided to do all of sudden qedandaed and flashed back on him and hes bored with it you get lot of people that go out and buy mercedes or something you see and they more than stick the keys in the ignition than they instantly are bored with the mercedes you see just do that bang just like that and they say i dont know whats wrong with i dont know whats the matter with what is the matter something fantastic is wrong i its not they got the mercedes because they were bored see the mercedes is solution to boredom well the mercedes is not solution to the boredom the mercedes is mercedes look one over if you dont believe and thats it you see but if they havent examined this and they dont even look at the mercedes and havent even looked at the mercedes at all and they were bored so they bought mercedes they step into the mercedes put the keys in the lock and theyre bored see the problem is the solution you see and the cure becomes the and then they dont know which they are and naturally you can do fantastic things by getting them out and having them touch the mercedes you know touch the fenders and the wheel and so forth and they say what do you know its mercedes it isnt solution to boredom and then they become interested in the fact that they have mercedes and you would do this by touch otherwise they will never confront the mercedes because they cant confront the boredom now you see why touch assists and familiarity and that sort of thing work out so easily so you have 1a as i say its got lot of rationale behind it and it looks very innocent and it looks very simple and so forth the things you must do in it dont overrun the thing beyond the security check point when i say hour for hour i dont mean one hour on this process and one hour on the security check i mean if you happen to run 1212 hours of recall problem or cchs then it looks to like youve got to put in about 1212 hours on security checks you got the idea we dont care when its done you flatten the cchs you bring them up to flat point and you say well we can let that rest for little while now you do security check for while and when the person seems to be kind of wound up on the security check whether it was one page or ten you say well we can leave that alone for while and well do some cchs you see you kind of run them flat well similarly youd run the motion out of the tone arm on recall problem and the motion is momentarily flat and so we at once move over into doing security check and the person seems to be cooled off and the needle seems to be doing better now and life seems to be little bit easier on the thing go back to this problem because the problems will kick withholds into views and the withholds will kick problems into view see the things operate one against the other very well and thats routine 1a and i advocate routine on 1a on people that arent making any very rapid progress on cch the progress is rather slow on cchs and we say well what were doing is trying to solve the problem with control communication and havingness and we probably could get there all right but lets make this person directly asis some problems before we go on you see youd run routine 1a until things looked bit better and the pc was making changes and gains and you were getting more and better tone arm action and looser needle i dont care whether thats an intensive or two intensives or what or five hours it doesnt matter its just as long as you attain some kind of goal looks like the pc can change better why you could go back to routine 1 or you could go to routine 2 okay but routine 1a is culmination of many years of investigation of this particular goofy factor called problem and its well worth noting that the solution to problem is problem that is the solution to the problem and when pc is being problem then youd better get him to look at and asis some problems some problems because it isnt ever one problem case never has one problem case does have one goal case does have one terminal but case never has one problem so you try to run pt problem flat and youre going to find yourself with another problem havent you ever noticed that and then you run that problem flat and youll find yourself with another problem they can just go on this way ad nauseam endlessly now also routine 1a would be something you would resort to if the pc keeps coming into session with present time problems by the time youve run three or four matter what else youre doing with this pc by the time youve run three or four sessions on the pc and every one has got tremendous fantastic and overwhelming present time problems and they take up an awful lot of session it just seems like we just have an unlimited supply of present time problems to view youve got routine 1a as the best fastest method of getting this case on the road okay all right i wish you good luck with that one thank you
