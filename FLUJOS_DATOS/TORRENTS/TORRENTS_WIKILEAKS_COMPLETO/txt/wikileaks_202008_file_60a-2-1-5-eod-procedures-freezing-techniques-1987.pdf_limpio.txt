introduction11 purpose and scope this manual provides the description modificationassembly procedures and maintenance for the freezing technique twomethods of applying the freezing technique injection and hand are described herein 12 general the technique employs standard hardware items and requires the application of carbon dioxide fig 5 snow or dry ice and alcohol in the form ofslush both methods effectively cool ordnance to prolong the functioning time ofchemical action fuzes and reduce the potential of electric batteries but may causemetal fatigue in springs and small parts and may break seals and plasticsfor official use only for official use onlysection 2 description 21 general all of the components and material required to accomplish both methods of the technique are available through the supply system and are designed tobe modifiedassembled in the field as required table 1 lists these components andmaterials 22 modificationassemblypreparation injection method preparation involves the modification of standard 15pound fig5 fire extinguisher and the fabrication of slush sleeve it is recommendedthat preparation be accomplished well in advance of the requirement for use 1 reinforce the fiber horn of the standard 15pound fig 5 fire extinguisher by placing piece of hanger strap around the hornapproximately 350 inches forward of the handle attach the strap with abolt and nut figure 1 2 drill hole through the strap and the horn to accept the small threaded end of the adapter 3 fabricate an alcohol tank by drilling hole in the side of metal container2pint can to accept the small threaded end of the adapter 4 attach an adapter to both sides of the valve use pipesealing tape to seal the connection 5 install the valve inlet side through the hole in the side of the metal container and attach with locknut use fiber or rubber washer betweenthe locknut and inside and outside of the container 6 remove the strap from around the horn and attach the alcohol tank and valve assembly by inserting the adapter into the hole drilled throughthe strap and secure with locknut 7 insert the remaining end of the adapter into the hole drilled in the horn and attach the complete assembly to the horn with the hanger strap 8 to prepare slush sleeve for large ordnance select piece of canvas or strong cloth approximately 6feet square line the canvas with threelayers of plastic plastic bags and attach the plastic to the canvas locatethe approximate center of the canvas and cut 4inch diameter opening6inches from the center through the canvas and plastic this opening willreceive the modified extinguisher horn 9 to prepare slush sleeve for small ordnance use sandbag lined with three plastic bags cut 4inch diameter hole for the fig 5extinguisher horn approximately 60 inches from the bottom of the bagfor official use only for official use onlyb hand method the hand freezing method requires special modificationpreparation of equipment or material other than the attachment ofthree layers of plastic to piece of canvas for slush sleeve section 3 procedureswarning do not eject fig 5 in confined areas large amounts of fig 5 can cause oxygen depletion 31 injection method this is the preferred method when 1 materials necessary for the preparation of the modified horn alcohol tank and valve assembly are available and have been assembled 2 the ordnance has small hardtoreach areas that the pressureinjected slush would reach this method is particularly suited to asituation which required the ordnance to be transported to safe disposal area place the slush sleeve around the fuzed end of the ordnance figure 2 so that the center of the slush sleeve covers the end of the fuze leaveenough space for injection of slush the opening for the horn should beover the fuze body b secure the sleeve to the ordnance with piece of line ensuring watertight seal note if the fuze will not permit forced injection the slush can be injected into plastic lined sandbags the bags of slush can then be applied to the ordnance and formed tothe desired shape to cool the fuze for transverse fuzes sandbags filled with slushmay be packed over the area of the fuze warning wears gloves and face shield when preparing or using the fig 5alcohol slush body tissues could be damaged if the slush is allowed to contact the body or skin c insert the modified horn of the extinguisher into the opening in the slush sleeve figure 3 d close the alcohol tank valve and fill the tank with approximately 2 pints of methyl alcohol open the valve to the alcohol tank and begin exhausting the extinguisher into the slush sleeve continue until both the alcohol and fig5 are exhaustedfor official use only for official use onlynote when the valve to the alcohol tank is fully opened the alcohol should mix with the contents of one 15pound fig 5 extinguisher dense fog appearing in the alcoholtank during injection indicates that the horn is clogged with fig 5 snow if cloggingoccurs turn off the valve and stop exhausting the extinguisher move the horn to avacant spot in the slush sleeve and rap the horn with stick to clear it of fig 5snow when the horn has been cleared begin dispensing alcohol and exhausting fig5 f transfer the modified horn from the exhausted fig 5 bottle to charged fig 5bottle g continue to exhaust extinguishers into the slush sleeve using 2 pints of alcohol per 15pound extinguisher until the sleeve is full of slush ensurethat the slush is in full contact with the ordnancefuze h inject minimum of four 15pound fig 5 extinguishers with alcohol add additional alcohol if necessary to form thin watery slush i apply the freezing technique for at least 30 minutes from initial application and until the fuze rsp can be performed note for extended freezing more than 1 hour additional fig 5 and alcohol may be required 32 hand method this is the preferred method when 1 the ordnance has large fins or other obstructing external fittings making the injection method impossible but could have the slush packed by hand on theordnance in the critical areas 2 the ordnance is in relatively inaccessible position this method is more convenient when modified extinguishers horn is unavailable the hand methodallows easier access to the fuze after freezing is completed note the modified horn alcohol tank and valve assembly are not required for this method using heavy canvas or other suitable material lined with three layers of plastic form dam around the fuzed end of the ordnance b attach the dam to the ordnance with piece of line ensuring watertight seal figure 4for official use only for official use onlywarning wear gloves and faces shield when preparing or using the fig 5alcohol slush body tissues could be damaged if the slush is allowed to contact the eyes or skin c place the nozzle of 15pound fig 5 fire extinguisher in 2 12gallon pailcover the pail and nozzle with piece of canvas or cardboard and discharge thecontents of the fire extinguisher into the pail d mix approximately 2 pints or enough methyl alcohol with the fig 5 snow to form thin watery slush if fig 5 is not available crushed dry ice may be used toform the slush if crushed dry ice is used add it to the alcohol pack the slush in the dam so that the slush is in contact with the fuze and the ordnance add additional alcohol if necessary f continue to prepare and apply the slush to the fuze and ordnance exhausting minimum of four 15pound fig 5 extinguishers g apply the freezing technique for at least 30 minutes from initial application and until the fuze rsp can be performed note for extended freezing more than 1 hour additional fig 5 and alcohol may be required section 4 maintenance 41 general other than keeping all components clean and serviceable there is maintenance or component repair required while in storage weight test andextinguisher seal checks are required for each fig 5 fire extinguishertable 1hfor official use onl for
