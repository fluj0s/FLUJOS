6810c15 class viii tape 19 an evaluation of examination answers and data on standard tech thank you thank you we have come to the end of the trip that sounds very bad in some connotations now you probably want to know what you got wrong on the examination the examination is what processes do you use on the green form well for some reason or another you characters have forgotten that you can have and have issued and have done green forms it is the ordinary qual action now the reason why this was not hit hard in this course is that so many green forms had already been handed out amongst the students that we did not heavily use green forms the best thing you can do with green form is to itsa earlier itsa thats the best thing you can do with it and out of that you could even omit arcu cdei if the guy didnt even know what he was doing on that just itsa earlier itsa do you follow you can run arc breaks with this so an auditor you could train an auditor to use green form rather easily if he could recognize an fn and knew enough to get an earlier incident but green form apparently your answers on green form were very poor now it takes rather skilled auditor to run listing and nulling so you tend to minimize that and you tend to minimize that but when environment reads on green form the proper thing the actual proper thing to call for if your auditor is skilled is remedy b when you get continuous present time overts reading the best thing on that is the listing and nulling question which is actually of the family of s and d questions its one of those very good questions is what are you trying to prevent and that is what you use to handle continuous present time overts now an s and d reads if the person is connected to suppressive person or group and you would do an s and d and the s and d of course is done on wsu an assessment of which s and d is required and if you start doing too many s and ds on case all it does is invalidate the last s and d but you can run one of each kind theres an fn available on w which is withdraw theres an fn available on stop theres an fn available on unmock so therere actually three types of s and ds that can be run you wouldnt even bother much to clarify that but beyond saving that if person has been run on withdraw s and d then it should not he run i dont know if you could get if you realize this but your recall or remember being blank is sort of an s and d all by itself on your lx1 that type of list now theres several of these types of lists by the way just as notation here theres several of these types of lists theyre all handled the same way dont all of sudden believe that they are something brand new and wonderful and strange for instances the money course people are giving all over the place is just one of these llist it would be handled exactly the same way run the motivator engram run the overt engram and the thing would be in actual fact just those things associated with money and itd simply be list of these things associated with money gives the person prepared list its already prepared its issued its not changed not added to and its simply assessed and you do recall or remember and so forth on that just filling you in on little bit of data here the lists have not at this moment been prepared and as result i didnt give them to you but your lx1 your lx1 is simply the pattern that is the pattern the other pattern the lx1 is the pattern by which you run recall get an fn run motivator chain of engrams or secondaries get an fn you can get an fn from secondaries and youd get an fn from engrams overts secondaries you can get an fn for overts secondaries you can get an overt for fn engrams and that is one pattern another pattern of action is you assess this little prepared list very simple little list and you can do for something like auditing or something like that you can do the l1 on the result of this little prepared list or you can prep check it these are all of family of actions they actually can be addressed to anything i just saw about i dont know must be twenty page auditing report on prep check of what you have been going over called you know they make list like auditing auditors you know so and so so and so that little list and then prep check it and that little list all by its little lonesome produced twenty pages worth of session on case that has been kind of nocase gain case and all that sort of thing but thats all by itself you see now actually you can prepcheck floating needles you can do all that sort of thing but this is all outside the zone of green form you dont discover these things on green form these are the things which case supervisor adds up as necessary on the case and he puts the thing together now when you send somebody over for green form over to qual your ordinary action would be something on the order of omit lists you havent got any security in your auditing your lists and theyve done too damn many lists already so just omit lists do the green form itsa earlier itsa and youll just be surprised what these characters can run into on this so you apparently forgot the green form and that is quals chief weapon now one of the things about the green form is people mustnt send people to qual to get disagreements check to get sec check to get bop bop bop bow bow people cannot dictate what happens in qual except the case supervisor do you see so that executives throughout an organization can send their staff in for anything they please as long as it isnt done this also follows on into the field of the arc break registrar its very unfortunate that it is known as the arc break registrar because what they ought to be doing on those people is green form and what they ought to be using is itsa earlier itsa thats all they ought to be doing on the whole arc break program the arc break registrar the arc break auditor thats all they ought to be specializing in because its very safe very safe and if you omit lists off of it youve got an unlimited run it really doesnt matter how often or how long you go on this sort of thing but i didnt issue these green forms to you for the reason that anybody can do green form its very simple ive taught you some very standard actions now remember when youve been putting in the ruds exactly the same action you use in putting in the ruds is what you use in handling green form except it ceases to be what is just in the rudiments and it becomes the whole green form goes that way now this has you had another one here what does setting up case mean and apparently you missed this left right and center and some of you undoubtedly got it but it was common miss it was question 246 you fly the ruds or green form to fn before starting major action and brother you better remember that cause if you missed that on the examination man wow youre going to have trouble we had somebody just day or two ago in auditing do the unforgivable thing the guy had somatic so they thought theyd put the full four rundown through theyre gonna handle lousy little pt somatic with full four rundown why that somatic ought to have been handled and everything ought to have been handled on the case they guy was set up to go dont you see and so setting up case is you fly the ruds or green form to fn before starting major action and that you wouldnt attempt any major action on case dont attempt major action on case that apparently has something wrong with it handle whatever is wrong with it before you attempt major action and if i can give you that the casell fly youre handling guy who is dead in his head or stuck here on earth or something like this the major actions of case are to fly this thetan i dont know i might even go so far as to have somebody who is having consistent tonsillitis and lumbosis and bogwoggus and that sort of thing make him get himself straightened out medically before id touch him yeah the case is obviously going to get audited with all the grades to cure his god damn tonsillitis now the difference of viewpoint is is you really shouldnt give damn what shape the body is in as long as it does not deter the pc from flying so your ruds and your little green forms and your actions of this character and how you set these cases up you set the case up before you attempt major action and youre going to have terrific wins because the major action is for something else its to fly the guy not to handle his ingrown toenails do you see that so im clarifying it here because it possibly wasnt clear question number 247 how do you set up case there is consistency on this there some said just ruds some didnt mention fn hardly any mentioned green form others went into more complex action of setting up case such as running engram chains and that sort of thing but you set up case with ruds or green form to fn or list 1 or list 4 but you set up the case somehow see you can you can go into more complex actions yes thats very true you can run engram chains you can do this you can do that and the other thing see but where you havent set up the case you throw away the major action and when youve thrown away the major action youve got place to go so you set up the case you dont run somebody with constant persistent present time problem on major action like grades dont say well itll all be handled when we do problems bunk problems are addressed more or less to the whole track i had somebody the other day had somebody the other day run on the grades and all that handled was her present time problems as messenger see that was flunk thats throw away of the whole line of grades because in actual fact the present time problem wasnt really straightened out on the case you want this person to look at life see we want him to look all around and we want him examine his track and we want him to fly on this stuff so this this youve got to get because its the very guts of modern auditing alright and question 250 is explain the mechanism of release and at which point you get an fn the fn occurs when the pc disconnects from the mass thats release when he disconnects from the mass thats release oddly enough it translates through to the person that when he for instance was in prison and they let him out thatll read as release too which is perfectly ok cause it was release from the mass do you understand but its release from the mass and the comment here on the case these not my comments but the people who corrected the examinations quite few amazingly had this wrong and for some reason had it confused with other thetan pictures and some even said its when you create the mass i wouldnt know how you got that wrong if its too the trouble with it is its too damn simple its too simple thats whats wrong its actually almost impossible to complicate the answer so ill give you the answer very bluntly here is mass when you take the thetan out of it its release when you erase the mass and leave the thetan there its an erasure and there is other complexity to it pleased thats all there is thats all there is there isnt any other complexity to it whatsoever ill go over it again theres mass any old damn mass mental mass prison cat fights alright the mass alright heres thetan hes stuck in this thing see and hes saying im not happy i get yowl all the time you know i yowl i keep seeing these bars in front of my face yap yap yap yap yap complain complain complain complain complain why is he complaining cause hes stuck in mass hes out of time hes in mass and so forth you come along you audit him you go poof do you see this oddly enough will drop out of sight and hell say whee thats release alright now weve got another action and here he is stuck in prison hes really stuck 199 years to go and we come along and we erase this the engram hes stuck in the mass hes stuck in we get it asised it doesnt disappear its gone gone it aint never gonna come back more and thats an erasure only two actions he gets out of the car or you scrub the car thats all there is to it you try to make anything else out of it and boy you gonna go around in circles sure we know he makes up the mass sure we know all kinds of complications sure we know that the mechanics of electricity show that ohms volts often resist yes we could probably fix up slide rules that would tell us the exact density of the release hes stuck on and i imagine somewhere up the track if i dont keep my eye on it some damn fool will do this but thats all there is to it he gets out of the car or you erase the car in either way hes rid of the car but if he just gets out of the car hes still got car somewhere if you erase the car he isnt ever gonna have any more trouble with that car because its gone we dont care that he mocked up the car in the first place he usually hasnt found this out and very often hes so disowned something he has mocked up that it appears to be something somebody else mocked up and sometimes it is something somebody else mocked up who is right there that moment looking down his throat but we dont care what the hell i dont know why you worry about where the hell the mass came from at the stage of defining release who cares where the mass came from it is and you can take him out of it or you can erase it you got it brother thats all there is to it wow wow wow now you could exteriorize and get him out of the body and then you can get complexities like that you can exteriorize him and get him out of the body only he took the mass with him so he complains that it really wasnt release cause he didnt think he was stuck in the body he thought he was stuck in some mass its what he thinks hes stuck in it isnt his idea hes really stuck in it like like fly paper but you can do those two actions and theyre entirely different now heres another one what is the matter and how do you handle someone who found none on three and i got one on you guys you never checked out on your study materials at an ao on 3 you never did you never did and by god from the lesson ive had here you know what im gonna do dey gonna give star rate checkouts before dey ever get 3 and thats going on right now going on right now that was telexed to them yesterday they study it and study it and study it and they can call it name rank serial number everything else whether they can confront it or not we dont give damn and then we fly the ruds and let them go at 3 and of course when they fly the ruds they go fn they say its all gone we say very good its all gone thats great you didnt find any oh i never had any im peculiar im one of those people whose feet never stick i was actually born in the universe as free being and i am still free being this stuff crawling on is simply rumor and at that moment we will fly rud run incident ii capture to pilot find some engram incident is and run them and the funny part of it is is you know sometimes this happened it sometimes has happened that after weve done this once or twice the guy all of sudden wakes up and he says hey you know theres lot of these hahaheheeheehoo we say heres your study materials and your pack again guess you go back to the old salt mines boy you understand now were not trying to invalidate his 3 were not trying to get him to audit 3 forever or anything like that but he ought to be reasonable clear of fleas so we dont have to use through the following ot sections flea powder on him every few minutes and the reason for ot section failure is failure not to audit 3 but failure to check out the materials of 3 the most abysmal ignorance you ever heard of seems to exist on this subject i dont know why maybe body thetan reads it laughter so youre going to find lot of these cats and the thing to do is to pat them on the back and say cheers and not evaluate for him and tell him its an unflat 3 throw him into session run an incident ii capture to pilot run him back run some incident is and then they either dont have any more or they do see its an open and shut proposition if you cant clear it up in review session theyve got more if you can clear it up in review session thats it do you follow and theyre going to have to do it all over again at 7 anyhow it isnt that they departed its that theres other phenomenon of case at 7 almost as startling as that of 3 and if you make them go back and audit 3 too often and too many times and so on youll start running into phenomena of 7 and then the guy sort of gets plowed in and doesnt know where the hell hes going or coming boy and he can really get chewed in but the way youd straighten it out is just take the repair actions which youve been taught on this course you could do an assessment of them and ba ba ba body thetans and sessions and invalidations and solo auditing and bowwow and examiners and review and auditors and so forth and i dont care run it on l1 prepcheck it whatever you want to do with it you could straighten him out do you understand if he overruns 3 theres another trick i think ive told you that already you can overrun body thetan on 3 so itll then read as an overrun 3 well the answer to that is always who who overran 3 whos overrun on 3 and youll get all of sudden we had one case who had apparently run 3 and in great thoroughness had overrun and arc broken every body thetan he had actually it didnt take more than about half an hour review session or something like this to clean him up both ways from the middle and he was getting more blowing off than you could count because thats ail we were picking up you know overrun arc broke overrun arc broke overrun arc broke overrun arc broke and it was running overrun fn arc break overrun fn fn overrun fn he looked like somebodyd left open the gate of menagerie but the guy really started to fly so you can set em up you can set em up it doesnt matter they can also do gorgeous job of plowing themselves in on this but we can pick them out of it so so what also the larger majority of it when they do study the study materials and they do audit go clear as bell you hit them on the left ear and they ring for half an hour and of course the trick of it all is is after youve done the clearing course the guy usually goes free of the body thetans so he parks them all over in left field he is clear do you see but his environment isnt so therefore he often goes clear has ball thinks that life is wonderful and suddenly falls on his head again and cant understand it actually what hes done is run in some body thetans the reason why you discharge it on 2 is so the body thetans wont be so charged up they can spin him when they hit 3 and if the guys fixed up 2 and discharged the thing bit on 2 when he hits 3 he wont spin if you were to take somebody who was wag right straight off the street run incident 2 not as the capture but just run incident 2 just the volcano and let him walk off youd probably have dead man on your hands within five or six days and the way were getting away with it is fantastic but let point out that its were getting away with it because once they start to freewheel through this stuff they cant sleep they cant eat and theyre finished the body dies for lack of rest and so on because the incident itself is set up to do just that so its nothing to play with isnt it interesting that we havent had it happen well its an attestation of modern auditing and the preparation of cases and the way it doesnt happen is to get the bank discharged bit show the guy what to do and it doesnt happen its really remarkable also weve already pointed out the bypassed charge if he didnt know about incident 1 and nobody pointed out the fact that there was an earlier incident 1 and he ran the volcano he would spin for sure but the mere fact that he knows theres an earlier incident 1 and i dont know how it got removed from the materials because there was doubt of it in the original material release incident 1 is way earlier and you point out the fact that incident 1 exists and that all by itself tends to discharge 2 so it cant wrap somebody around telegraph pole and thats why it isnt happening im just telling you the other phenomena could happen however you dont he doesnt study the materials never reads the materials hes never been audited hes never come up through the grades and some how or another we force him back and run volcano just that only we erase the volcano and let him freewheel well the whole bank freewheels all thetans in coordination do beautiful freewheel straight through r6 and hell freewheel for days and days by freewheel i mean its automatic run it must starts and it keeps going do you see basically thats why the materials are confidential so just that wont happen to somebody thats why we say the case should be prepared well prepared he should be run up through the grades thats why we say he takes ot 3 when hes supposed to take ot 3 thats why the guy when he runs ot 3 should run the study materials of ot 3 he should know them and casualties will occur its something on the order of you take and put knife through the right hand tire of car while its doing sixty miles an hour itll go off the road well thats stupid thing to do isnt it thatd be very stupid thing to do well so you dont do that to somebody now i dont know if you knew or not that there was any liability to 3 but there is that liability to 3 that it is prematurely run and so on now the material is somewhat self protecting because very often somebody gets hold of the ot section materials and we have had that happen and they looked at it and said whats this got to do with it doesnt have anything to do with and so forth there isnt any picture on it theres realitv on that and they walk off and leave it and they dont even know they got their hands on anything in other words its so far beyond their reality that they dont even contact it which is quite remarkable additionally supposing somebody came along to get the materials didnt run any of the materials and then all of sudden accidentally ran piece of 3 there he would go but he would have done himself in with his own lies well the materials to that degree is self protecting i imagine some psychiatrist who got hold of it would decide to test it out on some patient hed probably go mad far quicker than the patient alright but the answer to the question what is the matter and how do you handle someone who found none on 3 he had severe physical injury and got them all packed together and run it like an engram its the melazzo actually the majority of you got this wrong some said you check it and run the grades and others that you unburden the case with lx1 assessments and prepchecks and so forth the guy who found none on 3 has been packaged by severe injury and what you do is run the engram of the severe injury and then blow some of them off the cluster and then you can run some incident 1s or you can run an incident 2 and then some incident 1s do you see but the mechanism of the cluster is what you havent understood supposing you had twenty gum balls and they all rolled around independently of each other just great now these twenty gum balls are somewhat loosely heaped up and somebody hits them with sledge hammer now can you tell one gumball from another gumball but if you run the engram of being hit with sledge hammer then they get separate again you get the mechanism and thats the basic mechanism by which you handle one of these none on 3s its just one of these simple things like release see heres whole bunch of body thetans all piled up around this bird and somebody comes along with baseball bat and hits the lot and they go squash and now they cant tell the difference between one or another and each one has different viewpoint of being squashed and so the thing doesnt asis and theyre all tangled up and that usually puts each one of them in different position of the back track in addition to the squash its mess man so you just run the engram of the squash they all come apart and run individually and thats the melazzo and that is what you do with none on 3 hes had severe injury now it may be whole chain of injuries before you suddenly get release but the top one was the cluster even though is didnt erase you at least got the thing that disconnected it do you follow funny part of it is you can do that two or three times if you ever ran into cluster of person who had been electric shocked violently electric shocked its liable to come off piece meal as cluster you know it isnt pc but some electric shock case having kicked the bucket under the gentle ministrations of what they laughingly call the butchers alright that character goes out as one piece dont you see and he sort of flies around and then he hits somebody thats cluster there be pressure on the body now the preclear wont be part of this cluster itll simply be hitting him so the thing you do is youve still got to find mutual engram of the cluster and then the pc may be very confused because hes never had that experience well thats right but its still just the mutual engram of the cluster and then you run the incident 1s out of it and it all goes sssssl its very easy operation if you know the mechanics of the thing so if youre ever puzzled about this remember hitting pile of gumballs with sledge hammer and then figure out how you would fix that up and thats all there is to it once more youre making too much out of it simple elementary alright now the next one is what do you know when you ret read on overrun on 3 well theres been one incident number an incident 1 overrun on somebody or something but it doesnt mean 3s overrun it means somebody has been overrun on an engram in 3 got it alright and most of you said to handle it like an overrun boy youd go mad trying to handle it as an overrun somebodys got to find what who which has been overrun therefore its very peculiar overrun dont you see if somebody people whove run the thing verbally go back to the beginning of the incident see theyve said this half dozen times the thing is already erased the thetan parks back at the beginning of the incident but there aint anything there and so he stays there in confusion what am i supposed to do here what am i supposed to do here what am i supposed to do here what am i supposed to do here you catch him month or two later and all you do is indicate the fact that hes overrun it and he goes thump what do you know sssst gone see its one of these damn fool foolishnesses see everybody knows the mind is so complicated that nobody could possibly figure any of these things out truth of the matter is theyre so buried under complexity that theyve been very hard to dig up but once theyre dug up boy they look as plain as dogs bone on the lawn and then you come along and you say see that over there thats dogs bone its just been dug up and people say now lets see is it the bone of cow its irrelevant it doesnt matter what its bone of alright here was question 270 should you find out what the ta is up on before you get it down mostly said yes should you find out what the ta is up on before you get it down not necessarily not necessarily at all you can simply ask the guy what has been overrun it very ordinarily comes down do you follow im afraid that was one of these trick questions one of these sneaky questions but if you first try to find out what it was up on before you did something to get it down you would very often miss this is one of these wild questions the ta that starts going up dont you ever as an auditor sit there and watch ta go up you indicate ask if somethings been overrun pc cant find anything come down you start messing around with it at that particular point and youre liable to be in severe trouble right in the middle of session he cant answer the question he doesnt know whats been overrun thats not been overrun you shoot at it couple of times and it doesnt come down you had better instruct any auditor auditing for you to pack it up and ask for cs dont go on with the thing going up and dont get in fire fight over the pc trying to get it down similarly low ta dont do that in the middle of session all of sudden the guys ta goes low dont start bugging him dont start chopping him up about it because hell get frantic thats why pcs should never be able to see the ta never he starts getting frantic youve entered present time problem into this thing and you know very well by the mechanics of it the person who has present time problem he doesnt make any case gain well lets look at it now the guy knows hes got his ta high or he knows hes got his ta low he now has present time problem right the weird part of it is youre not going to solve it your chances of setting the ta down at that moment are zero thats how you get into these fire fights cause the guys now got present time problem if youre going to ask him anything do you have present time problem yes i have present time problem i have ta thats high well good thank you very much youll watch the ta come down you see its idiocy but if the guys ta is starting to rise and you cant immediately go back and say hey wait minute it goes back to here and rehab it right now pack it up dont just sit there and fool with it ta which inexplicably goes up when it shouldnt be going up usually forecasts itself long time before youll see this persons ta acts up suddenly why actually the thing i would do on it is i wouldnt fool around with ta that suddenly inexplicably goes up the auditor tried to rehab say did i bypass an fn so forth and yip yip and so on was something been overrun and the ta keeps going up oh brother unload unload knock it right off right there pack it up and say thank you very much and send it send the thing for cs or make somebody send it to you for cs what you normally order what you normally order that is the most successful is seven special cases something has appeared on this case that wasnt here before and youre liable to get the most astonishing result out of this and once you do that wham wham wham wham now dont in session try to cs it at the same time ive tried to keep you from doing that but if you cant immediately spot hey wait minute i bypassed an fn on you you should see it right in front of you you say what the hell was the matter with i mean there it was he got an fn on clearing the command and i thought he was still fning on the last process and obviously he fned on clearing the command and i missed it the tall go flow boom fn see nothing to it but if that doesnt happen and it doesnt clear it and so on then you had better do an assessment and every other damn thing those are the proper actions for handling high ta or low ta but if the guys ta is going low and hes getting arc break needles with the ta down at 15 and all of this sort of thing and oh wow wow wow you can get into an awful fire fight with pc under that one too and the best thing to do if you dont immediately rehabilitate it wham wham wham and its quite obvious what this thing was all about in the first place it isnt gonna do him bit of harm running with low ta cause itll come right back up again usually low tall come right back up again theres case after case around that every time you ask them question the ta goes down to 17 and then as they answer it it goes back up to 2 so why get why get all sweated us about it but he goes down to 15 and has an fn well thats for sure an arc break so that you can check that out easily enough you can check it out now but if its getting difficult to check out pack it up get another cs get back off of this thing and take look at it and see whats wrong with this case all of sudden all will meet the eye youre busy processing somebody who is so pts it is pathetic the whole behavior of the case is this you start tracing back through other arc breaks the persons had its always an arc break with mother or its an arc break with something or its an arc break with wuf wuf wuf and each time they have this arc break the ta is sunk persons pts as hell this is the time to run an s and d something of that sort hes pts you know that low ta equals invalidation high ta equals overrun theres nothing more simple than that do you follow alright now whether you know it the thetan starts to spin on incident 1 well he doesnt spin on incident 1 really in the first place but he has run an incident that should be what do you know if the thetan starts to spin on section 3 and so forth or something he normally has run 1 on one thetan and 2 on another thetan so thats hes got 2 which has been run without its 1 and its when you run 2 without its 1 that the guy spins yet people will do this every now and then they run they will run on this one and 1 on joe and 2 on pete now pete starts to freewheel so all you have to ask is when did you run the incident 2 something like that and alright then get the same thetan down and run an incident 1 and he unspins just like that magical right now thats all thatts wrong do you follow some said not enough food and rest and other said the case was overcharged both of which are probably true but the actual action is hes run usually run an incident 1 on one thetan an incident 2 on another thetan and youve got an incident 2 run now with the thetan going through the thirty six days all on big freewheel and maybe whole cluster started through it and the thing to do is to whip it back and get the 1 run on the guys who are going through 2 and you get the incident 1 run itll unspin just like that theres nothing to it alright explain the mechanics of lx1 its the basic postulate he made to move off the track the mechanics of lx1 is simply he couldnt stand it anymore so he decided he had been wiped out driven off over powered overwhelmed whatever the words are of lx1 and hes moved off the track and hes not now in his own valence and by running recall you discharge the top of the engram and you can run the engram out to then and he will get back in his own valence and he can stay in his own valence as long as the case is very badly over charged hes not likely to stay in his own valence some two or three people by the way believe implicitly for some reason or other i dont know why but some two or three people believe that if youd run lx1 you omitted the valence shifter on the full four rundown and i dont know how anybody would figure that out because the full four rundown doesnt have anything to do with lx1 and one case that had had the valence shifter left out of the full four rundown had lot of trouble at once so its not something that you would leave out theres probably fifty ways you could handle the guy out of valence well the first way that was ever written about is in dianetics the modern science of mental health it says get into your own valence theres was after way you can handle it but the case is so over charged he cant stay in his own valence so you have to discharge the case so anyway case can be discharged will eventually get him back into his own valence but the full four rundown flips him out of the valence as body thetan and gets him into his own valence so that you can run confront on him if you run the full four you recall the being you run the motivator chain you run the engramovert chain those are the actions you take and that is the only actions which you take you actually could prepcheck it or something but it seems silly to prepcheck it because its too hot button and that isnt whats wrong with him ok actually i think you did most remarkably well and i have noticed i have noticed that anybody who can pass long examination with high grade normally knows what hes doing now there are few more points id like to make here before while i still have chance to explain them to you now one at this juncture it will be available to you i have been working too hard with you and so on to actually put together your book of case supervision and what you lack is why certain things are done here and there and i havent explained that in all things it seems sort of mysterious and its funny to to have to explain it because it sort of feels to like im explaining why lead pencil makes mark you know here is this bird and he has its so damn simple some of these things you see hes got folder six inches thick well now look if that many auditors had worked on him for that long and he is still getting audited the case is overcharged thats very clever analysis isnt it thick folder so were going to undertake lot of actions to take charge off the case because its all on the basis that reality is proportonal to the amount of charge off it alright but its that kind of think that kind of think and you wonder actually cs 7 was saying to the other day on one case here god that was clever to prepcheck floating needle look what it did for that case how on earth did you ever guess that cause it just says prepcheck floating needle see bong you know assessment nothing bang you know and prepcheck it and wow it goes on and on and on and on and on and its all straightened out and the case does beautifully im afraid i cant take too much credit for it because the guy has complained to his auditor about floating needles and he has even said that every time he gets floating needle he feels horrible hes complained to the examiner about floating needle not not very mysterious so i just looked at this and read it over and so forth and i was reading through it to find where i could straighten this case out little bit more and i ordered three prepchecks on it and the first one to prep check floating needles naturally you see so youre not very mysterious its sort of like asking to explain why is that white sign white what color paint do we use to paint white sign and i look sort of blank and i say well alright white paint great i never would have guessed it you know alright so this guy this guy its reading the folder its reading the folder its reading whats going on thats why auditors have to be able to write and if you want to keep yourself from getting headaches as case supervisor you should insist like hell that auditors either clarify what theyve written or write plainly because otherwise you can pick up case you know trying to make the damn thing out and you want to help the guy and somebodys standing in your road with horrible scribble and and you get strained up on it boom but you look through this thing and you say well i dont find my wife and so on but in the next session wa wa wa wa gab gab and my wife and so on aw for christs sakes theres mystery about it the guy keeps getting off the same withhold and he keeps getting off the same ptps and so forth and in setting up the case lets just make sure that these things get cleaned up thats all they obviously arent getting cleaned up one of the ways and the ways the idiot way they dont get cleaned up is the guy has withhold and he gives it as an arc break the guy has ptp and he gives it as missed withhold so im likely to be as evaluative as this prepcheck the missed withholds he keeps giving them as arc breaks and ptps and theyre very obvious its guesswork on my part i mean they are see an arc break i dont know how im going to pay for oh god christ thats not an arc break never has never will be and yet somebodys running arcu cdei and then they run this column after column and page after page and arcu cdei and do you have an arc break and heres big fall and then they clean up false and the guy never does give them anything under gods green earth but ptps and then im liable to say fly the ruds but clear each command and the case straightens out you see you cant straighten out case on missed withholds if nobody asks him for anything but arc breaks you see its all this idiot stuff like the way to cross the river you cross the river you know the way to get in the boat is you get in the boat if you want to get the pc someplace in boat you have to have boat to put him in you know its this kind of stuff and the violation of logic is so fantastic as you wouldnt believe it and until youre case supervising you wont believe how easy it is to do its terribly easy very very simple well you cant clean up one rudiment if the guy never doesnt know what the rudiment is and is always cleaning up some other rudiment right you see the case the case is always having trouble with x or something hes always having trouble with this guy hes always having trouble with this guy hes always having trouble with this guy hmm well yes hes at least got problem with him see so you could actually specify ask him about the problem with joe and by earlier similar itsa get rid of it because hes obviously got joe identified with admiral henobarbus back in someplace you know wow its not complicated cases are not complicated when you know this theyre very simple but you have to do the thing youre supposed to do and thats what standard tech becomes for instance the guys got to have his arc break cleaned up hes in sad effect alright hes in sad effect what you gonna do sit there and pull missed withholds well you know very well thats idiotic but its just as idiotic to clear up his missed withholds by running arc breaks or try to clear up his ptps by he keeps saying theyre arc breaks do you see theres some illogic about all this theres something that doesnt add up about all this and all youd have to do is look for what doesnt add up and thats that but i want to make this point with you very sharply and that is the available fns how many fns can you get now youre liable to get yourself problem that runs something like this some weird problem see and it runs something like this former therapy and you run the motivator engram and the guys still got somatic but its fned well it fned well you cant do anything more with that can you still got somatic and you know hes still got somatic of having his guts cut out or whatever they do and he ran the engram of it oh what can we do all is lost theres an available fn on the overt you find and run an overt chain you find out he was making specialty of cutting peoples guts out and thats the somatic and thats why its still there now lets say heres an actual case of somebody who had an incident 2 shot in the brisket run out discharge to fn alright great still sore still got the somatic you say oh wow we failed theres another fn available on shooting people in the brisket so you run the overt side of it and the somatic goes pft magically so you dont do any more work than you have to do if you got rid of it running the motivator side great but if you ran the motivator side and the guys left with somatic you still got an fn on the overt side do you follow now sometimes you run recall being and then you run doing it and youll get rid of both sides very nicely but it sometimes doesnt work and remember youve still got an fn left look at the number of fns available on the recall process any recall process theres an fn available any motivator chain of secondaries theres an fn available any motivator chain of engrams theres an fn available any overt chain of motivators theres an fn available theres an fn available on secondaries overt secondaries theres an fn available on overt engrams and theres an fn available on recall the overt so you got one item assessed off list and what do you know you got six fns available the possibility of running them all on most cases is slight because you try to run the secondary and theyre liable to plunge into the engram but at the very least youve got two you have been given sketchy line up of it because its usually sufficient but look how many are available now weve got assess the item kicked on some list so we could run recall being kicked bang recall being kicked we could also run recall kicking thats two fns now we could run the engrams of being kicked and we could also run the engrams of kicking and thats four fns thats four fns on the same subject its just which way did the flow go so dont feel all is lost if youve run an engram chain to an fn all is not lost youve got the other chain you can run this fellow says well i got this horrible head this horrible head and it doesnt go away and my back hurts and my head hurts and it just doesnt go away and youve run all of his head injuries and his back injuries and well well get clever you get clever you have an engram chain on the other side you can run also to fn which is him hurting peoples heads hurting peoples backs and youve probably got one on heads and youve probably got one on backs do you follow theres lot of fns available but your minimum number of fns on any button is four recall motivator recall overt engram motivator engram overt and if you if its all very sad and misemotional also why youve got two secondaries available recall this death whatever it is see being sad about some relatives death see and you run that thing out and thats all squared around alright did you ever think or running somebody being sad about your death do you see see theres two different things available see and very often when your death engrams or your death secondaries rather wont run its because you know the fellow just lost his uncle and he felt very sad about it and hes griefy and he runs it through and he still feels griery about death and it went to fn but he didnt didnt feel so good and so forth run the secondary run the secondary of somebody feeling bad about his death and all of sudden the whole thing will go zzzt and this is the phenomena now hear now cause every once in while youre going to have gotten an fn on some injury and then have the person complain that it fned before he got rid of it have you ever had that happen it shows up every now and then well it fned on the motivator or it fned on the overt and it hasnt fned on the other side and theres still mass there theyre not they actually if they checked it over theyre not now sad about their uncles death they just know they got this funny griefy feeling stuck on their skull so they say well it fned i think it fned too quick well sure it didnt all disappear well if that side of it fned hes released from that side of it theres two sides to that you know now you can turn around and run the other side whichever way it is and the rest of the mass goes pffft and then that really does fn itll be relatively small fn but if youve ever had somebody complain oh well yes well i fned on it but it really ended off too quick yeah well they had it coming one way and went the other way you pay lot of attention to that cause you know youre running this guy with motivators when hes guilty as of bunch of overts so he fns on the motivators but the overts are still there bugging him but of course theyre all ready to blow theyll blow now go binge you could just run them very briefly and theyd blow but he deserves the motivator dont you see and you ran out the motivator now he hasnt got motivator but hes got the overt so he gets sort of unhappy you got it thats how many fns there are available theoretically therere six fns available on any button you should be able to plot this course off the top of your head theres nothing to it alright now theres another point here which i havent covered with you too well missed withholds missed withholds missed withholds you are always asking for missed withholds and so forth and i very often say missed withholds when i say rudiments but the rudiment is withhold the rudiment is not missed withhold the standard rudiment is withhold not missed withhold but withhold and here and there in your sessions youve missed time or two because you havent used withhold because theres whole line of the whole subject of withhold is absolutely fascinating the whole subject of withhold is miraculous and marvelous guys who go around withholding and guys who have withholds and all of this sort of thing you get so accustomed to thinking that guy is bad off because he has withholds that you dont wonder whv hes bad off because he has withholds well hes bad oft because he has withholds not because hes dishonest but because hes not flowing in certain direction and he cant flow in that direction and he keeps it piled up on himself and you can get the same action now as well you can practically push his face in you can get something that feels very much like body thetans and so forth just because the guy is withholding just that just withholding nobodys missing withhold hes just withholding ill give you an example way back when i was fooling around and doing some research thing i all of sudden found out sitting at breakfast that it was very unpleasant proceeding sitting at breakfast for the excellent reason that the wax type of milk carton which is cold clammy and slimy sitting only three or four feet from if i would become incautious enough to let my perceptivity slide out if that far i would collide with this damned cold slimy milk carton see waxed paper milk carton so id have to eat breakfast held back from this milk carton after while id find myself getting sort of cross and id get up and id be fine and then i suddenly realized maybe other people get up against things and they dont go back out in that direction so i have checked this out and that turned out to be the case thetans withhold they withhold energy they withhold beams they withhold emotion they withhold mass they withhold from going someplace when they shoot somebody they withhold from being him nobody missed it and case can get just gorgeously stacked up because of withholds withhold withhold thus american girls are very often quite withholdy and the reason why is is over in america the girls dont arent taught to shake hands and theyre taught that they must be reached for and never to reach and that its unladylike to reach and that sort of thing criticism of it one way or the other but you will eventually find them sort of and anybody else in the world thats been trained that way you eventually find them sort of caved in and you as an auditor might think theyve committed some fabulous crime whereas its more important than the fact that they must not ever reach in the direction of man or mustnt ever reach in the direction of another person its which directions they mustnt reach and theyre withheld permanently from that area see there they are withholding withholding withholding withholding withholding withholding eventually they squash their noses and now you come along and youre asked to perform some miracle freed from squashing my nose sort of miracle you know now this is very unimportant in the lower grades but when you get up into the ot sections what im telling you now is very very important because you are going to find some guys have nothing more wrong with them than the damn fools keep on holding onto their bodies from in front and that those horrible somatics theyve got that is tearing their knees apart or something like that is simply them pushing on their knees its very mysterious oh what can be wrong with george he seems to have these sore throats all the time well now the guy is up around an honest 5 or something like this and he starts developing sore throat and so on you of course dont audit in this fashion but you could say you know why dont you let go of your throat boy so hell say oh have i got ahold of my throat yes very difficult very difficult the guys get into ot sections they one will withhold from things and they can damn near pull their skulls off or crush their chests or something see or theyve got hold of the body or somebody has offered them something and theyve suddenly tensed back from it and its practically busted their ribs or something and you run into one of them right after hes flinched from something of this sort he walked out of the building and he comes back in and hes all caved in and you say oh my god what masses have we got he must have more body thetans lets see what can we do what wonderful process do we have to run on this bird and the funny part of it is if you use the rudiment withhold particularly as you get up into the upper sections as well as the rudiment missed withhold and the way you do that is you ask for withhold and then determine whether or not its the kind of withhold which is discreditable so somebody would miss it or whether its just plain withhold and youll ask for the missed afterwards or not ask for it but the actual proper rudiment question on ot levels is withhold not missed do you have any missed withholds now ive been watching it go on here for some time and been expecting in vain for some of you to suddenly ask the ordinary garden variety way back when rudiment do you have withholds or are you withholding anything now you start asking ots if theyre withholding anything and fifty percent of their somatics will just go up in smoke see so youre missing one this is the great ease with which some of this stuff works so the guy has just went up and pulled himself back on the curb suddenly so that he couldnt be hit by the taxi cab and he comes in and hes all so on you set in youre getting in the ruds you dont have to know all that see youre getting are you withholding anything and have you withheld anything or something like that and you get little read and he feels wonderful oh yeah taxi cab i got myself back off the curb i withheld yeah thats it whmi because youre dealing with somebody who is already pulling and squashing and grabbing now theoretically you could also ask somebody where you got hold of the body and that would cause it on the ot sections you cant figure out what in the hell is going on add that to your repertoire just do you have hold of the body or are you pushing on the bony in some way if theyre not you wont get any read and if they are the damn meter will blow up you got the point because youre dealing with somebody who holds onto bodies who pulls back bodies who withholds bodies who withholds energy who pulls in energy beams do you follow so that you certainly check this on the upper levels not very important on the lower grades we found out that newspaper reporters were never never never able never never never never able to make little beep meter we had work whereas any anybody who had been audited at all could make the thing connect and spark and short circuit we had little machine wed set it up and we found that newspaper reporters wogs guys off the street theyd look at this thing and theyd try to do it see rather pathetic you know theyd try to do it and nothing happened they couldnt make the thing close actually all you had to do is put spark between it and buzzer went off you can set up two two contacts or hold one contact next to body while the body is also connected to another contact very low voltage and you hold that out from the cheek and then somebody stands off thirty feet and makes beam he puts beam between the cheek and the finger and the buzzer goes and he can turn the buzzer on and off at will its one of the most remarkable experiences you ever saw in your life the lower level guy he couldnt do it and anybody who had been audited at all boy he could make that thing go beeps and off and on and first hed say christ i couldnt be doing that that is not possible and then ding yes that was hey im an electric eel see he could do it he could do it thirty forty fifty feet away as far as he could see it which is very interesting indeed now if guy can do that he also can of course apply close up on his own body the most fantastic amounts of energy actually you can apply him almost at any distance you got that one now also let give you another one that goes along with some ots go around get high ta because they lean on things and if all else fails remember that they also can lean on things they habitually push against wall because rooms are too small and they dont catch themselves doing it and it pushes up their ta they lean on the wall very simple they will do anything that guy would do with current current or force you can expect anybody to do one guy had terrible trouble because he had ringing in his ears and he was ringing them now to show you how far out some things can as there is dictionary which i did not do which is called the scientology dictionary ive never read it it was called to my attention the other day that the definition of recall in it is to reexperience which is completely wrong i merely bring this up as what happens when i start clarifying materials few bulletins few things come out that i havent written i havent said anything about theres some errors creed in those things and it throws technology out this is what youve got to keep an eye out for if you run into this sort of thing why send it through to and let find out whether or not it is factual or not on clarification because youre liable to get in some arguments with somebody on it another datum i wanted to give you is you can do two or three assessments on lx1 and run each one of them with engram chains and recalls and everything else i mean its quite remarkable they move upscale on lx1 theyll get different buttons and you can do the same things with them all over again now we have we have pretty well reached the end of the line here we have pretty well reached the end of the line and we have the general situation pretty well in hand not to pile you up with tremendous amount of data here in the last few minutes of play but i will tell you this that putting through this org viii course as we have called it aboard has been quite tour force it has been called for lot of coordination in lot of ways and i noticed even down in the last few minutes of play that we were still riding close to the edge in some instances and all that got straightened out now i want to talk to you for just few minutes here on the subject of what you will be doing what your difficulties might be first and foremost people are going to ask you what is so different about standard tech that is different from scientology and wise guy sort of answer which is perfectly legitimate is well you see standard tech is the way ron does it that was sort of just you know floor the opposition but the truth of the matter is is standard tech is standardization of processes so that they apply to hundred percent of the cases to which they are addressed and that was the main thing and it was codifying style of auditing which produced maximum results in minimum time and that was what standard tech was and theyre going to say well that therefore invalidates my class iv my class vi and you say oh not not at all not at all but in due course when you have learned all there is to know about everything you can also learn to be totally simple and when you achieve that you have achieved then maximum velocity and maximum gain standard tech is simply how to achieve maximum velocity maximum gain in processing and what are the real importances in processing and how do you set cases up and what do you do with them the truth of the matter is the subject itself was pretty well wrapped up in 1966 but required settling down and it hasnt been until now that i have settled the whole subject down and have begun to take out of the lineup additives which have been put in there that were unnecessary and made it come back and do what is was supposed to do for instance as youve seen even on the ot sections i have taught you how to get something like maximum gain out of the ot sections ive taught you how to get more gain more velocity out of the actions which other people would say well i dont see how thats any different than anything ive been doing i sit down at table i let people talk to while i fiddle with my emeter i dont see how anythings different about that and so forth well ill tell you to whom it will make great deal of difference itll make deal of difference to somebody who has been trying to put across to somebody that his case hasnt been handled and people have gone on not handling it for some time it will make great deal of difference to that person it will also start to make difference to anybody else in the vicinity who is audited by comparison hes been audited one way and he suddenly starts getting audited in highly simple way and he starts making much faster case gains in the same line of direction so in actual fact standard tech for all of the technology or for all of the work which has gone into the simplification of it for all the work of codification of how i got it across to you and so on is more of an experience than an action it is something which is experienced and after youve been at it for while youve either got it or you aint you see its something you experienced now just as the lowest mark on the course was the one who had been audited the least this coordinated he started to catch up undoubtedly in the last couple of days but it took catch up because its something one experiences now i dont want auditors at large across the world to believe that all of their training is invalidated quite the contrary what i believe is that somebody has invalidated their training what were doing is deinvalidating training what they have learned they have learned and then somebody has pushed it aside so they felt that is was not learned and what it required was stabilization and giving one back security of the data and if one had security of data he could then carry on very nicely and very smoothly because with that security of data and with somebody holding him on the square hair line road of it he all of sudden realized that by doing it just this way and using just this data he all of sudden got things to fly which have never been flown before and so therefore the biggest hump in standard tech is the auditor making it work and the auditor having it work on him can he make it work as an auditor does it work on him and so on and out of that of course you get your superlative auditor for instance itd be very difficult to kid about how this worked or that worked or something else worked i know how these things work and anybody who has worked very long in this field with standard tech and hes seen this work and hes seen the put together and hes managed to cut it down to where hes to look at it is totally simple and so forth to jar him out of that rut would be very very difficult indeed in fact people are liable to accuse him of being unbudgeable or conservative or fuddyduddy whats the matter you mean he wont run pcs wiggling their ears anymore and so forth but people are going to ask you people are going to ask you why is standard tech so different than just general tech well actually there is general tech there has really never been anything but standard tech but it required codification it required delivery it required simplification and once the research line was completed on it it had to be delivered and it had to be delivered in the simplest possible fashion it is necessary actually for an auditor to go all over the research lines and datas and side panels and everything else of this whole subject as he does on the class vi course before he can appreciate all there is to know and how little of it is main line action and if he gets that all settled and straightened out he knows tremendous body of data about the mind there are fabulous amounts of it you actually if you settle down on just standard tech only and didnt know the other lines then people would think they were making fabulous discoveries every time they found out that you could match terminal couple of mock ups see they didnt know that that was ever part of the subject matter but do you know oddly enough if hypnotism and lot of other subjects of one kind or another went this route the material which was evolved in the days of mesmer and charcreax was considerable there was an enormous amount of it and its been boiled down now to some little tiny balderdash that doesnt even work but there was lot known in this particular field there was lot known and it has all more or less disappeared it isnt know to anybody anymore its very funny now any day now i expect somebody to break out and find out that there is such thing as an hypnotic rapport guy pinches himself in the shoulder and somebody else feels the pinch and theyre going to be very fascinated how did that happen actually its all part and is called actually mesmerism back in the eighteenth century if one doesnt know the scope of discovery of subject he cannot then take hold of its various importances if one doesnt know how wide the study is then he cannot also find out how narrow is the walk that goes through it if you can grasp that youve got it made and youre going to see that when you talk to an academy student and youre going to tell him just exactly what youre doing is great and hes doing just exactly this and you actually think you have cracker jack auditor and he can do exactly what you say and go ahead and this is great and you think thats fine there is reason to make class vi out of him hes doing so well this guy is in danger of stepping off the edge of the sidewalk and finding out some horrendous thing like invent problem get himself some big win feel that the field has not been covered or researched and then hes completely off into some brand new field scientology being only this tiny little simple thing you see hes in this brand new field which has vast ocean of data in connected to it because hes never been exposed to the data he actually wont be an auditor who can hold the line until hes also found how much there is to hold and then he will understand it now when you try to relay to somebody this is standard tech i am class viii yes people are going to be making bunch of lot of fuss over you thats for sure and you have deserved it youve earned it they will try to feel uninvalidated not invalidated and this sort of thing and be happy about this well you can help them be happy about the whole thing by saying oh well you see the funny part of it is is all the simple things you know are true and the only difference is is you dont know how true they are and ron said for to tell you that standard tech does not invalidate anybodys tech but is just the high velocity fast streamlined way through and it takes the total expert to do it it is the road to total gains well you have to know great deal now all of you have been trained great deal down through the years youve had lots of training of this way and that way and youve done this and youve done that and youve done the other thing the net result of it is that you can look back over it and you can see you can see where its shined up and you can see where it was rather dim and you undoubtedly those of you who have been through saint hill recently and so on and those of you who are very old timers indeed have very good grasp on the whole width of the subject have very very good grasp on the subject itself and know very well it is only where your own insights have been themselves then invalidated by bad training or by counterdata or something of this sort that youve had any loses at all now im not trying to tell you you might have known all this before that would be little bit too much that would be bowing out of the picture too much i have done reevaluation of materials reevaluation of addups and that is very definite part of the speed which you attain in them these materials have been groomed within an inch of their lives really and this of course is not something that one normally sees when one is trained in some subject he does not see the amount of research or testing or other things that go on with it well thats all been there too but if you notice you have not been trained anything that was very contrary to anything in your training its more main line than otherwise but you certainly have shed lot of complexities that somebody or another has given you the main the thing that you will run into is the fact that auditing is team action its team action it requires the ethics officer and the hco exec sec and the org exec sec and the qual sec and the this one and the that one and the promotions people and the this and so on and the handling it up what i expect you to do what i expect you to do is set and hold the standard and continue to go forward with the standard and by doing that and by doing that consistently set up examples of what can be done and continue to set up those examples of what can be done so that people eventually realize that thats what can be done and then they start doing it too that i do expect you to do and i know youll do that it has been an all night all day proposition of training the first org viiis you have had some fairly damp times of it i have had some rather snarly times i have never read my cs 7 the lrh comm staff has never made the tape of snarling over some of these folders and so forth but she often threatened to do so because some of them were pretty gruesome i mean the snarls not much the folders and somehow or another we would bring it all off and somehow or another why amongst us we seem to have gotten through with it and you all made it for which i thank you very much now youve contributed great deal to this class you have made the grade in more ways than one and i appreciate very much what youve done and i respect you great deal for coming here and going through the lineup and coming out the other end victorious and for that i wish to thank you thank you very much
