bridge publications inc newsletter date where the society is at on the help button nd do you know were catching this planet today were actually catching it on the last bottom shreds of help people will help they will drop penny in the society for disabled children or something like that even though they dont care what happens to the society they see the sign and so forth and they say well they probably need some help and they drop penny theyre not really interested if you ask them what is your interest in what is your interest in disabled children and theyd say huh well now it goes downscale on help to point where the person will help but wont receive help thats getting down into the lower realms of this thing and if you could just see these things as interest communication control and help with sort of curtain being pulled down across each one of these youd see there was still little tiny bit of help possible but nothing else well the persons life has simply gone out to that extent just gone out and as you raise the curtain it gets back up to interest enthusiasm verve and so forth l ron hubbard excerpted from the london congress on dissemination help and the london open evening lectures mans prevention mechanism from doing wrong an article by l ron hubbard from the london congress on dissemination help and the london open evening lectures one time i was looking around for people to straighten up on series i was trying to do series of about ten and i got hold of criminal who was real hardened criminal he is what is known as the dyedinthewool criminal i think thats the technical name of it this fellow had habit he would find somebody who had some money lure him down the street take him into an alley and then hit him hard blow on the jaw take the money put it in his pocket and walk off hed been doing this for years and his arm was very shriveled but he hadnt quite made it yet he was still capable of striking blow with this shriveled arm but he was working on it and i tried to get this shriveled arm straightened out and he went so fast that he practically got total paralysis of one side before id worked on him more than few minutes i gave him wonderful opportunity of really crippling himself he was desperately trying to get himself into state whereby he could longer hit people on the jaw because thats what he did and the way he was trying to work it out you see was that way he never he never asked the question of why he hit people on the jaw this was something he couldnt confront so he just never looked for that he just looked at ways and means to prevent himself from hitting people on the jaw that was all he did obvious answer crippled arm you see some old man going down the street on two canes gimping along terribly interesting what that old man thinks he would do if he had two good legs its quite fascinating you find out what he would do if he had two legs its easy because he himself can hardly stop himself from answering you if you ask him what would two crippled legs prevent you from doing and before he can hardly open his mouth the words come out id just get any woman i saw and knock her down and just kick her and kick her and kick her thats how i got two crippled legs see its very funny now as long as man has been fooling around with man he has considered that man was basically evil and factually this isnt true man tries to prevent becoming evil to such an extent he moves right around into the middle of it he tries to restrain himself to point of where he cant restrain himself anymore and there he goes and theres what theres your control button now the fellow who has the crippled arm i found out by the way why he had crippled arm when he was little kid there was an older boy on the newspaper route who used to beat him up and take his money and this happened at least once week as soon as this fellow as child had collected his money on his route or collected his money from his customers this other fellow would come along and beat him up and he got so fixated on this whole thing he got so fixated on the idea that the best thing to do was beat somebody up and take their money away thats all he could do for the rest of his life but he really didnt get paralyzed side until one day his mother woke him up unexpectedly and he drew back his arm to hit his mother and actually his arm was drawn back in the act of hitting his mother from there on out because he checked that but good but he couldnt check the other dramatization he could longer control that dramatization you straighten out these various buttons try to find out what the individual has failed to help that is your lowest entrance point and if theres anything lower than that the case is probably not conscious unable to talk to you in any way is in an asylum someplace and you have to use another regimen of processing entirely called the cchs but we assume that this individual can still talk to some slight degree and if you find out what that individual failed to help you will find out at once one of the points that prevents you from helping him l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture help from the london congress on dissemination help and the london open evening lectures success stories from the lectures these lectures are exactly the tech i was missing i have read the hcobs on help but was missing this talk from lrh on how it related to cases their tone levels their withholds and their desire to live or die it has helped to get my 15yearold into the longest conversation of substance we have ever had if you are parent you will realize what it is like to try to get your teenage to talk it also cleared up why i have lost on previous dissemination attempts i thought i could just speak to the person directly i was never addressing help or their will to do better it has sped up my auditing i cognited on various aspects of my case lastly it has given tool i can use which makes future comm cycles more of game with aware and at cause bf where the society is at on the help button mans prevention mechanism from doing wrong success stories from the lectures this is technology that cuts right to the core of deeprooted apathy and gradiently brings individuals to revitalized interest in their case in their environment and in life itself in june 1960 ron presented the deadly quartet of help control communication and interest through series of four open evening lectures in the empire rooms on tottenham court road in these public lectures to scientologists and their friends ron demonstrated the use of these factors to revitalize anyones interest in life accomplished through casual conversation and as to how that casual conversation might play out ron spelled it out in vivid detail while to bring that technology of revitalization to every scientologist he convened landmark congress at londons royal commonwealth society hall held on the 7th of august ron presented the power of presessioning both in auditing and in dissemination he further presented an undercut to those four steps revealing the real why behind mans often destructive behavior as defined by an expanded cycleofaction createsurvivedestroy find out in these lectures how to bring anyone up to interest in anything using the deadly quartet in casual conversation and thus being expert at flattening the buttons of help control communication and interest why being can only have bad luck if hes in someone elses valence the mechanism of people wishing to die and how this can be handled what lrh was really investigating in those saint hill horticultural experiments and what this has to do with why people get sick why touch assist works and what this has to do with the basic nature of man how it is that machines fall apart around some people and run well with others why injuries stay injured and why they heal in direct relationship to confront the perfect dissemination formula for
