tv demo sec checking with comments by lrh an auditing demonstration given on 27 march 1963 well how are you today how are you today weve got demonstration today were going to be see checking somebody showing how you dig something up your attention is recommended to the fact that the auditor is not there to miss withholds on the pc this is not definition of an auditor whats the date by the way twenty female voice twentyseventh twentyseventh of march 1963 and the art of see checking is very very well established its one of the finest arts that we have but it is to large degree an art it is restimulating the material to be picked up and then picking it up i think somebody here recently went through ain one week of four hours of auditingi think that was right wasnt itone week of four hours of auditing went through the last two pages of the joburg form 6a and what else female voice and student prepcheck and student prepcheck oh boy thats really remarkable i dont know how he did that in the first place it isnt that we want to audit slowly we want to audit thoroughly and thorough audit is very much the point now one of the things which you will find one of the things which you will find consistent and so forth is that good auditor gets something done he audits the pc in front of him he gets something done and its not getting through the prepcheck its getting through to the pc withholds restimulate they are actually not there they have to be keyedin and i think you will see some of that happening now now let see if were ready downstairs here yes were all ready downstairs and were about to see some see checking okay there we are auditor hmm is that right pc nearly this will do auditor okay leslie well what were going to do in this session is that ive got here the uh joburg the last two pages of the joburg pc hm auditor which i understand has been flattened on you over the in the pavilion pc well we got something alive on it auditor you still got something alive

ask you now tell what does this question mean pc well it means do i know anybody who i know is communist auditor hmhmm pc and i think it means in this life auditor all right thank you all right well now heres the question do you know any communist personally pc auditor all right did good look at that pc well if i if i do i dont know that they are auditor hmhm pc i mean i might know somebody who is communist unknown to but not known to auditor all right thank you has anybody told you think who might be communist or anything do you know pc well i just thought of one preclear who gave us bit of trouble about year ago but i dont think he was communist auditor all right pc i just thought of him then auditor okay is there anybody else pc auditor all right ill check this question on the meter now pc hmm auditor do you know any communist personally all right you possibly have an answer there do you pc i just felt nervous and wondering if it would read or not auditor hmhmm all right okay im going to check that question pc yeah auditor we had an equivocal read there pc yeah auditor do you know any communist personally there is read here pc the only thing i get there is something which has come up in processing before auditor hmhmm pc its some came up on this question some past lives stuff thats very confused and im not sure about it but thats all i get auditor all right pc hmm auditor what actually do you get here pc i usually think of lenin and auditor hmhmm pc sometimes karl marx auditor yeah pc and i used to get the idea that i had had something to do with starting communism auditor hmhmm pc and it gave horrible scare auditor all right pc and i backed off that one auditor okay now ill ask you the question do you know any communist personally pc auditor all right ill check it on the meter do you know any communist personally all right do you agree thats clean pc hmm auditor okay thank you all right now the next question fin going to ask you is have you ever injured dianetics or scientology thats the question im going to ask you now tell what does that mean to you pc um have i ever damaged it or hurt it in any way or auditor yes pc um injured it could mean have i prevented it from advancing like i really feel it shouldnt advance by auditor hmhmm pc by not doing things too auditor all right okay and on the question on dianetics whats this mean to you pc well i havent had very much to do with dianetics except for auditor hmm pc trying to sell the book to few people auditor right pc hmm auditor and scientology pc that means just the general science all over the world auditor all right okay now how long have you been in dianetics or andor scientology pc 59 auditor since 1959 pc hm auditor all right okay well have you been working in an organization or something pc with eddie in the franchise center auditor hmmm pc uh i did did little bit of auditing in melbourne auditor all right okay well now im going to give you this question all right have you ever injured dianetics or scientology pc well the thing i thought of there straight away was uh the preclear i had in melbourne auditor hmhmm pc auditing her auditor yes pc i was i had to leave melbourne and go back to new zealand and i hadnt completed her intensive she still had missed withholds at that time auditor all right pc it wasnt break of agreement there but the fact was that i felt that i could have done better job auditing her than i did do auditor all right what did you actually do there pc well i left melbourne while she still had missed withhold auditor all right okay any other doingness there pc i didnt use my own judgment auditor all right pc in the sessions auditor very good anything else there pc i dont think so i think thats all auditor all right okay ill give you the question again have you ever injured dianetics or scientology pc yes by being slow with dissemination auditor all right now when was that pc thing i thought of there was once uh we were going to put an advertisement in the paper for course in something and i slowed eddie down in doing it in some lrh you notice that rock slamthat rock slam there that shes turning on over this question you notice that its early and late that is quite common pc very banky sort of way and auditor hmhmm pc oh we wont do it just yet you know sort of i said something like that and we actually put it off auditor yes all right okay now i didnt quite hear what ron said then and i wondered if he could repeat it pc yeah auditor all right lrh i said it was just early and late that rock slam and that she does have rock slam there on this subjectbut it doesnt get instant when they do that on sec check you can expect it to turn up and turn off and shes really shadow boxing with something thats all i said auditor thank you lrh you bet auditor all right now im sorry i didnt get quite get the last of your communication there pc ive forgotten what i auditor all right okay ill tell you what ill do im going to give you this question again have you ever injured dianetics or scientology pc i didnt get any definite answer there nothing that auditor hmhmm pc ive definitely done auditor all right um what were you looking at there pc well what i was looking at before was uh slowing eddie down in getting an advertisement put in the paper advertising testing that might have been auditor hmhmm pc sort of backoff of confronting new people auditor all right okay pc and i and i was successful in doing it i realized it was an overt auditor hmhmm all right anything else you did around that time pc i didnt get anything there at that time auditor all right well lets have another look all right have you ever injured dianetics or scientology pc i feel as if i have but i dont get anything there auditor all right well what are you looking at there something there pc justjust feeling of grief auditor hmhmm all right pc the the thing is that i feel that ive done wrong and and to do with scientology and dianetics is in in not making myself get bit of necessity level on it and start things auditor all right pc thats the thing i feel auditor okay when didnt you when didnt you do this thing pc oh i havent done that all the time ever since i came into scientology all the time its been constant really i i do little bit now and then auditor ye s pc and when i do i usually do well good enough job to know that i ought to do bit more you see auditor all right give an example here whats that pc well that was 1960 before we started practicing scientology auditor hmhmm yes pc and feeling we ought to start i think it was 1960 im not quite sure of my dates auditor yes all right pc but at that particular time we were having bit of confusion ed and i and ed was bit down and i had the feeling that i ought to do something auditor hmhmm pc sort of get cracking you know quite strong and i just didnt do it but ii knew i should have done it certain time and then i sort of forget about it auditor yes well what was it you didnt do here at that time pc im getting bit mixed up auditor yes well pc i i didnt run pe course auditor all right okay lrh thats pumping needle by the way you see there class thats pumping needle auditor all right now what was at at that time what was it you actually did lrh it can also be caused by somebody having their cans against their clothing while breathing auditor there pc it would be the thing i did would be say just go out to the pictures or something like that and do auditor hmm pc just do lazy sort of things instead of doing something worthwhile auditor yes very good very good can you give us specific time when you did this an incident pc gee ive got this shut off auditor all right okay some time when you went to the pictures pc i just get the idea of of going in the truck you know just being having my body in the truck moving toward the picture theater some time but i couldnt tell you exactly when it was it must auditor yeah pc have happened dozens of times auditor all right now youre telling that you got this feeling you what was it you were doing what was this general thing you were telling here pc doing things like being irresponsible going to the pictures instead of getting here auditor all right have you got one time when you went to the pictures pc well the the time ive got when i i had this urge to do something was auditor yes pc coming home from the pictures ive got that time auditor all right what happened there what was it you did pc oh i think im starting to see bit of daylight auditor all right very good pc theres more to this this this i was processing eddie at the time auditor right pc and he was getting upset as as preclear auditor yes pc i think that was what it was auditor hmm pc and um this is before missed withholds you know lrh see that needle go clean pc and uh the cause would be in giving giving bad auditing and results because he was confused and didnt want to didnt want to start until he was sort of more sure auditor yes pc and i had this urge to do something real strong this time and i probably made him feel guilty about it but the fact was i had done an overt before that auditor yes pc because if i had done good auditing he would have felt all right auditor all right so what where was this overt to here then pc i dont know which overt you want auditor the actual overt you got in mind when you said youd done some bad auditing on him lrh see this is pc i dont have it there except that ijust general idea of of bit of confusion near his processing lrh see that needle dirty up again the moment that she started talking about this bad auditing pc and lrh moving on down toward what she really did pc once i blew of from him in the session auditor i beg your pardon pc once i blew from him in the session auditor i see yes pc probably around about that time auditor hmhmm you what actual how did you blow the session what actually did happen tell about it pc uh auditor hmhmm pc the the one ive got one there now auditor good pc ive done it after this too i i did this few times auditor all right pc uh first one would be uh i was trying to get his case going and id be running process what part of that scene you are looking at can you be responsible for or something like that auditor yes pc and he got upset in the session you see and im trying to get this process going and i got angry because he was angry and i blamed him you see auditor right pc it just went and i think i said you can go to hell and i just left and i realized when i got to the door i was in real rage auditor hmhmm pc what id done and i came back auditor yes pc i dont even remember if i ended that session or not but i did 90 back auditor all right okay now is there anything else you did to that in that session pc oh break the auditors code auditor all right anything else anything else there pc ii didnt get anything there must be but i sort of ran up against blank wall auditor all right well now tell when was the first time you blew sessions on this preclear thats it pc there was twice very close together and i dont know whether the one im telling you about is the first one i think it is the first one auditor well what was the other one here then pc the other one was uh one early one morning auditor all right pc quite close to that time probably within two months auditor all right now what happened on that occasion hmhmm you have got something there pc not not anything yet auditor and what happened in that session the other session where you blew its there its there pc oh yes auditor hmhmm pc uh he he got upset about my auditing auditor all right okay pc and i justi just didnt confront that auditor hmhmm pc so i blew auditor all right and what had you done then in here lrh notice the auditor properly called that motivator see he got upset and i blew so now we got to get the overt see auditor there it is pc i didnt want to audit him auditor all right now the when when was that that pc i this was all the same time it was the the one it directed to another one there were two close together auditor all right pc and this is the one morning before i went off to to school auditor right fair enough now what had you done in this session there there there you are pc i get the feeling i havent got it yet auditor okay just have look there something you did there you are there pc oh i thought i started the session late auditor all right okay well is that what you did pc im not sure but thats what ive got thats what came up auditor all right pc just then when you said that auditor all right okay now is there anything else in that session that you did something there pc well i wouldve qed and qed and qandaed before i got angry i i would have said something back auditor oh all right pc i dont remember what auditor okay lets have look at this what what was said in this session that led to this something there pc uh all i got there was the idea of ed saying to i wasnt doing something right and i cant even remember what i was doing or what it was i wasnt doing right auditor all right okay now what was before that was it that you werent that youd done in this session before he said that to you youve got something here pc not seeing anything yet auditor hmhmm lets have look was it an auditing flub pc well it would be an auditing flub auditor hmhmm all right pc would be an auditing flub auditor well what was the auditing flub pc not understanding the preclear auditor all right okay what didnt you understand there pc im getting bit of bit of it back auditor hmhmm good pc um i didnt listen fully and and acknowledge his difficulty auditor all right pc there was some difficulty with processing auditor yes pc in scientology and his case at that time he felt that he could help other people with scientology but nobody had helped him you see auditor right pc and uh it used to come up lot in sessions auditor yes pc and now i think its feel that that would be what it was auditor what would it be actually then pc well i must have done something that he made him feel awful the preclear was feeling lousy anyway thats for sure auditor i didnt quite hear that pc i must have done something to make him feel bad because the preclear would have been feeling really bad in the session auditor oh all right okay pc and and got failure auditor hmhmm pc somehow or other about auditing auditor yes now was there something on this you didnt understand or something that you did in the session pc oh i didnt understand it auditor oh all right now where um well tell this which house was this did this session take place in pc oh this was in uh uh river road 574 river road auditor all right is it big building small building pc mediumsized house auditor all right how many rooms in it pc oh i dont know how many rooms one two three four five auditor all right pc five major rooms auditor all right now which room were you auditing in pc we were in the front the front lounge auditor all right tell how hows that room furnished in pc oh i get that view all right auditor all right pc carpeted floor and settee and the sofas auditor hmm yes very good all right have you got the picture of that when you when you had this session with him pc yeah yes auditor all right pc its getting better auditor good anything um distinguishing anything distinguishing about the preclear that day pc only being upset i guess auditor yes all right well his attire or his clothing pc i seem to think he had on his green jersey but thats what i think auditor all right very good all right now have look at this session see what it was you did its kicking here all right how you doing pc uh all right auditor good pc im sort of just looking trying to find something auditor yes all right well what what process were you running what sort of auditing were you giving him on this occasion pc it would be what was out at that time i think auditor well what would be what was it what were you running in the session pc gee its hard to recall could have been havingness and confront auditor all right pc or it could have been uh uh one of those routines auditor well all right was it one of those routines pc there was another one another another routine there and im trying to pick it up what it would be auditor hmhmm pc hmm im not sure auditor all right now what what were you doing at the moment when he when you started to get when he started to get arc broken then pc running process id be running process when it happened auditor all right okay and what were his words to you pc im not sure whether this is right or not but auditor hmm pc i get the idea auditor yes pc of him saying i dont think this is doing any good auditor all right okay now what was it what would it be that wasnt doing him any good then what process were you running at that time pc christ i dont know auditor all right hows this doinggoing pc its bit hard to get get what it is auditor all right well now tell this wasnt the first time youd audited this pc pc auditor all right now were there some earlier sessions when youd audited this pc pc yes auditor all right now in any of those earlier sessions that you got something that youd done wrong in them pc plenty of things i hadnt blown in those earlier sessions but auditor pardon pc i hadnt blown auditor all right okay pc in those earlier sessions but plenty of things auditor all right now was there an earlier session you can recall here with this pc pc well it it might be the first or second session i gave him auditor all right now hows that session seem to you what did you do in that one pc we were running uh overts and withholds auditor good all right yes now what uh what did you do in that session pc well id be running what have you done to what have you withheld from that would be what td be doing auditor all right now how did that session go pc first session went all right auditor good your second session pc second session auditor yes pc ah yeah the second session was when i started getting uh uh some trouble with the arc auditor all right pc in the session auditor very good now what was it you did in that session lrh theres an additive in that first session pc all i can get in the second session was uh auditor hmm pc in the second session i gave him uh we were were at this time we werent married auditor hmm pc and we were just going together and i was bit keener than eddie was at that particular time auditor all right pc and in the second session some of this started coming up as his withhold you see auditor yes pc in that session but i didnt do anything wrong in that session i just acknowledged and went on but i felt shaken up but i might have done something before that auditor all right very good well what about the first session then that you ran yes hmhmm yes pc ive looked at this before and auditor all right pc the first session i ever gave him the only overt i could i can think there is quite quite goodsized one really auditor hmm pc and it would be would be teaming up i sort of suggested that we audit each other auditor hmhmm pc and the the teaming up there was sort of for scientology but the my main goal uh auditor hmhmm pc was second dynamic goal i sort of sort of fell for him you see and i was really auditor yes pc after him auditor all right pc in cunning sort of way so the auditing would be as means for that really underneath auditor all right now was there anything in your auditing along these lines second dynamic lines at all pc not at that point i dont think auditor hmhmm pc i was only running overtwithhold on auditor all right pc oh well i get his overts off on and he wont fly auditor pardon pc i get his overts off on and his withholds and he wont fly auditor all right okay is that it pc oh yes well thats part of it auditor all right now is there anything else in that session pc i dont see anything else there auditor all right well now how about this pc now and the subsequent arc breaks still something there pc he didnt really start arc breaking auditor hmm pc him himself until thats probably about three or four sessions and maybe even week later auditor all right pc i think it would be within week really auditor okay now after the first session what about the second session is there anything you did in that session yeah pc i dont get anything i did i was just looking at the session auditor hmhmm pc just just looking at it there auditor all right now was that how what was the purpose of running that session pc the purpose would be to clean up the overts and withholds get the get it clean auditor yes very good all right now any other purpose as far as you were concerned pc the actually the other one i told you about i didnt consciously fully realize it about that at the time but auditor hmhm pc i could see it afterwards auditor all right pc that it was there but it wasnt uh i had it nicely suppressed lrh talking to auditor auditor um uhhuh uhhuh all right okay well now why did you come into scientology then what was the original idea of coming into scientology pc uh the original idea of coming into scientology auditor hmhmm pc i had read little bit about it in book auditor yeah hmhmm pc and got bit interested auditor ye s pc and i then heard bit about it from my father just little bit auditor right pc and then i saw i was very bored and dissatisfied with my job auditor right pc and so i wrote to the christchurch scientology people to find out if they had course and thats thats auditor yes pc primarily i think that was the first reason why i came in auditor yes all right and you wrote for the course then what did you do pc pardon auditor you wrote for details of the course pc yeah auditor then what did you do pc i went to the pe course auditor right yes all right pc and eddie was running it thats where i first met him auditor oh i see pc thats where i got my eye on him auditor pardon pc i said thats where i got my eye on him auditor all right pc sounds awful doesnt it auditor okay thank you now what uh then was there any purpose then of continuing on pc i dont think i had any strong second dynamic feelings until probably partly through the week i sort of thought oh hes nice something like that auditor hmhmm pc and i thought gee you know nice boys like that in scientology auditor hmhmm pc you see but first of all i really was sure at that time that scientology was something auditor good all right pc yeah auditor so what was your what happened after the pe course what was the next move pc ii went on to coaudit auditor all right pc in christchurch and did the extension course auditor okay now whyd you go on that coaudit yes pc i went on that coaudit with the with the reason i dont want to own up to this one auditor all right yes pc because i thought he might audit auditor all right okay all right now any more on that pc he didnt auditor all right okay so that was the original purpose there was it pc it would be part auditor all right pc would be partly not wholly auditor all right okay all right im going to check this original question again now all right pc hmhmm auditor have you ever injured dianetics or scientology pc i feel lot better about it but i dont really see one lrh yeah nice and clean isnt it huh nice and clean auditor all right i didnt quite hear what you said here pc i i feel lot better about it auditor hmm right pc but i dont know if theres anything there or not auditor well we got nice clean needle here now all right pc yeah auditor okay pc yeah auditor all right lrh you can close it off auditor all right now uh its nice point to finish up pc hm auditor on the session so if its all right with you im just going to finish the body of the session now pc yes thats all right auditor all right anything you want to say before i do uh finish the body of the session pc well ive had little look for this before auditor hmm pc since missed withholds came out with ed but i havent had good look at the whole sort of picture like this before auditor all right okay pc yeah auditor all right well then have you made any part of your goals for this session pc hmm auditor which was to clear up anything that has been missed and to do your very best pc hmm auditor all right pc yeah auditor howd you make out in those pc i feel good about that auditor all right and on this one to do my best pc yes auditor all right now are there any other gains youve made in this session youd care to mention pc i didnt feel too worried about the audience auditor all right very good all right anything else pc only only comment auditor on goals and gains i was asking you if pc yeah yeah auditor you want to make comment do so pc oh just just comment that it was so much easier to get get to it when when we went earlier auditor hmhmm pc i got couldnt get that later one at all auditor all right very good pc yeah auditor all right okay now ill just check your havingness all right pc hmm auditor just uh good now give the cans squeeze would you let them go all right now your havingness is down what is your havingness process pc touch that or feel that i think they work auditor all right okay put the cans down then would you all right im going to run touch that okay touch that table good all right touch that cord good touch the top button of your jacket very good touch your right cuff good all right touch your nose fine touch your hair very good pick u the cans would you good p give the cans squeeze well thats working nicely put the cans down would you please thank you all right touch this cord good touch your right elbow good touch your left elbow very good touch your right ear good touch your right knee very good touch that can good touch the microphone very good touch that little bit of dirt there very good all right pick up the cans okay all right now good now give the cans squeeze okay let them go all right and once more all right well were almost back to where we started there and im going to leave it at that how do you feel about that pc i feel all right auditor all right very good now is there anything you care to uh end of havingness process all right is there anything you care to ask or s before i end this session pc just thank you auditor all right is it all right with you if end the session now pc yes auditor okay here it is end of session session ended for you pc yes auditor very good all right tell im longer auditing you pc youre longer auditing auditor good all right thank you pc okay well there you have an example of sec checking actually with first cousin to the withhold system pressing it back to the earliest time picking up the earliest charge and carrying it on forward i want to call to your attention very distinctly and very definitely that there is wealth of difference between sec checking and getting mid ruds in or some other type of activity now you get the mid ruds in something like that or clean up something it is simply for the perfunctory the perfunctory purpose of getting session going getting things out of the road momentarily so that you can carry on with what youre doing in sec checking you are doing auditing with this type of action youre doing auditing with it in doing prepcheck such as on purposes you are doing auditing thats different dont you see youre doing auditing of the pcs case with the process in other words with sec check questions and with prepchecking doesnt include prepchecking goal or something like that but in prepcheckingby which i mean youre trying to find times when well youre trying to find out how certain purposes have been suppressed and that sort of thingyou are actually doing the auditing with the prepcheck you understand so on however goals running or 3m or some other process you are simply using the mid ruds youre simply using the mid ruds to brush the pc off of it so they wont get in your road do you understand now you can either audit with these thingsas you just saw demonstration ofyou can either audit with these things or you can just set pc up so they can be audited do you see that in other words theres two distinctly different uses to such things as sec check question or prepcheck question do you understand they are two distinctly different uses the one use is to get auditing done with it and of course thats hammer and tongs thats get the earliest one on the chain thats this thats that thats the other thing you see steering the pcs attention finding out if there is anything restimulating the pc if you please to find out if theres anything that can be picked up and then going ahead and picking it up and then on the other sideon the other sidewe have their use very permissive just lightly brush off in this session has anything been suppressed in this session has anything been suppressed pc says you say all right ill check it on the meter in this session has anything been suppressed that doesnt read on the meter and away we go you understand now that same question that same question used on the subject of purposes might go very well this way how has purpose been suppressed the pc says oh i dont get anything on that oh were doing prepcheck you see were using this thing to get auditing done so we have to say well what do purposes mean to you what are purposes all about whats suppression did you ever have any purposes like that do you suppose thereany purpose was ever suppressed anybodys purpose was ever suppressed anything like that pc says oh i see what you mean yes well ive badly suppressed my fathers purposes and so forth well of course you realize by the limits of the question you cant just have what purpose was suppressed thats bad process you have to sayits like look around here and find something you could go out of arc with spin the pc so you have to say all right now how did you suppress that purpose and all of sudden why the pc is giving you answers you dont have to keep badgering the pc that isnt the point you can just keep giving the question as long as the pc gives you answers your tone arm sitting there as youve had tone arm motion and so forth and the pc all of sudden puts on the brakes and he says thats all well all youve run into is something the pc is unwilling to tell you so you just have to go ahead and find out if this is the case its pc has something there that he doesnt want to tell you theres difference here in other words when you use see checking and prepchecking for the purpose of auditing you are pressing the question home to the pc you are making sure that the pc understands that question youre making sure that the pc knows this question applies to his life and youre trying to pick up the earliest incident that is available and carrying it on forward youve walked the pc down chain and so forth you get auditing done in other words with this question but over here on the other side just rudiments and havingness all right well we just do light brushoff with the rudiments we make sure they dont read on the meter we run some havingness on the pcpc comes up smiling we dont badger the pc at all do you see that is difference two entirely different modes of auditing the mode of auditing done in w is very different than the mode of auditing done in z you have to learn both modes of auditing you need both of them how are you going to pull somebodys missed withholds to set him up so they arent going to explode in your face all the time while youre trying to do 3m well youll have to take up the whole question with him you have to restimulate these things in other words you have to discuss these things with him see checks of course are very good to do this with now your concept and understanding of this is invited you haventyou actually cant be called an auditor unless you can see check and press it home you understand and you actually cant be called an auditor if you dont know this other method of just light brushoff and dash on you understand because youre trying to get your routine 2 routine 3 processes done these days dont you see well youre not trying to press anything home but lets take the borderline process which is your 2g1 and that pc just goes on answering answering answering smoothly but if the pc isnt answering you have to know how to press that question home and get it answered so its at 2g1 that you have the great divide between these two things its part of each you understand now where pc is having difficulty and rough needle and lot of things are very poor about the situation where all these things are going onpc is uncomfortable and so forth about lifeyou can straighten them out with sec check and your procedure would be more or less the way you saw it but as i press home to you it is an art it is an art its not aits not onetwothree four shift onetwothreefour shift oneyou have to audit the pc in front of you pcs saying rah i dont rah rah rah gahr and ive never done anything to dianetics and scientology except of course im pretty critical of the way youre auditing and im pretty critical of the organization and so on well realize that there must be an overt beneath the criticism thats one of the stable data of sec checking its up to you to find that chain of overts and its up to you to get the bottom chain of overts its up to you to release those overts you notice this girl went down to female clear read on this well one of the things that happens on sec checking is that high tone arm gets cancelled out and you get them coming down on it if you do good sec checking so its quite an activity all by itself and its distinctly different activity than that carried on in routine 3 and finding goals and that sort of thing do you see that now you have to learn both kinds of auditing and learn when to use each and i hope that youve got some idea of that now theres one remark id like to make technically rather than post it on the board and that is that 2g1 is not run on the needle sec checking is run on the needle 2g1 is right part of its old ancient grandfatherand ill give you more talks about itwas routine 2 prehav levels and that is all run on the tone arm and you run it up to high tone arm more or less stuck and then shift to your next level and its all done on the tone arm it is not done on the needle part nothing and part of the auditing commands are run on the needle in 2g1 do you understand that only the tone arm and you have to be able to persuade the pc to answer it few more times as long as theres tone arm motion going on you have answers now theres 2gph which is the original routine 2 process which is by prehav level applied to purposes and you will be learning that one too but im just calling that to your attention because those early 2gs are all tone arm all tone arm not needle sec checking rudiments havingness is all needle not tone arm you got the idea theyre quite distinctly different not only different processesthey use different parts of the meter all right well im very pleased with that demonstration and i think we ought to give reg and leslie big hand thank you thank you very much and good night
