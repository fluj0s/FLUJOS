government and finance division misuse of government purchase cards summary since the mid1990s the use of government purchase cards has expanded at rapid rate spurred by legislative and regulatory reforms designed to increase the use of purchase cards for small acquisitions the dollar volume of government purchase card transactions grew from 527 million in fy1993 to 187 billion in fy2007 while the use of purchase cards has been credited with reducing administrative costs audits of agency purchase card programs have found varying degrees of waste fraud and abuse one of the most common risk factors cited by auditors is weak internal control environment many agencies have failed to implement adequate safeguards against card misuse even as their purchase card programs grew in response to these findings congress has held hearings and legislation has been introduced that would enhance the management and oversight of agency purchase card programs one of the most comprehensive proposals before the 110th congress is the government credit card abuse prevention act which was introduced on march 7 2007 in both the senate s 789 and the house hr 1395 drawing on gao recommendations the bill would require agencies other than the department of defense dod to implement specific set of internal controls establish penalties for employees who misuse agency purchase cards and conduct periodic risk assessments and audits of agency purchase card programs dod would be required to expand its use of technology to prevent and identify fraudulent purchases conduct periodic risk assessments and audits and develop more specific rules regarding card deactivation of former dod employees this report begins by providing background on agency purchase card programs it then discusses identified

procurement particularly with regard to small purchases 25000 or less several agencies subsequently participated in pilot program that evaluated the use of commercial credit card called purchase card as an acquisition tool3 at the time even routine order for widely available items such as office supplies typically required agency program staff to submit written procurement request to contracting officer who reviewed it obtained the necessary authorizing signatures made the actual purchase and processed the associated paperwork to critics this process was inefficient especially for small purchases not only was it time consuming for both program and procurement personnel but it also prevented program offices from quickly filling immediate needs under the pilot program non procurement staff used purchase cards to conduct smalldollar transactions directly with local suppliers thus bypassing procurement officers entirely report on the pilot program concluded that purchase cards could reduce administrative costs and improve delivery time and in 1989 the office of management and budget omb tasked gsa with making purchase cards available governmentwide4 participation in gsas purchase card program was not mandatory and card use did not initially grow as rapidly as some had expected5 in 1993 however report issued by the national performance review npr sparked number of legislative and regulatory reforms intended to increase purchase card use the npr was clinton administration initiative headed by vice president gore that sought to reinvent the federal government by making government operations both less expensive and more effective6 one of the nprs objectives was to identify opportunities to streamline number of governmentwide processes including procurement drawing on input from experts in the public and private sectors the initial report of the npr recommended expanding the use of purchase cards across the government step it said would lower costs and reduce bureaucracy in small purchases7 in separate report that focused solely on procurement the npr estimated that if half of all small acquisitions were made using purchase cards the government would realize 180 million in savings annually8 the report further recommended amending the federal acquisition regulation far the 3 us government accountability office acquisition reform purchase card use

acquisition streamlining act fasa pl 103355 in 199410 fasa introduced several reforms that increased the use of purchase cards11 among these title iv of fasa established simplified acquisition threshold of 100000 purchases at or below the threshold were exempted from the provisions of number of procurement laws this reform significantly reduced the administrative burden and procurement expertise needed to make small purchases12 to further streamline procedures for the smallest acquisitions title iv also established micropurchase threshold of 2500 which was increased to 3000 in 200613 fasa further exempted micro purchases from sections of the buy american act and the small business act and they could be made without obtaining competitive bid if the cost was deemed reasonable by the cardholder at the same time the clinton administration took steps to increase the use of purchase cards citing the need to make agency procurement procedures more consistent with recommendations of the national performance review president clinton issued executive order 12931 on october 13 199414 eo 12931 directed agency heads to 1 expand purchase card use and 2 delegate the micropurchasing authority provided in fasa to program offices which would enable them to make such purchases directly eo 12931 also directed agency heads to streamline procurement policies and practices that were not mandated by statute and to ensure that their agencies were maximizing their use of the new simplified acquisition procedures in addition the far was amended in 1994 to designate the purchase card as the preferred method for making micropurchases and to encourage agencies to use the card for purchases of greater dollar amounts15 card use increased sharply as agencies implemented these reforms the dollar value of goods and services acquired with purchase cards increased from 527 9 ibid p 36 the far is codified in title 48 of the code of federal regulations cfr 10

the use of purchase cards now saves the government 13 billion year in administrative costs18 structure the federal purchase card program is implemented by individual agencies with the involvement of gsa and omb in broad terms agencies establish and maintain their own programs but they select purchase card services from contracts that gsa negotiates with selected banks and their programs must conform to the government wide guidance issued by omb agencies each agency is responsible for establishing its own purchase card program the agency within the framework of omb guidance establishes internal rules and regulations for purchase card use and management decides which of its employees are to receive purchase cards and handles billing and payment issues for agency purchase card accounts two levels of supervision generally exist within an agencys purchase card program individual cardholders are assigned to an approving official ao the ao is considered the first line of defense against card misuse and agency policies often require the ao to ensure that all purchases comply with statutes regulations and agency policies to that end the ao may be responsible for authorizing cardholder purchases either by approving purchases before they are made or by verifying their legitimacy through reviews of cardholder statements and supporting documentation such as receipts the ao may also be required to ensure that statements are reconciled and submitted to the billing office in timely manner each agency also appoints an agency program coordinator apc to serve as the agencys liaison to the bank and to gsa at some agencies each major component has an apc one of whom is chosen to serve as the agencys liaison the apcs are also usually responsible for

sony playstations cameras and jewelry and coast guard cardholder who used his purchase card to buy beer brewing kit and then brewed alcohol while on duty23 congress has held several hearings to

httpgovernmentmanagementoversighthousegov storyaspid1982 crs7 discuss these weaknesses identified in audit reports published between 2002 and 200825 ineffective transaction review and approval processes one of the primary safeguards against improper use of government purchase cards is the review and approval of cardholder transactions by someone other than the cardholder as noted purchase card aos are usually responsible for reviewing the cardholders monthly statement given that the ao is often the only person other than the cardholder to assess the validity of purchase before payment is made to the purchase card vendor the review and approval process is considered one of the most critical components of an agencys purchase card control environment steven kutz gaos managing director of forensic audits and special investigations stated in testimony before the senate basic fraud prevention concepts and our previous audits of purchase card programs have shown that opportunities for fraud and abuse arise if cardholders know that their purchases are not being properly reviewed26 despite the importance of the aos role in preventing and detecting improper purchases some agencies have failed to ensure that cardholder statements were carefully reviewed prior to their approval at the department of education auditors estimated that 37 of monthly cardholder statements they reviewed had not been approved by the ao27 most recently gao reported that nearly one of every six purchase card transactions governmentwide had not been properly authorized28 even when aos did conduct reviews they often failed to meet government standards agencies are required by omb to ensure that cardholder statements are compared with supporting documentation such as invoices and receipts as part of the review process29 this is necessary because purchase card statements are rarely itemized they usually provide only the store or contractor name and the amount charged for aos receipts and invoices are the principal means of verifying what items were purchased and determining whether those items were for legitimate program purposes many agencies have not ensured that supporting documentation is available and examined as part of the review and approval process according to 25 because some audit findings are several years old the agencies cited may have taken steps to address them the most recent audit reports from 2007 and 2008 however continue to identify these types of internal control weaknesses in agency purchase card programs 26 testimony of gregory d kutz

did not have adequate documentation for 47 of transactions auditors deemed questionable purchases from merchants that are not normally expected to do business with hud which meant auditors were unable to determine what was purchased for whom and why30 similarly 2004 audit of the veterans health administrations vhas purchase card program estimated that 313 million of its transactions lacked key supporting documentation31 one consequence of these weaknesses is that fraudulent and abusive transactions may slip through the review process unnoticed for instance gao found that aos at agencies across the government have approved cardholder statements that included transactions that should have been questioned such as purchases of jewelry home furnishings cruise tickets electronics and other consumer goods at the forest service one employee used her purchase card over period of years to accumulate more than 31000 in jewelry and electronics32 similarly hud cardholders spent 27000 at department stores like macys and jcpenney in single year33 in one egregious case an faa employee had his statement approved even though it showed he violated agency policy by charging cash advances to his purchase card while at casino34 the want of adequate oversight is also evident where aos have approved duplicate transactions vendors charging the government twice for the same goods or services and purchases made by someone other than the cardholder one audit identified an estimated 177187 in duplicate charges at one agency35 an audit at the federal aviation administration faa discovered that cardholder had allowed unauthorized individuals to charge over 160000 to her purchase card account36 when unauthorized and duplicate transactions are identified by the ao they should be disputed under the process described in the smartpay master contract when aos fail to identify and dispute fraudulent charges the government often pays them in full or fails to obtain refund from the purchase card vendor 30 us government accountability office hud purchase cards poor internal controls resulted in improper and questionable purchases gao03489 apr 2003 p 7 at httpwwwgaogovnewitemsd03489pdf 31

many agencies fail to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of their purchase card controls responsibility that is often assigned to the apc monitoring and evaluation may include sampling purchase card transactions for potentially improper purchases ensuring purchase card policies are being properly implemented across the agency or component and assessing program results these duties are often unfulfilled at faa for example an audit found that apcs generally were not utilizing available reports to detect misuse and fraud nor was the headquarters apc taking steps to assess the overall program37 similarly an audit of the forest service purchase card program found that the agencys apcs failed to review sampled transactions for erroneous or abusive purchases as required by us department of agriculture regulations38 lack of separation of duties agencies are required to ensure that key procurement functions are handled by different individuals when having goods shipped for example the same person should not both approve and place the order or both place the order and receive the goods at many agencies however the cardholder may perform two functions that should be separated which increases the possibility that items may be purchased for personal use lost or stolen in march 2008 gao estimated that agencies were unable to document separation of duties for one of every three purchase card transactions39 three navy cardholders ordered and received 500000 of goods for themselves with their purchase cards before getting caught40 in this way inadequate separation of duties may contribute to millions of dollars of items that agencies have purchased which cannot be located items that are easily converted to personal use commonly referred to as pilferable property are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft the department of education for example could not account for 241 personal computers bought with purchase cards at cost of 26150041 an audit of femas spending on items related to hurricane recovery found that 170000 worth of electronics equipment acquired with purchase cards had not been recorded in femas property records and could not be

policies and procedures training on the proper use and management of purchase cards is considered an important component of an agencys internal control environment it is through this training that cardholders approving officials and program managers learn their roles in ensuring compliance with applicable regulations and statutes and in reducing the risk of improper card use to that end omb requires all agencies to train everyone who participates in purchase card program43 cardholders are to be trained on federal procurement laws and regulations agency policies and proper card use approving officials are required to receive the same training as cardholders in addition to training in their duties as aos program managers are required to be trained in cardholder and ao responsibilities as well as management control and oversight tools and techniques in addition all purchase card program participants are supposed to take their initial training prior to appointment eg becoming cardholder or being designated as an ao or program manager and receive refresher training at least every three years number of agencies have not fully implemented ombs training requirements report by the inspector general at the department of the interior for example noted that the department of the interior had not provided any training to its aos and concluded that many of those officials were not performing adequate reviews44 the aos themselves reportedly said that they did not know how to conduct proper review of purchase card transactions or how and why to review supporting documentation both subjects that are normally included in ao training similarly an audit at faa concluded that the agencys failure to provide refresher training for cardholders and aos may have contributed to violations of statutory sourcing requirements45 the failure to comply with sourcing statutes which require agencies to purchase certain goods and services from specified vendor categories may undermine congressional procurement objectives the javits wagneroday act jwod for example requires the government to buy office supplies and services from nonprofits that employ blind and disabled americans cardholder failure to comply with the provisions of jwod and other sourcing statutes is widespread enough that gao has estimated that tens of millions of dollars of purchase card transactions may have been conducted with vendors other than the ones congress intended46 43 office of management and budget circular a123 appendix b improving the management of government charge

under 100000 in fy1993 to 680000 in fy200047 after auditors expressed concerns that the government had issued too many credit cards and provided excessive credit limits factors that raised the risk of card misuse omb issued memorandum in april 2002 that required agencies to examine the number of purchase cards they issued and to consider deactivating all cards that were not demonstrated necessity48 that same year provisions in the bob stump national defense authorization act for fy2003 pl107314 required the department of defense dod to establish policies limiting both the number of purchase cards it issued and the credit available to cardholders49 these reforms contributed to net decrease of 380000 government purchase cards between fy2000 and fy2006 despite this decrease in the total number of purchase card users audits indicate that number of agencies including some with relatively large purchase card programs have yet to establish appropriate controls over card issuance and credit limits 2006 gao report on purchase cards at the department of homeland security dhs for example identified 2468 cardholders about 20 of all dhs cardholders who had not made any purchases in over year50 similarly congressionally directed audit of the veterans health administrations vhas 14 billion purchase card program found that vha had issued cards with credit limits up to 11 times greater than the cardholders historical spending levels thereby exposing its program to unnecessary risk51 it is not known how many other agencies have not developed and implemented appropriate internal controls over card issuance and credit limits so the extent of the governments financial exposure is also unknown policy proposals omb guidance omb director jim nussle in response to march

review of purchase card activity below the micropurchase threshold the memorandum also stated that omb is in the process of revising its charge card guidance in appendix b of circular a123 pending legislation several bills have been introduced in the 110th congress that address purchase card misuse the most comprehensive of these bills the government credit card abuse prevention act of 2007 was introduced in both the senate s 789 and the house hr 1395 on march 7 2007 the bill was drafted to implement the recommendations of gao regarding internal control weaknesses in both purchase and travel card programs53 the bill would require all federal agencies except the department of defense to implement more than dozen internal controls over their purchase card programs54 specifically the bill would require agencies to ensure that adequate records of cardholder credit limits and purchase activity are maintained cardholder statements and supporting documentation are regularly reviewed and reconciled cardholders and officials are provided with proper training agencies use available technology to monitor activity and identify fraud the number of cards issued and their credit limits are appropriate and payment dispute and cost recovery procedures are effective the bill would also mandate that nondod agencies develop penalties for card misuse and require igs to conduct periodic risk assessments and audits of agency purchase card programs to identify waste fraud and abuse provisions specific to dod would require increased use of technology to prevent and identify fraudulent purchases expand risk assessment and audit practices and develop more specific rules regarding card deactivation of former dod employees other purchase card legislation introduced in the 110th congress includes two bills that focus on micropurchases s 2300 the small business contracting revitalization act of 2007 which seeks to measure and promote the participation of small businesses in micropurchases made with purchase cards and s 680 the accountability in government contracting act of 2007 which would require the director of omb and the gsa administrator to work with vendors and

on march 27 2007 s 789 was favorably reported by the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs on april 10 2008 crs13 agencies to achieve savings when using purchase cards for making micropurchases55 in addition section 1005 of hr 5658 the duncan hunter national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2009 would require the secretary of defense to implement policies that ensure inventory and property systems are updated promptly after pilferable property is bought with purchase card56 other considerations staffing levels few agencies are able to dedicate employees to work full time as aos rather ao duties which include timeintensive activities such as reviewing cardholder statements often fall to staff who already have full workloads not surprisingly some aos have said it is difficult to find the time to carefully review purchase card statements because of the demands of their other responsibilities57 this problem may be compounded if the number of cardholders assigned to an ao referred to as the span of control increases there is governmentwide span of control policy but gao has recommended that agencies assign more than seven cardholders to each ao beyond that 71 ratio the ability of the ao to conduct effective oversight may be diminished particularly when the ao has other significant duties58 although data are limited audits have found that at some
