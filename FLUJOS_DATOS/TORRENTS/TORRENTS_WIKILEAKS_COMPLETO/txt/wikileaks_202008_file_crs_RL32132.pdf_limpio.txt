governments accounted for almost twothirds of this spending by far the primary payor for longterm care is the federalstate medicaid program which paid for almost half of all long term care spending in 2001 many states have devoted significant fforts to respond to the desire for home and communitybased care for persons with disabilities and their families nevertheless the financing of nursing home

icfsmr many believe that the current federal financing system pa id through medicaid is biased toward institutional care state governments face si gnificant challenges in refocusing their longterm care systems given the structure of current federal financing in this regard many states have devoted signif icant efforts to expand home and community based services for persons with disabilities and their families nevertheless financing of nursing home care primarily through the medicaid program still dominates most states spendi ng in longterm care today while advocates believe that the federa l government should play larger role in providing support for home and communi tybased care congress has not yet decided on whether or how to change current federal policy one possibility is that congress may continue an incremental appr oach to longterm care without major federal involvement leaving to state g overnments the responsibility for developing strategies that support home and commun itybased care within existing federal funding constraints and program rules to assist congress in its consideration of options for any future federal policy and to assist policymakers in

federal legislative perspective states choosing to modify their programs for longterm care face significant challenges financing of nursing home care has dominated longterm care spending for decades the federal financing structure that created incentives to support institutional care reaches back to 1965 number of converging factors have supported reliance on nursing home spending prior to enactment of medicaid homes for the aged and other public institutions were financed by combination of direct paymen ts made by individuals with their social security old age assistance oaa benef its and vendor payments made by states with federal matchi ng payments on behalf of i ndividuals the kerrmills medical assistance to the aged maa program enacted in 1960 predecessor to medicaid allowed states to provide medical services including skilled nursing home services to persons who were not eligible for oaa cash payments thereby expanding the eligible population1 in 1965 when kerrmills was transforme d into the federalstate medicaid program congress created an entitlement to skilled nursing facility care under the expanded program the social security amendments of 1965 required that states provide skilled nursing facility services and gave nursing home care the same level of priority as hospital and physician rvices amendments in 1967 allowed states to provide care in

for nursing home care grew by 50 in the 3year period beginning in 1967 in fy2001 medicaid spent 531 billion on institutional care for nursing homes and care in intermediate care facilities for the mentally retardedskilled nursing home care but needed more than room and board in 1987 congress eliminated the distinction between skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities effective in 1990 as result of these various amendments people eligible under the states medicaid plan are entitled to nursing home facility care that is if person meets the states income and asset requirements as well as the states functional eligibility requirements for entry into nursing home he or she is entitled to the benefit these early legislative developments we re the basis for the modern day nursing home industry significant growth in th number of nursing homes occurred during the 1960s from 1960 to 1970 the number of homes more than doubled from 9582 to almost 23000 and the number of beds more than tripled from 331000 to more than one million2 today there are about 17000nursing homes with 18 million beds 3 during the latter part of the 1960s and the 1970s nursing home care attracted great deal of congressional oversight as result of concern about increasing federal expenditures and instances of fraud and abuse that were becoming evident between 1969 and 1976 the subcommittee on long term care of the senate special committee on aging held 30 hearings on problems in the nursing home industry4 home care services received some congressional attention in the authorizing statute home health care services were one of the optional services that states could provide under the 1965 law three years later in 1968 congress amended the law to require states to provide home health care services to persons entitled to skilled nursing facility care as part of th eir state medicaid plan s effective in 1970 during the 1970s the department of healt h education and welfare now health and human services hhs devoted attention to alternatives to nursing home care through variety of federal research and demonstration efforts these efforts were undertaken not

legislative ac tion to expand home and communitybased services through medicaid when it aut horized the medicaid section 1915c home and communitybased waiver program under that authority known then as the section 2176 waiver program the secretary of hhs may waive certain medicaid state plan requirements to allow states to cover wide range of home and comm unitybased services to persons who otherwise meet the states eligibility requirements for institutional care the waiver provision was designed to alter the fact that the medicaid program had emphasized institutional care rather than

the rate of inflation for institutional longterm care was more than 100 annually7 although the oregon department of human services dhs wa s created in 1971 to unify fragmented service delivery system in the state the offices responsible for longterm care continued to have parate budgets and admin istrative leadership in order to address these concerns oregons state legislature decided to drastically reshape its medicaid longt erm care program in 1981 the state legislature combined the states unit on aging and its medicaid longterm care program this new division within dhs was charged with containing the costs of longterm care while at the same time promoting the option of home and communitybased care over nursing facility care over the last 20 years state officials have strived to cr eate coordinated system of longterm care where nursing homes are the placement of last resort the number of medicaid clients receiving home and community based services has been steadily rising in 2002 82 of medicaid longterm care clients were receiving home and communitybased care compared with only 40 of clients in 1985868 this dramatic increase is due in part to the diverse home and community based care options provided by the state these options include range of supported housing arrangements such as assisted living facilities resi dential care facilities adult foster care as well as inhome care where clients may select their own caregivers in 2001 the state legislature directed th states principal longterm care agency seniors and disabled serv ices division to administer

institu ted in the development of its longterm care system number of reports have concluded with similar findings among other things oregons success in moving clients to home and communitybased settings can be attributed to the legislative mandate to reinvest any costsavings from reductions in institutional care into the development of system that promotes home and communitybased care the

oregons longterm care system stems from its administrative structure oregons system is one of the few in the country to consolidate all of the various administrative and service functions into single state agency the goal of state officials over the last 20 years partially in response to seve ral state legislative mandate s has been the creation of seamless system for seniors and people with disabilities that favors care in community settings rather than in nursing homes or other institutions in 1981 on the final day of one of the l ongest legislative sessions in oregons history the state legislature passed sena bill 955 drastically reshaping oregons longterm care system the bill consolidated the states unit on aging and its medicaid longterm care program creating the senior services division which later became the seniors and disabled services division and is now seniors and people with disabilities the new division was charged with containing the costs of longterm care while at the same time creating longterm care system that supported the preference of people with disabilities for home and communitybased services vision was articulated in the legislation for longterm care system that embodies the human values of indepe ndence dignity privacy and choice10 in testimony to the us senate special committee on aging in 1998 roger auerbach the director of the seniors and di sabled services division stated that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32132crs12 11 roger auerbach reforming the delivery system testimony before the us senate special committee on aging mar 3 1998 crisis

is really proportionate to the clarity of our vision that vision which is now very clear is one of consumercentered individualized program delivered by coordinated accessible system11 the most recent reorganization spear headed by the legislature in 2001 consolidated all state longterm care functions into the single division of seniors and people with disabilities spd one of seven divisions within the department of human services it is unique among longterm care systems in the united states in that it incorporates the states medicaid agency the state unit on aging the state unit on developmental disabilities and the longterm care regulatory agency under single administrative structure and budget figure 2 portrays the primary functions pe rformed by spd and local agencies that collectively make up oregons longterm care system those functions are financial and functional determination of eligibility licensing and protective services financial reimbursement management of

law creating the current longterm care system supported strong role for the state s area agencies on aging aaas and allows for significant local control spd contracts with aaas that wish to administer longterm care programs in the state in areas wher the aaa chooses not to provide services primarily in the rural areas of eastern oregon state employees within the county human services office administer longterm care services and programs the result is that local service providers and admin istrators can choose the most appropriate administrative structure for their localities there are three types of service delivery models in oregon type type b1 and type b2 each type of delivery system is described below type in this service delivery model the aaa administers programs and services funded by the older americans act and the statefunded oregon project independence opi program for seniors aged 60 and over in type area the state operates local multi service office housed within the county human services office to administer medicaid for longterm care clients state employees develop care plans provide ongoi ng case management and license and monitor longterm care facilities for

state funded opi program for persons 60 and older and the states medicaid longterm care program fo r seniors 65 and over it does not provide medicaid services to people with physical disabilities who are under the age of 65 or to individuals with developmental disabilities in type b1 area the state operates local disability service office housed within the county human services office to administer medicaid and other stat programs for longterm care clients not served by the aaa there are seven type b1 areas in oregon type b2 this service delivery model administers all of the sameprograms that type b1 agencies may administer but also serves adults aged 18 to 64 with physical disabilities people with developmental disabilities are served in the disability service office there are eight type b2 areas in oregonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32132crs15 for the last several decades oregons department of human services has attempted to integrate its rvice delivery systems throughout the state oftentimes clients with complex needs were forced to visit multiple social service offices and provide the same information to multiple case workers in order to make it easier for clients to navigate the social service syst em in oregon the depa rtment has developed wrong door approach to service provi sion client should be able to walk into any area agency on aging or county

agencies on aging to serve as an informa tion center for variety of social service programs in the state management of services for persons with developmental disabilities in 2001 the state legislature ma ndated that spd administer programs for persons with developmen tal disabilities at the cal level county dhs offices employ staff to provide case management rvices other services are subcontracted to local providers which typically specialize in serving individuals with developmental disabilities licensing spd is responsible for licensing longterm care facilities and ensuring that quality care is delivered in both nursing homes and home and communitybased settings oregons licensing process includes inspection reporting on inspection outcomes or complaint inve stigations and sanctioning deficient facilities in spite of these regulatory responsibilities officials in the office of licensing and quality of care housed w ithin spd have attempted to move away from strictly

the states longterm care system in addition to managing clients care plans pe rforming preadmission screenings and determining client eligibility for medicaid case managers also monitor nursing facilities and communitybased care facilities because home and communitybased care requires more rigorous oversight by case managers to ensure the best placement of clients spd regulates the number of individuals case manager can serve depe nding on the type of care he or she is receiving in nursing facilities the staffing ratio is one case worker per 130 clients in adult foster care the staffing ratio is one case worker per 79 clients in residential care facilities and assisted living facilities the staffing ratio is one case worker per 100 clients and for inhome services the staffing ratio is one case worker per 69httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32132crs16 clients depending on the ty pe of service area where client resides case managers are employed by either the local area agencies on aging the disability service office or the multiservice office financial and functional eligibility determinations information about financia l eligibility for medicaid nd other state programs is gathered at the local level by caseworkers in the area agencies on aging the disability service office or the multise rvice office although in itial decisions on financial eligibility are made locally state officials within spd make the final eligibility determination functional eligibility is also determined at the local level in order to assist case managers in making eligibility determinations spd has developed number of automated tools to streamline the process the client assessment and planning system caps is computer system that assists caseworkers in determining eligibility and assigning

and the americans with disabilities act ada fo r failing to provide indivi duals with developmental disabilities the option of home and communitybased longterm care services with reasonable promptness25 the state and the plaintiffs settled the lawsuit in september 2000 the parties agreed that the settlement would apply not only to the plaintiffs named in the suit but also to all other similarlys ituated individuals with velopmental disabilities under the federal medicaid program thereby treating the lawsuit as class action26 as part of the agreement oregon agreed to implement its state plan for universal access to services for people with developmental disabilities over 6year period between 2001 and 2007 the plan provides for improved access to supportive services such as personal care inhome car respite care and job coaching so long as cost of services does not exceed 20000 annually per client by 2007 after the plan has been fully implemented supportive services must be provided within 90 days after the indivi dual is determined eligible for services comprehensive services or services costing more than 20000 per year will be offered to limited number of

period spending for home and communitybased services increased from 221 in 1990 to 628 in 2000 table 11 today more than 80 of medicaid clients receive longterm care in the community according to state officials these trends are due to number of factors implemented at varying times during the 1980s and 1990s these include legislativ mandate that called for preference in providing communitybased care over nursi ng home care implementation of the states preadmission screening program to divert patients from nursing homes implementation of oregon project inde pendence for persons who do not meet

figure 4 and table 12 according to state officials this increase is largely due to oregons use of medicaid upper payment limits under medicaid provisions states can be reimbursed by the federal gove

the difference between the upper payment limit and the state s reimbursement rate to nursing homes was transferred back to dhs in 2001 and used to fund increases in the reimbursement rates to nursing facilities and communitybased care facilities because of these transfers of state and fe deral funds the 28 increase in institutional spending between 2000 and 2001 is not repres entative of actual

issues in longterm care in oregon oregon officials and stakeholders identified issues in the states longterm care system in series of reports over the ears the following discussion highlights selected issues identified in reports by re searchers task forces and advocacy groups as well as issues that surfaced in crs inte rviews with state officials providers and consumers institutional bias in federa l funding and oregons response recurring theme in discussions of longterm care with state officials is the view that the federal financing system is biased towards institutional care this is largely due to the fact that nursing facility care is an entitlement under medicaid for persons meeting its eligibility criteria financing of institutional care is federal mandate home and communitybased care is not although states may choose to provide home and communitybased services under va rious medicaid options state officials indicate that state f unding constraints and the provider system that was created as result of the institutional entitlement make it difficult to reorient the system although oregon has been successful in provi ding the majority of its longterm care clients with home and communitybased services many officials believe that the federal system should equally support consumers choice to stay at home or in the community for most states the impetus for heavy reliance on institutional care is embedded in the structure of the federal medicaid sy stem resulting in vast funding disparities between institutional care and home and communitybased care over the last 20 years oregon has relied on number of strategies to ameliorate the institutional bias embedded in that system for example rather than relying on providers to refer hospital patients directly in to nursing homes oregon requires most residents to be screened before entering nursing hom patients level of impairment is evaluated and home and communitybased rvice options are discussed with the client and family members partially as result of this screening process the rate of hospital discharges directly into nursing homes is significantly lower than the national average another method to counter institutiona l bias is to control or downsize institutional capacity oregon controls its institutional capacity by requiring the approval of medicaid beds thr ough the certificate of need process described earlier and through limitation on reim bursements controlling the supply of state institutions for the developmentally disabled differs somewhat from that for nursing homes the state has closed all but one intermediate care facility for persons with developmental disabilities ove r the past several decades and as of 2001 fewer than 1 of persons with developmental disabilities were served in institutions the state could do so because these fac ilities were operated by state government virtually all nursing homes in the state are privately owned and therefore controlling or downsizing institutional capacity is not as direct as in the case of stateoperated facilities state officials indi cated that federal entitlement to nursing home care should be changed so that nursing homes are an exception rather than the rule in oregonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32132crs39 32 certain items are excluded such as an individuals home up to 2000 of household goods and personal effects life insurance policies with face value of 1500 or less an automobile with value up to 4500 and burial funds up to 1500 among other things home and communitybased care is considered first and then if services are judged to be inappropriate or unavailable the alternative is an institutional placement budget cuts recent state budget cuts have greatly impacted oregons long term care system after statewide ballot initiative to increase taxes was defeated by voters in january 2003 the state has been forced to make up its revenue shortfall with drastic cuts in number of social service programs seniors and people with disabilities spd had to reduce its longterm care spending by nearly 30 for the 2003 state fiscal year sfy spd decide d to cut funding fo r individuals whose impairment levels fell within service priority levels 1217 table 5 as of april 2003 over 4792 persons had lost medicaid ngterm care services over 16 of total program participants with potentially more cuts needed in the future by choosing to restrict medicaid rollment through f unctional eligibility criteria as opposed to caps on 1915c waiv er spending for example oregon was able to ensure that institutional services as well as home and community based services were effected by these budget reductions of the residents who lost medicaid services 3834 were receiving inhome services 765 were residing in communitybased assisted housing arrangem ents and 193 were residing in nursing facilities spd worked with the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to make changes to the states current waiver program to provide limited transitional services for those who longer qualify for medicaid in addition to reducing the number of pe ople eligible for medicaid the state also eliminated inhome supports for 3800 senior s who were not eligible for medicaid reduced reimbursement rates to medicaid longterm care providers by 15 to 30 and eliminated the states medically needy program for 8757 individuals medicaid eligibility require ments and access to services number of issues identified by state officials relate to medicaid eligibility for home and communitybased services persons need ing longterm care services paid for by medicaid must meet countab income and resource limits established by the state within federal require ments states may allow pers ons with income up to 300 of the federal ssi level to b ecome eligible for secti on 1915c home and community based waiver services th is level in 2003 is 1656 per m onth and is the level used by oregon for its waiver programs the re source level used by oregon for the waiver programs is the same as that for nursing home care that is in order to qualify for medicaid person may have resources th at do not exceed 2000 for an individual and 3000 for couple32 while these requirements limit the number of persons who may become eligible for medicaid they also act as barrier to many persons in need of longterm care who live at home for example state officials indicated that persons in need of home and communitybased care who live in their own homes do not feel comfortablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32132crs40 33 oregon department of human services seniors and people with disabilities at httpoddswebmhdhrstateorus pubscpmswaitsumhtmdepleting almost all of thei r liquid assets that may be needed for household expenses and emergencies oregon through its statefunded oregon project independence program has addressed some of these medicaid financial eligibility issues the oregon project independence program allows persons with income up to 200 of the federal poverty level up to 17720 per year in 2002 to b ecome eligible for statefunded home and communitybased services with resource or asset test individuals pay sliding scale fee for each service based on income this allows persons needing longterm care to receive services and gradually become eligible for medicaid rather than having to wait until all count able resources are depleted to the 2000 medicaid level waiting lists for persons wi th developmental disabilities waiting lists for services for persons with development disabilities have drawn attention across many states and in oregon despite the sizable amount of funding devoted to home and communitybased services for persons with developmental disabilities in oregon waiting lists for services ve been persistent problem according to state reports as of june 13 2002 4773 individuals were waiting to receive home and communitybased services of those 750 had been on the waiting list for less than 2 years 763 had been on the waiting list between 2 and 4 years and 3260 had been waiting for services for more than 4 years33 as result of the staley lawsuit approximately 5000 persons with deve lopmental disabilities are to be removed from the waiting list and receive services by 2007 longterm care staffing across the country states are faced with the challenge of finding sufficient numbers of qualified staff to pr ovide longterm care services many of the staffing shortages experienced in other states however are ameliorated in oregon by the states clie nt employed provide r cep program and nurse delegation program in 2001 approximately 20000 individuals needing long term care were served in their home by client employed providers state officials indicate that this program which allows clients to select unlicenced caregivers to provide longterm care services has greatly expanded the states ability to serve individuals in their homes th state has also addressed i ssues of staffing shortages through its nurse delegation pr ogram this program allows licensed registered nurses to delegate certain medical tasks of nursing to unlicenced caregivers state officials and providers maintain that the use of nur delegation has been essential to the expansion of home and community based care services in oregon in spite of the success of these two initiatives state officials expressed concern about finding adequate numbers of direct care workers def ined as home health aides nurse aides personal attendants and pe rsonal care aides particularly to serve persons with developmental disabilities in residential settings centralization of responsibility many states confront issues of fragmentation in the administration of l ongterm care programs oregons systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32132crs41 however is one of the few in the country to consolidate all of the various functions of its longterm care system into single state agency many state officials credit the success of oregons longterm care syst em to the centralization of responsibility within single administrative structure nd budget the goal of state officials over the last 20 years partially in response to several state legisla tive mandates has been the creation of seamless system for seniors and people with disabilities that favors care in community settings rather than in nursing homes or other institutions bounded choice state administrators recognize that with the aging population and increasing costs of longter m care they may need to rethink the design of their current system in the coming years administrators hope to incorporate concept of bounded choice in to the system where an individuals preferences for services are considered within the boundaries of service capacity and fiscal constraints the governors task force on the future of services to seniors and people with disabilities made number of recommendations for incorporating concept of bounded choice in oregons longterm care system the concept raises some difficult questions in light of the states ongoing commitment to promoting system that values consumer choice the task force hopes to pursue changes in federal regulations and the states waiver programs that would allow service packages to be designed within certain financial constraints other issues other issues raised by advocat providers and state officials are consumer choice in the fall of 2001 oregon initiated medicaid pilot project independent choi ces to offer consumers the option of expanded control over th eir longterm care services in this program spd authorizes clients to receive lump monthly payments in their bank accounts participants are then responsible for meeting their longterm care needs within that monthly allotment consumerdirected care of this kind often referred to as cash and counseling programs is not currently available on larger scale in oregon although state officials expressed their ongoing commitment to expand consumer choice within their long term care system estate planning and avoidance of estate recovery state officials reported that although there ma be small number of people sheltering assets in order to qualify for medicaid longterm care services sooner than they otherw ise would the number is growing an increasingly popular way of she ltering assets in oregon is to shelter assets in trusts ie pooled trusts annuities and other financial instruments that are deemed not available to the medicaid applicant to pay for longterm care or transferring assets to community spouses and other indi viduals particul ar concern was expressed about the use of special needs trusts among younger individuals with disabilities state officials also provided anecdotalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32132crs42 evidence of increasing avoidance of medicaid estate recovery requirements provider costs and liability insurance in oregon as in many states nursing home providers we re unanimous in their concern about the increasing costs of liability insurance and the absence of state caps on punitive damages this issue was raised by many of the provider groups that were interviewed for this study integration of medicare and medicaid advocates and state officials expressed an interest in eliminating the administrative inefficiencies associated with using multiple payers and delivery systems in poorly coordinated sy stem between medicare and medicaid one option might be to pool medi care and medicaid financing to promote financial and service integration and
