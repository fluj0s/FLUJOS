alliance among the republic greece and turkey provided for 950 greek nd 650 turkish soldiers to help defend the island however at that time the two major communities aspired to different futures for cyprus most greek cypriots favored union of the entire island with greece enosis and turkish cypriots preferred to partition the island taksim and unite turkish zone with turkey cypruss success as new
