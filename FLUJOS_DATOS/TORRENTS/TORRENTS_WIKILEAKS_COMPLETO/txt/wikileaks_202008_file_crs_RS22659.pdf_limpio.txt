government wit hout fatah the secular party that had dominated palestinian politics for decades wh ich refused to join hamasled coalition on april 7 2006 the united states and the eu announced they were halting assistance to the hamasled pa government but that humanitarian aid would continue to flow through international and nong overnmental organizations ngos the eu has been the pas largest donor since it was created in 1996 under the oslo peace accords at the same time israel began withholding bout 50 million in monthly tax and customs receipts that it collects for the pa in 2005 international assistance and the israelicollected revenues together accounted for about twothirds of pa revenues in addition the pa lost access to banking rvices and loans as banks around the world refused to deal with the it for fear of running afoul of us antite rrorism laws and being cut off from the us banking system the resulting fiscal crisis left the hamasled government unable to pay wages regularly and deepened poverty levels in th palestinian territori the hamasled government was forced to rely on shrinking domestic tax revenues and cash that hamas officials carried back from overseas press reports indicate that much of this cash emanated from iran3 by the end of 2006 tensions in the west bank and gaza strip were rising as living conditions deteriorated nd pa employees including members of the security forces went unpaid for weeks or m onths armed supporters of fatah and hamas clashed repeatedly trading accusations of blame settling scor and drifting into lawlessness more than 100 palestinians were k illed in the violence the mecca accord after months of intermittent talks on february 8 2007 fatah and hamas signed an agreement to form national unity government aimed at ending both the spasm of violence and the in ternational aid embargo that followed the formation of the initial hamas led government the accord was signed by pa president and fatah

israeli prime minister rabin and the late plo chairman yasir ar afat on september 9 1993 renounce violence and recognize israels right to exist in peace and security therefore some analysts suggest the new platform implicitly rejects violence and recognizes israel all the lands that were occupied in 1967 with jerusalem as its capital and at the same time affirms the palestinians right to resistance in all its forms and to defend themselves against any ongoing israeli ggression the new government commits to respect previous agreements signed by the palestine liberation organization plo but does not explicitly renounce violence or recognize israel4 the government platform states that any peace agreement reached will be submitte d for approval to either the palestine national council

and platform but also its actions6 some observers saw this as softening of the quartet position whic h could allow for possible resumption of direct aid european officials reportedly argued for more flexibility saying the government should not be judged purely on the semantics of its official platform but on the future actions of hamas many european policy makers hope that this strategy will encourage further moderation of hamas position and facilitate forward movement in the peace process defying the eu policy 10 european pa rliament members met with hamas prime minister haniyeh in gaza

russia has taken different approach to the hamas government from the beginning by maintaining contact with hamas officials and recently arguing to lift the aid embargo hamas political leader khalid mishal has twice visited moscow since hamas took power most recently in february 2007 foreign minister sergey lavrov has urged hamas l eaders to meet the quartet conditions but without success russian officials prefer to keep lines of communication open with all parties as they seek to position themselves as mediator between arabs and israelis this in turn would serve their larger ambition of reestablishing moscow as significant player in the region nonetheless the russians tinue to see the quartet as useful and necessary mechanism and are unlikely to break ranks with it completely the

abdullah called for an end to the international boycott of the pa in light of the agreement between fatah and hama s to form unity government in addition the summit communique relaunched the arab peace initiative of 2002 which calls for full israeli withdrawal from the territories occ upied in 1967 creation of an independent palestinian state with east je rusalem as its capital and just agreed upon solution to the refugee problem in exchange for an endofconflict agreement in which all arab states would enter into peace agreements and establish normal relations with israel analysts speculate that the recent saudi diplomatic drive has several purposes first is to end the intrapalestinian violence and resume longs talled peace negotiations with israel second by securing arab and perhaps internationa l recognition of government that includes hamas and then relaunching p eace talks with full arab backing the saudis hope to bring hamas into the arab consensus moderate its antiisraeli ideology and ultimately get it to accept twostate solution finally by creating momentum toward peace the saudis are seeking to undermine the regional influe nce of iran and rejectionist groups like hezbollah some observers also note that saudi efforts to gain acceptance of the unity government and restart israelipalestinian peace talks may be an effort to set the price for saudi cooperation on other u s policies in the region notably toward iran other arab states among the arab states only libya refused to attend the riyadh summit and join the call to back the new palestinian government and

acknowledges israels right to exist and adheres to all previous international agreements and understandings it exempts funds for humanitarian aid and democracy promotion it also provides 20 million to establish fund promoting palestinian democr acy and israelipalestinian peace the law limits the pas representation in the united states as well as us contact with palestinian officials in signing statement the president asserted that these and several other provisions of the bill impinge on the executive branchs constitutional authority to conduct foreign policy and he therefore viewed them as advisory rather than mandatory the original house vers ion of the bill hr 4681 passed on june 23 2006 had been seen by many observers as more stringent as it would have made the provision of us aid to
