for approximately 554 million people in fy2003 the latest official enrollment figu re to qualify applicants income and resources also called assets must be within program financial standards these standards vary considerably among states and different standard s apply to different population groups within state medicaid eligibility is also subject to categorical restrictions generally it is available only to wincome persons who are aged blind disabled members of families with dependent children and certain other pregnant women and children the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program provided cash assistance to 22 million families in fy2003 tanf is structured as flexible block grant to states and it was the centerpiece of the 1996 welfare reform law replacing previous entitlements to cash assistance under tanf eligibility thresholds and benefit levels are established by states but federal law imposes work requirements and time limits on benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22035crs2 prior to tanf families qualifying for cash assistance under the former aid to families with dependent children afdc program were automatically eligible for and in most states automatically enrolled in dicaid in contrast there is direct link between eligibility for tanf and eligibility for medicaid alt hough tanf eligibility does not confer automatic medicaid eligibility medicaid entitlement was retained for those individuals who meet th requirements of the former afdc program as in effect on july 16 1996 these old statespecific af dcrelated income st andards are typically well below the federal poverty vel fpl however states may modify ie liberalize or further restrict these criteria for determining medicaid eligibility for lowincome families like those receiving tanf anecdotal evidence suggests that some states have chosen to align income rules for tanf and medicaid thus facilitating medicaid coverage for some tanf recipients while some stat also provide medi caid to higherincome adults under waivers of progra m rules the afdcrelated rule s are the main pathway into medicaid for lowincome working parents transitional medical assistance tma is available for families who lose medicaid due to increased hours of work earnings or child support payments there are two separate tma provisions in medicaid law one that perm anently requires four months of coverage and another that requires six to 12 months of c overage but is subject to sunset rule under the latter provision qua lifying families receive an initial six months of tma second six months of tma is provided to those familie s who were covered during the entire first sixmonth period nd whose earnings are below 185 of the poverty level the six to 12month tma provision expired on december 31 2005 but was reinstated retroactively to this da and extended through 2006 under the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 tma can be particularly important for low income parents since there are few other ways through which such adults can main tain medicaid coverage or private health insurance however over the years cong ress has created severa l other mandatory and optional coverage categories for children that are tied to income leve ls at or above the poverty line up to 185 of the fp l for infants at state option another pathway for lowincome children in particular is the schip established in 1997 schip builds on medicaid by providing health insurance to uninsured children in families with income above applicable medicaid income standards tanf children ineligible for medicaid due to income are likely to qualify for schip if they meet other eligibility rules each state defines the gr oup of children who may enroll in schip using factors such as geography age income and resources residency disability status access to other health insurance and duration of schip eligibility as of october 2004 39 states covered at least some groups of child ren in families with in come at or above 200 fpl states provide schip children with health insurance that meets specific standards for benefits and costsharing or throug h their medicaid programs or through combination of both coverage for adults under schip is restrict ed to special circum stances as of may 2005 nine states arizona california co lorado illinois minnesota new jersey oregon rhode island and wisconsin had been granted approval specifically to enroll one or more categories of adults with ch ildren typically parents of medicaidschip children caretaker relatives legal guardians andor pregnant women three states also covered childless adults parents may also be cove red through schip programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22035crs3 providing premium assistance with employe rsponsored health insurance for eligible schip children concerns about underutilization of schip were raised early in the program and are still voiced by some today but enrollment is growing in fy2004 the number of children ever enrolled in schip during that year reached nearly 62 million during that same year about 646000 adults we re enrolled in the program the medicaid picture is more complicated analyses of program administrative data show that between 1995 and 1998 during the early years of the newly established tanf program the number of ablebodied adults and children on medicaid fell while the number of aged beneficiaries stayed r oughly constant and the number of persons of all ages with disabilities rose slightly for adults and children reductions were greatest among those eligible for medi caid via afdcrelated pathways perhaps due to confusion about the relationship between tanf and dicaid eligibility these losses were only partially offset by enrollment gains through other eligibility routes especially among children in the late 1990s enrollment declines were also affected by strong economy high employment rates and rising income lack of awareness of continuing eligibility culturallanguage barriers and immigration issues eg fiveyear ban on medicaid enrollment for certain aliens entering the us after august 22 1996 medicaids historical ties to welfare nd its associated stigma the often arduous enrollment process itself and agency errors different medicaid enrollme nt picture emerged at the beginning of the 2000 decade program administrative data fo r the fy2000fy2003 period show increases in enrollment in medicaid overall and for all types of beneficiaries with the largest enrollment gains for adults and children in fy2003 the number of adults and children ever enrolled in medicaid during th at year reached 144 million and 274 million respectively reasons for the increased enrollment among children and adults include the economic downturn that began in 2001 drop in employersponsored insurance and new or expanded medicaid eligibility pathways through waivers and liberalization of income requirements for the afdcrelated group future considerations both medicaid and schip have eligibility rules that leave some members of low income families without coverage most notably parents reinstatement and extension through 2006 of six to 12 months of tma fo r tanf recipients who move from welfare to work was included in the recently passed deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109 171 some states have used waiver authority to cover childless adu lts and parents under medicaid and schip however pl 109171 bars coverage of nonpregnant childless adults through new waiv ers using schip funds in general further simplification of medicaid and schip program rules streamlining of enrollment processes and additional outreach have been deemed necessary for improving coverage rates fo r tanf eligibles and other groups even though states received some fiscal relief from the federal government in fy2003 and fy2004 to help offset medicaid and other s hortfalls expanded coverage of the tanfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22035crs4
