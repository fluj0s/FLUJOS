not included in baseline si nce their reauthorization is not addressed by the farm bill b other provisions in the farm bill primarily consist of savings associated with the federal crop insurance

comparison of previous and new law the text and summary of the new farm bill are posted on the websites of the house agriculture committee and senate agriculture committee httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21233crs6 selected talking points following are some of the arguments offe red in debate over the final new measure crs takes position on these or any other views the new farm bill pro will address continuing economic problems including lowest real net farm cash income since 1930s and 5th straight year of low prices without it farm income and land values will plunge maintains market orientation by giving farmers flexibility to plant crops based on market signals unbound by most governmentimposed supply controls or supply management market prices and production will be minimally impacted is balanced regionally helping both southern and northern tier crops and spreading dairy be nefits nationwide fully complies with the fy2002 budget resolution permitting the expenditure of another 735 billion in direct spending over 10 years above april 2001 baseline it provides more in subsidies than under the 1996 farm law as supplemented by subsequent emergency farm aid complies with trade obligations new circuit breaker requires cuts in trade distorting subsidies so that their annual 191 billion limit is not breached it also places the us in stronger position to negotiate new agricultural trade reforms the us will not unilaterally cut its own support until others do so whether they are domestic supports or import barriers foreign agricultural tariffs average 62 compared to 12 for the us is the largest investment in conservation in recent farm bill history new 171 billion 80 over baseline will help stimulate rural economies by spreading farm payments through rural economies but also by adding 870 million for innovative rural development will worsen farmers economic situation by inflating land values especially for the 42 of farmers who rent land and stimulating overproduction causing farm prices and incomes to decline further maintains outmoded commodityoriented policies where major subsidies are tied to prices of just few major row crops this plus target prices nd loan rates well above market prices will continue to distort production and prices provides the largest benefits to just handful of farm belt states 75 of all payments will go to just 13 states was enacted as ne wer baseline shows the us budget deficit worsening new lower commodity price forecasts also mean this bill will cost much more than 735 billion which could make it the most expensive farm bill in history at time of other more pressing national priorities has features that will be viewed by other countries as violating us obligations the limit likely will be breached and the circuit breaker will be administratively and politically infeasible to employ it undermines us negotiating credibility including the us stated position that subsidies should be reduced worldwide many countries sharply criticize the new us law and are considering increases in their own subsidies and import barriers spends four times as much money on commodity price support as on conservation will help few rural areas only small portion of rural countie s have agricultural bases and in those farm benefits do not generate good jobs and longterm growth
