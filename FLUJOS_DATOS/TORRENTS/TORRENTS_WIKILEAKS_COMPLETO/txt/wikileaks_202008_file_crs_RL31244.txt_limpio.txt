from fy2002 through fy2007 all but five authorizations are for unspecified amounts such sums as may be necessary for the years fy2003 through fy2007 with regard to appropriations the total for esea programs was 186 billion in fy2001 the total for fy2002 is 219 billion for esea programs as amended by nclba the number of appropriations is sometimes counted in terms of line items for fy2001 there were 57 line items in appropriations for esea programs for fy2002 the number is 45 the counts of authorizations and appropriations do not necessarily correspond to the number of programs other definitions may bring other results for k12 programs outside of esea such as the education for homeless children and youth program or certain indian education programs administered by the bureau of indian affairs bia nclba includes an additional six authorizations of appropriations five of these authorizations are funded in fy2002 for total appropriation of 2258 million in the latest legislative

education funding authorizations and appropriations for fy2002 introduction this report summarizes the authorizations of appropriations for the k12 education programs of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 esea as amended by the 107th congress in particular it lists and totals the specific authorizations of appropriations in pl 107110 hr 1 the child left behind act of 2001 nclba the nclba details are shown in table 1 which also includes comparable appropriations for fy2001 and fy20021 this report will be revised when regular fy2003 appropriations are enacted for esea programs final action on fy2003 appropriations is expected to be high on the list of priorities for the 108th congress table 1 shows that for fy2002 nclba includes 45 specific esea authorizations of appropriations the precise number of programs authorized can be an issue however in part because several nclba authorizations include multiple activities previously authorized and in some cases funded as separate programs most notably the esea title v part d fund for the improvement of education fie authorizes 21 distinct activities 14 of these were specifically funded in fy2001 and 14 are funded in fy2002 as well in this report however the fie is counted as single authorization of appropriations for fy2002 the table summarizes the amounts authorized for fy2002 by nclba of the 45 specific esea authorizations 16 are authorized for such sums as may be necessary the authorizations of appropriations total 263 billion for fy2002 for the remaining 29 esea programs as amended by nclba all esea programs are authorized through fy2007 with virtually all authorized for such sums as may necessary for each of the years fy2003 through fy2007 there are five exceptions where dollar amounts are specified for each year 1 title i part grants to local 1 in the latest legislative action the hr 1 conference report hrept 107334 december 13 2001 was signed into law by the president on january 8

4 title v part b voluntary public school choice and 5 title v part d the fie the total fy2003 authorization for these five programs is 1865 billion with regard to appropriations there were 57 lineitem amounts for esea programs in fy2001 and 45 line items for fy2002 the correspondence of line items to programs is as inexact as the relationship between authorizations and programs as indicated above there is single line item in the fy2002 appropriations for the fie but from these funds specific allocations are made for 14 distinct programlike activities in aggregate the appropriations for all esea programs totaled 186 billion in fy2001 the fy2002 appropriations for esea programs total 219 billion an increase of nearly 18 compared to the fy2001 amount for k12 programs outside of esea such as the education for homeless children and youth program or certain indian education programs administered by the bureau of indian affairs bia nclba includes an additional six authorizations of appropriations as table 1 shows five of these authorizations are funded in fy2002 for total appropriation of 2258 million data for table 1 are based on two conference reports fy2002 authorization levels are based on hrept 107334 december 13 2001 the nclba conference report to reauthorize the esea hr 1 and fy2001 and fy2002 appropriations are based on hrept 107342 december 18 2001 the labor health and human services and education lhhsed appropriations act 2002 hr 3061 several cautions should be exercised when considering nclba and esea funding provisions an authorization of appropriation is only an authorization as is obvious from the table the congress can and does enact actual appropriations at different funding level the number of programs that are counted in this report is determined by the specific number of authorizations of appropriations and line items in appropriations tables these definitions do not take into account the number of programs projects or activities under single authorization or lineitem appropriation other definitions for programs may give different program counts the use of such sums as may be necessary for the authorization level of several different programs makes it difficult to compare totals since such unspecified amounts cannot be added into cumulative total the fy2002 appropriations are those provided by hr 3061 hrept 107342 the lhhsed appropriations for fy2002 these amounts can be modified by the enactment of further legislation during fy2002 crs3 table 1 k12 education programs fy2001 and fy2002 appropriations and fy2002
