19332002 edited by geoffrey s becker specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry division summary since 1933 congress has required the us department of agriculture usda to administer various price and income support programs for us farmers some standing authority for these programs is provided by three permanent laws from 1938 1948 and 1949 however congress frequently alters the basic provisions of these laws the omnibus law now guiding farm support through 2007 is the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 this report will be updated if events warrant historical notes farm commodity programs were product of the great depression after world war i farm prices dropped from their wartime highs as economic recovery in europe lessened the demand for us farm products many producers struggled financially throughout the 1920s their voluntary cooperative efforts to bolster prices mainly by controlling supplies failed meanwhile farm advocates in congress called for more aggressive government intervention the situation became more acute when farm prices fell by more than 50 between 1929 and 1932 alone and net farm income plummeted even more precipitously about fourth of the population resided on farms at the time compared with less than 2 today congress responded by passing the agricultural adjustment act of 1933 see below among the first pieces of new deal legislation proposed by incoming president franklin d roosevelt key features of the new law included mandatory usda price support for specified commodities direct subsidy payments to farmers and supply controls congress has frequently amended the early legislation modifying program operations or creating new support techniques in response to changing conditions in the
