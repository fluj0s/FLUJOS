6810c11 class viii tape 15 auditors additives lists and case supervision well i forgot my notes which lecture number is this fifteen lecture number fifteen and what is the date eleventh of october that brought you up to present time eleven october ad 18 the subject of my lecture this evening is auditors talk too much its impolite but its the first discovery i made about auditors when i was first training auditors back in the late 40s i did train few experimentally and along the line and i found out they all had one frailty they said too much now when cs gets session that looks nearly perfect and he gets it and he says great and then couple of days later the pc falls on his head something has obviously happened in the session which wasnt recorded the most frequent thing that hastened in the session is an auditor additive of comment or attitude which is additive to the business of auditing now it isnt necessarily slight the additive can be fantastic ill give you an exact direct example that is exact and direct the auditor asking for arc breaks not noted in the report form but the auditor asking for arc breaks says now if you knew anything was wrong you wouldnt hold it from would you you wouldnt refuse to tell would you now youve youre giving the straight dope that fns an arc break needle what you see on the auditing report is arcu cdei something like this he was gentling an arc break and apparently indicated the thing and then that craziness ensued that isnt in the report cs is actually at the mercy of the auditor attitude and additive because the attitude itself is also an additive when you look at an auditing session and since my lecture yesterday actually youre to be congratulated on the org 8 you floated nineteen out of twenty one to the examiner which is fantastic so thank you applause thanks very well done now the business of the smooth tr is simply to put across to the pc and keep the pc interested in his own bank and his own case so therefore the auditor who would say see the pcs looking for an arc break all of sudden he shatters with this oh well now you wouldnt hold anything from would you yeah youre really telling the he hasnt got the foggiest notion dont you see the auditor as personality isnt there bang all of sudden the personality intrudes what does the pc try to do he tries to hold it off stow it and he parks himself to that degree in the session do you see that alright now lets take another one lets take another one pc says this is also an actual on the auditors report it reads what do you do to make others wrong pc says he doesnt do anything fn but the pc an hour or two later and the following day was found to be fantastically upset really fabulously upset after an auditing session the pc is upset what the devil is this hes supposed to run his service facsimile supposed to have gotten bunch of fns whats he doing all upset well somebody could say well the technology doesnt work you know hmm look the technology works but somebody just worked too damn well what actually transpired in that brief period between writing down question about making others wrong and what is noted as pc says he doesnt have any was something on this order you say you dont have any ah come ant come off of it come off of it come off of it people have hundred of these things what do you do an arc broke needle how would you like to have that blow up in your face in session totally unexpected totally unreasonable now when it goes so far as just this the pc has cognition he says you know i dont think i have that problem anymore you know hes looking at this he thinks thats great you know it just fned and so forth and the auditor says oh thats great boy thats great glad to hear it boy thats really with it whew it said fn there the cognition is written here but what happened right afterwards see what it is is distraction sudden distraction and session is supposed to smooth out the pc what happens to the pc if enturbulance is run into it so what an auditor says just before the session during the session and right after the session in those three immediate periods which are additive to the actual business of the session are all additives of highly useless derogatory backwards nature theyre all for the birds an auditor who has to be interesting who has to think he has to persuade the pc who does this who does that actually is building up on top of the top of standard tech bunch of additives which prevent it from working that line of action has the cs at its mercy because it isnt recorded in the report you can get report which apparently looks ok and from that standpoint and if youve not sending people to the examiner youve just about had it then what you get you hear from the doctor or you hear from somebodv else or you hear from the family or hear from the registrar jukes was here last week and when he came in he said he was signing up for fa fa fa fow and you know he hasnt been back whats the matter you look at the session theres nothing in the session that indicates anything why see he came to get smoothed out and got roughed up well what roughed him up he put his attention inside you know he looked inward and somebody forced his attention forcefully outward and just about the time he started to look inside somebody flipped his attention outward so he goes out of session that is the commonest source of outofsessionedness now rough tr is one thing that tends to but it is not actually as near session destroyer as the additives the comments why comment see why comment now some auditors think to be agreeable they have to laugh with the pc i never do pc is not aware of anyhow he wouldnt know whether i was laughing with him or not laughing with him besides i havent got anything to laugh about its his joke laughter ive had pcs chortle and burble and giggle and cognite from one end of the session to the other while i was sitting there not with any expression on my face now its rather difficult to assume noexpression you do have face the next point of evaluation you have somebody who is illintentioned in some fashion or another on the examiner line pc goes to the examiner and the examiner looks him over and says oh my god what happened to you pcs feeling great actually maybe the examiner has very bad case of myopia and hes trying to see what pc it is something like this and the examiner squints and looks at the pc and the pc thinks theres something wrong with him and it kills the float so there is subject called noexpression there is subject but this is normally what you will find back of the false auditing report it is the auditor additive now theres another thing an auditor can do god help us there is another thing he can do is to fail to give the next command in other words hes not there at all now this can also be deadly when you have somebody whos very green auditing he is liable to chicken get scared and he sees hes put the pc down the track in some fashion or another doesnt quite know what hes doing all of sudden the pcs face turns red or something like this and he goes he freezes now when he does that the pc then has to extrovert take control of the situation and somehow or another come out of it but hes been put into it by another being and he has to come out of it by himself so he actually doesnt make it to that degree he doesnt make it so it hangs him up on the track now all of these actions act to hang the pc up on the track the additives the comments and on the other hand the failure to state the pc comes into session the auditor all of sudden forgets what hes supposed to ask for and sits there and looks at the pc and tries to look in his papers he doesnt put in any rfactor he doesnt say ive got to see here what im supposed to do because itd be too derogatory of his attitude or something and he might sit there for minute or two without saying anything racking his wits out the pc goes half way around the bend because hes expecting something to happen that doesnt happen or right in the middle of crucial situation the auditor fails to follow the same patter that he has just followed engram one pattern correct engram two he blows it he tells him to go earlier and then in locating the incident his patter blows up he forgets to ask for well he forgets to ask for the date forgets to ask what it is what does he see forgets to ask for the duration and then just says go through it now that would be maddening situation do you see theres an infinite number of varieties by which an omission could also rough up pc so auditing along with standard tech is that thin narrow path through being there enough to get the session done and not being there enough to put on vaudeville show do you see this is the one thing that is usually hardest to teach if i were running an activity where i was very suspicious and i could be more suspicious of sessions than i am sometimes my level of trust is too good but i would actually put it on slow play tape recorder which is voice actuated tape recorder so that the entirety of the session would run off on tape something of this nature then it could be checked back now i wouldnt necessarily put this on as constant action but if i had one pc if i just had one pc fall on his head after he was audited and i got report in which seemed to be well done resort and the pc promptly fell on his head and so forth i would be thinking in terms of listening to that session i would then want spy system you know where microphone can be taped or i would want that now these these spy systems can be escaped its simple matter just never use the auditing room thats bugged yes its happened three auditing rooms had microphones in them so that sessions and auditors could be checked and then they were never used nobody ever seemed to give session in those rooms well at once one should have become very wary because it so happened at that particular moment the session were very very very additive the reports looked great and the sessions looked like clown show at the circus lot of yik yak going on several cases messed up and so on it was by auditor additive so it isnt slight now one of the ways an auditor additive can occur is with cs an auditor who is auditing his own pc he doesnt have cs around and you will occasionally be in that position is already breaking down on cs in the first place he has talked to the pc in the second place he knows the auditor so his cs is busted on two counts but there is thin way to get away with it and that is merely to make rigid rule never to cs during session never never cs during session write up your cs before the session follow your cs rigorously and religiously when you get to the end of the cs end the session your next cs write it up dispassionately as though you had nothing whatsoever to do with it even cuss yourself out but if you hold that you hold that as very very sound rigid principle you wont get auditor additives into your session which is to cs at the same time auditing is occurring because nothing can be more confusing and it can lead you into an immediate and direct q and you excuse the q and on the basis that youve changed the cs do you follow and gradually these two things merge until you become almost educated in q and well just audit the pc on what he needs right now lets see and you sit down now the pc himself is distracting hes somebody to hold on line and if you want to deliver all your sessions into the hands of the pc why then just never cs them so before the session if you were doing this sort of thing before the session you would look over the folder and you would write up your cs as good cs thats what were gonna do when you go into the session thats the cs you execute and when youre all done with the session with that cs done and you write up another cs before the next session and you just win you just win win win youd just be absolutely fascinated it gets this kind of an oddity somebody comes in and says would you audit and you say yes just minute wheres your folder ill get your folder yes come back in fifteen or twenty minutes and ill rive you session get the guys folder from wherever it is go through the thing figure it out write down your cs from the folder deliver your session now the one the one type of session that isnt true in is when it isnt session its an assist somebody comes bunging up to you and they just got the railroad rail run through their brisket or something of this sort you had better know the cs for assists so well that you simply go into that and dont do anything else if its very handy the spot where he was hurt youre going to do contact if its not very handy youre goina to do touch assist if he is at all auditable you are going to run him through the engram of the incident if it gets heavy and sticks youre going to go to the earlier incident earlier similar incident thats all the csing there is as far as ruds are concerned you could make some little gesture at trying to put in the ruds but you dont have to fly anything you understand because hes got the ptp youre looking at it hes actually in the rudiments now you ordinarily wouldnt run rudiment with an engram but ordinarily guy like that isnt in position to run the engram on you can do the contact assist you can do the touch assist theres very often on severe one theres got to be some medical patch up of some kind or another now when he comes back remember this is not an assist this is session now youre going to fly the ruds and youre going to run the engram of injury or earlier similar now somebodys just lost their brother or something of this sort and they come in to you crying and theyve got to rush off to the funeral or the hospital or something like that i assure you there is so little you can do about it that the more you try to do about it the worse off youreagonna be let them handle what theyve got to handle when they come back formal session secondary earlier similar secondary those are the actions which you take if you dont take the two actions which ive just given you lot of guys are going to hang up youll see people going around in grief very upset you ask them and somebody somebody ran recall it or something keyed it out they didnt erase it and it keeps keying back in again you see this guy all bunged up and you say whats the matter whats the matter well he says about two or three months ago i broke my leg and you say anybody ever run the engram yes i had touch assist its actually the formal entirely different thing so that there is formal auditing side of this and the cs for that is very exact you go in you do just that you do what youre supposed to do at the moment of emergency you dont have to fly the ruds contact assist or its touch assist if the objects and so forth arent available you bring em around any way you can you have them tended to by the plumbers give him shot of morphine anything like that if theyre in agony and then when they have progressed and they are not in state of physical shock why they can stand up to run an engram but by that time they can also stand up to flying their ruds do you follow so later on when you run the engram or the secondary youre not doing an assist thats just session do you get the difference between these two things so an assist you can handle the apparent ptp that is in front of you without cs if you always know what the cs for it is and ive just given it now if you want to commit professional suicide its to badger badger around with somebody without set up cs or case study in front of you because youre liable to run into some very tigerish situations ill give you an idea you say well he just mentioned this he just mentioned his brothers death something like this he just mentioned his brothers death but this secondarys never been run ill run it ahhh how how what were you doing well you say its ok because it fned and ill just add in and ill run this secondary here and you dont know if that case is going to fly or not on this subject you dont know anything about it lets take look at this now ill give you few little tips of one kind or another in doing cses in doing cs you should be far more careful to set up the case to be audited than an auditor ordinarily would be you look for places to take charge off of this case lets shave this case down you look for symptoms and signs of very overcharged or specialtype case somebody carts you in six inch thick review folder ahh resistive case you dont immediately say hes been badly audited for the last two years because the law of averages are that some time during the last two years he has run into an auditor who could audit and if hed run into an auditor that could audit he wouldnt have it six inches thick itd only be three inches thick do you get the idea so obviously if all this period of time nobodys been able really to pack up this case and figure out what it is all about why in that length of time if nobody has theres something very very very peculiar and the thing that is peculiar this you have to keep in mind the thing that is peculiar is standard tech is out on it theres dear old lady i think she even wore youve heard speak of this old lady before she even wore the little bonnet with the flower off the top of long stem and when she walked the bonnet flower bobbed she was the most precise prim proper little old lady you ever saw in your life and nobody could get to first base on her case i think her tone arm was dirty tone arm and nobodyd ever been able to pick any withholds or overts off of her what we used was the exaggerated overt which is perfectly valid it works its perfectly valid somebody wont give you up his overts and so forth you its rather harsh but perfectly valid way of pulling an overt you multiply the overt what you are trying to get them to confess to is so much more horrible than what they are than what they are guilty of do you see but you can actually make up list for the auditor have the pc questioned on the following points murder bank robbery desertion child slaughter bigamy see you can put down list like that horrible the little old lady said she wasnt guilty of any of those crimes all shed ever done was commit adultery on her husband for the last forty years with all of his friends and it blew the case sky wide and handsome and it rolled beautifully what was wrong with the case the ruds were out that was all but this was one of the most resistive cases in whole area it was famous case ruds out and so they go so they are and in your csing in your csing you want to get some kind of an estimate of how how tough is this cookie you can write up you can write up and broaden enormously the seven types of cases they ougnt to be called by the way special cases to your pcs people like to be special cases not resistive cases but you can write very very large assessment sheet out of those seven resistive cases furthermore you can assess it sectionally you notice the first time it was ever assessed the former therapy read once and then went out and out of valence was the item well now you could have another assessment done or you could just grab the brass ring as you went by and assume also that theres former therapy and your next action is former therapy run the engrams of former therapy you already got the assessment out of it see it fell on the first one now if you wanted to be more positive about it you could take whole assessment sheet of just former therapy you see that it read once now you can broaden this it slashed once and then went out so theres something there now we can broaden and we can list any kind of former therapy that we can think of and we could shake out of the hamper the exact type of former therapy it was now that would be important because you see some former therapies are engrams and some former therapies can be rehabbed now in hypnotism and yoga and several other analogous practices and so forth there is rehab available furthermore drug therapy under sedation for long period of time and so forth is very often rehabbable so thats already on the list drugs but it might not come up under the heading of former therapy people this personal say well i never took drugs i was just under morphine for seven years in the general hospital we see this all the time so you can do an expansion you can do an expansion and what i told you earlier in session you have got in session only to touch the corner of something and you can slide in on it its as though the bank flew little tiny flags out to the side and you can see these little flags and your job is to try to find one of these little flags and slide in on it now you saw for instance the guy the guy has sciatica or something of this sort and this youre not trying to cure his sciatica its just an index of case what the hells he doing with sciatica or whatever it is whats he doing with this hes grade three release he shouldnt have psychosomatic illness you get the idea i mean thats your think hey this guys been audited he shouldnt be doing that theres something goofy out here some place alright lets see if we can pinpoint this now all youre really doing is looking for an area of charge youre not trying to process against sianificance you just want to discharge this case when this case is sufficiently discharged you couldnt care less about the flat feet of humanoids thats why im very insulted when the medicos and so forth say youre busy healing nobodys interested in healing bodies but you take fellow who is who is ill in some quarter or another i can assure you that theres sweat deal of charge available in that area do you see the case is heavily charged its aberrated in some fashion so your job is how do you discharge this case as case supervisor now your first and foremost way to charge the case is send him up through the grades thats your first and foremost way to charge case next grade hes made the grade good send him onto the next grade great now lets say he has had these grades according to his record and hes still got lumbosis now you should get curious at this point as to what this is all about because what it is actually is that grade is out some place or rud is out some place now theoretically you could put in the ruds ahead of the sessions you could also put them ahead of major action or an engram in life you could also put them in at the beginning of track you could do all sorts of weird things with rudiments but it is very very touchy situation i assure you to start running back ruds which are not limited in the command now you could put the ruds in for the last session if you said the last session you could even put the ruds in in the last few sessions by saying lately see lately have you been audited over an arc break lately otherwise youre liable to dive clear back to the beginning of track or you can actually earlier similar when you start putting in ruds earlier you can actually do an earlier similar clear on back to god help us now you could say the date of the engram is 1862 and you could say just prior to that incident what rudiment was out now youre stuck with it because youre gonna have to say earlier similar earlier similar earlier similar earlier similar and oh my god youre going to have to start running this case on nothing but rudiment clear back to the beginning of track the case youre running it on is in shape to pick up an arc break ahead of incident 1 hes never even heard of body thetan you see why its one of these things like r212 you hardly dare trust it to anybodies hands because it works so fast but it isnt this isnt matter of trust its simply matter of the second you start putting in ruds on earlier similar youre liable to get rud hung now the only thing you can do with it is earlier similar you start putting ruds that far back and youre getting the whole track ptp the whole track arc break and this is going to be run on case which isnt prepared to run anything like that and the casell fall on its head just sure as hell case runs just below the level of its available reality the current reality of the case demonstrates how much charge you can set off the case what is the current reality of the case now person who is at low down in the lower graces and so on he maybe has many many things wrong with him but he has reality of any kind whatsoever it wouldnt even read on the meter do you follow so your safest cs is on something that will read and therefore you take the assessment you can actually have some fellow who is going around on crutches and you say what is wrong with you and he could tell you ive got an ear ache and you could say weil then something wrong with your legs or something like that oh well that yeah thats thats just nothing it just it bothers well if he never got well physiologically and after something or other theres obviously some terrific charge on the case or body that is holding it that far out of line and your task as case supervisor is is it available well its only available if he has some awareness of it and the way you measure his awareness is with meter now you can look all the way through folder find an awful lot of blunders and have somebody try to put these blunders to rights particularly on somebody who wasnt trained you try to put these blunders to rights you know them youve seen them in the folder you order foolishly as cs to go through all of the persons earlier grades and do all of the auditing and point out all of the overruns and bpc in all of the earlier grades and youre liable to find the auditor youre csing for in sudden fire fight with the pc under the heading of invalidation the guy thought his lower grades were great so that is why you take these little assessments just let teach you that you can see whats wrong is it real to the pc the way you measure whether or not it is real to the pc is not what is the most wrong but what is the most real to the pc and so you write up an assessment now you know very very very well that this guy goes out and wrecks cars this seems to be the thing he does this is life manifestation now you from your viewpoint are very foolish if youre trying to going to get him over wrecking cars if thats the goal you set as cs why to hell with it but the symptom of wrecking cars shows you theres something very obsessed about this fellow someplace and its magical one button its just some kind of charge and itll eventually come off in one way or the other but it shows the case is very very heavily charged because he seems to talk lot in his sessions about cars and wrecks and you know it just seems to be coming up well lets do an assessment lets write up so youd write up an assessment like cars drivers policemen highways just get whole bunch of motors speed you know rest anything you care to put together and then have your auditor assess this and then he assesses it very nicely and he comes out with one that is reading now that is not what is the most wrong with him it is what he has got the best reality on now you could do an l1 on it you could prep check it you probable could even find an engram chain on it more rarely if it indicated as such you might be able to find secondary chain on the subject theres lot of things that you can do with this now youve got his item now youve got this item and this item doesnt mean its just an assessed item its from your list it isnt the make or break of the case but it does show you zone or area of available charge which when bled off the case will leave the case less charged up and with higher level of reality and the reality and awareness of the case increases in direct proportion to the amount of charge off now the case supervisors trving to solve things like this when the case doesnt seem to be able to do what is asked of him he doesnt seem to be able to do these things hes well its represented by high ta somebody has been audited up through the grades heres typical case supervisor problem and youll go ahh when you see this one see something like this guy is if hes grade three lower grade three his ta is at 5 and he doesnt much like auditors and hes come in for session now whats this whats this what the hell is his ta doing up there well your first action of course is to take his folder if you can get your hands on it and you take his folder and you go back to point where the case was running well and the ta was not extreme now you can come forward from that point and you can find some clue as to what went on it isnt necessarily however an auditing overrun it isnt always auditing to blame the guy got married twice without getting divorced so that you in actual fact now in coming forward from that point it could be as corny as this you found out that he didnt have any trouble getting fns last january but so help pete right now wow this is stuck mcgluck man hes parked at high 6 and parachute whatre you going to do with him well you know you can run one of these lists which isnt listing question but which will give you an item now when you use question like this its border line thing it might list to one item but it also might not because it isnt proper listing question but you can still do it and it wont damage the pc any providing somebody doesnt try to horse around with it so the auditor that does it has to understand that its not one item list and hes not supposed to do anything with this thing hes just trying to find out what reads what happened since january the twenty eighth which is the date of the session in which it read whats happened since january the twenty eighth date and he tells you this and he tells you that and he tells you something else and tells you something else and all of sudden something reads without even discussing the matter of overrun prep check on the thing might very well knock the ta down but you certainly have got to set this case up this case has done something since then something has happened and if you dont set the case up youd better damn well not run four and this is where your expertise comes in this is where your expertise now expertise is very standard theres nothing much to it the only thing youre really trying to do is find an area where charge can be removed from the case and remove it now you obviously have to remove it with process the pc can do now all of sudden we find this guy and we do an assessment of seven cases or we do this or that or on lower grade pcs like that the common action is green form with itsa similar itsa lists forbidden and it rubs down and it finds zones and areas and before it fns however youre liable to find another zone or area which wouldnt fn because the process is not not beefy enough and you find some interesting things have gone on now it gives you another zone because anything down toward that fn before that fn if its on another subject on the green form which leads to it is of course cs bait do you see now you could do an itsa you could do an itsa early similar itsa on green form carry it on down the form the thing doesnt go fn all the way through the form you say oh my god now what do we do because we have just run out of ammunition well your first thought is the form was badly done very badly done and your second thought that it was badly done on the first page so therefore you look over all this carefully and you could now establish little assessment that can be done which reestablishes your suspicion and its little items that come off the green form you can have these assessed which one of these was out which one didnt the auditor set you can cross play this do you see what i mean and one of the most fantastic things is somebody with some some withhold like drugs drugs can shoot the ta up the guy got up to grade three and then all of sudden for some reason or another he met some of his old pals that he used to have trips with and hes busy he used to smoke with them lot and so on and just talking to these birds he doesnt take it up again hell tell you quite truthfully i didnt do any but just talking to these characters keyed in he keyed himself in of course obviously its rehab action so im just telling you the various categories of entrance and it isnt very tricky it isnt very tricky because the law which governs it is is you find an area of charge on which the pc has reality and audit it with simple action now you can find an area of charge on which the pc has reality and get it audited with simple action and now you can find and there is another area of charge where the pc has reality and audit it with simple action all of sudden the case is sitting there with an fn that was all you were looking for in the first place you say run grade four and we were not interested in all the tortures of the damned he was going through as to whether or not he was going to tell the auditor we arent interested in the depth of the arc break he had with his cat these things are not of interest the actual interest in the matter first and foremost and right straight across the line is simply and only that you mustnt start major action without flying the needle and this is gonna be one of our big problems you dont think so but this is gonna be your major case supervisor problem because itll be to you with great urgency and emergency that all cases are brought you immediately get nothing but the tough cases the easy cases are wrecked independent of your interference laughter right away youve got rough cases yes what about this folder what about this folders foot and half thick and grade zero and you follow the same formula go back to find time that the case was running well try to find out what happened to the case from that time forward do some simple action that will establish it further and get charge off and your whole action is find simple action on which the person has reality have something on which the person has reality perform simple auditing action on it and get charge off if that didnt work then you try to do it forward if that didnt work you wanna find some action some sphere where the pc has reality perform some simple action which gets charge off the case and then see if you can push it do you understand its just case of bmp pow its case of hunt and punch actually now its not very hunt and punch because youre using standard actions to do all this and you must keep firmly in mind this one thing is its the case thats variable not the technology youre applying and man these cases have got an infinity of complexities infinite complexities what people can do and how they can get messed up and what thinks can get cross wise in them probably couldnt be computed on an ibm computer now it looks so big and so complex that you could confuse the postulates and stuck ideas and incidents and experiences of the individual with the very simple actions you have to work with you see they look so simple theyre so easy and your most progress youre going to get on the case is the next grade if the case is to be put on the next grade youve got to be able to fly the needle with gis if the pc is in such state that the needle wont fly there is something wrong there is something out along the line of standard tech he really didnt get as far as he got or something weird has happened in his life to key him in upside down and backwards and it is your job as cs simply to see that new next grade or section is started on him unless the needle flies easily now i will go further than that in the ot sections i will monkey around with case until it blows out of its head this hunt and punch around with the case until he finally exteriorizes now what am i doing im just hunting and punching around hes gone that now actually i could get him up to 7 and make him do 7 and 8 and all of that is great and so on but he actually should have blown out of his head at about 5 see he shouldve blown out of his head at 5 or 6 and if he hasnt blown out of his head at 5 or 6 then theres an earlier section out now theres probably an we cant go back and put the case ready to fly and then do the earlier section cause its done now what are we going to do see well it did get him little bit further and so on but i would be i would hunt and punch around until i took enough charge off the case start taking it off directly an assessment of exteriorization death release beating it doing bunk leaving responsibility possessions bodies do an assessment all of sudden pang death this individuals got being out of his head associated with death now look at the number of things you could do with this obviously cant get out of his head for some reason best known to somebody hes still got something or somebody or himself has got some kind of stuck death so you could actually run chain of engrams of death i mean elementary now you can vary that its how can you bypass the fn you could key it out by recall you could run the overt you could run the motivator usually run by key out the recall run the overt series to fn see recall to fn overt series would then be the last action see recall to fn motivator to fn overt to fn theres three fns available on the same material then see how hes doing well lets see we get report something like this we assessed out death and when i tried to run death the pc said he actually he went back down the track ta 12 and wasnt able to find anything and however he felt good about it but actually there werent very many good indicators in at the end of the session now whats that told you what you know now huh what you know you know that the knuckleheaded auditor didnt make correct assessment thats what you know you had your nice little list and all of sudden he gave you an item that was in some fashion forced to read the one that would have read is the one on which the pc has the greatest reality and he obviously didnt have very much reality on this because he couldnt get back and run anything do you follow thats your think so you know youve got misassessment we had one the other day damndest fire fight you ever cared to see ran something like this i gave the pc the first command and told her what we were going to run and she said you know i didnt understand that at the time it was assessed and so i told her what it meant and then i said i didnt think we should run it but she said that it was alright to run it and so we did and its one of those do not send to find for whom the bell tolls an assessment because of noncomprehension which gives you clue that your assessment should be checked now if you give now let teach you little bit of piece about assessment if you assess something and then send it to the cs and then the cs says to run something on it when you start to clear the command if you find out that he didnt know the item is your face red because you assessed against misunderstood the pc couldnt have even dimly been in session or interested in what was going on because all he hung up on and read was the fact that he didnt understand you so it must have been very corny assessment indeed the thing to do in such instance would be to quick like bunny get the misunderstood off reassess it almost cruelly on the basis now are there any other when youve finished the assessment are there any other words on this assessment you didnt understand you know stick it back in the folder and send it back to the cs you know its an is my face red type of submission but that is the correct action not to run it because look at the mechanics im trying to teach you here the reality of the pc is totally violated pc that doesnt understand what some very simple word means well actually youre actually auditing then in zone or sphere of what was that is that in the direction of reality its in the direction of total unreality so you wouldnt dare audit such thing it would be horror beyond horror you wouldnt dare audit such thing now you say therefore there ought to be some sort of drill on which we go over the whole list and take us each one of the words on the list before we assess it in order to clear if on the list there are any misunderstoods instead of that we dont inspect before the fact any where along the line we ask the person we can ask the person before we run it now the reason why you dont hang up pcs and give them the assessment is they walk off and self audit it youve given him the item youve given him the item dog chains you didnt do anything about it and then you finally say thats your item your item is dog chains so you get it mixed up with listing and nulling then the pc goes out of session saying dog chains dog chains dog chains yes they come back the next session its overrun already and then you overrun it see you set yourself up to fall on your head if you trust the auditor completely and if youre not having any assessment trouble and auditors can do the assessment the actual act of cs is assessed list fow fow or assess the following items take what reads and prep check it list one it do what you will do with it find an engram about it you know whatever youre going to say about it see now the proper auditing action is after the assessment is done you do the action at once and then the person says they dont understand that cause you try to clear it with them at that time which is proper auditing procedure youve got to clear the auditing command and they say yeah well i meant to tell you i didnt know what that means you say thank you very much thank you well clarify what that means yes that means boaga boo so fwa fwa fwa thats something you lead dog around on thats it yes now were going to do an assessment click click click click assess it out again and you find it now comes out entirely different not the other one that read because what you were getting were latent reads on top of the misunderstood now youll get the one on which hes getting reality so your assessment is always assessed against the pcs reality and the only reason you do an assessment at all is to get close to where the pcs reality on the situation is you can look in six inch thick folder and you can find it in this six inch thick folder there are eight thousand nine hundred and sixty two auditing errors now question is ive already given you an example of this you start patching up the list but he didnt have any reality on the list being wrong its also something trained auditor has to do to patch up list hes got to be very skilled on the laws of listing and nulling to patch up list otherwise hell dog breakfast the list again so your safest action i then showed you is assess list auditors auditing sessions reviews you know any word that you could think of in regard to this then you assess it now youve got the pcs greatest reality now you run that on and youll find that the pc gets some charge off and it starts straightening out now how manv times could you do this well i dont know its almost an infinity of times its not limited action now the funny part of it is that limited actions only occur in the presence of out trs almost any action becomes limited action in the presence of bad trs bad trs auditor additives auditor omissions and so on add up as nice as you please you limit the processes and you can audit guy so badly believe it or not that the simplest process in the book right here this now ive suddenly given you nocomm bridge and changed to an entirely different subject but it is relates to this because ive been telling you how to cs and so forth now im going to tell you something else about it i started in to tell you that the cs is bit at the mercy of the additives or omissions or the rotten trs and so forth of the auditor who is auditing for him and that might have left you in slight puzzlement exactly what is the extent youre not puzzled about it because you have reality on it you think you understand it i got news for you you dont this one you have to learn this is very upper level material this is level 7 and 3 section material so therefore you go trying to teach somebody this and youre gonna wrap him around telegraph pole if he isnt already up the sections so i give you warning what you want to do is put it into peoples heads that they mustnt add they mustnt do omissions and theyve got to have good trs now i want to give you the reasons back of this the reasons back of this it is under the heading of the anatomy of an overrun the anatomy of overrun is very interesting anatomy you would say well its been run too long so it goes up thats great thats very simple but that is the overall mechanic of the thing and the overall appearance and the overall datum what is actual fact happens why is an overrun an overrun well i can give it to you just one two at some time or another the pc decided to stop it and from that point on it is getting overrun and that is all an overrun is lets take series of engrams the individual youre running engrams on the track it goes more solid you have to get earlier similar why do you have to get earlier similar because youre running down chain of incidents where he has already got the consideration that its already gone on too damn long youve got to go back and get the incident where he first decided it had better stop you dont in actual fact get the first incident on the chain it isnt there the first experience he had in this particular line of country he didnt stop it was alright for lions to jump on him he didnt mind it thought what the hell so the lion jumped on him and chomped up body well he just mocked up another body to hell with it body easy come easy go so what after while he start deciding bodies are very important and lions shouldnt do that and so on so he decides to stop lions from jumping on him and now we have chain of animals leaping upon bodies which goes on for years and years and eons and eons and you start tracing this thing back and it goes into the millions and tens of millions and hundreds of millions of years ago how the hell did you ever get chain like that well its running back to somewhere in the vicinity of the original stop its this type of action must cease thats what he has determined this type of action must cease and that is the point which you have to get out of it and that is why in the materials of 3 you get my instruction to get the stop out and in ninety percent of the time if you dont take the stop out of 3 it is already bit late on the chain and it wont blow other incidents and actions have happened before that so wherever we look on the track we find this is true and that is the datum which compares to all the other datum and is the datum which makes engrams stick makes them go more solid which makes things overrun alright now lets take the rudiments now this is very interesting in actual fact it is impossible to put in the rudiments too often thats theoretically its theoretically impossible to put the ruds in too often there is limit on the number of times you can put in somebodies rudiments yet you will look in folder and you will sometimes see this arc break up ta overrun down ta well how the hell could that happen now let give you an exact way it could happen at fifteen minutes before lunch the auditor starts two hour session he just has time to get in the ruds he gets these ruds in laboriously they go to lunch and he comes back from lunch he sits down and puts in the ruds ah but the pc expected major action so he stops the auditor putting in the ruds and up goes the ta theres folder kicking around which runs like this its actually criminal its fly each rud to fn and then and it gives about six more instructions so some time just before supper the fellows flew each rud to fn on pc who does an awful lot of itsaing alright just before supper flew each rud to fn took long time you might have known the pc it always takes long time to fly rud on this pc the pcs gabby took break went to supped came back and once more flew each separate rudiment didnt even just check em flew each separate rudiment even then it took quite while to push the ta up but eventually the ta went up to 425 on putting in rudiments what two things happened now the pc could have had all the work shed done to get rudiments in invalidated while waiting for something major to happen in the session or the pc simply was trying to stop him from putting in the ruds so the pass invalidated or the pcs trying to stop the pc invalidated ta goes down trying to stos ta goes up so cs knows at once whether or not the pc was overwhelmed by invalidation in some fashion or knows whether he was so rough and crude and dull in his action or was doing something so stupid the pc was trying to stop him pc trying to stop him ta goes up ta down invalidation and overwhelm you got that now in the first place what the hell makes one of these chains youre already aware that youre mocking everything up how come this damn chain can stay there thats curious isnt it well its out of 8 actually its the exercise of permeation for control control by permeation and if you want chairs to tip over and that sort of thing without having hand laid on em of course youll permeate them and tip them over so let us take now this guy who had the lion jump on him and hes got long chain of being destroyed by lions fighting lions shooting lions and hes clear for gods sakes and you start dredging around and all of sudden you find this wild chain having to do with lions well let tell you the exact circumstances of how that chain came into being it used to matter it used to didnt matter damn and then one fine day he decided he was tired of getting bodies mucked up or lions mucked up or something and so as the lion leaped through the air he permeated the lion he permeated his environment to control it in order to stop the lion this is very successful you can stop things this way like bomb theres trick in this its done by permeation and youre just every where at once you know well it freezes or it does something else or it goes off in the other direction dont you see you can make it do what you please alright that was great that was great and then one day lion jumped on him the frequency the length of the track permits the most unlikely incidents to repeat theres sufficient variation that you finally youll get on one of these points again somewhere up the track so anyhow the lion jumps on him he permeated the lion stopping him from jumping and at that moment lion jumped on his back that he hadnt noticed this caused dispersal he thought he had the environment under control and there was piece of the environment he didnt have under control which causes him to shift his attention from this lion to that lion so this lion hits him and he loses his body anyway now on that failure chain he will have already got the basic of stomping lions from jumping on him and now you get cant stop lions chain now the damn fool will keen on going through this permeation act long after it doesnt work and it gives him chain of pictures quote unquote pictures theyre very funny looking pictures theyre very thin pictures theyre mostly energy frozen do you see the mechanics well it takes distraction to put him into chain of loses and after while he doesnt permeate things but he still does permeate things and he cant understand why after he walks out of the room he has picture of phonograph do you see well that failed so he doesnt take responsibility for the action any more but thetan can permeate anything anyhow and its often surprise to that things in my vicinity dont move but my body will move my hands will move but that doesnt move thats cause im holding it still why my hand moves thetan is very clever see and you have to he careful what you permeate there are many things you shouldnt permeate obviously you had better stop permeating i suppose somebody who has done that and so forth has whole chain of invisible pictures refraining from permeating but regardless of all of that im telling you this mechanic which is simply mechanic the mechanics of handling things because it was distraction which gave him his first lose on stopping up to that time he didnt care whether he stopped things or not now he becomes frantic about stopping and it took distraction like he stopped he permeated the lion in front and turned him around in the airs and sent him somewhere else right at the same time the lion he was going to do this you see right at the same time the lion hit him from the rear so he starts for this lion stops this lion and he gets this lion but he hasnt got this lion under control and he gets so confused he didnt know what the hell lion hes trying to control and its by distraction and youll find then that distraction is an interesting point to handle in the pc its handled just by discharging the case but an engram which has got distraction in it if you were really gonna run this thing out come hell or high water regardless of how late is was on the chain will really hang you up boy you really can sweat as an auditor trying to run out this engram which has distraction on it do you see he almost he was running the car into tree when another car hit him in the side brother you try to unwind that engram and youre generally going to have ball its going to take earlier similar earlier similar earlier similar earlier similar earlier similar earlier similar earlier similar do you see why because its got the failure point has been dramatized in it which is the distraction in it do you see its whole chain of distractions and to get down to the earliest distraction is some times bit of trick theres too many conflicting forces to rationalize do you see this now we come right back to what i was talking to you about in the first place what do you think about distractive auditor in session thats interesting isnt it if that was his first point of failure to permeate and if its dramatized on him at the same time hes trying to introspect and handle his bank and hes been distracted in some peculiar fashion by some idiocy actually his tolerance of distraction is fairly high he isnt scared to death but interjected comments evaluations invalidations the auditor not taking care of the environment gale of wind starts coming in through the window and the auditor doesnt go over and close it you know any one of these things which causes distraction in the session doesnt necessarily ruin the pc because there isnt anything really violent happening with the pc but is sure sort of hangs him with session and he cant get on with it the reason he cant get on with it is because its got the element of distraction the unpredictability and there is where the importance of trs begins now have you got the whole mechanism i suppose the auditor not saying anything is he was counting by that time on lion tamer to reach out with noose and grab the lion and the lion tamer one time didnt grab out with the noose and grab the lion and it was an omission so omission becomes distractive too he expects something to happen and it doesnt happen its plus or minus side of the ledger do you see then the essence of smoothness of predictability of doing what the auditor is supposed to do in the session not adding to it not subtracting from it and carrying on with the actions necessary to resolve the case now part of the actions necessary to resolve case are the auditor auditing him now ill give you another little piece of this its the auditor plus the pc versus the pcs bank makes it possible then to audit pieces of the pcs bank so therefore for you to do an assessment of what the pc should go off and audit is bonkers lets look at this again you do an assessment on list which you now give to the pc and you tell him to go off to his solo session or something and do this l1 on wuf wuf you assessed it now his reality then is always increased in the presence of an auditor his reality on his bank is increased in the presence of the auditor because hes got that much more attention he can put on his bank right so therefore the assessment will go deeper than he himself all by himself has reality on this gives you three or four phenomena which sometimes make you very curious as to what happened pc walks out of session and says something entirely different happened if you look on an examiners report sometime this pc maybe has been audited for half an hour and the pc comes out and tells the examiner all we did was assess list trimity god the persons list yeah we assessed list but there were about fifteen other actions present before the list was assessed well what was being done before that is this is negative gain what was done before is longer important to the pc its erased theyre gone not important pc doesnt comment on it but the list hasnt been run yet furthermore its been assessed by the auditor so the second the pc walked out of session if the pc was given the item the pcs liable to walk out of that session overwhelmed cause he got the item and it was actually not the reality level of the pc it was the reality level of the auditor plus pc the pc safeguarded was able to confront the bank enouan to inspect what was going on but the pc all by himself couldnt you got that so it enters into this equation so there are many rules the auditor plays in auditing which he really doesnt really suspect he actually increases the reality of the pc during the session the pc can become much more aware of his own bank the pcs pictures in running engrams are liable to be far brighter go brighter when the auditor is auditing him then some auditor or other i do cs for him the cs is to run some engrams i intend it to be audited on him and so on and he goes off and audits himself like wow you see i already have given him csed action so it isnt likely that hell run into this on his own volition im already undercutting his reality to some slight degree by making sure that its correct but nevertheless that its pushing the case bit and thats supposed to handle the situation well its audited he goes and audits it on himself he wraps himself around telegraph pole do you see why so the auditor can be definite liability to the session by additives or subtractives from the session he can actually provide sufficient distraction to key in or hang up the pc in the session he can make an unlimited process actually appear limited because the pc is busy trying to stop his doing it which then gives you the whole phenomena of overrun because the pc has already decided its overrun i think ruds are overrun ta up see now pc isnt aware hes doing this hes operating however to do this or on the other hand the auditor in there pitching sitting there just doing his job routinely nothing very magical about it he says what he has to say hes got his trs are in he gives the auditing command he gets them executed he follows through and does his job right straight on through actually has enormously increased the reality of the pc as he moves on up the line and so has permitted him to confront parts of the bank and handle it that he never under gods green earth all by himself would be permitted to do so theres very plus and theres very minus to the situation and theres lot to be gained and lot to be lost all on the same subject have you got better idea of what sessioning is about yes sir alright very good thank you very much
