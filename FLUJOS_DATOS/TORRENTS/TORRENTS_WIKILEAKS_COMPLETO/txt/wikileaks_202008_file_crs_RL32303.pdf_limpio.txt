related to the c onsolidation of student loans earmarks for specific projects the earmarking of funds for specific proj ects in appropriations bills has become topic of contention for the congress nd the administration and the issue extends to lhhsed projects in the case of lhhsed appropriations earmarks may be defined as funds set aside within an acc ount for specific organization or location either in the appropriation act or its conf erence report typically the authorizing statute gives the general purpose for use of appropriations such as projects for the improvement of postsecondary education but an earma rk designates specific amount for specific recipient such designations bypass the usual competitive distribution of awards by federal agency but otherwise require recipients to follow standard federal fina ncial and other administrative procedures the president has urged the elimination of cong ressional earmarks in appropria tions in recent years but the congress has continued the practice earmarks in lhhsed appropriations ge nerally have increased during the past decade along with the total appropriation for lhhsed programs table 3 shows the total annual lhhse d

104134 hrept 104537 302a and 302b allocation ceilings the maximum budget authority for annual lhhsed appropriations is determined through twostag congressional budget process in the first stage the congress agrees to overall spending totals in the annual concurre nt resolution on the budget subsequently these amounts are allocated among the various committees usually through the statement of manage rs for the conference report on the budget resolution in years when the house nd senate do not reach budget agreement spending totals may be set through leadership arrangements in each chamber these overall spending totals are known as the 302a allocations these allocations are the discretionary totals available to the house and senate committees on appropriations for enactment in annual appropriations for fy2005 the house agreed to conference report on an fy2005 budget resolution sconres 95 hrept 108500 on may 19 2004 the senate has yet to act directly on that resolution if agreed to by both house and senate the conference report would establish 821 billion as the 302a allocation ceiling for the total discretionary budget authority for fy2005 hres 649 the rule agreed to by the house for the floor consideration of s conres 95 deems the amount from the conference report to be the ceiling for the house pending approval of budget resolution by both house and senate however 14007 of pl 108287 the department of defense appropriations act 2005 also establishes 302a allocation for the senate of 821 billion pending appr oval of budget resolution by both house and senate for legislative details pleas see related legisl ation pa ge 42 and crs report rl31443 the deeming resolution budget enforcement tool for procedural informati on please see crs report 98721 introduction to the federal budget process in the second stage of the congressional budget process the appropriations committees allocate the 302a discretionary funds among their subcommittees for each of the 13 annual appropriations b ills these amounts are known as the 302b allocations these allocations must add up to more than the 302a discretionary allocation and form the basis for enforcin g budget discipline since any bill reported with total above the ceiling is subject to point of order the 302b allocations can and often do get adjusted during the year as the various appropriations bills

the corporation for public broadcasting cpb for use in fy 2006 advance appropriations may be used to meet several objectives these might include the provision of longterm budget information to recipients such as state and local educational systems to enable better planning of future progra m activities and personnel leve ls the more contentious aspect of advance appropriations however involves how they are counted in budget ceilings advance appropriati ons avoid the 302a and 302 b allocation ceilings for the current year but must be counted in the year in which they first become available for obligation this procedure uses up ah ead of time part of what will be counted against the allocation ceiling in future years for an example of the impact of advance appropriations on program administration see discussion in department of education page 31 the fy1999 and fy2000 annual lhhsed appropriations bills provided significant increases in advance appropria tions for

ately contentious while there is general support for an increase in the earnings threshold it had fallen to level nearly coequal with the federal minimum wage redefining the duties test has been more troublesome dol some contend has made major changes to the various classifications which depending upon ho w they might be interpreted could significantly expand the concept of an execu tive or

provide free appropriate public ducation to children with disa bilities in 1975 the congress authorized state payments up to maximu m amount of 40 of the national average perpupil expenditure appe times the number of children with disabilities ages 3 and above that each state serves the rati onale for this formula was the assumption that the education of children with disa bilities cost twice the national appe 100 more than the average child and the federal share would be up to 40 of the extra cost appropriations have never been sufficient to reach the 40 level some view this as promise made that has not yet been kept others see the maximum federal share as nothing more than an authorization ceiling for fy2005 achieving the 40 funding leve l for idea part b grants to states would take an estimated 223 billion wher eas 107 billion has been appropriated the fy2005 funding represents an estimate d 190 of the current appe times the number of children served an add itional 116 billion would be necessary to provide the 40 authorized maximum for fy2005 because of amendments to idea made by pl 108446 the individuals with disabilities education improvement act of 2004 futu re maximum grants will be based on changes in appe and on growth rates in tota l student population and in st udents living in poor families for additional information please see crs report rl32085 individuals with disabilities education act id ea current funding trends pell grants the funding level for pell grants has been continuing issue the program provides assistance to ligible undergraduate students based on financial need aggregate program cost s depend largely on the maximum award and the number of eligible recipients the maximum award is currently set when appropriations are enacted whic h is usually before the star t of the program year the exact number and total amount of the pell awards cannot be determined until all students have claimed an aw ard generally the number of recipients and the amount of the pell awards are not reconciled until the end of the program year which occurs after the following years appropriations ve been enacted appropriations for pell grants make funds available for two full fiscal years to provide administrative flexibility regarding potential shortfalls and surpluses if the costs of the pell grant program exceed the current fiscal years appropriation the shor tfall is covered by using appropriated monies from the next fiscal year similarly surplus can be carried forward and used in the followi ng year as of december 9 2004 the ed budget service estimates that the fy2004 s hortfall will be 36 b illion and that the shortfall will grow to 40 billion under the fy2005 funding level for add itional information please see crs report rl31668 federal pell grant program of the higher education act background and reauthorization forward funding and advance appropriations several lhhsed programs including some of the larger ed programs have either authorization or appropriations provisions that allow funding flexibility for program years that differ from the federal fiscal year for exampl many of the elementary and secondary education formula grant programs receive appropriations that become available forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32303crs32 obligation to the states on july 1 of the same year as the ppropriations and remain available for 15 months through the end of the following fiscal year that is fy2005 appropriations for some programs will becam available for obligation to the states on july 1 2005 and will rema in available until september 30 2006 this budgetary procedure is popularly known as forwa rd or multiyear funding and is accomplished through funding provisions in the lhhsed appropriations bill forward funding in the case of elementary nd secondary education programs was designed to allow additional time fo r school officials to develop budgets in advance of the beginning of the school year for pell grants for undergraduates however aggregate program costs for indi vidual students applying for postsecondary educational assistance cannot be known with certainty ahead of time ppropriations from one fiscal year primarily support pell grants during the following academic year that is the fy2005 appropriations w ould be used primarily to support the 2005 2006 academic year unlike elementary and secondary education programs however the funds for pell grants remain available for obligation for two full fiscal years as discussed above an advance appropriation occurs when the appropriation is provided for fiscal year beyond the fiscal year for wh ich the appropriation was enacted in the case of fy2005 appropriations funds normally would beco available october 1 2004 under regular funding provisions but w ill not become available until july 1 2005 under the forward funding provisions disc ussed above however if the july 1 2005 forward funding date were to be postponed for obligation by three months until october 1 2005 the appr opriation would be recla ssified as an advance appropriation since the funds would become available only in subsequent fiscal year fy2006 for example the fy2005 budget request for title i part grants to leas for the education of the disa dvantaged was 133 billion this amount includes not only forward funding of 61 b illion to become available july 1 2005 but also an advance appr opriation of 72 billion to b ecome available october 1 2005 like forward funding provisions th advance appropriations are specified through provisions in the annual appropr iations bill what is the impact of these changes in funding provisions at the program or service level relatively little is changed by the threemonth delay in the availability of funds since most expenditures for st andard school year occur after october 1 at the appropriations level however significant technical difference occurs because forward funding is counted as part of the current fiscal year and is therefore fully included in the current 302b allo cation for discretionary appropriations under federal budget scorekeeping rules an advance appropriati on is not counted in the 302b allocation until the following year in essence threemonth change from forward funding to an advance appropria tion for given program allows onetime shift from the current year to the next year in the scoring of discretionary appropriations for additional info rmation please see crs report rs20441 advance appropriations forward funding and advance funding
