thanks caspar i agreeits important to emphasize this point and im glad you recognized that we were underplaying it mike at 1025 am 10142003 0600 caspar ammann wrote mike looks good to it is one of these points where they can persuade journalists that they are correct and it actually got into newspapers and finally to the senate floor this way the more we are able to explain why the first half of the 20th century warmed up naturally the more confidence we get on the detection of the anthropogenic signal afterwards caspar michael mann wrote dear all in response to caspars suggestion which i agree with i propose rephrasing item 2 as follows 2 the statement by s03 that the mann and jones 2003 reconstruction clearly shows temperatures in the mwp that are as high as those in the 20th century is misleading if not false m03 emphasize that it is the late and not the early or mid 20th century warmth that is outside the range of past variability mann and jones emphasize conclusions for the northern hemisphere noting that those for the southern hemisphere and globe are indeterminate due to paucity of southern hemisphere data consistent with m03 they conclude that late 20th century northern hemisphere mean temperatures are anomalous in longterm nearly two millennium context any comments thanks mike deliveredto 1mem6uvirginiaedu date tue 14 oct 2003 091837 0600 from caspar ammann

looks good to indeed including the new last paragraph following toms wording the only point i would highlight little more is in point 2 maybe it could be stated that the early part of the 20th century is within the natural range whereas the late 20th century the main point of the agu position statement and also in m03 is clearly outside please also add second n in my name cheers and thanks for your momentum on this caspar michael mann wrote dear all i agree with each of tom ws suggestions adopting them by the way brings us down to 738 words so pending any revised language from keithmalcolm in response to michael comment on paragraph 2 im putting out last call for comments signons etc thanks mike at 0800 am 10142003 0600 tom wigley wrote some minor points 2 should it be an ensuing rather than the ensuing 2 i still think each line 3 is unnecessary 4 comma after and globe re boreholes does the point about comparing late 20th century with much longer period 1000 years ago help us given that the 1000 years ago data is highly lowpass filtered if one did have series with temporal resolution that allowed legitimate comparison then the likelihood of warmer interval 1000 years ago must be higher in any event the time scale issue will not be meaningful to most readers the key point is the data reliabilityuncertainty i would just say something like taken into account for times more than 500 years ago uncertainties in the borehole reconstructions preclude any useful quantitative comparison finally i would like the last retained but i suggest shorter wording as as indicating that sb03 misinterpreted and misrepresented the paleoclimatological literature the controversy my problem here is twofold first they really say nothing directly about mainstream scientific opinion except that they clearly disagree with it at issue is not the mainstream opinion but their interpretation of the literature and their illogical conclusions second they may have misrepresented the results of their work but we do not address this issue so it comes here as non sequitur in fact just what such misrepresentation consists of and why it might be judged as misrepresentation is subtle issue hence my revision which retains the word misrepresentation but in different context tom michael mann wrote thanks tim and malcolm the latest round of suggestions were extremely helpful ive accepted them w few minor tweaks attached were at 765 wordsi think agu will let us get away w that so comments from others thanks mike at 0211 pm 10142003 0100 tim osborn wrote so3 argue that borehole data provide conflicting view of past temperature histories to the contrary the borehole estimates for recent centuries shown in m03 may be consistent with other estimates provided consideration is given to statistical uncertainties spatial sampling and possible influences on the ground surface eg snow cover changesbeltrami and kellman 2003 it is not meaningful to compare the late 20th century with much longer period 1000 years ago bradley et 2003 especially given the acknowledged limitations pollack et 1998 of borehole data ______________________________________________________________ professor
