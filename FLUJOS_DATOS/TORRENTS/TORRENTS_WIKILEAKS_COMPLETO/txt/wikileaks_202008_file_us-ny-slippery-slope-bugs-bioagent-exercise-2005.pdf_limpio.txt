this phase begins with the final preparations for the exercise and continues concurrently with exercise play until the final operational component of play has concluded the objective of concurrent observation and evaluation is to actually see what activities are being carried out how by whom using which tools procedures and methodology actual performance is compared to the policy and procedural requirements analyzed during the prospective evaluation process during this session evaluators will be oriented to the exercise and its features and fam iliarized with the evaluation tools and techniques to be employed additional components of the concurrent evaluation phase include use of the exercise evaluation guides and evaluation tools evaluator deployments to key functions or areas and concurren t documentation process this documentation process employs observation and inquiry freehand note taking photographs and any video must be cleared with the exercise director and the senior hospital management of the hospital involved much of the crucia l evaluation information should develop through this process b retrospective evaluation the second phase will begin upon com pletion of all exercise play and will continue until the evaluation objectives are completed during this process the evaluation t eam will collaborate on developing an incident timeline data gathered during the concurrent phase will be compiled into an issuediscussionrecommendation format for the final after action report additional documentation will be incorporated from the fe edback forms returned by participants exercise staff and agency leadership who have been asked to provide clear written appraisals of activities from their perspectives exercise leadership evaluators and subject

compelling guide to the measures needed to upgrade the community infrastructure and emergency readiness evaluators role and responsibilities evaluator selection and training 1 evaluators have been selected from the hospitals within the cbpp and other subject matter experts they are individuals who have considerable familiarity with agency discipline andor community polices plans and procedures often with background as trainers for their agencies in some cas the evaluators participate in developing and deploying the exercise and are intimately familiar with the planned exercise flow b the role of an evaluator 1 the role of an exercise evaluator is to observe understand document and report exercise activitie s and the performance of participants in an assigned area or functiondiscipline an evaluator is not plan reviewer trainer or judge the evaluator must be prepared to observe and record all events exact times and personnel performance the evalua tor must be familiar with the scenario and applicable objectives for their assigned location or position c controllerevaluator interface 1 evaluators will typically be assigned in teams with exercise controllers the controllers role is to monitor and guid the progress of the exercise and interface with the players the evaluators role is to observe and document the performance and progress of the players this is best done by working in partnership with the functiondisciplinearea controllers to shar information maintain situational awareness and common perspective as to events underway or anticipated and ensure that all key events and issues worthy of documentation are recorded by working together as controllers observe issues for evaluation they can bring these to the evaluators attention for the record as evaluators observe issues requiring controller intervention or awareness they can alert the controller to the situation in this manner while slippery slope 2005 central brookyln cbpp exercise exercise

material may not be reproduced copied or furnished to individuals outside of the evaluation team without written approval from the exercise director 15 each assignment has distinct tasks and resp onsibilities they can work synergistically to improve the activities of both as well as the overall exercise d prompting and player interface 1 evaluators should limit their interface with the players to clarify observations or inquire about activities evaluators must avoid interfering with player activities or providing suggestions or prompts that result in altering participant actions documentation and recording 1 because numerous events may be occurring simultaneously evaluators may not be able to reco rd all the action knowing which events are important makes recording the action manageable eliminates superfluous information and provides the kind of data most useful for exercise evaluation important events evaluators should record include the follow ing f communication and coordination 1 other elements to look for and note include the following initiating scenario events including when players first detect abnormal conditions b timeliness of critical actions c information gathering activities d monitoring and assessing scenario events use of unified command at the scene f creative player problem solving beyond current plans and implementation procedures g plans or procedures that affect player efforts h equipment issues that affect player efforts i securing t he scene establishing perimeter much of the above information will be obtained through watching and listening to the exercise players however the evaluators may also interact with players during the exercise if they have question about something th ey observed this may be especially important for those evaluators observing play in eocs j oint information centers or similar locations where much of the activity is conducted over the phone because evaluators cannot hear what is

wait until there is break in activity g evaluator effects on the exercise evaluators may ve an inadvertent effect on the exercise based on factors that may be intentional or unintentional with good selection methods and proper training most of the factors can be reduced or eliminated evaluators should be aware of these potential effects an d work to avoid them h after the exercise 1 following exercise play brief hot wash will be held at each exercise venue an exercise controller will lead the hot wash the purpose of this review is to briefly recap the events of the day by participantsplaye rs establish broad overall assessment of performance by the hospitals and identify major element of performance that went well or needs improvement 2 evaluators are expected to attend the hot washes in the areas they evaluated giving them the opportunit to clarify issues or obtain missing information from the players before they depart the area at the hot wash evaluators will distribute participant feedback forms to all players and participants soliciting their feedback on the exercise process and th eir participation these forms are brief and must be returned immediately to the evaluator or submitted later as directed on the form 3 at the conclusion of the field nd tabletop exercise debriefing with the consultant will be held at the simcell this will be the opportunity for the senior exercise management team from each of the hospitals and nycdhmh to recap the days events identify critical issues and opportunities for improvement and ensure cross hospital coordination this will also be the opportunity for the entire team to re acquire overall situational awareness based on the days events throughout the exercise venues persons required to attend this meeting will be notified in advance 4 finally evaluators will be required to complete the exe rcise evaluation tool forms as many pages as needed for each portion of the exercise that they are evaluating and

creating the scenario writing the scripts and arranging the exercise logistics the evaluation phase provides important guidance to decision makers at all levels of the organization allowing them an opportunity to make adjustments in emergency response and management policies and procedures 2 evaluation is about information gathering it sorting it organizing it and analyzing it questioning and observation can be done in haphazard way or systematically using specific techniques the level of skill and attention given to using the tools in correct and skillful way is usually eviden t in the quality value and usefulness of the final product m evaluation tools 1 direct observation done in an organized systematic way are important evaluation tools like all tools they require training and

decision makers work safely place yourself in position that is free from hidden hazards out of traffic zones and in low noise areas if possible since you will be focused on observing others performing their work your mind may not be tuned into other sights and sounds around you your safety is your responsibility if in doubt about where it is safe to position yourself consider asking the exercise controller or member of the simulation team before the exercise begins also bear in mind that every evaluator is also safety officer in your position as observer you may detect hazard or unsafe practice that those engaged in activity may not realize you are ex pected to take actions necessary to prevent hazards or harm to others which may include resolving the hazard yourself notifying the controller in the area alerting the officer or team leader working in the area or requesting assistance through the chai n of command b choose good location for observation position yourself where you can clearly observe multiple activities from one location if that is not possible minimize the number of times you have to move c blend into the woodwork observations are best done when your presence is not obvious to the person being observed individuals tend to perform differently when they are reminded they are being observed which skews the quality of the information gathered it is okay and can actually be good thi ng to let them know why you are present and what youre doing but your presence should not be obvious d document your observations document your observations in writing photographically on audiotape if approved or using combination of these we fo rget or filter what we have observed based on other actions or things we hear from others which can change the quality quantity and reliability of the information gathered therefore its important as an evaluator to document activity as soon as it hap pens know the difference between observations and opinions do not mix observations and opinions together it is natural for evaluators to have opinions about what is observed however observations are facts and opinions are not keep the two separate f jot down ideas and suggestions it is commonplace to have ideas and suggestions for improvement or additional activity come to mind as you slippery slope 2005 central brookyln cbpp exercise exercise manage ment use

number of performance elements required for an individual or group of people to perform in the best possible manner evaluators can provide valuable information about performance by looking for these elements and documenting their presence or absence some of these elements may be apparent through the evaluators observations and others by specifically asking about them in some cases an evaluator may witness observe something but not be able to determine whether the item is helpful or hurtful to the overall performance the following questions may guide your thinking in appraising performance b

78 deaths case fatality rate of 35 have been reported from 16 countries including the united states outside of the most severely affected areas in the peoples republic of china including hong kong the majority of cases repor ted to date involve direct contact especially among health care providers caring for patients with sars although the international outbreak investigation has made great strides towards identifying the cause of this illness the definitive etiologic agen t and full understanding of the epidemiology especially regarding the modes of transmission and the period of contagiousness of this illness are not yet known the cdc has issued travel advisory recommending that individuals who are planning noness ential travel to the peoples republic of china including hong kong hanoi vietnam or singapore may wish to postpone their trip until further notice in the united states 94 of the 100 suspected sars cases reported as of april 2 2003 involved person s who had returned from affected areas within the 10 days before illness onset of the remaining six four were household contacts and two were health care workers with exposure to suspect sars patient an updated clinical and epidemiologic summary of the cases in the united states has been published in this weeks morbidity and mortality weekly report which is available at wwwcdcgovmmwr 1 seven possible sars cases in new

typically just fever and cough and are recovering laboratory specimens have been sent to the cdc for testing all results are still pending and it is possible given the broad spectrum of illness that is currently included in the surveillance case definition that some of these patients may not have sars the new york city department of health and mental hygiene nyc dohmh is posting updated information on sars surveillance data in new york city on our website at httpwwwnycgovhtmldohhtmlcdcdsarshtml the nyc dohmh has been monitoring cases and their household contacts until 10 days after the sars patient has recovered there has b een evidence to date of secondary cases among health care workers or household members nor evidence of community transmission of sars in new york city in addition to traditional disease reporting the nyc dohmh continues to monitor for unusual incre ases or geographic clustering of disease syndromes including fever and respiratory syndromes through our syndromic surveillance systems current systems include daily monitoring of electronic data from 911 ambulance calls emergency department chief co mplaint logs absenteeism records and pharmacy sales based on this data there has been recent evidence of fever or respiratory outbreak in the city 2 updated cdc sars case definition the cdc sars case definition has been updated to include indi viduals who traveled to mainland china the peoples republic of china as there is now evidence of community transmission beyond guangdong province the current case definition is person presenting with respiratory illness of unknown etiology with an onset since february 1 2003 that includes measured temperature 38ºc 1004ºf and one or more respiratory signs or symptoms including cough shortness of breath difficulty breathing hypoxia or radiographic findings of pneumonia or respirato ry distress syndrome and either travel to areas reporting community transmission of sars see below within 10 days

or documented community transmission of sars currently include the peoples republic of china including hong kong hanoi vietnam and singapore as this international outbreak is evolving please che ck the cdc website at wwwcdcgovncidodsars to get the most up todate information on countries with suspected or documented community transmission note canada is not currently included in this list since there has been evidence of community transmission all sars cases in canada are travel related or have been linked directly to the index family cluster that occurred after two family members returned from travel to hong kong 3 reporting pect cases to the nyc dohmh although the sars outbreak in the united states has remained mild compared to other affected countries the nyc dohmh recognizes the need to remain vigilant for evidence of both imported sars cases and community transmission to ensure our ability to detect both imported cases and persons who may represent the first evidence of community transmission we ask providers to be alert to and report any of the following to the nyc dohmh any individual meeting the cdc sars case defi nition see 2 above providers should take travel history from all patients presenting with fever and respiratory illnesses to ensure that potential cases are recognized as soon as possible pneumonia or acute respiratory distress without an identifi able etiology after standard workup occurring in the following hospitalized people health care workers who are employed in acute or primary medical care settings due to the potential that during the 10 days prior to their illness onset heshe may ve had an unrecognized exposure to patient with sars two or more members of family or other group of people who have close contact with each other please be advised that we consider the conditions listed above to be unusual manifestations of diseas and are therefore reportable to the department pursuant to section 1103b of the new york city health code

center at 212 7647667 or 1 8002221222 4 important points in the management of suspect sars patient all clinicians are encouraged to review infection control guidelines published in previous dohmh health alerts and the cdc website at wwwcdcgovncidodsarsichtm in addition to these guidelines these important points should be emphasized if you are transferring or referring patient w ho could have sars to another facility place surgical mask on the patient prior to transfer b inform the transport personnel that the patient is suspect sars case they should observe appropriate infection control practices including the use of an n 95 respirator eye protection gloves and gowns c call the receiving facility emergency department infection control andor receiving physician prior to transport to ensure appropriate infection control measures are implemented on arrival certain healt h care procedures such as the use of nebulized medication may potentiate the risk of sars in health care workers all health care workers performing aerosol generating procedures in suspect sars patient should observe strict airborne and contact preca utions see the cdc website at wwwcdcgovncidodsars for complete guidelines due to concern that sars may also be transmitted by direct contact with infected secretions or body fluids all health care workers should wash their hands promptly in soap and water after they remove their gloves when they are finished taking care of suspect sars patient close contacts eg family members of sars patients are at risk for infection close contacts with either fever or respiratory symptoms should not be permitted to enter the health care facility as visitors and should be educated about this policy system for screening close contacts of sars patients who are visitors to the facility for fever or respi ratory symptoms should be in place health care facilities should educate all visitors about the need for infection control precautions when visiting sars patients and their responsibility for adherence to them slippery slope 2005 central brookyln cbpp exercise exercise management use only for exercise management use only information contained in this

speci mens associated with sars wwwcdcgovncidodsarssarslabguidehtm the following activities require biosafety level 3 bsl 3 facilities and practices culture based attempts to isolate the agent including inoculation onto cell culture bacteriological or mycological media and eggs until the agent causing sars is fully characterized attempts to isolate routine viral respiratory pathogens by cell culture in patient meeting the sars case definition should only be attempted in bsl 3 facilities if bsl3 facility is not available contact the bureau of communicable disease during regular business hours at 212 7889830 to arrange shipment to the new york state wadsworth laboratories the wadsworth laboratories will only accept samples from patients meeting the cdc sars case definition after clearance by the nyc dohmh bureau of communicable disease 6 interim guidelines for management of exposures to sars in healthcare settings several health care workers in asia have been reported to develop sars after caring for patients with sars transmission to health care workers appears to have occurred after close contact with symptomatic individuals eg persons with fever or respiratory symptoms before recommended infection control precautions for sars were implemented ie unprotected exposures personal protective equipment appropriate for contact and airborne precautions eg hand hygiene gown gloves n95 respirator and eye protection have been recommended for healthcare workers to prevent t ransmission of sars in health care settings the cdc has proposed the following interim guidelines for management of employees with unprotected exposures to sars in health care facility exclusion from duty is recommended for health care worker i f fever or respiratory symptoms develop

worker if they do not have either fever or respir atory symptoms however the worker should report immediately any unprotected exposure to sars patient to the infection control or employee health department at the facility c hospitals should conduct daily monitoring of any health care workers with unprotected exposure for fever and respiratory symptoms workers with unprotected exposure developing such symptoms should not report for duty but should stay home and report symptoms to the appropriate facility point of contact immediately d hospitals s hould consider conducting passive surveillance eg review of occupational health or other sick leave records among all health care workers in facility with sars patient and all health care facility workers should be educated concerning the symptom s of sars 7 cdc sars broadcast and webcast cdc will be presenting lecture entitled preventing the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars on the public health training network
