of environmental protection issues updated june 21 2004 david m bearden analyst in environmental policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress highway and transit program reauthorization an analysis of environmental protection issues summary balancing public needs for surface transportation infrastructure with protecting the environment has been longstanding issue among states and local communities these two objectives can often conflict due to the rise in pollution that typically results when new highways or roadways are constructed or highway is expanded to provide greater traffic capacity expanding highway capacity can be especially challenging for states if the resulting rise in pollution would be great enough to make compliance with federal air quality standards more difficult in order to receive federal highway funds the clean air act requires states with air quality problems to demonstrate that their transportation plans conform to their plans to control emissions referred to as transportation conformity to help reduce potential conflicts between highway capacity needs and environmental requirements congress has authorized the use of federal highway funds to alleviate some of the pollution resulting from highway construction and travel the most recent multiyear funding authorization for these activities was provided in the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 pl 105 178 which expired at the end of fy2003 how to meet state needs for highway infrastructure while ensuring compliance with environmental requirements is among the key issues for reauthorization tea21 authorized total of 218 billion for federal highway and transit programs from fy1998 to fy2003 it set aside 9 billion for air quality projects including 8 billion for the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program cmaq to offset some of the emissions from highway travel as means to assist states in complying with federal air quality standards the other 1 billion was authorized for the purchase of clean fuel transit buses tea21 also expanded funding eligibility to allow states to use federal highway funds for mitigating water pollution from highway runoff the law also authorized funding for environmental research and the development of advanced vehicle technologies and it included several other provisions related to environmental protection the use of federal highway funds to address environmental needs has focused mostly on air quality projects due primarily to requirements for states to demonstrate conformity as condition for receiving federal highway funds most of this funding has been provided under the cmaq program while the programs effectiveness has been questioned there is broad support for increasing its funding in response to an upcoming rise in air quality needs among the states other air quality issues involve the use of transit funding for the purchase of clean fuel buses offering tax benefits for cleanerburning alcoholbased fuels and exempting certain lowemission vehicles from high occupancy vehicle hov lane requirements the extent to which water pollution mitigation projects and environmental research and development activities should be eligible for federal highway funds are issues as well this report provides background information and analysis of

transit program reauthorization an analysis of environmental protection issues introduction meeting highway capacity needs while protecting the environment is challenging task for many states in order to receive federal highway funding several environmental requirements must be met the clean air act requires states with poor air quality to demonstrate that plans to expand highway capacity would conform with their plans to control emissions referred to as transportation conformity state may be denied access to federal highway funds if conformity is not demonstrated or if air quality plans are determined to be inadequate as required by the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa the potential environmental impacts of all highway and transit projects are also subject to review prior to the approval of federal highway funds for final project design property acquisition or construction while air quality impacts are prominent consideration in the approval of many projects other common environmental impacts include water pollution from contaminated runoff and the loss of wetlands or other natural habitat that may occur from clearing the land for construction such impacts would need to be mitigated as condition of approval for federal highway funds environmental permits or other documentation may also be required before certain aspects of project may proceed to address potential conflicts between surface transportation needs and environmental quality congress has established numerous programs and authorities intended to help mitigate pollution resulting from highway construction and travel the most recent multiyear funding authorization for these activities was provided in the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 pl 105178 which expired on september 30 2003 this law authorized total of 218 billion for federal highway and transit programs from fy1998 through fy2003 it set aside approximately 9 billion of this amount for air quality projects authorized tax benefits for cleanerburning alcoholbased fuels and permitted states to exempt certain lowemission vehicles from high occupancy vehicle hov lane requirements tea21 also made funding available for mitigating water pollution from highway runoff and authorized funding for environmental research and the development of advanced vehicle technologies the most controversial issues for the reauthorization of federal highway and transit programs have been the amount of funding to provide for surface transportation infrastructure needs and how to allocate this funding among the states demonstration of conformity with air quality requirements and the performance of environmental reviews are pertinent to these overall funding issues as they play major role in the approval of federal highway funds for individual projects crs2 transportation stakeholders including numerous state departments of transportation and transportation advocacy organizations argue that extending the time frame for conformity would provide more time to control emissions and that streamlining the environmental review process would be more efficient thereby speeding project delivery on the other hand some environmental organizations have expressed concern that such changes may compromise environmental protection there also has been significant interest in the adequacy of funding for air quality projects under the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program cmaq states and environmental organizations advocate significantly increasing the funding for this program in light of emissions reductions that states may soon need to make in order to attain stricter federal air quality standards for ozone and fine particulates stakeholders have expressed differing levels of interest in other environmental issues regarding the adequacy of funding for the mitigation of water pollution from highway runoff research on how surface transportation impacts the environment and the development of advancedvehicle technologies whether to extend tax benefits for renewable alcoholbased fuels and whether to expand the exemption for lowemission vehicles from hov lane requirements are also issues this report provides background information on activities intended to help mitigate pollution resulting from highway construction and travel and analyzes key issues for congress this report is resource document for the reauthorization debate and will not be updated for discussion of reauthorization legislation see crs report rl32454 environmental provisions in surface transportation reauthorization legislation safetea s 1072 and tealu hr 3550 crs report rl32226 highway and transit program reauthorization legislation in the 2nd session 108th congress crs report rl32032 streamlining environmental reviews of highway and transit projects analysis of safetea and recent legislative activities crs report rl32106 transportation conformity under the clean air act in need of reform and crs issue brief ib10128 alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles issues in congress revenue and financing issues slower growth in motor fuels excise tax revenues that support the federal highway trust fund is significant consideration in determining how much funding is available for surface transportation infrastructure and related environmental needs during the previous authorization cycle robust gasoline sales led to substantial increase in trust fund revenues congress used the greater availability of funds to significantly expand most highway and transit programs including numerous environmental activities however the fiscal climate of the current authorization cycle is more restrictive due to smaller balance in the trust fund as result of slower growth in motor fuels excise tax revenues the limitation on available funding has made it more challenging to balance highway capacity needs with protecting the environment and other competing priorities in addition to deciding how much funding is made available for environmental activities the category of funding under which these activities would be authorized crs3 will be critical factor in determining whether their support is insured tea21 established new budget category of discretionary spending guarantees that function as firewall to ensure minimum level of funding for the majority of highway and transit programs including most environmental activities guaranteed funding is separated from the rest of the discretionary budget in way that prevents the use of federal highway trust fund revenues for any other purpose and as such is not subject to reduction in the annual appropriations process1 in addition to guaranteed funding tea21 authorized traditional discretionary funding for certain programs which is entirely subject to the annual appropriations process in appropriations subsequent to tea21 congress did not fully support the authorized levels for some of the traditional discretionary funding for environmental programs such as those for clean fuel buses environmental research and advanced vehicle technologies consequently an issue for the reauthorization of environmental programs is the extent to which funding for them should be firewalled to guarantee support for their implementation air quality issues motor vehicles have become cleaner in operation with the gradual tightening of federal emission standards since 19652 however the rise in the number of vehicle miles traveled has offset some of the reductions in air pollution achieved by more advanced emission controls3 as result motor vehicles continue to be major sources of air pollution including groundlevel ozone commonly referred to as smog4 emissions from motor vehicles continue to contribute significantly to poor 1 however surplus revenues in the highway account of the trust fund that would exceed the guaranteed funding levels are subject to the annual appropriations process as revenue aligned budget authority raba for further discussion refer to crs report rs21164 highway finance rabas doubleedged sword 2 congress first required vehicle emissions to be regulated in amendments to the clean air act under the motor vehicle air pollution control act of 1965 pl 89272 congress subsequently amended the clean air act in 1967 1970 1977 and 1990 to tighten controls on vehicle emissions and establish other requirements epa promulgated the most recent vehicle emission standards in february 2000 65 fr 6698 which will be phased in between model years 2004 and 2009 for history of the clean air act refer to crs report rl30853 clean air act summary of the act and its major requirements 3 during the same period that vehicle emission standards have become more stringent the department of transportation reports that the number of highway miles traveled has tripled from nearly 890 billion in 1965 to nearly 28 trillion in 2001 as indicated in national transportation statistics table 132 available online at httpwwwbtsgovpublications national_transportation_statistics2002 4 according to emissions data compiled by epa onroad vehicles account for 62 of carbon monoxide co emissions in the united states 37 of nitrogen oxides nox and 27 of volatile organic compound vocs nox and vocs contribute to groundlevel ozone pollution commonly referred to as smog these percentages are based on emissions data released in february 2003 in average annual emissions all criteria pollutants years continued crs4 air quality in numerous metropolitan areas making it difficult for some states to comply with emissions limits in their state implementation plans sips to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards naaqs5 how to meet public needs for greater highway capacity while controlling emissions is major issue for states with areas that are in nonattainment with the naaqs and areas that must maintain them as the availability of federal highway funding in these areas is dependent on the state demonstrating that its transportation plan conforms to the emissions budget for motor vehicles in its air quality plan in order to reduce conflicts between highway capacity needs and air quality requirements congress has authorized the use of federal highway funds for various projects that would reduce vehicular emissions the majority of the air quality funding authorized in tea21 was allocated to the cmaq program federal transit funding has also been made available to local transit agencies for the purchase of clean fuel buses congress has also authorized tax benefits to encourage the production and sale of renewable alcoholbased fuels that reduce vehicular emissions and petroleum consumption in addition states have had the flexibility to allow the singleoccupant use of certain lowemission vehicles in high occupancy vehicle hov lanes in order to encourage the purchase of cleaner vehicles further background information on transportation conformity and specific air quality programs and authorities and key issues for congress are discussed below transportation conformity the clean air act requires states and metropolitan planning organizations to demonstrate that their transportation plans conform to their air quality plans the purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the change in emission levels resulting from new transportation projects would not interfere with the states efforts to attain or maintain federal air quality standards many states have experienced greater challenges in demonstrating conformity as air quality requirements have become more stringent background section 176 of the clean air act prohibits federal agencies from funding projects in nonattainment or maintenance areas unless those projects conform to states sip6 because new highways generally lead to an increase in emissions both the statute and regulations currently require that metropolitan planning organizations transportation improvement program tip demonstrate 4 continued including 1980 1985 19892001 httpwwwepagovairtrends 5 the naaqs set safe ambient levels for carbon monoxide lead nitrogen dioxide ozone particulate matter and sulfur dioxide localities that have exceeded the naaqs for one or more pollutants are classified as nonattainment areas once attainment is achieved locality is reclassified as maintenance area states must develop plans to reduce emissions and comply with the standards in nonattainment areas and to control emissions and sustain air quality in maintenance areas epa reports that 107 areas with combined population of nearly 98 million are in violation of the naaqs for one or more pollutants of which 85 million people reside in ozone nonattainment areas 6 42 usc 7506 crs5 conformity less frequently than every two years highway and transit projects cannot receive federal funds unless they are part of conforming tip states also must demonstrate that their longterm transportation plans conform to their air quality plans over 20year time frame in addition to conformity requirements section 179 of the clean air act authorizes federal highway funds to be withheld from state if an adequate sip is not prepared or implemented properly7 for additional discussion of conformity requirements refer to crs report rl32106 transportation conformity under the clean air act in need of reform key policy issues there has been increasing support for allowing states more time to demonstrate conformity due to the likelihood that the impact of conformity requirements on states will grow in the next several years numerous factors have made it more challenging for states to control emissions and demonstrate conformity such as 1 the growth of emissions from sport utility vehicles suvs and other light trucks whose emissions are not regulated as strictly as passenger vehicles 2 greater than expected increases in vehicle miles traveled 3 recent court decisions that tightened conformity rules and 4 the implementation of more stringent federal air quality standards for ozone and fine particulates scheduled for 2004 which will result in more areas being subject to conformity demonstrations numerous metropolitan areas may face cutoff of highway and transit funds in the future unless they impose sharp reductions in emissions to demonstrate conformity during lapse in conformity state may receive federal highway funds only for limited set of exempted projects mostly safetyrelated or replacement and repair of existing transit facilities the rules do not even allow funding of new projects that might reduce emissions such as new transit lines how conformity requirements may affect states access to federal highway funds has raised significant concerns for the reauthorization of federal surface transportation programs while conformity requirements could be modified to provide greater compliance flexibility for states proposals to do so have been controversial because conformity is the only current mechanism to ensure that states consider how their transportation planning decisions might affect air quality congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program congress established the cmaq program under the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 istea pl 102240 this program is based on the fundamental concept that lowering the number of miles traveled by motor vehicles and reducing congestion to make vehicles operate more efficiently can reduce emissions and improve overall air quality the program has been widely popular among local areas struggling to reduce air pollution as it is the largest single source of federal funding for air quality projects while questions have been raised about the programs effectiveness there appears to be broad support for increasing its funding levels in response to concern that greater emission reductions will be needed in many states when new nonattainment areas are designated 7 42 usc 7509 crs6 background congress originally authorized 6 billion for the cmaq program from fy1992 through fy1997 in enacting tea21 congress authorized another 81 billion for continuing it from fy1998 through fy2003 cmaq funding is available only for projects that would reduce traffic congestion and assist states in complying with the naaqs for carbon monoxide ozone and particulate matter states with areas that are in nonattainment with the naaqs for these pollutants and those that must maintain them receive cmaq funds according to formula based on the severity of air pollution in those areas and the population residing in them states that do not have any nonattainment or maintenance areas receive 05 of the total annual cmaq apportionment and have the flexibility to use this amount for transportation projects that are eligible under cmaq or the surface transportation program tea21 also allowed each state to transfer portion of its cmaq funds to other highway programs that the state determines to have higher priority if certain conditions are met most transportation control measures identified in section 108 of the clean air act are eligible for funding8 cmaq projects generally fall into one of the following eight categories 1 mass transit 2 traffic flow improvements 3 rideshare programs 4 traffic demand management programs 5 bicycle and pedestrian projects 6 public education 7 vehicle inspection and maintenance programs or 8 alternative fuel conversions according to the federal highway administration more funding has been obligated for conventional mass transit projects than for any other activity approximately 44 of total cmaq funds since fy1992 key policy issues after more than decade of implementation questions have been raised as to whether the cmaq program has reduced emissions significantly enough to help states comply with the naaqs whether to modify various elements of the program to improve its effectiveness or possibly to shift its focus is an issue for reauthorization congress included provision in tea21 that required the national academy of sciences nas to study whether the emission reductions from cmaq projects have been large enough to help states comply with the naaqs the nas released its report in the spring of 20029 the study indicated that the air quality benefits of cmaq projects were difficult to assess because of the lack of quantitative data for all projects for those with quantitative data the nas concluded that the emission reductions were relatively small and that these projects were less costeffective than other pollution control measures however the nas also concluded that when these emission reductions are assessed collectively the overall air quality benefits that they provide may be great enough to help states attain and maintain the naaqs in areas that are on the margin of compliance consequently the nas recommended that the program be continued and suggested various modifications to improve its effectiveness the findings of the nas have raised numerous issues for reauthorization since the impact of the program on air quality was difficult to quantify some argue that the 8 42 usc 7408f 9 the national academy of sciences transportation research board the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program assessing 10 years of experience 2002 508 p refer to httpgullivertrborgpublicationssrsr264pdf for the full text crs7 focus should be shifted to reducing traffic congestion in general rather than linking eligibility to air quality benefits that are questionable there also are arguments that the statutory formula should at least be amended to provide higher amount of minimum funding to states that do not have any air quality problems but that would still benefit from reduction in traffic congestion rising traffic congestion and progressively lengthier commuting times in some metropolitan areas have motivated support for such options among some transportation stakeholders on the other hand proponents of the program argue that areas on the verge of attainment may benefit from the continued use of cmaq funds for air quality projects even if the emission reductions are relatively small they also argue that more areas will be in need of emission reductions in order to comply with stricter federal standards for ozone and fine particulates scheduled to become effective in 2004 and that air quality benefits from cmaq projects matter how small would be helpful however the current funding formula does not include factor to account for new areas that will be in nonattainment with these stricter standards consequently the formula would need to be changed during reauthorization in order to allow affected states to receive greater funding clean fuel buses in general transit projects provide air quality benefits by reducing the number of motor vehicles on the road and the emissions that are generated from their operation however transit vehicles mainly buses produce emissions themselves in many local areas with air quality problems transit agencies have purchased buses that operate on cleanerburning fuels as means to control emissions in enacting tea21 congress set aside funding for program to assist transit agencies in purchasing clean fuel buses but subsequently redirected this funding to more general fund for bus purchases not restricted to fuel type while this program has not been implemented many transit agencies have still chosen to purchase clean fuel buses with federal funds at their discretion the upcoming designation of new nonattainment areas has sparked further interest in the use of clean fuel buses and some have advocated that dedicated source of funding should be established for acquiring them this proposal has been controversial to those who argue that local transit agencies should be allowed to decide what kinds of buses best meet their capacity needs rather than having portion of federal transit funds restricted to certain types of buses based on fuel type background tea21 authorized the secretary of transportation to establish clean fuels formula grant program to assist transit agencies in acquiring low emission alternativefueled buses improving facilities to accommodate them and rebuilding pre1993 engines with clean fuel technology under this authority the secretary of transportation may award competitive grants to transit agencies based on formula that factors in the number of vehicles in transit systems fleet the number of passenger miles traveled and the severity of air pollution in recipients area eligible technologies include compressed natural gas cng liquified natural gas lng biodiesel fuel battery power alcoholbased fuel hybrid electric power fuel cells clean diesel fuel or similar technologies crs8 to support the program tea21 authorized 200 million annually from fy1999 through fy2003 for total authorization of 1 billion over five years of the 200 million annual authorization 100 million was authorized as guaranteed firewalled funds and the remaining 100 million was authorized as traditional discretionary funds subject to the annual appropriations process in appropriations bills subsequent to tea21 congress has not appropriated any of the 100 million in traditional discretionary funds that were annually authorized for the program and has redirected the 100 million in guaranteed annual funding to traditional capital bus improvement projects the federal transit administration reports that data are not available to determine the extent to which transit agencies have purchased alternativefueled buses with the redirected funding even though there is dedicated source of funding for the purchase of clean fuel buses they do receive preferential treatment under federal matching funds requirements to help local areas attain or maintain federal air quality standards generally federal transit programs provide up to 80 of the cost of new bus purchases and local transit agencies are responsible for securing funding from state or local sources to pay the remaining 20 however the federal contribution can be increased to 90 to purchase buses that use clean or alternative fuels for the purpose of complying with clean air act requirements10 the major capital assistance programs administered by the federal transit administration that have funded the purchase of alternativefueled buses include the capital investment grants and loans program urbanized area formula program nonurbanized area formula program elderly persons and persons with disabilities program and the job accessreverse commute program some funding is also available under the new starts program of these programs the urbanized area formula program has been the largest source of funding for buses that operate on alternative fuels alternativefueled buses have accounted for significant share of federal transit administration funding obligations in recent years the agency began compiling data on new bus purchases by fuel type in fy2000 as indicated by the data in the table below an average of 34 of the federal funding obligated for the purchase of new transit buses from fy2000 to fy2002 has been devoted to those that operate on alternative fuels air quality concerns are frequently among the most prominent factors in transit agencys decision to purchase clean fuel buses despite their typically higher costs for example transit agencies located in metropolitan areas that need emissions reductions to comply with federal air quality standards under the clean air act are more likely to choose cleaner buses that operate on alternative fuels other factors may include the extent to which the purchase of cleaner buses would improve the publics perception of transit and increase ridership and whether there are any state or local mandates or incentives for the use of alternative fuels 10 49 usc 5323i crs9 apart from air quality concerns an economic factor that transit agencies typically consider in their planning process is the extent to which the purchase of alternativefueled buses would help to maximize the benefits of past investments in the refueling infrastructure necessary for such vehicles consequently transit agencies that have invested in alternativefueled buses in the past are more likely to purchase additional ones in the future conversely transit agencies that have not yet invested in them are less likely to do so as they would need to invest additional resources in new refueling infrastructure federal funding obligated by the federal transit administration for the purchase of buses by type of fuel from fy2000 to fy2002a diesel or gasoline alternative fuels b

reflect the amount of federal funding obligated to assist transit agencies in purchasing buses dollar amounts do not include funds provided by transit agencies to meet matching funds requirements and therefore do not reflect the total cost of bus purchases b alternative fuels include compressed natural gas liquified natural gas liquified petroleum gas methanol ethanol electric biodiesel dual fuel operation fuel cell and hybrid electric key policy issues as indicated by the above data funding obligations for alternativefueled buses have significantly exceeded the original 200 million annual authorization for the clean fuels formula grant program this trend has caused some to argue that setting aside funding exclusively for the purchase of alternative fueled buses is not necessary to encourage their use and that the favorable 10 matching funds requirement is sufficient encouragement some also point out that stricter standards for heavyduty diesel engines and fuels which are scheduled to be phased in beginning in 2007 and 2006 respectively will allow diesel buses to achieve level of emissions performance that is equivalent to alternative fuels such as cng such critics say that the cleaner performance of new diesel buses that are on the way will negate the need for reserving portion of transit funds for alternativefueled buses in order to reduce emissions on the other hand some environmental organizations have expressed skepticism that diesel buses equipped with cleaner engines will generate as few emissions in actual operation as those that operate on alternative fuels they argue that dedicated funding should be set aside in reauthorization for alternativefueled buses to ensure that transit agencies continue to purchase them as means to improve air quality federal tax benefits and revenues for renewable alcoholbased fuels the federal government currently provides an excise tax reduction and an income tax credit to promote the production sale and use of renewable alcohol crs10 based fuels including ethanol and methanol11 vehicles operated on these fuels typically produce fewer tailpipe emissions particularly carbon monoxide than those operated on conventional gasoline or diesel reduction in tailpipe emissions can help to reduce the impact of highway travel on air quality however alcoholbased fuels can be more volatile than conventional gasoline or diesel and the use of these alternative fuels can result in higher evaporative emissions during refueling which could offset tailpipe emission reductions in some cases while alcoholbased fuels have the potential to improve air quality the preferential treatment of these fuels in the us tax code has been controversial background the current authority for the tax benefits that apply to alcohol based fuels expires at the end of 2007 these benefits are available for alcoholbased fuels if they are derived from renewable sources those produced from petroleum natural gas or coal are specifically excluded from eligibility under the us tax code12 ethanol is produced primarily from the distillation of corn and is therefore renewable while methanol can also be derived from renewable biomass or municipal waste it usually is produced from natural gas which is not renewable consequently the tax benefits for alcoholbased fuels apply mostly to the sale of ethanol among alternative fuels ethanol is the most commonly used the majority of the ethanol sold is not used in its pure form rather it is blended with gasoline to produce gasohol which can be used in any conventional vehicle as substitute for ordinary gasoline ethanol is also used as an additive for various purposes it is commonly added to reformulated gasoline rfg to increase the oxygen content of the fuel rfg must be made available in certain areas to meet clean air act requirements to reduce vehicular emissions of precursors to groundlevel ozone commonly referred to as smog during the winter months rfg also must be used in certain areas to reduce emissions of carbon monoxide in addition to meeting oxygenate requirements for rfg ethanol is added to gasoline in some areas to increase octane levels for additional information on ethanol refer to crs report rl30369 fuel ethanol background and public policy issues the excise tax reduction for ethanol is most commonly taken at the blended state by either fuel producers or distributors the amount of the tax reduction depends on the percentage of the blend that is composed of ethanol the current tax reduction is 52 cents per gallon for gasohol consisting of at least 10 ethanol 40 cents per gallon for blends of at least 77 ethanol and 30 cents per gallon for blends of at least 57 ethanol these amounts reduce the excise tax levied on the sale of gasohol below the current tax rate of 184 cents per gallon for ordinary gasoline while nearly all of the excise taxes on gasoline are deposited into the federal highway trust fund 25 cents of the per gallon tax for gasohol are deposited into general treasury funds and are therefore not dedicated to the support of federal surface transportation programs 11 the statutory authority for the income tax credit is codified at 26 usc 40 and the statutory authority for the excise tax reduction is codified at 26 usc 4081 12 26 usc 40d1 for the income tax credit and 26 usc 4081b3 for the excise tax reduction crs11 key policy issues since the wholesale cost of ethanol is relatively high tax benefits for the sale of ethanol are needed to make it competitive with other fuel additives and with conventional fuels however there has been disagreement as to whether these benefits are appropriate proponents argue that ensuring the commercial viability and resulting availability of ethanol improves air quality due to reduced vehicle emissions lowers us dependence on foreign oil and provides an additional market for corn farmers who grow the biomass needed to produce ethanol on the other hand opponents argue that gasohol tax benefits are essentially subsidy for the ethanol industry which reduces overall revenues for the federal highway trust fund some also argue that the emissions and energy benefits of ethanol can be offset by the energy needed to produce the fuel and the resulting emissions from generating that energy key issues for reauthorization include 1 whether to extend the tax benefits beyond this time frame 2 whether to increase or decrease the amount of the excise tax reduction and the income tax credit and 3 whether to continue the current policy of devoting portion of alcohol fuel tax revenues to general treasury funds use of high occupancy vehicle hov lanes many states have constructed hov lanes as means to reduce traffic congestion through reducing congestion these types of lanes also can provide air quality benefits because vehicles typically generate fewer emissions when operating more efficiently at steady speeds in tea21 congress approved novel approach to using hov lanes for air quality purposes by allowing states to permit vehicles with extremely low emissions to operate in an hov lane with only one occupant the premise was to offer benefit that would possibly encourage the purchase of cleaner vehicles thereby helping to improve air quality this authority expired on october 1 2003 some have advocated that it should be renewed and expanded to include other lowemission vehicles that were not clean enough to qualify under the previous authority however others have expressed concern that expanding this benefit to include greater number of vehicles could cause traffic congestion to rise impairing the primary function of hov lanes background tea21 provided the authority for states to permit vehicle with only one occupant to operate in an hov lane if the vehicle is certified under federal regulations as an inherently lowemission vehicle ilev the law authorized states to implement this policy through september 30 2003 and granted each state the right to revoke this policy within its borders if hov lane congestion were to increase as result of this practice epa established the ilev category to recognize the inherently low emissions of certain types of fuel and vehicle technologies and to encourage their use the ilev standards are so strict that only those vehicles without evaporative fuel emissions are able to meet them consequently vehicle that burns any quantity of gasoline or diesel cannot meet the standards including hybrid vehicles that operate on combination of gasoline or diesel and electric batteries vehicles that operate entirely on alternative fuels with evaporative emissions such as compressed natural gas cng liquified natural gas lng or purely electric vehicles are the only ones that are able to meet the standards such vehicles account for very small percentage of the onroad fleet due to the limited availability of ilevs few motorists have been able to take advantage of the hov lane benefit provided in tea21 crs12 key policy issues there has been growing interest among motorists the vehicle industry and some states in renewing the hov lane benefit and expanding it to hybrid vehicles which are more widely available proponents argue that hybrid vehicles are almost as clean as ilevs and that expanding this benefit to include them would encourage additional sales of cleaner vehicles that would help to improve overall air quality over the shortterm allowing hybrid vehicles to use hov lanes with only one occupant may not cause hov lanes to become noticeably more congested in areas where there is excess hov lane capacity to accommodate them because they currently represent fairly small percentage of the vehicle fleet however hov lanes could become more congested in some areas over the long term if the popularity and corresponding sales of these vehicles were to rise making them larger share of the onroad fleet water quality issues in addition to contributing to air pollution highway travel and construction activities can impair water quality runoff from highways can deposit variety of petrochemicals and other potentially hazardous substances into adjacent waterways and wetlands which can migrate over time throughout watershed and result in violations of water quality standards highway runoff is basically nonpoint source that is more difficult to quantify and control than conventional point source such as water discharge pipe from stationary facility in seeking federal funds for new highway construction states must consider the potential impacts of highway runoff on water quality and wetlands during the environmental review process required by nepa depending on the extent of these impacts mitigation such as storm water management systems may be required to prevent or minimize the potential for pollution if wetlands would be lost as result of new highway construction other measures such as mitigation banks may be required in order to make up for these losses tea21 established preference for the use of these banks to address the impact of new highway construction on wetlands13 the costs of water pollution mitigation and the replacement of wetlands is typically absorbed as part of the total costs for new highway construction project however many highways were constructed prior to more recent requirements for the installation of storm water management systems or other water pollution mitigation measures consequently many waterways adjacent to highways have been contaminated from years of runoff and are in need of environmental restoration in response to these needs congress has provided authority for states to use federal highway funds for environmental restoration or mitigation projects to address water pollution from existing highways eligibility for these projects is provided under the surface transportation program in general and under the transportation enhancements setaside within this program the conditions of eligibility under each authority and key issues for congress are discussed below 13 in july 2003 the environmental protection agency federal highway administration and army corps of engineers issued new guidance on the preference for the use of wetlands mitigation banks see httpwwwfhwadotgovenvironmentwetlandtea21bnkhtm crs13 surface transportation program most federal highway programs are devoted to meeting specific needs such interstate maintenance bridge repair or highway safety and states are generally not permitted to use funds allocated to these programs for other purposes the surface transportation program is different in that it gives states broad flexibility to use federal highway funds to meet multiple surface transportation needs in enacting tea21 congress amended the eligibility requirements of the surface transportation program to include projects that would address the impacts of highway travel on water quality background under the surface transportation program the federal highway administration is authorized to make funds available to the states for environmental restoration and pollution abatement projects that address water contamination or environmental degradation attributed to runoff from an existing highway14 for clarification purposes the construction or retrofit of storm water treatment systems is highlighted as an eligible activity surface transportation program funds may be spent on environmental restoration and pollution abatement activities only when an existing highway is undergoing reconstruction rehabilitation resurfacing or restoration the portion of program funds that can be spent on environmental restoration and pollution abatement activities for these types of highway projects is limited to 20 of the total project cost the law does not provide the authority for states to expend program funds to mitigate water pollution from past runoff if improvements are not being made to the highway at the time while environmental restoration and pollution abatement activities are eligible for funding the law does not require states to expend their surface transportation program funds on these activities rather state may use program funds for these activities at its discretion determining how many states have done so and in what amount is not possible because states are not required to comprehensively track this information however states may voluntarily supply this information to the federal highway administration based on the data that have been provided the states report that they have spent total of 19 million in surface transportation program funds on environmental restoration and pollution abatement projects from fy1998 through midfy2003 however the actual expenditure may be significantly greater than this amount due to the absence of complete data from all states states also must spend portion of their federal funds for new highway construction to satisfy water pollution mitigation requirements due to the scope of most new construction and the extent of its impacts these amounts mostly likely have exceeded the funding that has been spent to mitigate pollution from older highways however data on the specific amount of funding are not available because states do not typically separate mitigation costs out from the total costs of new highway construction key policy issues some of the relevant issues for the reauthorization of the surface transportation program are 1 whether to increase the limitation on the portion of the total project cost that can be spent on environmental restoration and pollution abatement activities in order to accommodate cases in which mitigation 14 23 usc 133b14 crs14 costs may exceed the current 20 cap 2 whether to establish comprehensive reporting mechanism for tracking the amount of stp funds expended by states on these activities so as to gain better understanding of the extent to which transportation facilities have impacted water quality and necessitated mitigation and 3 whether to permit stp funds to be used to address water pollution from highway runoff even if highway improvements are underway at the time transportation enhancement setaside although states have the flexibility to fund wide variety of projects under the surface transportation program they must set aside 10 of their annual apportionment of funds under this program for transportation enhancements that would improve the multimodal environmental cultural or aesthetic aspects of the nations surface transportation system in enacting tea21 congress modified the definition of enhancements to include the mitigation of water pollution from highway runoff as an eligible activity while the use of enhancements funding to address water quality needs has not been controversial some criticisms have been raised about the use of federal highway funds for some enhancements that are not directly related to surface transportation infrastructure needs background states may choose to spend their enhancements funds on numerous categories of eligible activities the categories that have received the most funding include bicycle paths and pedestrian walkways preservation of historic transportation facilities and landscaping and scenic beautification15 of the eligible categories mitigation of water pollution from highway runoff has received relatively small percentage of overall enhancements funding tea21 authorized total of 33 billion for transportation enhancements from fy1998 through fy2003 of this amount the national transportation enhancements clearinghouse reports that states had expended 66 million or nearly 2 on water pollution mitigation projects through midfy200316 while this amount represents small fraction of enhancements funding it is more than three times the amount that states had reportedly spent on these types of projects with general surface transportation program funds the federal contribution to the cost of projects funded under the surface transportation program including pollution mitigation is generally limited to 80 15 the categories of eligible transportation enhancements include 1 facilities for bicycles and pedestrians 2 acquisition of scenic easements and scenic or historic sites 3 scenic or historic highway programs 4 landscaping and scenic beautification 5 historic preservation 6 rehabilitation and operation of historic transportation structures or facilities 7 preservation of abandoned railway corridors 8 control and removal of outdoor advertising 9 archaeological planning and research 10 mitigation of water pollution due to highway runoff 11 transportation museums and 12 measures to reduce vehiclecaused wildlife mortality 16 the national transportation enhancements clearinghouse is sponsored jointly by the federal highway administration and the railstotrails conservancy the clearinghouse compiles data from the states on the categories of transportation enhancements for which federal funding is obligated crs15 as is the case with most other federal highway programs however states have the flexibility to calculate the nonfederal share of the total cost of transportation enhancements based on individual projects multiple projects or on programmatic level states also can use funds from federal agencies other than the department of transportation to count toward the nonfederal share of the cost of enhancements17 consequently the federal share of the cost of an individual project can be as high as 100 if the federal share for others is low enough to offset that amount and yield federal share of more than 80 for an entire group of projects key policy issues while numerous states local communities historic preservation interests and environmental organizations have expressed support for the diversity of activities that are supported with enhancements funding some argue that certain enhancements are an ineffective use of federal highway funds opponents believe that federal highway funds should only be spent on improvements to surface transportation infrastructure rather than on projects that may provide some related benefit but that do not meet highway capacity needs help to relieve traffic congestion or meet an environmental requirement necessary for project approval limitations on federal highway funds as result of recent decline in trust fund revenues have sparked some support for such arguments if the funding for transportation enhancements were reduced or eliminated states would still be able to use general surface transportation program funds at their discretion for pollution mitigation projects assuming that current authority were not repealed environmental research and development issues the majority of research and development activities that are supported with federal highway funds focus on how to improve the overall function and safety of the nations surface transportation system in order to meet travel needs relatively small fraction of federal highway funds has been devoted to researching the environmental impacts of highway travel or developing environmentally beneficial technologies some argue that more highway resources should be devoted to environmental research and development in light of the impacts of vehicular travel on air and water quality others counter that highway capacity and safety needs should remain the focus of research funded with motor fuels tax revenues and that other federal agencies such as epa or the department of energy already conduct variety of activities to research pollution from motor vehicles and develop advanced vehicle technologies while tea21 authorized the secretary of transportation to establish an environmental research program it was never implemented due to lack of funding tea21 also authorized program to develop advanced vehicle technologies but its implementation has been limited due to insufficient funding 17 23 usc 133e5c crs16 surface transportationenvironment cooperative research program tea21 authorized the secretary of transportation to establish surface transportationenvironment cooperative research program to be carried out with other federal agencies state and local officials scientists and engineers and environmental organizations it was designed to examine the complex relationships between surface transportation systems and the environment and to improve methods for assessing transportation needs and determining the environmental impacts of transportation the law authorized 592 million in guaranteed funds for surface transportation research from fy1998 to fy2003 but specific amount was not allocated for the environmental research program in subsequent appropriations congress has not designated funding to implement the program nor has the administration allocated funding for it within its discretion advanced vehicle technologies program tea21 authorized the secretary of transportation to establish an advanced vehicle technologies program to encourage the development of multimodal and environmental technologies to improve the efficiency safety and costeffectiveness of the national transportation system the law directed the secretary of transportation to promote technological advances through contracts cooperative agreements grants and other transactions with other federal agencies state and local governments businesses and research or educational organizations tea21 authorized total of 250 million in general treasury revenues to support the program from fy1999 to fy2003 which was subject to the annual appropriations process of the 250 million authorization congress has appropriated 10 million to date consequently the implementation of the program has been limited the projects that have been funded have focused on the development of low and zero emission technologies such as hybrid all electric and fuel cell power trains18 streamlining the environmental review process many stakeholders at the state and local level have expressed longstanding concerns that the environmental review process for highway construction projects can be overly timeconsuming and can impose additional costs some state transportation departments and transportation advocacy organizations support revisions to certain elements of the process that could speed project delivery however environmental organizations have expressed concern that changes to the process might weaken environmental protections they also argue that lengthy environmental reviews are sometimes warranted due to the scope of proposed alterations to the natural landscape and the potential effects of increased traffic capacity on air and water quality 18 for further information refer to httpscitechdotgovpartnersnextsuravp crs17 background the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa pl 91190 requires all federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of their proposed actions to ensure that these impacts are considered before final decisions are made nepa requires federal agencies to provide detailed statement of environmental impacts for every proposed federal action significantly affecting the quality of the environment the detailed statement has been subsequently referred to as an environmental impact statement eis the eis must include description of the projects purpose and need an analysis of all reasonable project alternatives description of the affected environment and the environmental consequences of impacts to the affected environment of each alternative19 the eis must also demonstrate that appropriate comments were solicited from relevant federal state and local agencies and from the public relevant agencies obligated to provide comments are those with jurisdiction by law or special expertise with regard to the environmental impacts of the project if it is not clear whether project would have significant impacts an environmental assessment ea must be prepared an eis is required if significant impacts are identified at any time during preparation of the ea otherwise finding of significant impact fonsi will be issued projects that do not individually or cumulatively have significant social economic or environmental impact are excluded from the requirement to prepare an ea or eis such projects are processed as categorical exclusion ce which according to the federal highway administration account for about 91 of all highway projects state agencies are required to provide fhwa with documentation to prove the action qualifies as ce the type of documentation required will depend upon the project final design activities property acquisition or project construction cannot proceed until one of the following occurs an action is classified as ce fonsi is approved for an ea or an eis is approved for further discussion refer to crs report rl32024 background on nepa implementation for highway projects streamlining the process the federal highway administration reports that approximately 3 of all federally funded highway projects have significant enough impact on the environment to require the preparation of an eis these projects have received about 9 of all federal highway funds while these amounts represent relatively small portion of projects and overall funding projects requiring an eis are usually large and costly and affect sizeable populations consequently construction delays can be controversial the federal highway administration has indicated that the planning and construction of major highway project typically takes between 9 and 19 years depending on size and complexity of these projects the preliminary design and environmental review process accounts for one to five years of this time 19 federal highway administration regulations implementing the nepa process are specified at 23 cfr 771 further guidance is available on the nepa project development process web page at httpenvironmentfhwadotgovprojdevindexhtm crs18 key policy issues to reduce the approval time for highway projects and speed the delivery of federal highway funds to states and local areas congress included provisions in section 1309 of tea21 which require the secretary of transportation to streamline the environmental review process environmental streamlining can generally be described as cooperatively establishing realistic project development time frames among transportation and environmental agencies and then working together to adhere to those time frames the department of transportation has taken numerous administrative actions in response to this requirement but has not issued final regulations to put streamlining into practice on national scale while the clinton administration did submit streamlining regulatory proposal in may 2000 it was widely criticized on numerous grounds by congress the states highway interest groups and environmental organizations the principal criticisms were that it did not fully address the requirements of tea21 and that it would have added new elements to the planning and development process that may have resulted in further project delays due to the these concerns the bush administration withdrew the proposal in september 2002 and indicated that new proposal would not be forthcoming until it is clear how congress may address the issue during surface transportation reauthorization in the interim president bush has issued an executive order which directs federal agencies to expedite environmental reviews for highpriority transportation projects and has established specific goals to reduce the time frames for review20 hearings were held during the 107th congress to examine the streamlining issue and streamlining has been discussed in hearings on surface transportation reauthorization during the 108th congress in the conference report on tea21 hrept 105550 congress stated its expectation that the secretary of transportation would implement the streamlining requirements through the regulatory process some members have expressed their disappointment that five years after the enactment of the law streamlining regulations have yet to be finalized the lack of final regulations has increased interest in further legislative action to speed project delivery and meet public demands for transportation infrastructure 20 for more information refer to httpwwwfhwadotgovstewardshipeoindexhtm for other versions of this document see
