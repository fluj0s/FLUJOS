the new law pl 105336 the william f goodling child nutrition reauthorization act of 1998 this bipartisan housesenate agreement enacted on october 31 1998 reauthorizes almost all expiring child nutrition appropriations authorities through fy20031 it also includes number of modest changes in child nutrition and wic program operations and rules primarily an initiative increasing the availability of federal support for snacks served in afterschool programs many of the new laws provisions are drawn from the administrations reauthorization package hr 3666s 2166 savings provisions 1 require that when indexed for inflation each year virtually all federal child nutrition permealsnack subsidy rates be rounded down to the nearest whole cent not rounded to the nearest quarter cent and 2 reduce federal funds set aside for audits in the child and adult care food program the bipartisan house and senate versions of the reauthorization measure considered in conference hr 3874 as passed by the house s 2286 as passed by the senate were very similar significant differences between the two measures included 1 whether to require funding for set of pilot projects under which elementary schools would offer free breakfasts to all students regardless of family income mandatory funding as in the senates bill or to authorize funds for the pilot projects subject to appropriations decisions discretionary funding as in the house bill 2 how much to increase federal support for snacks in afterschool programs and 3 whether to reduce funds set aside for audits in the child and adult care food program in the end the housesenate conferees chose and congress approved and sent to the president discretionary funding for the breakfast pilot projects more expansive provisions for federal support for afterschool snacks and small reduction in audit funds costs and savings congressional budget office estimates under the new law cost items total 173 million in outlays 181 million in budget authority through fy2003 savings through fy2003 total 176 million in outlays 215 million in budget authority as result net savings in federal spending through fy2003 are expected to be 3 million in outlays or 34 million in budget authority most of the laws costs are accounted for by provisions expanding federal support for snacks in afterschool programs 127 million in outlays 136 million in budget authority on the other side of the ledger the lions share of savings 167 million in outlays 175 million in budget authority is attributable to provisions changing the rounding rules for federal subsidies cost items in the house bill that went to conference with the senate primarily provisions increasing federal support for afterschool programs totaled almost 130 million in outlays over 130 million in budget authority through fy2003 savings totaled approximately 200 million in outlays some 250 million in budget 1 left out are few unused demonstration project authorizations and authority for activities that the law folds into larger program authorizations as well as special project related programs dealing with boarder babies crs3 authority and the net savings in federal spending through fy2003 that would have been produced by the house bill added up to an estimated 70 million in outlays about 120 million in budget authority cost items in the senate bill that went to conference with the house primarily provisions increasing federal support for afterschool programs and mandatory funding for free school breakfast pilot projects totaled about 165 million in outlays 175 million in budget authority through fy2003 savings totaled more than 170 million in outlays just over 180 million in budget authority net savings in federal spending that would have come from the senate bill added up to 8 million in outlays and 11 million in budget authority through fy2003 afterschool programs and the child and adult care food program cacfp the 1998 reauthorization laws major initiative expands the availability of federal subsidies for snacks served in afterschool programs in two basic ways first it allows institutions schools and public or private nonprofit organizations that provide care to atrisk schoolchildren those living in lowerincome areas during afterschool hours to receive federal payments without family income test for the recipient child for snacks served free to participating children including adolescents second it permits schools sponsoring afterschool programs to receive payments varied by family income for snacks served in their afterschool programs including those serving adolescents when the program is not operated in lower income area the house and senate versions of this initiative differed primarily over how far to extend federal subsidies for free snacks in afterschool programs other changes in the new law affecting outsideofschool program sponsors 1 allow them to participate in the cacfp so long as they meet state or local health and safety standards unless statelocal licensing or approval as child care provider is required of them 2 only require schools operating day care programs receiving federal child nutrition payments to meet state or local child care licensing or approval standards if they are covered by them ie alternate federal standards will not be applied to them and 3 permanently provides funding for demonstration project operating in iowa and kentucky that expands the availability of cacfp payments to forprofit child care providers the reauthorization measure also includes two provisions related to improving program integrity in the cacfp requirement for periodic visits to cacfp sites and funding 1 million year for cacfp training and technical assistance activities finally and it makes permanent automatic eligibility under the cacfp for even start program participants school breakfast pilot projects the new law includes provisions for 3year pilot projects under which all elementary school students in participating schools would receive free breakfasts regardless of family income the bill authorizes the projects subject to appropriations summer food service program the reauthorization law loosens limits on the number of sites operated and children served by private nonprofit sponsors this and other changes eg allowing the use of private vendors to provide mealssnacks are intended to make it easier for private nonprofit organizations particularly those in rural areas to participate in the summer food service program the law also adjusts federal subsidy rates in alaska and hawaii upward to conform to the practice crs4 in other child nutrition programs and expands authority for schools running summer programs to receive subsidies for meals when child does not take an item offered offer vs serve authority flexibility for states and schools the new law drops restriction that limits the degree to which states can transfer state administrative expense sae grant money among child nutrition program operations this will allow sae funding including the money derived from separate administrative grant related to the summer food service program to be used as states see fit to help them administer child nutrition programs the law also includes provisions easing administrative burdens on schools where single state agency administers multiple child nutrition programs it requires that the agency allow schools that run them to operate programs under single permanent agreement with the state as opposed to separate agreements for each program and requires that common claiming procedure be used to obtain schools federal subsidies as opposed to separate procedures and forms for each program in addition the law loosens requirements on schools choosing to take advantage of paperwork reduction option to offer all students free meals at additional federal cost often called provision 2 and includes special grants to help schools take advantage of current options to reduce paperwork finally the new law includes an amendment extending waiver allowing schools to postpone using weighted averages when reviewing their menus for compliance with federal nutrition standards and another to encourage schools to establish adequate meal service periods homeless children nutrition programs the 1998 child nutrition reauthorization law merges separate limited nutrition programs for homeless children into the regular cacfp thereby expanding the availability of federal support for meals served to homeless children the wic program the reauthorization law contains number of amendments relating to the wic program in general they would give state wic agencies some more flexibility in how they use their federal funds limit agencies ability to retain unused funds for use in the next fiscal year add provisions aimed at protecting the programs integrity and revise provisions related to the wic farmers market nutrition program the law also requires study of cost containment efforts in the wic program and study of the costs of delivering wic services specifically the new law eases rules governing wic agencies ability to convert funds provided for food to spending on nutrition services and administration allows wic agencies to use money provided for food to purchase breast pumps permits wic agencies to retain and spend forward unused nutrition services and administration funding in the following fiscal year but only up to an amount equal to 1 of their total grant or up to 15 if the additional crs5 amount is used for management information or electronic benefit transfer systems2 permits wic agencies to retain and spend back unused funding to cover costs incurred in the prior year above the amounts allowed under prior law encourages states to pursue abuse in the program by loosening the rules governing use of any misspent money they recoup so that wic agencies can use the money for program purposes as late as the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which they were collected requires wic agencies to permanently disqualify vendors convicted of trafficking or other serious violations requires wic agencies to design and implement systems to identify individuals who might be participating at more than one site requires wic agencies to identify highrisk participating vendors retailers and follow up with compliance investigations includes provisions requiring that those involved in trafficking face forfeiture of property associated with the trafficking requires wic participants to have income documentation to support their eligibility while granting wic agencies some authority to waive the requirement mandates that individuals be physically present at each certification and renewal of eligibility while granting wic agencies some authority to waive the requirement requires the development of longrange plans for wic management information and electronic benefit transfer systems requires wic agencies to take into consideration the prices stores charge for wic foods when selecting vendors for participation and loosens requirements on states participating in the wic farmers market nutrition program by allowing them use any additional funding to increase benefits rather than adding participants and allowing them to count income they receive from donations and vendor fines toward meeting the required match for farmers market program grants 2 wic agencies will not be allowed to spend forward unused food dollars and when compared to prior law it is important to note that the new law reduces wic agencies spendforward authority crs6 general provisions the 1998 reauthorization law 1 requires health and safety inspections for schools in the school meal programs 2 requires that schools whenever possible buy food products produced in the united states 3 extends authority for an information clearinghouse on food assistance and selfhelp initiatives and 4 extends authority for the agriculture department to carry out activities to help accommodate those with special dietary needs in addition the reauthorization law 1 makes clear that states and schools can enter into procurement contracts with suppliers that have provided assistance in developing contract specifications 2 boosts from 2 million to 3 million year the money provided to the national food service management institute and 3 extends authority for grants in support of projects that integrate food and nutrition education into elementary school curricula finally the law more than doubles the maximum fine for serious violations of any child nutrition laws offsetting savings provisions the new laws major amendment providing offsetting savings requires that when federal child nutrition subsidies are indexed for inflation each july virtually all be rounded down to the nearest whole cent not to the nearest quarter cent at present this is the case for most subsidies for meals and snacks provided to nonpoor children3 additional savings arise from provision reducing from 2 to 15 the funding set aside for state audits of sponsors and providers under the cacfp program4 commodity provisions the reauthorization law includes number of amendments affecting commodity distribution operations that were suggested by the administration they 1 ease requirements to collect customer acceptability information 2 authorize the transfer of commodities among the various domestic food assistance programs 3 provide funding for the removal of commodities provided by the agriculture department that pose health or safety risk and 4 allow the agriculture department to accept commodities provided by other federal sources for distribution through all its domestic food assistance programs major differences from the administrations reauthorization package most of the provisions recommended by the administration as part of their child nutrition reauthorization proposal hr 3666s 2166 are contained in the 1998 child nutrition reauthorization law however it expands on the administration proposal to extend federal support for afterschool programs and its proposals for the wic program it also does not include administration proposals to eliminate the 2 set aside for cacfp audits and allow states to keep half of any claims they recoup from schools and other providers through stateconducted reviews of child nutrition programs 3 the law retains quartercent adjustments for the special milk program and commodity distribution assistance 4 note the cacfp is the only child nutrition program with special setaside of money for state audits sae money may be used for this purpose and the new law increases states flexibility in using sae dollars crs7 other bills before congress house bills in addition to hr 3874 and the administrations bill five other bills were before the house the extensions of appropriation authority in hr 3871 3873 are included in the new reauthorization law as is expansion of support for after school programs contained in hr 3086 however two major proposals advanced in hr 3086 and hr 3405 are not hr 3086 proposed to mandate federal subsidies for free breakfasts in all participating elementary schools without regard to family income the new law includes demonstration project for this hr 3405 would have greatly eased the rules governing participation of forprofit child care providers in the cacfp along the lines of what is already allowed in demonstration project operating in iowa and kentucky which is extended by the 1998 reauthorization measure the new law does not s 1396 the meals for achievement act this measure proposed to provide federal subsidies for free breakfasts for all elementary school children in schools participating in the school breakfast program as in hr 3086 noted earlier the child nutrition reauthorization law authorizes pilot project to test this concept s 1556 the child nutrition initiatives act the major provisions of this measure included amendments to restore 1 startup and expansion grants for school breakfast and summer programs and 2 subsidies for some additional mealssnacks served in day care centers and summer programs these 2 forms of federal support were ended by the 1996 welfare reform law the bill also would have increased and extended funding for an information clearinghouse and expanded support for the summer food service program afterschool programs the homeless children nutrition program the wic farmers market nutrition program and the nutrition education and training net program most provisions of s 1556 are not included in the child nutrition reauthorization measure s 1581 the child nutrition reauthorization act this measure would have reauthorized through fy2003 all expiring provisions of child nutrition law see later discussion of programs up for reauthorization with program or funding changes extension of virtually all expiring authorities is included in the 1998 child nutrition reauthorization law other relevant bills in addition to the measures noted above three other bills in the 105th congress are relevant as passed by the senate in late 1997 s 1150 an agricultural research measure would have spent over 100 million through fy2002 on child nutrition initiatives eg as in s1556 it would have restored startup and expansion grants for breakfast and summer programs and additional mealsnack subsidies in day care centers and summer programs however the conference agreement on this measure dropped all child nutrition amendments and none were enacted hr 3531 the new mothers breastfeeding promotion and protection act included proposal similar to that included in the new child nutrition reauthorization law to allow wic agencies to use funds provided for food as opposed to nutrition services and administration money to support and promote breastfeeding thereby giving wic agencies more flexibility in how they support breastfeeding hr 1507 the hunger has cure act included proposals to restore startup and expansion grants subsidies for some additional mealssnacks in child crs8 care centers as well as sense of congress statement supporting full funding for the wic program s 1556 also incorporated these initiatives other enacted legislation other than the 1998 child nutrition reauthorization legislation discussed earlier and appropriations measures discussed in child nutrition programs background and funding crs report 9825 only one item of child nutrition legislation was enacted in the 105th congress wic benefits for overseas military personnel and dependents provisions in the national defense authorization act for fy1998 pl 10585 seek to provide funds for wic benefits for overseas military personnel and dependents the national defense authorization act for fy1998 includes an amendment seeking to make funding available to carry out 1994 provision of law calling for extension of the wic program to serve overseas military personnel and dependents the defense department estimates that about 5 million year would be needed to fund this program extension however it is unclear whether the amendment will actually provide funds for an overseas wic program without separate specific appropriation for the purpose the new law requires the secretary of defense to submit to congress report regarding the secretarys intentions as to implementing this extension of wic services and any plans to do so major issues in bills before congress school breakfast initiatives there were three initiatives affecting the school breakfast program in the measures before congress one would have authorized demonstration project providing free breakfasts to elementary schoolchildren without regard to family income hr 3874 s2286 second would have actually established program of free breakfasts in participating elementary schools hr 3086 and s 1396 and third would have restored startup and expansion grants to schools wishing to establish or expand breakfast program s 1556 hr 1507 although in excess of 70 of school lunch program schools offer breakfast programs student participation in breakfast programs is low 20 of children enrolled in school breakfast program schools vs nearly 60 of enrolled children participating in lunch programs in order to increase participation primarily by removing the stigma associated with receiving free breakfasts while others pay and reducing schools paperwork associated with means testing program advocates advanced the idea of providing federal subsidies such that all elementary school students in participating schools can be offered free breakfasts5 others argued that 5 because the school breakfast program primarily serves elementary school students in continued crs9 the relatively low participation can be attributed to factors other than stigma price and administrative burdens eg timing of breakfast serving hours bus schedules parental choice opposed universal free breakfast program in elementary schools that would subsidize free meals for middle and upperincome children and supported pilot projects to test the idea instead the house version of the child nutrition reauthorization bill authorized pilot project to test the effects of offering free breakfasts to elementary school children without regard to family income on participation academic achievement tardiness dietary intake and attendance however supporters of the universal free breakfast proposal continued to argue for mandatory funding of this demonstration project to make sure the concept is tested and the senate measure included mandatory funding of 20 million in the end the house approach was included in the 1998 child nutrition reauthorization law observers credit the startup and expansion grant program for infrastructure and other nonrecurring costs with helping to boost schools participation in the school breakfast program from under half those operating lunch programs to over 70 of school lunch program schools and advocates argued for reinstituting it so that program coverage would more closely approximate that of the school lunch program which operates in more than 90 of the countrys schools opponents contended that the grant program has done its basic job and that reintroducing what they see as aggressive federal support for further expansion is unwarranted revival of the startup and expansion grant program was included in the 1998 child nutrition reauthorization measure afterschool and child care initiatives both the house and senate child nutrition reauthorization bills included significant expansion of federal support for snacks served in afterschool programs particularly for programs serving adolescents in lowerincome areas the only major opposition expressed was concern over paying for the cost of these expansions under prior law schools could get federal subsidies for afterschool snacks only if 1 they were getting them in may 1989 only few thousand schools qualified or 2 separately applied and qualified as child care center and assumed the additional administrative burden and meet child care center standards moreover in neither case were subsidies available for children over 12 in afterschool programs private nonprofit sponsors could only get subsidies as child care providers but not for children over age 12 proponents argued that the lack of major support for after school care is serious gap in existing child care efforts especially for lowerincome atrisk adolescents and that allowing schools to easily extend their regular school meal programs to afterschool settings would be an important contributor to filling the gap they also argued that private nonprofit sponsors should be able to receive support for afterschool programs they run for adolescents the 1998 child nutrition 5 continued relatively lowincome areas the overwhelming majority of participating children receive free breakfasts crs10 reauthorization law includes substantial expansion of federal support for snacks served in afterschool settings including programs serving adolescents in addition to afterschool program initiatives there were two major proposals dealing with the cacfp before congress one would have restored subsidies for extra mealssnacks served to children in care for longer than eight hours ie fourth mealssnacks in participating child care centers s 1556 hr 1507 another would have opened up participation in the cacfp to forprofit day care centers serving significant proportion of lowerincome children hr 3405 neither proposal was included in the new child nutrition reauthorization law child care providers asked for restoration of fourth mealsnack subsidies they viewed their elimination for child care centers as unfair to working families with children in care for long periods of time supporters of the 1996 amendment dropping these subsidies pointed out that the child care food program is not intended to cover all the food needs of participating children that tracking food service for children in care more than 8 hours day is difficult and can lead to unwarranted claims and that greatly increased federal child care funding in 1996 and 1997 welfare reform and balanced budget legislation more than makes up for the relatively small loss of fourth mealsnack subsidies federal assistance under the child and adult care food program cacfp for forprofit child care providers is limited to 1 those who receive compensation from programs under title xx of the social security act the social services block grant for not less than 25 of their enrolled eligible participants and 2 providers participating in demonstration project operating in iowa and kentucky where at least 25 of the children have family income meeting the criteria for free or reduced price school meals ie have family income below 185 of the federal poverty income guidelines where the provider is public or private nonprofit provider there are such restrictions as result very few forprofit providers receive aid under the cacfp forprofit providers called for opening up the cacfp to for profit providers at least by allowing all forprofit providers to participate in the cacfp under the terms of the iowakentucky pilot project others were reluctant to expand federal assistance to forprofit providers especially given the cost summer program initiatives while participation in school meal programs continues to grow especially among lowincome children participation in the summer food service program is far below that in the school programs moreover the 1996 welfare reform law substantially reduced subsidies for meals and snacks served in summer programs one initiative in s 1556 would have raised summer lunch subsidies to encourage increased summer program participation by sponsors and children however opponents noted that even after the 1996 subsidy cut summer program subsidies remain somewhat higher than subsidies for free meals in other programs recognizing that there are some added costs to running summer program s 1556 also would have in effect made in easier for sponsors to qualify eg it would allow sites in areas with 40 rather than 50 lowerincome children to participate crs11 on the other hand the 1998 child nutrition reauthorization law makes modest changes in the summer program to open up participation to more private nonprofit sponsors eg loosening limits on the number of sites operated and children served by private nonprofit sponsors finally coalition of summer program advocates advanced proposal to restore startup and expansion grants for the summer food service program as with similar grants for breakfast programs they were dropped in the 1996 welfare reform law however opposition developed because of cost concerns and worries about undoing welfare reform changes and restoration of summer program startup and expansion grants was not included in the 1998 reauthorization law wic initiatives there were three major issue areas relating to the wic program wic directors argued that they need more flexibility in managing wic funds more authority to keep unspent money for use in the next fiscal year more authority to convert food dollars to spending on nutrition services and administration and were leery of being given added administrative tasks the administration the appropriations committees and other were worried that wic agencies have too much authority to keep unspent money rather than return it for reallocation to states that might need additional funds and congress and the administration were concerned that the program is too vulnerable to abuse the 1998 reauthorization law attempts to strike compromise by giving wic agencies some more flexibility in managing their funds but not as much as desired by wic directors limiting their authority to retain funds for spending in the next fiscal year but not as much as proposed by the administration and the appropriations committees and adding number of provisions intended to protect the programs integrity however the national association of wic directors continues to maintain that they have not been given enough flexibility and that some of the program integrity provisions will impose too great an administrative burden on them additional issues of note during congressional consideration of reauthorization legislation child nutrition program advocates pushed for several substantial changes in child nutrition law that were not included in the final reauthorization measure or only partially addressed the american school food service association asfsa and others called for legislative and administrative changes that would create seamless set of meal programs operated by schools in effect they asked that rules be changed so that schools can run the full range of child nutrition programs including school meal child care afterschool and summer programs under single set of standards and subsidies thereby reducing their administrative burden and expanding the crs12 availability of the programs6 fully implementing this type of initiative eg uniform operating standards and federal subsidies could be costly and the administration and others in congress indicated that they were hesitant to go forward with major changes instead the agriculture department issued limited set of program coordination policy guidances in the spring of 1998 and the 1998 child nutrition reauthorization law includes amendments 1 calling for single agreement between state agencies and schools running multiple programs and common claiming procedure for these schools to obtain their federal subsidies and 2 expanding schools role in the provision of afterschool snacks the asfsa also asked that an agriculture department proposal to require that schools follow federal procurement rules in school meal programs be quashed arguing that some of the federal rules are too burdensome on schools and would prevent them from procuring the items they felt most appropriate for their programs congress declined but did include one amendment in the 1998 reauthorization law that makes clear that schools can enter into procurement contracts with suppliers that have provided assistance in developing contract specifications finally the asfsa 1 called for modification of the current system for auditing schools meal programs the coordinated review effort or cre 2 asked to effectively increase the income threshold for free meals 3 proposed elimination of rule requiring schools to offer variety of milk consistent with student preferences in the prior year 4 called for eliminating what it sees as an administratively burdensome rule requiring that certain schools running breakfast programs account for school breakfast costs in order to receive their full federal subsidy 5 supported increasing what is now relatively minimal state matching requirement for receiving federal child nutrition funds and 6 asked that rules governing waivers from federal child nutrition requirements be changed to make waivers easier to get these proposals were not acted on the nutrition education and training net program was for number of years mandated funding of 10 million year as an entitlement however the 1996 welfare reform law converted it to discretionary program subject to annual appropriations decisions through fy1998 reduced funding of 375 million year was provided this program makes grants to states to provide nutrition education services to school food service administrators teachers and students nutrition education supporters including the asfsa would like to see net funding increased to prewelfarereform levels and pushed for 1 an increased discretionary appropriation and 2 returning the program to its prewelfarereform entitlement status as part of the child nutrition reauthorization measure however the fy1999 child nutrition appropriation includes funding for the net program and the child nutrition reauthorization law simply extends discretionary appropriations authority 6 separately oregon sought approval of demonstration project that would allow the state to adjust program rules so that schools would operate child nutrition programs under uniform set of rules and subsidy rates with federal funding provided as single annual grant adjusted for enrollment changes and inflation however the project was not approved crs13 through fy2003 it was scheduled to expire in fy2002 and eliminates 10 million ceiling on the authorized appropriations level programs up for reauthorization authority to appropriate for or carry out four major child nutrition programs and number of other programs and activities was scheduled to expire during the 105th congress as result they were under review by congress during 1998 as were other child nutrition programs such as the school lunch and breakfast programs that are permanently authorized except for some demonstration project authority unused authority and two projects noted below the 1998 child nutrition reauthorization law extends all expiring authorities through fy2003 the wic programs appropriations authorization was to expire september 30 1998 as was the provision of law governing the formula allocation of wic funding among states requirement that 10 million year from any unused wic carryover funds from the prior year be used for program infrastructure development and special projects and the appropriations authorization for the wic farmers market nutrition program the wic program administered by statelocal health clinics provides nutritious foods to lowerincome pregnant postpartum and breastfeeding women infants and children who are judged to be at nutritional risk the 10 million infrastructure fund is intended to help states develop better wic management systems improve their services increase their ability to reach eligible clients and expand breastfeeding efforts the farmers market program operates in 31 states and issues special wic vouchers to be used to purchase fresh foods through farmers markets the appropriations authorization for the summer food service program was to expire september 30 1998 under this program local public and private nonprofit sponsors receive federal support for food service during the summer months in lowerincome areas the appropriations authorization for state administrative expense assistance sae was to expire september 30 1998 formula grants are provided to states to help cover administrative costs associated with their child nutrition operations equal to about 15 of total federal cash payments for institutional meal programs like the school lunch program the requirement to use additional agriculture department resources eg permanently appropriated section 32 funds to purchase commodities sufficient to maintain the entitlement levels of child nutrition commodity distribution called for by law was to expire september 30 1998 some active demonstration projects were to expire september 30 1998 1 twostate pilot in iowa and kentucky allowing for increased participation by for profit child care centers in the child and adult care food program 2 project for subsidized food and nutrition services for boarder babies abandoned infants and 3 demonstrations
