the department of labor bls is probably the most widely used measure of the rate of inflation beyond that it plays particularly important role in the federal budget number of federal government programs are affected by changes in the cpi on the spending side social security benefits are adjusted each year so that recipients are insulated from the effects of rising prices on the revenue side the personal income tax brackets are adjusted so that when income rises just to keep pace with inflation it is not subject to higher tax rate1 in the recent past there has been concern in congress about whether or not the cpi was an accurate measure of the true rate of inflation2 in december 1996 special commission established by the senate finance committee reported that the cpi was biased3 this commission chaired by economist michael boskin suggested that the cpi overstated the inflation rate by as much as 11 per year if that were true social security benefits were rising more than necessary to allow recipients dependent on them to maintain constant standard of living congress has passed legislation requiring bls to change the way it calculates the cpi however as part of long running effort to make the cpi better measure of price change bls has made number of changes in recent years which have affected actual measures of inflation and hence both federal outlays and receipts this report summarizes those changes presents estimates of their effect on measured inflation and explains what other changes are forthcoming methodological revisions between 1995 and 2000 between 1995 and 1999 there were ten specific changes in the way the cpi is calculated some of them affected narrow categories of goods and services in the index while others had more widespread effects this section gives brief overview of the details of each of these changes the explanations are given here as much to illustrate some of the difficulties bls faces in its continuing efforts to make the cpihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30019crs2 4see us department of labor bureau of labor statistics measuring price change for medical care in the cpi summary 979 june 1998 4 ppa better measure of changes in the cost of living as to chronicle individual methodological improvements 1995 changes four methodological changes were adopted in january 1995 they involved the pricing of prescription drugs food prices and the rental cost of housing prior to 1995 when prescription drug manufacturers patent expired and generic substitutes became available bls only substituted the generic drug for the brandname drug in the cpi in those stores which discontinued selling the brand name drug because of this practice the savings accruing to consumers who switched to generic drugs were not fully reflected in the cpi beginning with data for january 1995 when the patent on prescription drug expires the generic drug may be substituted in the cpi marketbasket whether or not stores continue to sell the brandname drug the chances of the generic drug substituting for the brandname drug in the cpi marketbasket depend on its share of total sales of therapeuticallyequivalent drugs this means that the cpi is much more likely to reflect consumer s substituting cheaper equivalents and is less likely to overstate the effect of rising prices on consumer wellbeing if prices were falling then it would be case of understating the rate of deflation4 the second methodological change initiated in 1995 concerned prices of food items consumed at home two factors created problem in the calculation of the cpi first each year bls samples prices of new items within detailed categories of goods and services for 20 of the areas in which bls collects price data this is referred to as sample rotation and it helps the marketbasket account for changing consume r preferences in the short run second the contribution of an individual product to the overall marketbasket depends on its share of total expenditures price x quantity when new product was introduced through sample rotation its implicit weight ie quantity or contribution to the overall index depended in part on its price the lower the price of the substitute item the higher would be its implicit quantity weight and vice versa when new item was substituted and it happened to be on sale the quantity weight was higher in subsequent periods when the product went off sale the increase in price contributed excessively to the overall measure of inflation similarly if new product was introduced at time when its price was temporarily high due to seasonal factors for example its implicit quantity weight was too low and when its price fell in subsequent periods the decline was insufficiently counted in the overall measure this resulted in an upward bias in the overall index and it was particular problem in the measurement of changes in the prices of food purchased for home consumption in order to correct for this difficulty

three months before dropping the old items by overlapping the price samples the risk of over or underweighting price changes for newly introduced item has been reduced this has been referred to as seasoning bls estimated that this change would reduce the overall cpi by 004 per year5 the third change instituted in 1995 affected the way owneroccupied housing costs were measured in the cpi rather than measure the cost of actually buying house in each period the cpi measures changes in the rental equivalent value of owneroccupied housing6 actually bls measures changes in the rental price of houses that are very similar to those houses in the sample that are owner occupied however prior to 1995 the way in which increases in rents were applied to the rental equivalent price of owneroccupied houses caused the cpi to overstate the rate of increase of owneroccupied housing for example suppose an owneroccupied house were linked to the average change in the rent of two equivalent houses if the rent on only one house went up half of the increase would be applied to the price of the owneroccupied house if in subsequent period the rent on the second equivalent house rose as well half of that increase would also have been applied to the owneroccupied house but this time the increase in price of the owneroccupied house would start from higher base and given percentage increase would mean too large an increase in the dollar value of the rental equivalent price of the owner occupied house in other words compounding effect was introduced which overstated the rise in the rental equivalent price of the owneroccupied house7 in 1995 bls changed the formula used to calculate changes in the price of owner occupied housing to eliminate this problem the fourth change put into place in 1995 also had to do with the measurement of changes in the cost of shelter estimates based on monthly surveys of rents tended to underestimate the magnitude of changes in rents one difficulty in tracking rent changes over short periods of time was that new tenant may not have been aware that his rent was higher than that of the previous tenant estimates based on monthly data also tended to be relatively volatile which could mask actual trends in order to mitigate these difficulties bls now bases estimates of change in rents on sixmonth intervals8 1996 change only one methodological change in the calculation of the cpi was adopted in 1996 that was to extend the socalled seasoning procedure adoptedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30019crs4 9see moulton brent bias

3446in 1995 for food items purchased for home consumption to all goods and services whose prices are measured in the cpi bls estimated that in between 1993 and 1994 the effect of this source of bias from all categorie s of goods and services amounted to 024 the seasoning procedure was extended to all goods and services in june and july 19969 1997 change one methodological change was adopted in 1997 it concerned the way changes in the cost of medical care were counted in the cpi with the 1997 revision detailed categories of medical care expenditures were consolidated in way that made the cpi better able to accommodate changes in the delivery of health care for example outpatient and inpatient services were combined so that the index could better account for shifts from in to outpatient services similarly the price of hospital care was changed to reflect broader definition hospital services are now based on the concept of visit this more flexible approach was felt to be superior in market where the pace of technological change led to frequent changes in the nature of goods and services whose prices were being collected10 1998 changes two changes to the cpi were introduced in 1998 the first had to do with the way changes in computer prices were estimated inflation occurs when consumers pay more this year than they paid last year for the same good theoretically costofliving index should not reflect price changes that are associated with changes in the quality of the various goods and services included in the index as virtually everyone is aware the pace of technological change has affected computers as much as any product on the market quantifying those differences is not always easy in 1998 bls adopted what is known as the hedonic approach to measuring quality change in computers simply put hedonics means that instead of just collecting single price for given product analysts attempt to model product as bundle of characteristics in this way price changes may be attributed to changes in one or another of several measurable characteristics of the product in the case of computers characteristics would be such features as processor speed and memory for many goods and services for example automobiles quality improvements are associated with higher prices for computers prices have been either stable or falling during periods of substantial quality improvements adjusting price changes for quality tends to reduce measured rates of price increase in the case of computers quality adjustment leads to significant declines in measured price change11 the second change to affect the cpi in 1998 was an update of the entire marketbasket of goods and services whose prices are collected to construct the index over time due to changing tastes and changes in relative prices among other thingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30019crs5 12lane walter changing the item structure of the consumer price index monthly labor review volume 119 number 12 december 1996 pp 1825 13congressional budget office the economic and budget outlook an update september 1997 pp 6566the mix of goods and services purchased by consumers changes every 10 years or so bls has updated the marketbasket so that the mix of goods and services in the cpi more closely corresponds to actual consumer purchases consumers insulate themselves somewhat from the effects of inflation by buying less of those goods whose prices are rising faster than average and more of those goods whose prices are rising more slowly than average because of these shifts in spending patterns the prices of the static marketbasket of the cpi tend to rise faster than the prices of what consumers are actually buying periodic updating of the marketbasket of the cpi helps minimize this source of bias in measured rates of inflation beginning in january 1998 the marketbasket reflects consumer purchasing patterns surveyed in the years 1993 1994 and 199512 1999 changes two methodological changes took effect in 1999 one involved the rotation of new goods into the index sample rotation refers to the fact that the actual goods and services whose prices are collected by bls change over time the overall contribution of an item to the index does not change but the individual representative of price category may vary as purchasing patterns and availability of that item change it used to be the case that the sample rotation was based on geographic area starting in 1999 it is based on expenditure categories this enables bls to concentrate on those categories of goods and services that are more subject to change or more likely to be affected by the introduction of new products13 the second methodological change for 1999 was the introduction of geometric means into the process of calculating the rate of price change for some categories of goods and services in between marketbasket updates the cpi is fixedweight index and so in the short run it doesnt keep up with changes in consumer spending patterns due to changes in relative prices thus it tends to overstate the rate of inflation in so far as it affects consumer well being the introduction of geometric means into the calculation of the cpi will help alleviate this problem geometric mean is the square root of the product of two numbers in order to illustrate the use of geometric means in the calculation of price index consider simple example involving just two time periods two rates of change must be calculated in the first expenditure weights from the initial period are used to aggregate all the changes in price in the second expenditure weights from the final period are used because consumers change what they buy the first estimate will likely be an overestimate of the true rate of inflation if it is positive and the second will likely be an underestimate the geometric mean that is the square root of the product of the two measures is middle ground estimate and given certain conditions can be better estimate of inflation than either of the other twohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30019crs6 the introduction of geometric means into the cpi reduced some of the bias inherent in fixedweight price index caused by changing consumer spending patterns 2000 changes the only change that has been announced for the cpi in 2000 is new effort to adjust for quality change in video and audio equipment this is part of continuing project to find ways to account for changes in the quality of the gods and services included in the cpi in this case the goods involved account for fairly small part of the overall marketbasket and thus the change is not likely to have major effect on the numbers estimates of the effect of recent methodological revisions estimates of the effect of these recent revisions are necessarily imprecise since the old and new methodologies are not simultaneously available to allow sideby side comparison nevertheless estimates have been made table 1 presents estimates published by the council of economic advisors cea as well as the congressional budget office cbo the two sets of estimates agree that the cumulative effect of the methodological revisions adopted beginning in 1995 have reduced the annual rate of increase in the cpi by about 07 percentage points below what it would have registered in the absence of any changehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30019crs7

have been if the methodology now used to estimate the current cpi had been in use beginning in 1978 this measure is officially referred to as the cpi research series using current methods cpiurs14 table 2 compares the cpiurs with the consumer price index for all urban consumers cpiu which is the most frequently cited cpi measure the average difference between the two measures between december 1978 and december 1998 was 045 percentage points on average the research series index increased by 045 percentage points per year more slowly than did the actual cpi this is smaller difference than was estimated by either the cea or cbo for several reasons the main reason for the difference is that bls does not include the effects of updating the marketbasket in 1998 in the research series since that was not methodological change the other main reason for the difference is that the cea andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30019crs8 cbo estimates are forward looking while the bls figures show the

for january 2002 the expenditure weights which were updated in january 1998 will be updated again to reflect spending patterns in 1999 and 2000 subsequently the expenditure weights will be updated every two years this more frequent updating of the composition of the cpi marketbasket should reduce some of the bias the index has had due to long intervals between updates this is only the latest in long series of changes in the cpi as this report documents bls is continually trying to improve the cpi and make it better measure of changes in the cost of living whether or not any future changes in the way the cpi is calculated have significant effects on the actual measure and whether any effects would increase or reduce measured inflation is unknown but because the cpi has an important effect on both federal outlays and revenues congressional interest in continuing efforts to improve it is likely to be high
