division july 28 2005 abstract about 75 countries currently possess cruise missiles many experts predict that anti ship and land attack cruise missile proliferation will increase in terms of both scope and technological sophistication order code rs21252 crs report for congress received through the crs web cruise missile proliferation andrew feickert updated july 28 2005 specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division summary about 75 countries currently possess cruise missiles1 many experts predict that httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21252 anti ship and land attack cruise missile proliferation will increase in terms of both scope and technological sophistication this report will be updated as events warrant introduction there are reportedly about 130 different types of cruise missiles in the world today and approximately 75 different countries are believed to have cruise missiles with the majority of these countries having only short range antiship cruise missiles ascm2 in testimony to to the senate armed services committee on march 17 2005 the director of the defense intelligence agency dia vice admiral lowell jacoby stated the numbers and capabilities of cruise missiles will increase fueled by maturation of landattack and antship cruise missile ascm programs in europe russia and china sales of competing systems and the spread of advanceddual use technologies and materials countering todays ascms is challenging problem and the difficulty in countering these systems will increase with the introduction of more advanced guidance and propulsion technologies several ascms will have secondary land attack role3 land attack cruise missiles lacms which can be launched against ground targets from the air surface naval vessels submarines and from the ground are of particular concern according to the us national air and space intelligence center 1 cruise missiles differ from ballistic missiles in that they are powered throughout their entire flight and fly relatively flat as opposed to ballistic course to the target 2 michael dickey chapter 6 the worldwide biocruise threat the war next time countering rogue states and terrorists armed with chemical and biological weapons united states air force counterproliferation center nov 2003 p 156 3 testimony of vice admiral lowell jacoby director of us navy defense intelligence agency in us congress senate armed services committee current and projected national security threats to the united states mar 17 2005 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 proliferation of land attack cruise missiles will expand in the next decade at least nine countries will be involved in producing these weapons the majority of new lacms will be very accurate conventionally armed and available for export the high accuracy of many lacms will allow them to inflict serious damage on important targets even when the missiles are armed only with conventional warheads us defense systems could be severely stressed by lowflying stealthy cruise missiles that can simultaneously attack target from several directions4 there are believed to be about 70000 ascms in the inventories of about 70 countries5 the largest class of these exported ascms are the us harpoon entered service in 1981 the french exocet 1977 the russian ssn2 styx 1959 and the chinese hy1 silkworm 1959 about 12 industrialized countries currently produce lacms and this number is expected to increase by the end of the decade currently only the united states and russia have air and submarine launched nuclear cruise missiles although china is reportedly developing new cruise missile with nuclear potential6 some believe that nuclear cruise missiles are probably outside the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21252 technical range of most countries as most third world nuclear designs would probably be too large and too heavy for cruise missile use7 cruise missiles have the potential to be effective delivery systems for selected chemical and biological agents because they could accurately deliver these payloads at subsonic speeds insuring greater survivability of the agent some have expressed concern that nonstate or terrorist groups could obtain cruise missiles and use them to conduct wmd attacks against either the united states or its interests abroad while terrorist use of cruise missile may eventually become plausible scenario successfully employing cruise missiles requires an indepth technical knowledge of the missile itself and mission planning8 which many experts consider fairly difficult task for nonstate groups cruise missile attributes cruise missiles have number of attributes that make them attractive to militaries around the world some of which include proven and effective air and sealaunched ascms are credited with the destruction of the israeli destroyer eilat by egypt in 1967 the hms sheffield and the 4 ballistic and cruise

mass destruction us government publication apr 2000 p 32 8 mission planning for cruise missiles involves planning route using detailed terrain information typically gained from highresolution satellite imagery in addition specific target data is needed for the terminal phase of the missiles flight and route and target data must then be uploaded to the missiles flight computer crs3 transport ship atlantic conveyor by argentina in 1982 and the damaging of the uss stark by iraq in 19879 land attack cruise missiles lacms have featured prominently in variety of us contingency operations in the past decade during the 2003 iraq war the united states used almost 800 cruise missiles10 of these 800 or so missiles only 7 of them reportedly failed to reach their targets11 us vulnerability to cruise missile attack was highlighted during the 2003 iraq war during the conflict us and kuwaiti patriot theater missile defense batteries intercepted and destroyed all nine iraqi ballistic missiles launched against the coalition but failed to detect or intercept the five hy 2cssc3 seersucker cruise missiles launched against kuwait12 all the more troubling was the fact that hy2cssc3 missiles developed in the 1970s are considered large and slow compared to modern cruise missiles this demonstrated vulnerability could further the attractiveness of cruise missiles to countries looking for means to strike us targets affordable and easily acquired or built relative to combat aircraft and ballistic missiles cruise missiles are affordable to most nations as one senior us official suggested an enemy with 50 million dollars to spend could buy one or two advanced tactical fighters or 15 ballistic missiles with three launchers or 100 offthe httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21252 shelf ready to fire cruise missiles13 in addition to the cost of acquisition cruise missiles require less maintenance training and logistical support than either manned combat aircraft or ballistic missiles which translates into lower operating costs14 given these attributes cruise missiles are often referred to as the poor mans air force according to one senior dod official if you want to see how easy it is to acquire cruise missile just visit any international air show and see how aggressively they are marketed15 one market analysis predicted that 6000 to 7000 lacms could be sold by 2015 excluding us russian and chinese sales16 to avoid missile technology control regime mtcr17 restrictions many countries either produce cruise missiles which just fall under the regimes parameters or modify missiles proscribed by the mtcr 9 thomas g mahnken the cruise missile challenge center for strategic and budgetary assessments mar 2005 p 13 10 tony capaccio raytheon

the scalpstorm shadow version of the french apache stealthy cruise missile if acquiring cruise missile proves to be too difficult or expensive it is possible to convert ascms into longer ranged lacms one such ascm the styxclass ssn2ssc3 is considered by some experts one of the most easily converted missiles largely due to its available onboard space its conventional aircraftlike construction and its large warhead19 the styx liquid rocket engine can be replaced with turbojet to extend range and its guidance system can be replaced with moderncompact inertial navigation system insglobal positioning system gps to provide sufficient accuracy for land attack operations at least 20 countries including angola cuba ethiopia india libya north korea somalia syria and yemen are believed to have the styx india north korea and possibly egypt produce the missile accurate and ability to penetrate defenses many analysts believe that the cruise missiles most significant attribute is its accuracy unclassified estimates of cruise missile accuracy are between 10 and 100 meters20 33 feet and 328 feet respectively but some experts suggest that accuracies of almost 1 meter or less are possible cruise httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21252 missiles are difficult to defend against because of their physical characteristics and their ability to fly unpredictable courses at low altitudes the cruise missiles relatively small size results in low visual infrared ir and radar signatures which makes the missile difficult for air defense radars to detect identify track and engage21 this situation is further complicated if the cruise missile employs low observable stealth technologies that reduce or minimize signatures proliferation the proliferation of both ascms and lacms continues to be significant us and international security concern according to one report naval surface combatant programs in several countries ie denmark finland france germany italy the netherlands norway singapore south korea spain sweden and the united kingdom have provisions for new generation of ascms including some with the dual capability of striking land targets22 most of these newer missiles eg many upgraded versions of older missiles such as the exocet and the harpoon incorporate new navigation and target acquisition technologies enabling the missiles to fly complex trajectories in littoral confined waters and still detect and track their intended targets india has conducted at least nine test firings of its pj10 supersonic brahmos ascm which it codeveloped with russia since 2001 and has recently started serial 18 robert wall p 57 19 information in this section is taken from cruise missiles potential delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction p 47 20 key cruise missile

easily modified for landattack use it is reported that russia and india plan to market the brahmos to supposedly friendly countries in order to cover developmental and production costs russia an mtcr member pledges to keep the missiles range below the mtcrs 300 km range threshold china and iran are also codeveloping new short and longrange ascms24 developments in lacms also continue to be source of concern in april 2005 taiwanese intelligence source reported that china would soon begin to deploy new subsonic lacm25 this missile is expected to approximate the performance and tactical flexibility of the us rgmugm109 tomahawk and will eventually be fielded in ground submarine ship and airlaunched versions26 this missile known as the hong niao or hnclass lacm comes in three versions with the hn2 version having 1800 km range from ground or ships and 1400 km range when fired from submarine27 it is believed that this lacm can carry both nuclear and conventional payloads28 according to taiwanese press reports china is expected to deploy some 200 additional lacms including the new hn series within striking distance of taiwan by the end of 200629 taiwan is also said to be developing lacm with 900 km range capable httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21252 of striking targets in china30 russia has reportedly deployed its first conventional air launched cruise missile31 the kh555 is derivative of its kh 55sm nuclear cruise missile and reportedly has range of between 3000 and 3500 km an accuracy of between 5 to 10 meters and 400 kg conventional warhead capacity these missiles designed to be carried on russian longrange strategic bomber aircraft are described by the russian press as weapon for use in local conflicts and counterterrorist operations number of unarmed kh55sm cruise missiles left in the ukraine after the withdrawal of russian forces were reportedly illicitly transferred to iran and china32 according to ukranian government officials 12 missiles were supplied to iran and six missiles to china in 2001 some western analysts believe that more missiles could have been supplied than the 18 23 information on the brahmos is taken from scott jones focus

washington times apr 6 2005 crs6 acknowledged by the ukranian government and that north korea might have also received missiles some are concerned that these kh55sms could be modified into precision guided kh555s and could ultimately be fired from smaller aircraft ie 24s thereby increasing its utility to nations that do not have large long range bomber aircraft reports indicate that other nations continue to advance their lacm programs france has recently announced that it is considering developing new cruise missile based on the scalpeg design and sweden plans to test new land attack version of its rbs15 in 200733 italy also plans to test its mbda storm shadow in south africa sometime in 2005 to fully demonstrate the missiles capabilities34 cruise missile defense35 dods cruise missile defense programs to protect deployed forces are under number of offices and organizations which some analysts feel makes it difficult to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21252 develop an effective strategy as well as associated technologies and weapons perhaps in response to repeated calls by congress for dod to develop affordable and operationally efficient cruise missile defense programs dods june 2005 strategy for homeland defense and civil support commits dod to devote significant attention to defending us territory against cruise missile attacks36 the senate version of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 srept 10969 to s 1042 calls for the secretary of defense to establish an executive agent within dod to manage the acquisition of capabilities necessary to defend
