the purse by expressing funding priorities through outlay allocations and revenue collections over the past decade federal spending has accounted for approximately fifth of the economy as measured by gross domestic product gdp and federal revenues have ranged between just over fifth and just under sixth of gdp in fy2008 the us government collected 25 trillion in revenue and spent almost 30 trillion outlays as proportion of gdp rose from 184 in fy2000 to 209 of gdp in fy2008 federal revenues as proportion of gdp reached postwwii peak of 209 in fy2000 and then fell to 163 of gdp in fy2004 before rising slightly to 177 of gdp in fy2008 the budget also affects and is affected by the national economy as whole given recent turmoil in the economy and financial markets the current economic climate poses major challenge to policymakers shaping the fy2009 and fy2010 federal budgets federal spending tied to means tested social programs has been increasing due to rising unemployment while federal revenues will likely fall as individuals incomes drop and corporate profits sink as result federal deficits over the next few years will likely be high relative to historic norms in addition to funding existing programs in challenging economic climate the government has undertaken significant financial interventions in an attempt to alleviate economic recession the ultimate costs of federal responses to this turmoil will depend on how quickly the economy recovers how well firms with federal credit guarantees weather future financial shocks and whether or not the government receives positive returns on its asset purchases estimating how much these responses will cost is difficult both for conceptual and operational reasons despite these budgetary challenges many economists believe that fiscal policy ie federal borrowing and spending would be the most effective macroeconomic tool under current conditions past fiscal stimulus measures which are being considered as possible options for 2009 have included extensions to unemployment benefits aid to state and local governments tax rebates and expanded infrastructure spending federal loans or loan guarantee programs may help provide liquidity to distressed financial markets and stimulate economic activity but may also expose the federal government to substantial credit risks while many economists concur on the need for shortterm fiscal stimulus widespread concerns remain about the longterm fiscal situation of the federal government the rising costs of federal health care programs and baby boomer retirements present serious challenges to fiscal stability operating these programs in their current form may pass on substantial economic burdens to future generations this report will be updated as

g343g561he federal budget implements congresss power of the purse by expressing congresss funding priorities through outlay allocations and revenue collections the budget also affects and is affected by the national economy as whole the federal budget over the next few fiscal years will likely face significant challenges to both revenues and outlays as result of recent turmoil in the economy and financial markets making budgetary decisions for the federal government is an enormously complex process entailing the efforts of tens of thousands of staff persons in the executive and legislative branches totaling millions of work hours each year the budget process allows the president and congress to negotiate and refine spending plans for the nations fiscal priorities1 the current budget situation is challenging at the end of fiscal year fy 2008 the government was facing growing deficits rising costs of entitlement programs and significant spending on overseas military operations the enactment of financial intervention and fiscal stimulus legislation designed to alleviate credit crunch and to bolster the economy will push up the deficit shifting fiscal burdens into the future in addition much of the government is operating under continuing resolution for the first half of fy2009 and work to complete funding for fy2009 as well as developing the budget for fy2010 will be required of the incoming administration the economic downturn has not only pushed federa l spending up and revenues down but also threatens to slow economic growth for the next few years the federal government has responded to the economic slowdown with an array of poli cy responses unprecedented in recent decades many economists believe large fiscal stimulus is in order traditional monetary policy options have narrowed leading many economists to believe that fiscal policy ie federal borrowing and spending would be more effective macroeconomic tool under current conditions other federal interventions such as loans or loan guarantee programs may help stimulate economic activity and reduce dislocation in financial markets these interventions however may also expose the federal government to substantial credit risks substantial concern remains about the federal governments longterm fiscal situation the rising costs of federal health care programs and the effects of the baby boom generations retirement present serious challenges to fiscal stability operating these programs in their current form may pass on substantial economic burdens to future generations

ie spending2 the total deficit in fy2008 was 455 billion or 32 of gross domestic product sharply higher than the fy2007 deficit of 162 billion the total deficit according to some budget experts gives an incomplete view of the governments fiscal condition because it includes social security surpluses which are then held in treasury trust funds until used to pay future benefits excluding offbudget items social security benefits paid net of social security payroll taxes collected and the us postal services net balance the federal deficit was 638 billion 2 most economists use data on federal outlays to track larger budget trends while most program analysts use budget authority to track changes in specific program areas

as well as net interest3 discretionary spending flows from and is controlled by annual congressional appropriations acts mandatory spending encompasses federal government spending on entitlement programs the food stamp program and other spending controlled by laws other than annual appropriation acts outlays rose from 184 of gdp in fy2000 to an estimated 209 of gdp in fy2008 over time mandatory spending has generally grown faster than discretionary spending as figure 2 shows mandatory spending reached 112 of gdp in fy2008 composing over half of total outlays discretionary spending as share of gdp fell in the 1990s but rose from 63 of gdp in fy2000 to an estimated 79 of gdp in fy2008 discretionary outlays increased 5 year on average in real terms from fy1999 to fy2008 the share of discretionary spending as proportion of total federal outlays rose from 336 in fy1999 to an estimated 381 in fy2008 higher defense outlays accounted for 756 of the increase in discretionary spending over the past decade on average from fy1999 to fy2008 defense outlays grew 8 per year in real terms while real nondefense discretionary outlays grew 25 per year entitlement programs such as social security and medicare make up the bulk of mandatory spending 4 other mandatory spending programs include temporary assistance to needy families tanf supplemental security income ssi unemployment insurance veterans benefits federal employee retirement and disability food stamps and the earned income tax credit eitc congress sets eligibility requirements and benefits for entitlement programs rather than appropriating fixed sum each year therefore if the eligibility requirements are met for specific mandatory program outlays are made automatically over the past 40 years mandatory spending has taken up larger and larger share of the federal budget in 1962 before the 1965 creation of medicare and medicaid less than 30 of all federal spending was mandatory at that time social security accounted for about half of all mandatory spending by fy2008 mandatory spending had grown to 54 of federal spending social security medicare and the federal share of medicaid alone comprised over 40 of all federal spending while discretionary spending totaled just under 40 in fy2008 net interest payments accounted for an additional 87 3 for more information on trends in

as proportion of total federal outlays some budget experts contend that any significant reductions in federal spending must include mandatory spending cuts other budget and social policy experts contend that cuts in mandatory spending would cause substantial disruption to many households because mandatory spending funds important parts of the social safety net

deficit the budget deficit however may give partial and potentially misleading picture of the governments fiscal condition annual budget deficits or surpluses determine over time the level of federal debt and affect the growth of interest payments to finance the debt g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g6g142g143g146g140g146g157g156g561 deficits can serve as powerful instrument of fiscal policy occasional deficits in and of themselves are not necessarily problematic deficits can be used to let governments smooth outlays and taxes so that taxpayers and program beneficiaries are shielded from abrupt economic shocks persistent deficits on the other hand lead to growing accumulations of federal debt that are passed along to future generations g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g6g142g139g157g561 gross federal debt is composed of debt held by the public and intragovernmental debt intragovernmental debt is the amount owed by the federal government to other federal agencies to be paid by the department of the treasury this amount largely consists of money contained in trust funds such as social security that has been invested in federal securities as required by law5 debt held by the public is the total amount the federal government has borrowed from the public and remains outstanding this measure is generally considered to be the most relevant in macroeconomic terms because it is the amount of debt sold in credit markets changes in debt held by the public generally track the movements of the annual onbudget deficits and surpluses whether or not the movements of gross federal debt will follow those of debt held by the public depends on how intergovernmental debt changes higher debt levels could slow investment and lower economic growth

the debt limit also imposes form of fiscal accountability that compels congress and the president to take visible action in the form of vote authorizing debt limit increase to allow further federal borrowing when nearing the statutory limit the debt limit can hinder the treasurys ability to manage the federal governments finances when the amount of federal debt approaches this ceiling in those instances the treasury has had to take unusual and extraordinary measures to meet federal obligations 6 while the debt limit has never caused the federal government to default on its obligations it has caused inconvenience and uncertainty in treasury operations at times 5 us executive office of the president office of management and budget budget of the us government fiscal year 2009 analytical

spent 260 billion or 18 of gdp on net interest payments on the debt what the government pays in interest depends on market interest rates as well as on the size and composition of the federal debt since fy1968 the us spent an average of 22 of gdp on interest payments in fy2004 interest payments dipped to low of 14 of gdp but have since increased if the value of the federal debt in real terms were to grow faster than the economy the burden of paying interest on the debt would grow as well g4g158g141g144g142g157g561g5g162g140g149g142g561 single years budget cycle takes roughly three calendar years from initial formation by the office of management and budget omb until final audit the executive agencies begin the budget process by compiling detailed budget requests during the winter nearly year before the fiscal year begins omb oversees the development of these agency requests the president by law must submit budget which is based on ombs work by the first monday in february because this date follows inauguration day so closely the incoming president has little time to compile budget documents in past decades some new presidents have relied on their predecessors budget teams to outline budgetary framework for submission in february and then submit their own budget or revisions at later date 9 this option may be unavailable to the obama administration because

g349g561the cbo currentlaw baseline sets benchmark to evaluate whether legislative proposals would increase or decrease outlays and revenue collection baseline estimates are not intended to predict likely future outcomes but to show what spending and revenues would be if current law remained in effect cbo typically evaluates the budgetary consequences of legislative proposals and the joint committee on taxation jct evaluates the consequences of revenue proposals cbo computes baseline projections using certain assumptions set in law10 forecasts based on these assumptions typically yield higher revenue estimates and slower growth of discretionary spending relative to scenarios independent forecasters consider likely more specifically cbo baseline projections incorporate three legislatively mandated assumptions that discretionary spending remains constant in inflationadjusted terms that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts fully expire after 2010 as current law specifies and that oneyear patches to the alternative minimum tax amt will lapse even though past congresses have extended amt patches year after year macroeconomic assumptions namely the point at which cbo expects the recession to end will also affect the baseline estimates and projections especially given the current economic climate previous baseline projections showed substantial growth in receipts after 2010 when most of the tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 expire federal deficits are expected to grow rapidly beyond the 10 year forecast window unless major policy changes are made however largely because of increased outlays due to rapidly growing health care costs and baby boomer retirements

financial turmoil with an extraordinary set of measures in february 2008 congress enacted 152 billion package pl 110185 economic stimulus act of 2008 to stimulate consumption that sent refunds to taxpayers and let firms depreciate their capital more quickly later in the year the federal reserve created panoply of lending facilities such as the term auction facility taf the primary dealer credit facility pdcf and the term securities lending facility tslf among others these facilities provide financial institutions with loans in exchange for various types of collateral on october 3 congress passed the emergency econom ic stabilization act of 2008 eesa pl 110343 which authorized the treasury secretary to use 700 billion subject to certain congressional restrictions and notifications to intervene in financial markets or to inject capital into key financial institutions as part of troubled assets relief program tarp while treasury secretary henry paulson first propose

complexity of federal responses to financial and economic turmoil present many challenges to budget analysis the ultimate costs of these responses will depend on how the economy performs how well firms with federal credit guarantees weather future financial shocks and whether or not the government receives positive returns on its asset purchases estimating how much these responses will cost the federal government is difficult both for conceptual and operational reasons g25g145g138g157g561g5g152g158g151g157g156g561g3g156g561g138g151g561g17g158g157g149g138g162g501g561 the distinction between outlays and budget authority is important to understanding the budgetary consequences of federal responses to economic and financial turmoil outlays are disbursed federal funds budget authority is what federal agencies can legally spend budget authority has been compared to funds deposited into checking account which then can be used for federal purposes until the federal government disburses funds to make purchases however outlays occur giving federal officials the ability to spend requires budget authority outlays will not increase until those funds are actually disbursed outlay data are used to assess the macroeconomic effects of the federal budgets while budget analysis of specific federal programs is typically based on budget authority figures appropriations legislation is generally framed in terms of budget authority because that is what congress can most directly control as of november 2008 treasury has spent appr oximately 330 billion of the 700 billion allocated by congress through tarp outside of the tarp other federal agencies have also used their statutory authority to provide relief to the financial sector and credit markets in

g351g561ways estimating the precise budgetary impact of these programs is difficult in addition cbo and omb disagree over the budgetary treatment of some programs for example much of the early amounts of tarp funds have been used to purchase preferred equity stakes in major banks cbo has contended that eesa requires those equity purchases to be costed on net present value basis so that the future sale of those equity st akes would offset much of the cost of acquiring them omb has argued for cash basis approach so that those equity purchases would increase the federal deficit for fy2009 and future sales would reduce deficits in future years as those equity stakes are sold off thus the difference between cbo and omb approaches could affect the timing of how hundreds of billions of dollars are reflected in budgetary accounts the final scope of many elements of the financial intervention programs remains unclear given that the treasury secretary has been granted wide discretion in how to use these funds the ultimate costs and budgetary implications depe nd on how long the recession lasts and what if any additional federal resources are put toward dealing with the current economic and fiscal issues with or without additional congressional action

the federal government has provided credit guarantees to several firms to reduce systematic financial or economic risks to the economy the cost of making these guarantees to the government however may be much less than the value of the guarantees if economic conditions improve soon those credit guarantees will not result in new federal outlays on the other hand if the economic conditions deteriorate the government may face major losses the federal credit reform act of 1990 fcra requires that the reported budgetary cost of credit programs equal the estimated subsidy cost at the time the credit is provided 11 fcra subsidy calculations however have typically omitted risk adjustments12 the true economic cost of federal credit guarantees can be substantially underestimated when risk adjustments are omitted13 cbo has recently included risk adjustments in estimates of the costs associated with the troubled asset relief program tarp and the conservatorship of the governmentsponsored mortgage guarantee giants fannie mae and freddie mac14 some economists argue that the federal government should not charge for the risks it accepts that argument however properly applies only to diversifiable risksthat is risks that can be minimized by pooling small risks for nondiversifiable risks such as systematic risks to financial markets governments may spread or redistribute risks but cannot eliminate them via pooling some argued that because the us government can borrow at riskfree rate that budget accounting for federal credit programs should not include risk premium 15 the us 11

funding for the vietnam war after the first few years was provided in regular appropriations 18 since 2004 war funding has been requested in two parts an emergency bridge fund to cover the first part of the year that has been included in the department of defenses dod regular appropriations and supplemental that has been submitted later in the fiscal year the supplemental appropriations act fy2008 pl 110252 provided both the second part of war funding for fy2008 in the amount of 66 billion and the first part for fy 2009 the fy2009 funding is expected to finance military operations until june or july 2009 19 according to press reports the current ad ministration may submit fy2009 supplemental covering the rest of the current fiscal year though congress is unlikely to respond to such request war funding request from the new administration for the rest of fy2009 would be expected to reflect its decisions about future troop levels in both iraq and afghanistan20 supplemental war appropriations complicate the budget process first some argue that war funding should be included in dods regular appropriations dod and others have suggested that war costs remain fluid and that combining regular and war funding could make segregating those funds more difficult some contend that the outgoing bush administration used supplemental appropriations to obscure the costs of wars in iraq and afghanistan to the public second the irregular timing of supplemental appropriations requests complicates comparisons of baseline budget forecasts cbo currentlaw budget baseline projections extrapolate discretionary spending levels including already enacted emergency war funding war funding that is not yet enacted even if military and budget experts were to judge such spending unavoidable is not included in baseline budget projections therefore baseline projections run just after supplemental appropriations bill is passed probably exaggerate true annual costs while baseline projections run just before such bill probably overstate dods ongoing peacetime costs and understate full annual costs including war funding finally many in congress have questioned whether after seven years war appropriations are appropriately categorized as unanticipated emergencies not subject to caps in annual congressional budget resolutions although congress required full years war

growth steady and employment high while maintaining price stability21 macroeconomic policy instruments are often divided into three components monetary policy ie control of monetary base and shortterm interest rates fiscal policy government borrowing and spending and st ructural factors structural factors include regulation and competition policies that may enhance the efficiency of an economy while these standard macroeconomic policy tools have been highly effective in moderating economic fluctuations over the past few decades the financial turmoil and credit crunch in fy2009 present

policy has several important advantages in macroeconomic stabilization the federal reserve the central bank of the united states can deploy traditional monetary policy tools such as openmarket interventions that help control ce rtain key shortterm federal interest rates the independence of the fed insulates it from political pressures and allows it to act quickly in response to new developments in the economy the fed in conjunction with the treasury department developed innovative responses to the financial turmoil that broke out in august 2007 as economic problems deepened in 2008 the fed redoubled its efforts to unfreeze critical areas of credit markets in the current economic situation traditional monetary policy initiatives appear to have neared their effective limits 22 in their december meeting the federal reserve set target range for the federal funds rate between zero and ¼ and cu t the rate on discount window loans made to commercial banks and other financial institutions by 75 basis points to ½ 23 thus the federal reserve has little room for further cuts in addition declining investment demand and investors seeking safe harbor for funds have pushed shortterm interest rates on federal treasury securities to very low levels furthermore many economists doubt that pushing those interest rates even lower would spur much additional lending when banks and other lenders worry about the solvency of financial counterparties monetary policy loses much of its effectiveness in such liquidity trap as banks reluctance to lend frustrates the feds efforts to expand the money supply moreover while new federal reserve lending facilities may improve credit conditions or at least limit further deterioration those programs were not designed to address the

the context for fiscal policy begins with national income accounting the national income as measured by gdp is the sum of expenditure categories specifically the national income accounting identity is c i g net exports where national income gdp c private consumption i private investment g government spending the identity implies that national income falls when private consumption and investment fall unless offset by increases in either government spending or net exports in the current economic environment government spending increases have become the focus of attention as source of stimulus as consumption and investment continue to decline while some measures of economic activity remained resilient in the first half of 2008 despite rapidly rising unemployment and sharp drops in asset prices and in housing prices in many areas of the country most forecasters predict sharp decreases in key economic indicators in 2009 25 private consumption fell in the last half of 2008 for several reasons rising unemployment rates left some households with lost earnings and pr ompted others to increase savings to cushion against possible future job losses some households that had borrowed using home equity credit lines credit cards or other types of credit became unable to continue borrowing thus requiring cutbacks in consumption other households became unable to afford mortgage payments contributing to increasing foreclosure rates and reducing consumption auto sales an important component of private consumption fell drastically as financing became harder to obtain and gas prices rose in mid2008 24 these credit facilities according to the federal reserve were cr eated to increase the availability of credit and to reduce interest rate spreads to more normal levels while these facilities have greatly expanded the federal reserves balance sheet they do not appear to have had significant effects on monetary aggregates see term assetbacked securities loan facility frequently

g343g346g561private investment falls when businesses believe that demand for what they sell is falling or will fall nonresidential investment component of private investment has been weak relative to historical levels since the mid1990s although information technology investment was strong until the collapse of dotcoms in 2000 the federal reserve then sharply lowered shortterm interest rates capital inflows especially from east asia pushed down market interest rates low interest rates helped housing prices rise and stimulated new residential construction and development boosting fixed residential investment as housing prices in many areas of the country reached their peak or began to decline in 2007 investors who once had thought that home prices would continue to rise backed away additionally many investors began to fear that residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs were much riskier than anticipated and capital markets became reluctant to put more money into the residential sector credit crunch partially sparked by concerns over rmbs emerged in august 2007 foreclosure rates have climbed as refinancing options for many homeowners dwindled putting added downward pressure on home prices high levels of fixed residential investment over the past decade have created large inventories of new houses which may dampen incentives for future construction all of these variables contributed to declines in private investment which are not expected to reverse in the near term the united states has run trade deficits since the mid1980s in recent years the trade deficit has narrowed so that net exports are less negative in part because the dollar has weakened relative to most major currencies sharply higher energy pr ices in 2008 offset many of those gains but falling energy prices in late 2008 may help shrink the trade deficit further as trading partners have begun to face their own economic problems demand for american exports may fall american consumers however may buy fewer imported goods during the recession the combined effect on net exports is likely to be mixed causing them to be an ineffective source of stimulus most macroeconomists believe that reductions in private consumption and investment will cut economic growth unless debtfinanced government spending increases to provide substantial fiscal stimulus other measures such as investme nt incentives or broad tax cuts may also promote economic growth although some economists believ debtfinanced government spending is more effective stimulus to aggregate demand in recession

rates are extremely low fiscal policy therefore plays an especially important role in economic policy during economic downturns the amount and composition of the federal spending along with the size of the federal deficit are key fiscal policy instruments during economic downturns government revenues fall and expenditures rise as more people become eligible for unemployment insurance and income support programs causing deficits to increase or surpluses to shrink these effects known as automatic stabilizers provide countercyclical stimulus in the short run without the need for new legislative action automatic stabilizers however probably cannot provide enough fiscal stimulus to pull the current economy out of recession higher government spending financed by borrowi ng above and beyond the

increased can dampen economic fluctuations and limit the depth of economic downturns debtfinanced government spending is one co mponent of keynesian demand managementthe theory that government can stabilize the economy or at least moderate economic fluctuations by using fiscal policy to offset changes in private consumption and investment the federal government according to that theory can shift buying power from future to the present more easily than firms and households and is therefore better able to maintain stable economic conditions in the view of most macroeconomists keynesian demand management as one component of welldesigned macroeconomic policy regime can increase economic efficiency by preventing labor and capital goods from becoming unnecessarily idle during economic downturns reducing government deficits when economic growth is robust is another key component of welldesigned macroeconomic policy regime in this respect responsible fiscal policy requires that spending in economic downturns be paid for by future spending reductions andor tax increases of course higher taxes in the future reduce private consumption and cuts in future government programs reduce consumption of publicl provided goods and services if debt is not reduced higher interest rates may reduce future investment

management and the discretionary application of fiscal spending by governments some have contended that keynesian fiscal policy arguments do not take sufficient account of choices made by firms and individual households others argue that ke ynesian demand management policies can create administrative problems and note that mustering the political will to maintain sustainable fiscal policy by reducing spending over the economic cycle can be hard some economists have argued that not just the government but also households can shift spending through time via borrowing and saving thus households according to some may counteract government fiscal policies by sa ving during economic downturns thus further reducing consumption other economists note that many households are not in position to choose between saving and consuming and that the low interest rates typically found in economic downturns may weaken incentives to save some evidence suggests that highincome households may take savings measures that offset government fiscal policies but lowincome households are in general less able to rearrange their finances in ways that would reduce the effectiveness of fiscal policy the argument for keynesian demand management presumes that governments run surpluses during economic expansions to repay debt accumulated when applying fiscal stimulus during economic downturns critics of deficitfinanced fiscal policy argue that policymakers are more willing to raise government spending when eco nomic growth slows than to cut spending when growth accelerates 26 certain federal programs or increased spending enacted during economic downturns may remain in place after they are longer necessary because of the interests of influential beneficiaries rather than overall economic welfare on the other hand some programs 26 milton friedman capitalism and freedom chicago univ of chicago press 1962 pp 7584

state of the economy while the power of debtfinanced government spending to provide fiscal stimulus is independent of how those funds are spent clearly taxpayers and beneficiaries of federal programs

century keeping future federal outlays at 20 of gdp approximately its current share and leaving fiscal policies unchanged according to cbo projections would require drastic reductions in all spending other than that for medicare social security and medicaid former cbo acting director stated that by 2030 spending for those programs medicare social security and medicaid is projected to reach roughly 15 percent of gdp if that increase happened the rest of the budget would have to be cut by more than half to keep overall spending close to its current level the administration indicated similar

growth or combination of these things many economists agree that having some federal debt is good thing because it builds credit which allows for more favorable borrowing terms it encourages investment within the country because federal debt is seen as relatively lowrisk and safe debt is not free however and requires interest payments that strain budgets high debt levels could limit the governments flexibility in meeting its obligations or in responding to emerging needs of its citizens ultimately failing to take action to reduce the projected growth in the debt potentially might
