in addition to these overarching issues other proposals addressed in the 109th congress included legislation to create stronger regulator for fannie mae and freddie mac and revisions to the fha loan insurance program legislation was also introduced on behalf of the administration to replace the section 8 voucher program with new block grant and to make major changes to the public housing program in the area of the budget generally as of the date of this re port congress had not yet enacted an fy2007 spending bill for the department of housing and urban development hud1 the president submitted his budget request on february 6 2006 it included reductions for severa l programs including the community development block grant cdbg program and increases for other programs such as the section 8 voucher program th appropriations committees in both houses held hearings on the budget in which mbers from both partie s expressed concern about several proposed funding reductions the house of representatives passed its version of the funding bill hr 5576 on june 14 2006 and the senate appropriations committee repor ted its version to the full senate on july 26 2006 both versions of hr 5576

increasing concern about the size of the federal budget deficit and have s ought ways to reduce it the president has outlined twopronged approach for reducing the federal budget deficit 1 increase revenues to the treasury without raising taxes and 2 cut spending3 in both fy2006 and fy2007 the president sought to keep discretionary spending growth below the rate of inflation although as of the date of this report congress had not passed an fy2007 spending bill in fy2006 congress kept growth below the rate of inflation the majority of huds budget is disc retionary funding and many of its programs were targeted for funding reductions in the 109th congress in his fy2006 budget the president asked congress to cu t funding for several programs including housing for the elderly and disabled and to eliminate funding for several others including the community development bl ock grant cdbg program hope vi and brownfields redevelopmen t congress did not enact most of the requested cuts in fy2006 in fy2007 the president again requested large cuts for several hud programs including housing for the derly and disabled and cdbg the administration criticized all of the programs slated for reduction for being ineffective or inefficient efforts to contain discretionary spending have also increased internal pressures in the hud budget the cost of the sec tion 8 voucher program is partially pegged to housing costs which have risen faster than inflation as result the voucher program requires increased funding to rve the same number of people since huds overall budget has been constrained an increases in funding for the voucher program have come at the expense of ot her programs another internal hud budget pressure involves the contribution of th federal housing administrations fha insurance program fha collects fees from participants and excess fees are used by congress to offset the cost of the hud budget fhas market share has been dropping in recent years and as resu lt the amount of excess fees has been declining with fewer fees to offset the cost of the hud budget the president and congress have had to find dditional dollars to keep the overall

for more detailed analysis of the question of housing bubble see crs report rl31918 us housing prices is there bubble by marc labonte in this budget environment congress faced pressure to reduce funding for huds programs in the fy2006 and fy2007 appr opriations processes at the same time congress continues to f ace pressure to maintain or increase funding for housing programs because of growing concern bout perceived shortage of affordable housing housing affordability the us housing act of 1949 established national goal of decent home and suitable living environment for every american family since the establishment of that goal great progress toward it has been made with record homeownership rates nd the elimination of much of the slums and blight that plagued the first half of the last century at the same time problems remain the bipartisan c ongressionally mandated mille nnial housing commissions 2002 final report identified affordability4 as the single greatest housing challenge facing the nation the harvard joint ce nter for housing studies found that between 2001 and 2004 the number of households payi ng more than 30 of their income toward housing increased from 313 million to 35 million5 while affordability is the overarching concern different cha llenges face owners and renters rising housing prices although the housing market is beginning to show signs of slowing an unprecedented us housing boom led to record housing prices again in 2005 home equity stood at 112 trillion in 2005 up from 10 trillion in 2004 and it is estimated that the wealth eff ect from rising housing prices generated onethird of the growth in consumer sp ending that year helping to buoy the economy6 homeownership rates slipped just slightly from their previous high in 2004 from 69 to 689 in 20057 and minorities who have consistently lagged behind whites in homeownership rates ve made some gains between 1995 and 2005 the percentage of minority homeowners increased from 437 to 531 during the same period the percentage of white homeowners increased from 709 to 758 despite this positive news fear s about the health of the housing market and the sustainability of recent homeownership gains are growing speculation about housing bubble has permeated local and national real estate news8 former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan in testimony before the joint economic committee on j une 9 2005 noted that while he did not believe that the us was experiencing national housing bubble home prices in some markets seemed to have risen to unsustainable levels the pace of future interest rate increases the health of the economy and the rate of job growth will all play an important role in determining the pace of futu re housing price appreciationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32899crs4 9 state of the nations hous ing report p 36 table a6 10 ibid p 25more serious market corrections could occu r if speculators begin to fear the end of the boom has arrived soaring home prices have also resulte d in proliferation of exotic and potentially risky mortgage products that make the entry into homeownership in these hot markets more affordable loans for more than the value of the home interestonly loans and various forms of adjustable rate mortgages have all become options for households buying highpriced homes they could not otherwise afford at the lower end of the market relaxed credit standards and the proliferation of subprime loans have expanded the pool of firsttime homebuyers to include families with little or cash and with limited or bl emished credit histories while all of these practices have helped to increase the national homeownership rate they come with repayment risks if interest rates soar buyers with adjustable rate loans and interestonly loans will be in for payment shocks and some might find themselves at risk of default if the economy falters and there are job losses some low and moderateincome families could be at risk of default if they become unemployed small but growing number of low and moderateincome homeowners are already considered severely costbur dened meaning that they ar spending half or more of their incomes on housing rent burdens in 2004 84 million renter house holds were severely cost burdened paying more than 50 of their income toward housing an increase of more than 1 million from 20019 while moderateincom renters are not immune from severe rent burdens lowincome re nters face the greatest burdens more than 86 of severely costburdened renters were in the bottom quintile of the income distribution when lowincome fa milies pay such large portion of their incomes for housing they have little left to meet th eir other needs let alone establish savings or build assets the problem of severe re nt burdens appears to be growing as the supply of lowcost rental units continue s to dwindle harvard universitys 2006 joint center for housing studies report attributes the growing affordability problem to two factors land use regulations that drive up the price of housing and the growth of lowwage jobs10 the report notes that solving the problem will be difficult and will require the cooperation of governme nt business and nonpr ofit organizations however the federal governme nts role in addressing what hud has termed worst case housing needs is increasingly in ques tion as deficits grow and pressure to restrain domestic spending mounts rebuilding after the 2005 hurricanes after the initial need to evacuate and relocate families after the 2005 hurricanes the focus primarily shifted to recovery and rebuilding of flooddamaged areas the storms caused unprecedented damage to the gulf coast housing stock studies estimated that the hurricanes and their related flooding damaged 12 million housin g units of those over 305000 were seriously damaged most of the seriously damaged units were owner occupied about 63 or 193000 homes more than half of them lacked

army corps of engineers had demolished 185 housing units in orleans parish and just under 38600 building permits had been issued12 in part the pace of rebuilding has been slowed by uncertainty at the local state and federal levels about what the new new orl eans should be and how it should look the appropriate balance of public sector and private s ector effort in rebuilding the damaged housing stock is also still under debate private insurance will cover some of the cost and new investment may come to the area but given the enormity of the damage the local state and federa l governments have been heavily involved thus far congress has pproved more than 16 billion in community development block grant cdbg funds and increased tax credit allocations to affected states to aid in their rebuilding the plans developed by local communities for spending the cdbg funds were approved in the late spring and early summer so the money is beginning to flow to local communities13 other

the house financial rvices committee reported hr 4100 to the house on december 15 2005 neither the house or senate bill received floor vote as described in hr 4100 and s 2172 the corporation would have followed local redevelopment plans and depended on financ ial incentives to obtain residential and commercial property it would not ve had the power of eminent domain it would have purchased homeowners equity for portion of the prehurricane value19 and paid the mortgage lenders more than 60 of the prehurricane mortgage balance owners and mortgage holders would have benefitted in cases where the posthurricane values were less than thes amounts because mortgages would have been forgiven in those cases owners with mortgages would have benefitted more than owners without mortgages the

part because of reductions to other programs the program has also been criticized for not promoting selfsufficiency among its participants and for its administrative complexity which results in high rates of error in calculating subsidies in response to these critiques two majo r initiatives have emerged over the past several years the first involves chan ges to the way the program is funded
