contained further extension through july 31 2007 pl 11057 extended the sbas authorization through december 15 2007 and pl 110136 continues the extension until may 23 2008 loan fees and subsidies the administrations fy2007 budget proposed changes in the fees and subsidies to sba loan programs which have been the subject of much discussion in the past interest rates in the sbas 7a guaranteed loan program are reduced below the riskadjusted market rate the difference between the riskadjusted market rate and the loan rate is subsidy for the borrower starting with the fy2005 crs2 budget the sba increased the fees on 7a loan guarantees to cover the cost of this subsidy the proposed fy2007 budget would increase fees on loans of more than 1 million to cover administrative costs supporters say that the increased fees allow more firms to obtain the loans while opponents say that the fees make the sba guarantee too expensive for some firms to afford the administration also proposed in the fy2007 budget that the interest rate on new disaster loans should be subsidized for the first five years after which it would rise to market rates for the remaining life of the loan which can be as long as 30 years currently an sba disaster loan has capped interest rate for the entire term of the loan none of these provisions was included in the sbas fy2007 appropriations bill hr 5672 in the 109th congress as reported in the senate but they were not included in the presidents fy2008 budget hr 1332 which passed the house on april 25 2007 would encourage the sba to use appropriated funds to pay the fees charged small business borrowers small business contracts awarded to large businesses in the 109th httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22589 congress the minority of the house small business committee and the sba inspector general ig reported that many government contracts intended for small business were in fact awarded to large firms1 there are three reasons why contracts set aside for small businesses could be awarded to large businesses first this could be permitted by current law and regulation under certain circumstances second there could be an honest mistake third there could be fraud proper awards recently many government agencies have set aside longterm multipleaward contracts for small businesses frequently these contracts are very general and offer the winning businesses the ability to compete later for specific task order work task order contract allows an agency to make single contract award through the competitive process and subsequently contract for specific work tasks with little or additional competition many agencies favor this type of contract because it reduces the burden on shrinking procurement staffs these longerterm contracts provide opportunities for business to outgrow the sba size limits either through winning additional contracts or by merger with other small or large firms when business bids on government contract set aside for small business an officer of the firm must certify that as of the date of signing the business qualifies as small with certain exceptions business remains eligible to fulfill contract even if it grows too large or is purchased by nonsmall business after submission of the proposal in late 2006 the sba issued final rule effective june 20 2007 to require firms with small business contracts to recertify their small business status 1 at the start of the 1 house small business democratic staff scorecard vii faulty accounting by administration results in missed opportunities for small businesses july 26 2006 available at httpwwwgovexeccompdfsscorecardviifinalpdfsearch2222faulty20accounti ng20by20administration2222 sba inspector general the central contractor registration needs large business and small business designation improvements management advisory report 618 march 21 2006 available at httpwwwsbagovig618pdf crs3 sixth year 2 with every subsequent contract renewal 3 after merger or acquisition and 4 with every contract extension2 if firm is longer small it can still win new work under the contract but such work will longer count as work awarded to small business the sba stated it was doing this to allow the contract to run for its full term prior to this change business retained its small business designation for the duration of contract although agencies could require more frequent recertifications this revised regulation could still allow large business to compete for and win work set aside for small businesses proposals to address this issue include requiring size certifications to be resigned annually or on the dates that contracts are awarded andor modified another question is whether firm that is longer small should be barred from competing for task orders on small business set aside contract against firms classified as small businesses honest mistakes the sba ig issued management advisory report in march 2006 recommending that the central contractor registry be modified to prevent inconsistencies in claiming small business status that allowed at least one ineligible business to obtain small business contract other sources of honest mistakes doubtlessly httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22589 exist for example it is possible that carelessness has caused some contracts in the federal procurement data system next generation fpds ng to be incorrectly listed as small business fraud the press has suggested that fraudulent misrepresentation of firms size is the reason that some small business contracts were awarded to apparently ineligible firms3 abuse of small business programs has been frequent subject of oversight hearings small business contracting goals many small business advocates are concerned that the federal government is not doing enough contracting with small businesses overall the federal government has set goal of awarding 23 of its contract work with small firms but each agency negotiates an individual goal with the sba agencies meeting their goals can be nominated for the gold star award but agencies failing to meet their targets incur penalties some small business advocates have questioned the accuracy of information in the fpds ng that is used to calculate the percentage of contracts awarded by an agency to small businesses they believe that some large businesses are incorrectly listed as small which inflates an agencys small business contracting totals 2006 report prepared by the house small business committee democratic staff discusses these issues in detail4 2

corporate giants steal from little firms rocky mountain news august 26 2006 p 2c 4 house small business democratic staff scorecard vii faulty accounting by administration continued crs4 proposed legislation affecting small business government contracts includes hr 1873 the small business fairness in contracting act which passed the house on may 10 2007 revisions to the definition of small there is uniform definition of small business the sba determines size standard on an industrybyindustry basis weighing the number and size of firms in an industry the degree of competition barriers to entry and start up costs the size standard must be small enough exclude any dominant firms in the industry depending on the industry the sba sets the size standard based on firms number of employees or revenues for example the size standard for new single family home construction businesses is 31 million of annual revenue and for iron and steel mills the standard is 1000 employees5 there have been proposals to increase the size standard to make larger businesses eligible for small business programs for example the department of defense dod has suggested increasing the size standards because defense contracts frequently push the winning small business over the size standard this limits small business to one dod contract and the pentagon would like the flexibility to award additional relatively large httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22589 contracts to firm many small business advocacy groups have opposed this on the other hand there are also proposals to reduce the size standard in order to eliminate larger small businesses from small business programs hr 1332 as reported out of committee on may 25 2007 would direct the sba to create size standard based on maximum tangible net worth and average net income in addition to the current standard based on either revenue or number of employees disaster loan issues in the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 many complaints were made about the sbas performance most notably its disaster loan program in particular many residents of the gulf coast complained about the lack of timely government assistance the sbas problems in responding were due in part to the magnitude of the natural disaster contributing to the delays was the implementation of new computer program to process disaster loan applications the sba has reported that the computer problems have been fixed and that processing capacity has been greatly enhanced peak disaster staffing remains challenge because the agency does not have the capacity to send significant numbers of regular employees to disaster areas as an alternative the sba has disaster reserve of 1000 intermittent employees6 4 continued results in missed opportunities for small businesses 5 sba small business size standards matched to north american industry classification system available at httpwwwsbagovsizesizetable2002html the sba adjusted its dollar measures of size for inflation effective january 5 2006 6 by way of comparison the sbas authorized staff for fy2007 was 3179 full time equivalent employees its fy2008 budget requested authorization to reduce this to 3161 employees making disaster loans would decrease to 749 from 3807 and most other categories of employees would increase us small business administration fy2008 budget request and performance plan p 26 crs5 some gulf coast businesses suggested that the sba should supplement its disaster lending with bridge loan program to fund the purchase of new inventory by retail and wholesale businesses bridge loans would be for short periods of time secured by the inventory bridge loan advocates say that they would meet pressing need with little risk to the government opponents say that there would be risks and that it could be difficult to liquidate the inventory if the borrower were to default they also argue that the program is unnecessary because many states already have such programs hr 1361 the recover act passed the house on april 18 2007 s 163 was reported favorably by the senate small business and entrepreneurship committee on may 7 2007 microloan program sbaguaranteed microloans are designed to overcome the relatively high fixed costs of processing small loans and to help inexperienced business owners they go mostly to new businesses that have little or track record and little or credit history these loans are too risky for private lenders to make without government guarantee the maximum microloan is for 35000 but the average is 130007 the more traditional sba 7a program guarantees loans for up to 2 million httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22589 sba microloans are made by local nonprofit lenders and include businessbased training and technical assistance in many cases the application process is simpler for microloan than for other sba programs for the first time in several years the administrations budget for fy2008 did not propose to eliminate funding for this program many small business advocates support continuing microloans the administration considers the microloan program too expensive to operate and be duplicated by other programs health insurance because of the way health insurance is priced small groups including small businesses usually pay more for similar coverage than large groups as result small businesses are less likely to offer employees health insurance than large businesses one reason is that the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa places health care benefits of large employers under federal regulation while smaller businesses are regulated by their respective states smaller multistate employers find it expensive to comply with the requirements of different states and some decide not to offer health insurance bills in the 109th congress hr 525 s 406 and s 1955 would have placed most plans sponsored by trade and professional associations called association health plans under federal regulation those opposed to the bills object to overriding state coverage mandates hr 525 passed the house the senate debated s 1955 but vote to invoke cloture failed hr 1012 the small business growth act was introduced in the 110th congress and referred to the committee on education and labor and in addition to the committees on small business the judiciary oversight and government reform and ways and means tax burden small businesses receive special tax treatment in many areas one tax provision that is important to many small businesses allows them to write off up to 7

the cost over many years the amount is indexed for inflation until 2008 when it is scheduled to revert to 25000 this provision is referred to as section 179 after its location in the internal revenue code advocates say that section 179 encourages business investment and supports small businesses9 in addition proposals to change the impact of the estate and gift tax on family businesses may come before the 110th congress10 internal sba management every year the sbas ig and the government accountability office gao review various aspects of the sbas internal management and suggest improvements any of these issues could come before the 110th congress but based on the amount of attention given to disaster assistance the response to hurricanes katrina and rita may be the most likely issue the ig also has found that fraud was perpetrated by some recipients of september 11 2001 disaster loans the ig has identified several areas in applications for sba guaranteed loans that may be vulnerable to misrepresentation these include 1 the amount of money that business owner is contributing to project 2 whether the owner is us citizen 3 fraudulent documentation including fictitious asset claims and valuations nondisclosure httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22589 of criminal records and misuse of loan proceeds false statements increase the risk that business will default on its loans forcing the sba to honor its guarantee and increasing the cost of small business lending programs to the taxpayer 8 as of 2006 9 crs report rl31852 small business expensing allowance current status legislative
