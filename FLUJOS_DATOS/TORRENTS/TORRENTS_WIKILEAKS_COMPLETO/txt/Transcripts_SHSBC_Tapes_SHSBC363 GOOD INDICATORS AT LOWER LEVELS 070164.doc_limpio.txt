good indicators at lower levels lecture given on 7 january 1964 all right thank you saint hill special briefing course january 7th ad 14 all right now ive got something the reason im giving you lecture today even though i was apparently bit under the weather and so forth is ive got something im trying to teach you and tomorrow in the demonstration you will be able to put this to good use now you have in front of you hco bulletin of december 28th 1963 and this bulletin here is the routine 6 indicators part i good indicators now that bulletin apparently would refer to routine 6 and apparently only refer to routine 6 but in actual fact it contains the most complete list of indicators for any session of course there are several of them that dont apply now amongst those that dont apply re whether or not the pc thought it was his own goal youre not going to get that at listenstyle auditing level i but if you look this over you will find out that these apply to most sessions and im going to take this up with you rather carefully now if i could teach you if i could teach you what good session looks like and teach you so that when you look at an auditing session in progress between an auditor and pc out there if i could teach you to be able to say thats good session or bang theres something wrong with that session why i could make whale of an auditing supervisor out of you see and youd really get lot of success as d of p or something like that why youd just come crashing down the line there youd have gains gains gains gains gains and the reason why im teaching you this way is because if i can teach you what good indicators are you can then pick out of the muck well what bad indicator is and we will take up bad indicators in the next lecture but if you dont know what the good indicators are you will never be able to figure out what the bad indicators are now the reason for this is an auditors tendency to look for wrongnesses hes always trying to find something wrong with the pc well thats the nature of scientology we assume that theres something wrong with somebody otherwise he wouldnt be here on this planet otherwise he wouldnt be dead in his head he would be capable of doing great deal more than he is doing at the particular moment when you get down to an examination of what kind of character thetan is we find that man has been making consistent or even intentional error and the intentional error is that being is piece of amoeba or something in the mud and only by great deal of punishment duress challenge in the environment upset holding gun on him giving him high taxes and treating him with medicine is he made into sentient being only by teachers rapping him over the head with ruler and being put in there into the grindstone being conscripted into the army and made to shoot his fellow man in other words thats the only way you get civilized thats the only way you get civilized well now remember theres an entirely different action involved here theres an entirely different action involved here we have different concept and until you can appreciate this you youll see what it is we see an individual we see an individual as basically routinely capable hes basically and routinely good he is basically and routinely capable of many actions hes capable of considerable power and so forth and we see him in you might say state of free thetan or native state as far more powerful individual than when hes been complicated up and we conceive here we conceive here an entirely reverse idea we conceive that all of this training in the school all of this being sent to the front and made to shoot his fellow man all of this being charged high taxes all of this being lectured to about how he should be good and bow seven times day due east to where the lodestone is all of that sort of thing drags down his capabilities and makes him less capable now we have tremendous evidence overwhelming evidence all along the line that our concept is true and that the quote biological concept is to be colloquial erroneous we tested series of schools now in the process of testing schools we found out that although the child was advancing in age his iq was dropping as he advanced in school his iq became less understand thats very important i think the highest iq we ever tested in one central organization which was testing floods of people was tested on tenyear old boy now thats the highest iq tested there thats very interesting in other words the harder and longer they were kept in their basic education the longer they were kept there the more stable data was shoved down their throats particularly false ones why the less their iq was thats interesting now college student in the united states has been very carefully masked and the psyrologist who was the those are the exphrenologists you know the bumps on the brain boys if you look up in the encyclopaedia britannica youll find particularly my edition i have very choice edition of the encyclopaedia britannica its an old one i think its the eleventh edition i love it man its got all of the you know what is black magic what is and it gives long explanations of spells and it gives the early history of hypnotism and it just gives all kinds of things and when you most of its articles were written as though you didnt know the modern encyclopedia is written only for the experts you see if youre an expert in landscape gardening and you go and look up landscape gardening why youll find out all about it if youre an expert well these old encyclopedias werent written that way and theres an article in there on phrenology which is which is marvelous and it describes the bumps on the brain bumps on the skull and it gives map of the head and all of this is very intriguing because down below it says this particular patient had an extra large meatus were not sure what meatus was but he had an extra large meatus which showed that he was fond of torturing animals and as matter of fact he was very fond of torturing animals and so became medical doctor you know when i read that you know i bet theyd burn that book you know theyd have law passed in congress you know theyd tell the president were going to cut out your adenoids man if you dont have that rescinded of course my quote is very liberal they didnt say he was medical doctor who was member of the ama trained recently they didnt say that they came very close to it however anyway im just giving you gag the facts of the case here is the psychologist inherited phrenology you know only they just went little deeper into the subject the phrenologist studied the skull and of course the psychologist going deeper into the subject went just inside the skull and started studying the brain and he has just as many superstitions about the brain and its sizes and lumps as the old phrenologist had about the outside of the skull now you might say weve gone to the root of the problem and weve gone to the center of the brain and we found thetan now this has been much more productive much more productive truth is demonstrated by workability now this is subject which would be contested in certain philosophic spheres i guarantee this would be contested there are those schools of thought which are so enamored of their own falsities that they demonstrate that truth need be workable i think this is rather marvelous there are certain religious philosophies and so forth which say workability is not anything we should have anything to do with because actually it is very sufficient for us that galen that galen said that the blood was like tides and so forth and these fellows harvey these fellows come along and they say its pumped or something like that or it runs at the impetus of the heart why the workability and the fact that you can observe it and so forth actually has nothing to do with it the beautiful aesthetic the beautiful aesthetic of the idea of blood tiding back and forth with the tides of the moon or something of this sort that is so beautiful and so aesthetic that even though we know it is false there is reason for us to accept the truth now did you know that there were schools of philosophy like that you occasionally run into one of these sad apples and he will tell you that workability is test of anything he will say that well what he means actually is workability so challenges his own favorite ideas or philosophies that he mustnt have it anywhere near him now let us use this anyway the idea that we can observe that we do something and we produce an effective result actually remember all the exact sciences built up to their present stature just on that idea alone that you put and b together and youll always get c well now in scientology we have that level of workability we have put and b together and we get c so we have this fellow with lumbosis we have this fellow with lumbosis this is the idea of the additive datum to the thetan see and this fellow has lumbosis now we can give him heat treatment we can operate on his lumbo we can do all kinds of interesting things to him and he goes on either having lumbosis or kicks the bucket now this is very interesting that even freudian analysts realized that some additive had been added that should be deleted so the idea of deleting something in order to bring about recovery is not new with us but in this particular case we only need ask him what solutions he has had for his lumbosis for him to recover from the lumbosis in other words if we could pick up all of his decisions and solutions with regard to lumbosis then we would pick it up in other words thats perpetuation of an error now this is all part and parcel of additives we add something to the being and he gets worse you understand now we take somebody who is feeling bad i mean you as scientologist can put this to test every time you turn around so you should know really what the basic philosophy of it is we take this fellow who has had he feels bleau and he feels down and he feels baruahh and life is pretty nnnnyah and here he is and we set him down and we put in the mid ruds see for the last week or something like this now what are we doing there were actually subtracting were subtracting actions it isnt necessarily that were subtracting bad actions dont you see were not subtracting the bad actions and leaving the good actions which are beneficial were subtracting the livingness of the last week and he comes up feeling better i think this is fascinating you can do that you do it well and dont arc break him and clean cleans and know how to read your meter and audit him really youll always bring about this same thing well what have you done in essence you have subtracted something from the being youve taken something away all right now i have made this test then lets lets go little more esoteric here i have taken an insane person subtracted from this insane being his body i mean this is just figuratively literally and actually this isnt any other type of description ive subtracted from him his body and had him immediately sane and sane talking responsive and so forth added back to him his body instantly returned to insanity thats quite interesting you say how do you do that well youve walked his body off of him you do it the same way by moving somebody out of his head now there is something that you cant argue with heres something you cant argue with you take any insane person hes rather easily handled or persuaded even though hes terribly dispersed hes in point where anything has an effect upon him and hes very easy to exteriorize of course hes still capable of talking through his mouth using his vocal chords and that sort of thing how do you know he was out of his body well that hasnt anything to do with it he said so you knew so and that was the only auditing command that was given to him so there he was minus the influence effects or pushes of the body and the fellow was sane well i can always produce five ten minutes of sanity it actually is not beneficial doesnt last its just an experimental technique but thats fascinating isnt it that you delete from this fellow his body all right now lets take lets take this fellow who has been living you say how about the good things of life well i dont know how about the good things of life of course we could all be pessimists here together today and say are there any and so on well yes as matter of fact there are but they are usually cessations if you look over the good things of life they are very often positive child gets toy or something like this well thats fine that all is taken care of in scientology under the subject of havingness but its havingness at own choice you understand the individual has this thing he wants now you try to give somebody something he doesnt want and youre going to overthrow his power of choice so what has happened to this individual is power of choice is the only thing he had to begin with which gave him power capability or anything else and that power of choice has been consistently and continuously overthrown by giving him things he didnt want and taking away from him things he didnt want to get rid of and back and forth and you get the individual pretty overwhelmed and he goes down in power but lets take this fellow hes been getting along fine he has goal to be great fellow see its gpm hes got the goal to be great fellow hes going around patting everybody on the back and hes great fellow and youd think for gods sakes this is the one thing that makes this man man you know the goal to be great fellow and unfortunately at the same time he has bad pain in the back of his skull and he rather has consistent twitches twitches and he twitches and so forth and we audit him up and what do we get we take away the goal to be great fellow the twitch disappears and he hasnt got the pain in the back of his head i think this is very fascinating so but this was apparently something he was doing apparently something he wanted well what happened to him what happened to him actually he solved something that didnt need solving there was something he couldnt confront so he solved it and he fixed the solution and anytime you go on and fix these solutions forever and ever and ever and ever and ever you put an individual down grade now the only reason under the sun that we have any right whatsoever to educate in the field of scientology the only right we have to educate at all is we are teaching things that are as close to fact as possibly can be made and the technology or the doingness or how you do it or how it is put together and so forth is so close to actually how it is put together that it runs itself out if you say to somebody who has solution for lumbosis the reason youre having lumbosis is because you have this solution for lumbosis and sometimes he will get well from just that fact now actually you can make people well simply by teaching them scientology so scientology doesnt come under this ban of educational aberration why well scientology is the only thing that runs itself out scientology is the only solution in this universe which erases itself now for instance right now anything that you are being taught anything that you are being taught is in actual fact simply being truth which is being pulled up through the muck and shown to you and it actually by being shown to you makes it possible for you to reach other truths now when you consider the power of an ri or you consider the power of one of these fantastic solutions of medicine or something like that like big operation or something like that when you consider the power of an actual gpm when you consider the power of service facsimile all of these things all of these things well i dont quite know how to put this to you because its something that i have recently studied and had been rather overwhelmed with and its this its this the data of scientology now the data of scientology is so minor and so sweet and so pure with regard to the tremendous heavy crashing banging solutions like service facsimiles ris gpms medical operations all kinds of those other types of solutions im beginning to be very relaxed you can do almost anything you want to with scientology because it sits on the top of this and when it has solved something it solves what has solved it and thats never happened before in other words these other solutions are so crashingly big and scientological solutions are so mild that these these things disappearing of course make the little mild scientology solutions just go phhhh and theres practically nothing to it so we dont come under the category of adding aberrative data to the individual as solution of his difficulties because even though it might stand there for while and worry him it will eventually reach home and uproot the thing it is sitting on and it blows along with it for instance every one of you right this minute is sitting in some ri of some kind or another and if anything made you flinch in the data which youve been given in the last twentyfour hours or its administration and so forth now or tomorrow or eventually that data is going to go phoooo its going to blow because its sitting on top of what it is uprooting you got the idea so when it blows the data blows but you know the data because the data is truth and all of this is very fascinating in other words the premise here is that an individual not to wander far afield now an individual becomes aberrated he becomes aberrative by additives his experiences in this universe are usually calculated to degrade and depower him now all you have to do is pick up all of these crisscrosses and you return him to power now ive given you few examples of these of course there are innumerable examples of these things what were doing is easily demonstrated you pick up you pick up bunch of data out of this fellow or knowhows or howdoits or something like that he becomes quite bright you can raise iq simply by picking up his school education or something like this and in scientological data the data itself is restimulation of more basic and fundamental truths which restimulated tend to blow later data as matter of fact some people just study scientology and they can leap out of bed well it has happened many times now whats this all add up to it adds up that man man is an added to being and everything that has been added to him has decreased his ability to cope now weve gotten him dependent on tools and that sort of thing ive studied some of this in anthropology ethnology and so on ive studied i think twentyone primitive races including the british and american and im always struck in their history with the fact that they have gone through periods of handicraft which are quite remarkable quite remarkable you see them in their museums and so forth well of course you see these things amongst actual primitive races the other big joke you see these amongst actual primitive races down in the philippines and so forth and you see these marvelous little pieces of handicraft one way or the other somebody has patiently put hes patiently put little lions heads on the arms of all the chairs that he was making and something like that and you see it down there in you see it in some of the primitive races as painstaking job of painting up every stone in the yard with paint and theyre rather clever designs you see it you see it in ivory work amongst the eskimo some of the most fantastic things this fellows just making spear you see and you see this spear my goodness its all chased and its got pictures of walruses and so forth this thing is just workaday spear this thing is something that manchester would turn out zoomzoomzoom you know and hes got this thing he has lot of them you see and they got they got walrus there and theres couple of seal or theres little hunting scene of depicting one of his activities at one time or another and thats that particular spear well these things are just spears spearheads hes going to throw these things and forget them and theyre going to get stuck and so forth well why did he go to all this trouble why did he go to all this trouble well he had obviously the patience and the talent and the skill with very very minor tools in order to do that thing and you find this in race prior to its automation or mechanization or being provided with adequate tools quote adequate tools i think its quite interesting you can see it in museums very often if you want to study this particular point it is in other words all im trying to say is is you give him this fellow up working in manchester right now my god hes got drill presses and hes got lathes and hes got hes got all kinds of furnaces and forging materials and hes got everything under the sun moon and stars hes got everything there is it isnt that hes deleted art the more you give him to work with the more you give him to work with why in actual fact the less he works and thats interesting it isnt that he doesnt have to work less its that his ability to work has been reduced i think its quite interesting you have somebody around sometime in maintenance department youll remember what i say if youve got somebody coming in all the time all the time all the time and hes got to have hes got to have this and hes got to have that and hes got to have the other thing and hes got to have something else and hes got to have something else and so forth you walk around the place youre not going to find anything being done theres direct coordination between got to have and getting done and thats good datum that you can use in any organizational action you find the fellow who has to have has to have has to have has to have has to have more more more more more in order to get his job done and so forth is actually doing usually very little now what calls this to account is that is an aberrative side of simply some thetans bent for collecting havingness i immediately think of my cameras i collect cameras ill collect lots of cameras but its interesting its interesting that in collecting cameras i pay less attention to any one camera and just had all of my christmas pictures wrecked by picking up camera i hadnt paid any attention to for very long time and one of its buttons had been shoved over to another point and the flash was longer synchronized with electronic flash i didnt get any pictures well what is this this thats just having too many cameras thats all you didnt pay any attention to the camera you had dont you see ive got five six cameras of one kind or another see and theres good example i was getting less pictures by having more cameras but of course i just collect cameras for the devil of it now this is very interesting it even follows through then into hobby work and so on now there is some point there is some point if youre dealing in the field of electronics for instance where you require minimum amount of equipment or maximum amount of equipment or certain amount of equipment in order to get something done very very true very very true and if you dont have that equipment youre mess for instance youd have tapes at all if we didnt have nice ampex 600 running dont you see and you wouldnt have any television broadcast if we didnt have some cameras and that sort of thing but remember were using these things these things are in use and as far as my cameras are concerned i do take pictures but you know the people im talking about the people im talking about have to have and never do and its good point for you to notice that they have to have but they never do and youll see this thing and its totally overwhelmed being now one day up in the cold and dust of peking winter and so on i saw chinese carpenter i saw chinese carpenter working and its the wildest thing id ever seen because theres an old civilization theres very old civilization you expect them to be very sophisticated in all of their tools and so on this little chinese carpenter was working out there in the cold and he was mending up the pillars of the british legation they were built out of wood and theyd been gnawed at by dust for long time and they had some carvings and some things like this associated with them and he was fitting in he was fitting in new beam and so on for one that had been rotted out and he was fitting it all in very nicely and i talked to him for little while and i stood there just absolutely fascinated this man had little bow it was about six inches long and it had piece of string from the two corners of the bow and he had drill he had drill that he had taken out of fish that he had had for breakfast and he had little piece of stone that hed picked up in the street which happened to have little concavity in the back of it and he took the fish bone and wrapped the string of the little bow around it and then held it with this palm fitting this stone and went up and down with the fish bow and he had nice auger and he was drilling holes in the wood and then he was taking he was taking then little knife that was hardly knife at all it was just sliver of metal that he had managed to sharpen up and he was taking bits of wood off of the old beam of course he you know that he was discarding he wouldnt have used new wood for that and he was taking these things and hed flick up little piece like off there and then hed go soandso and soandso and so on and next thing you know he had dowel and then hed put the dowel where he had drilled the hole and then hed tap it in with his with this same stone he was building more beam faster than us carpenter i looked at this and he was perfectly competent with these tools and he was taking the greatest of care and he was making the nicest possible things out of the thing interesting isnt it this little fellow in other words was perfectly capable of doing job with of course you could say tools to which he was accustomed but using the minimum tools and you dont find people who are having good time of it using minimum of tools now to him those tools were effective those were effective tools man i think to do the same job nobody would have been putting something together with wooden dowels anyway they would have been nailing it together with nails at vast expense and so on you say well what about this fellow well this fellow actually had never really been spoiled by being taught all of the things he had to have before he was carpenter i think all youd have had to do was added to his education of you have to have nails and you have to have hammer with fivepound head and then you have to have actually three hammers you have to have so on and so on and then you have to have and you have to have and you have to have before you can drill hole and the have to have gets in the road of ever getting the hole drilled see its interesting in other words you could have added to his understanding of carpentry to the degree of you cant do without certain union tools to point where he can longer carpenter thats the only point im making here the earlier history of races or the more primitive cultures and so on are fascinating to to the amount of time and the amount of skill which is put into odd little bits and now man is getting up to point where he can mass produce these things and so forth all of which is very very interesting im sitting here looking at georgian fireplace of the early eighteenth century and the amount of work which has gone into chopping up that marble there probably could not be found modernly we could say oh yes somebody could have made it i dont think so because ive seen lot of modern marble work and they have better tools today but they dont turn out the same work im also looking at fire grate and so forth of the same period fancy man fancy its all scrolled and chased and that sort of thing why some of the best stamping machines and patterns they make these days dont turn those things out and yet that was probably turned out with blacksmith by blacksmith all by his lonesome he said well lets fix up fireplace bang bang i think it ought to have some nice scrollwork and so forth and so on whats happening here whats happening here its just the more you add to the workman why the less individual work one accomplishes you get the better workman it isnt that he can make do its that he does anyway and you say well if you kept taking his tools away from him he might not be as good workman and so forth because he couldnt do well there is point of course that we have to remember hes working in body hes working at great limitations but there is something in which i say fellow can have too much he can have too much burden he can have too much this and that whats this all amount to this amounts to the fact that were in the business of deleting wrongnesses from the individual now because now understand understand this very carefully because we are in the business of deleting wrongnesses from the individual we darn seldom look at rightnesses and thats whats wrong with most auditors they are so anxious to find the wrongness and quite properly that they really never look at the rightness and if they dont look at the rightnesses that are present then they arent appreciating the degrees of truth that are present which can be promoted up into more truth in other words theyre starting at level of truth present all the time so of course they never make any forward progress you must realize you must realize that there must be truth present and that that truth must be recognized and that is hand and fist part of auditing the recognition of the fact that truth is present if you only look for wrongnesses and only recognize wrongnesses then you will never be able to pull anything up gradient because you wont think you have any rightnesses to work with it just all looks wrong to you now thats an interesting concept thats an interesting concept we have to be able to look at the wrongnesses in order to right them but we also have to be able to look at the rightnesses in order to increase them were only trying to find wrongnesses in order to increase rightnesses and thats very important if you have rightnesses present in session you will never be able to make any progress of any kind now thats whats interesting progress is built on gradient scale of rightnesses by which you delete wrongnesses and they drop and fall away therefore processing is an action by which wrongnesses can be deleted from the case to the degree that rightnesses are present in the session do you see that you cannot take case that doesnt have any rightnesses present and delete wrongness thats not possible so you have to realize that there are rightnesses present and then you increase those rightnesses and that makes it possible for you to pick up the wrongnesses and thats what auditing auditing really consists of its contest of maintaining rightnesses so that we can delete wrongnesses now if you keep on then deleting wrongnesses all the while maintaining and increasing the rightnesses you eventually wind up with very right being now let state this to you little bit different so that you really get it youre trying to get right being therefore if you dont continuously encourage right beingness you never wind up with right being this actually is one of those things where i realize im stacking up little kids blocks b and c and so forth but im always astonished that they get missed you see ive had actually ten or thirteen years of losses of trying to teach somebody to observe an auditing session and so forth and i finally made breakthrough here and im giving it all we have you want your pc to wind up right you know i mean right state hes in more native more capable less overwhelmed higher power of choice sort of state all right you want him to wind up with more rightnesses well therefore if you audit so that you do not increase or encourage and increase rightnesses then you wont wind up with right pc i mean it im its idiotic you know i feel like im yelling in the wind here to some degree because ive tried to point this out before but ive really never had language to do so and if for instance if you want to pick up godawful horrendous crashing wrongness lets put it in ratio form we got to pick up this fantastic wrongness here and we got this wrongness you see and its something on the order of this big now the degree of action which you have to have or the degree of rightness you have to have present over here the degree of rightness you have to have present must exceed the wrongness in other words you have to have at least this much rightness i dont know if you can see those or not on the screen doesnt matter theyre just two circles of similar size in other words were trying to pick up this wrongness and erase it well to do so we have to have this rightness present in other words youve got to have rightness in session at least as great as the wrongness youre trying to pick up its proportional action proportional now frankly if youve got as much wrongness in session as youve got rightness youre not riding on any cushion youve got youve got yourself comparative situation here thats going to eat somebody up now the facts of the case are the facts of the case are that if you want to pick up this little rightness here this little fellow this little wrongness here and youve got to have rightnesses weve got to have rightnesses present which are that big in order to engulf it now thats an easy job of auditing now these comparable theres as much wrongness in the session as there is rightness comparable magnitude that makes very difficult job of auditing very difficult but you get somebody who is oh hes singing and happy and cheerful and so forth and its all springtime and so on and you say to him and so forth you say to him did you know soandso and soandso and he looks at it and his ability to asis is so great that he simply goes pphhh and its gone do you understand now you get this fellow and he is worried and he is nervous and he is upset and you give him little tiny peanutsized present time problem that is very very little and so on and the wrongnesses in the session that is to say the rightnesses in the session are very minor and the problem is very tiny problem but there isnt enough rightness in the session to handle the problem and he actually cannot erase it you get the idea now you we could talk about banging somebody into gpm and so on but you realize that all youve got to do is delete good indicators from session one after the other and your pc will not be able to asis he wont be able to asis speck of cigarette ash on the middle of the rug in other words he cant asis anything so pcs ability to asis and here is your rule and your datum and which you should remember well the pcs ability to asis or erase in session is directly proportional to the number of good indicators present in the session you see that its proportional to that and his inability to cope in session is also measured proportionally his inability to cope in the session rises proportionately to the number of bad indicators present in session as we delete good indicators of course we get bad indicators except they dont cross one to the other necessarily but if we had very few good indicators in session we would have very small ability on the part of the pc to asis and if we have lot of good indicators in session then the pcs ability to asis is much greater and you can actually bog pc down you can bog pc down every once in while youll find pc sick you know i mean life and so forth and hes done something or other pcs sick youll find i dont say once in while you find pc sick but every once in while an auditor will have this experience that the pc is sick and the auditor cant continue to run the process he has been running but has to drop back to very minor process indeed auditors very often overlook this they were running this pc on service facsimiles and not for any reason of auditing because of duress or weather or something of this sort the pc got himself stomachache or something and ate something bad or something and he gets back into the session again and the auditor tries to go on running the process and by george the process wont run well the auditors not on the ball the good indicators you see are inadequate to the running of the process which was in progress got that so whats the score here he has sick pc so he has to fall downstairs to running something like look around here and find something you could have see hes got to run the pcs havingness process or give the pc touch assist or something like this he hasnt got enough sense to retrograde the process to cope with the state of the pc now what problem is he up against there actually good indicators in the session are inadequate to handle the wrongnesses the auditor is trying to eradicate now thats whats happening in the session now you get yourself sick pc every time you see the good indicators vanish and the pc can be considered sick youve just you havent got any good indicators in the session well all right good indicators have dropped out of the session your pcs ability to asis is going to be very very very very lowered going to be much lower than it was the indicators are much low the good indicators are much fewer the pcs ability to handle wrongnesses is much less now you remember that the next time you see pc start to bog start to drag start to flounder one way or the other whats happening these good indicators are not present therefore the pcs ability to handle wrongness is lessened the pc youve got to get the good indicators back in before you can get the pc to handle what you want him to handle thats the only thing you can do about that now how you go about that is horse of another color and is part of this lecture im just telling you the good indicator now i worked all this out and every once in while im never im never such fool as to believe that i cant learn anything about auditing and so forth in fact in fact amongst you there may be some of you who have more to learn about auditing and so forth and i congratulate you because that is very happy state to be in and i have never achieved it thats mean thing to say but ive never never achieved this happy state i always have something new to learn about auditing always i can always learn something from any given session and im struck to the degree of my own ignorance sometimes as to what i have been neglecting im sometimes overwhelmed by it little bit and i say hey what do you know all these years ive been watching wahwah and i never knew that wahwah what do you know you know and i get very interested in it in other words i can make progress along this line and after cursing and snarling about how it was almost impossible to impart to an auditor about how session was put together what session should look like and after having this problem on my plate for about thirteen years i solved it because auditors couldnt observe pcs this has been nagging nagging nagging and this has been right up front as research project you think ive been researching only very esoteric things that isnt so i always have my eye on the fundamentals and the improvement thereof see i was snarling around and auditors never learned this will this will give you this is good laugh see auditors just never learned to observe pcs you see and i finally figured out this system good indicators and bad indicators you see when good indicator disappears bad indicator doesnt necessarily show up they are not they are not justice scale where you put so much on one side and take it off that side and put it on the other side you know thats why theyre released here in two different sections good indicators are good indicators and they dont become bad indicators bad indicators are something else entirely different and good indicators are something else good indicator disappears another breed of cat called bad indicator shows up and theyre usually not at once translatable you have to memorize them in their own categories but anyhow i worked this over and i got it all worked out and i saw what it was and so on and i thought now i says that will show them something that will show them something and soandso i was very happy then because i realized that i could show you without lot of trouble what an auditing session should look like and so that you could correct some of this and so you could get raised workability out of auditing see so as you could make your auditing of pc work better i was very happy about it heres the joke i was sitting in session i was giving and all of sudden i noticed that good indicator was missing pc cogniting pc had ceased to cognite so slight difference here you see i just said hey theres good indicator missing hmmm so i said im going to find out whats wrong here right away pc hadnt even begun to dream that there was anything wrong and see auditor finding out you auditor by the way you know heres another rule the auditor must always find out whats wrong in session before the pc finds out thats how you hold altitude as an auditor thats how you hold control you must always find out whats wrong in session before the pc finds out when the pc finds out and has to tell you why your your altitude suffers and so forth and you have less control over the pc now in this particular instance and so forth i very clever indeed i said good indicators missing ah and i looked at the list which i had in front of and noticed that it was very very short list indeed and that nothing had fallen on it and the pc was just about ready to make critical remark or say something or other and introduce some new bad indicators into the session and didnt get chance to introduce them i said complete the list that was obviously what i said pc says oh oh oh yes yes completed the list and so forth and we got the list complete and went on cogniting started cogniting again and we pc and i laughed about this great deal because it was it was so quick it was so quick off the mark that the pc really didnt find out what was going on until it was all over and yet was probably saved probably saved half an hour or something like that of patchup arc break that kind of auditing see it undoubtedly saved half an hours worth of auditing just that so right away i dreamed this up so as to make you better auditor and ive become better auditor as result so thank you but anyway that was very good and it saved just like that bang just half an hours worth of auditing because that cognition drop out that would have been followed by something else and that would have been followed by something else and the good indicators would have dropped out and dropped out and dropped out and of course thats very light indicator the bad indicators would have shown up then id have gone and had to figure out what was wrong and id have had to backtrack where we were at the time when it went out and then i would have found that wed had an incomplete list at that time well obviously it only could have been only one thing wrong in the session at that moment because all i was doing was trying was just doing short list so there was only one thing wrong and it must have been an incomplete list you could just get off the mark like that because it wasnt overlisted it wasnt long enough so bang good indicator disappeared i say somethings wrong with exactly what im doing because the good indicator disappeared right there and it was right there while i was doing it and i hadnt cut the pcs itsa and my observation of my own auditing was high so i said therefore we have an incomplete list so complete the list the pc was just getting ready to say you wahwahwah andandand it oh all right ill complete the list that was the end of that in other words there are three degrees of indicators theres light indicators theres medium indicators and heavy indicators and the very unobservant auditor only uses heavy indicators screaming arc break there is fourth grade pc wont come near an auditing session and we never let it go that far but the medium indicator thats pretty darned obvious and the light indicator is something you either do something about or merely get alert about its an alerting thing more than using thing medium indicator is something you use and must do something about right now and heavy indicator means youve missed the light indicators now any process has its own series of bad indicators and the bad indicator moves in when the good indicator moves out so you have to have as primary knowledge this sounds odd but you have to have as primary knowledge knowledge of good indicators now you never look dont look for bad indicator dont look for bad indicator on and on and on dont look for bad indicators all the time all the time youd drive the pc round the bend and suppress your good indicators what you want to do is to know your good indicators so well that when one of them disappears from the type of process for thats for the level youre running know the good indicators so well that when one of them disappears out of session your ears go up spannngg and you instantly look for the bad indicator and really dont look for the bad indicator until you see the vanishment of the good indicator when you see good indicators vanishing you look for the bad indicator otherwise you are always continuously prowling around looking for wrongnesses in session and you keep the pc very upset and you get auditing done of any kind whatsoever so this other system is far better and quite usable and quite good system now rapidly lets go over the routine 6 and level vi indicators these are all good indicators and im merely going to read them off youve got them in your bulletin of december the 28th and can copy them from them so im not going to bother you with making notes of this particular set because you have business being separated or away from that bulletin pc cheerful now what do we mean pc cheerful well we mean the pcs cheerful thats what we mean the degree of misemotion that the pc is indulging in must be diminishing degree interesting isnt it diminishing degree pc hits grief charge or something like that now these remember routine 6 in routine 6 pc cheerful your pc hits any misemotion of any kind whatsoever thats all under the heading of bad indicator so when we say pc cheerful pc should be running like grinning idiot you understand cheerful you know teeth smiling you know happy hadadadadadadada bowwowwowwow you know oh its dog and bog and bagitibog and pokata wog oh and that and what do you know about that thats wudiwum yeah all right bang kowchowpow chapowpowpow powpow cheerful oh gugfrog oh my all my life all my life ive been worried about gugfrogs you know bang you know pc cheerful so at other levels however you have different actions r3r if your pc is laughing all the time he is having grief charge we would say something is weirds going on were trying to run secondaries on the pc we dont expect the pc to be cheerful but your misemotion should be diminishing in session diminishing it isnt that you have to suppress the pcs misemotion but youll find good grief charge off at certain levels of auditing is very fine thing indeed but it must be diminishing and working back up toward cheerful so its other levels of auditing pc cheerful would become pc working in direction to becoming more cheerful so at other levels you would have pc getting more cheerful as your indicator it would be the change of degree thats for lower levels now we dont of course have at lower levels pc cogniting on goals and items but we certainly do have pc cogniting and if youve got noncogniting pc john sanborn once said very wisely he said you know he said im suspicious of this guy im suspicious of him you know he never looks around and says well what do you know you know he never looks at anything and says well what do you know and he said id feel an awful lot better if sometime or another hed look at something and say well what do you know well what hes spotting there was pc who was not cogniting which would be sure symptom that the pc was running in present time problem an arc break was running at level above his level or ability to handle pc not cogniting pcs items found are the ones pc thought they were on the list well of course that is relatively inapplicable at lower levels except for this you very often find that what pc thought was wrong early on in his life turned out to be what was wrong and if he if hes coming up with things like this you know as little boy i always suspected it was because my father was was so on so on so on so on so on on and by george you know thats fact the rightness of the pc the basic or fundamental rightnesses of the pc are asserting themselves is the way that could run at lower levels now you have pc listing items briefly and accurately that would apply to listing any listing activity but in other levels giving things to the auditor briefly and accurately the early items on the list turning out to be the right ones that thats doesnt even apply anymore to routine 6 just scrub it the right well if overlisted it takes the pc too long to find out anything and so forth youd say pc finding out things or finding things rapidly is your good indicator pc is finding things rapidly takes the pc long time to find something youve seen pc sit there and say the obvious answer of course is the fact that hes been beaten you see why do you feel bad you know and the pc says ohhhhhh and so forth and it just takes him takes him half an hour or fortyfive minutes to come up with the fact well i guess i feel bad because i just got beaten in other words in other words the speed of turnup the speed of the pc finding something or giving up something this next one could be translated as proper reading meter the next one items found not rocket reading well that has applicability to anything except youve got to have whats being done is giving proper meter responses and youve got your goals found rocket reading well whats found gives its proper meter response and this next one could be determined as short item lists could be determined as it doesnt take long periods of time to get something done with this case this by the way is an indicator that lot of auditors should pay more attention to they they they themselves think it just takes forever i used to scare i had an auditor one time that i used to scare half to death the auditor would run something and id change and itd get over and itd straighten up and so forth and that would be that and the auditor was just settling down and the auditor actually didnt like to audit very much i changed too quickly and had cognitions too fast and this was very tiring because he had to think up new process at once of course and youll see some auditors sit down and theyre going to run i see the cat you see and theyre sitting that down for nice long intensive and then its flattened off in twenty minutes we just had it happen out here i gave process over to an auditor to run and it was reported to from all sides that the process hadnt been run and i found out the facts of the case were the process had been run on the pc but the pc had been able to cope with the process and handle it and come up to final cognition on it in half an hour now the expectancy on every hand then that was going to take long time to run that process well it takes as long to run process as it takes to run it and pc running processes easily and rapidly and flattening them on comm lag or cognition or meter thing is good indicator an indicator thats very often missing in sessions and you never notice it the pc is taking forever to flatten something well thats not necessarily good indicator at all items being found rapidly without lot of hassle even though the right item was hard to make read now that only applies to routine 6 in ordinary auditing it translates over into into this being able to get the datum for the pc without an awful lot of wrastle you ask the pc whats your name you know and the pc three hours later finally guarantees with giggle that hell let you in on the fact that the first name begins with j i wouldnt say that that was good indicator pc giving the auditor information easily is the good indicator see easily all right now tone arm continuing in motion not stuck now thats good indicator but thats an indicator which can be overdone if youve got some other good indicators present like pc flattening processes rapidly if youve got these present and hes coming up with new things easily and rapidly and so forth our action here is cancelled out in other words the tone arm keeps going flat well it would be very dumb auditing indeed that would try to get flattened process to produce more tone arm action you know well yesterday he got beautiful tone arm action on critical thoughts of his father but today we just keep trying to run this process and trying to run it and you know i dont get any tone arm action well never occurs to him the another good indicator was present and that was that the pc was easily and rapidly flattening processes given that thats good indicator so if that indicator was present then we dont expect the tone arm to keep moving forever on the same old hassle we weve got to weve got to weve got to change our sights here on this case now the needle active now thats something in meter reading that you seldom see you seldom really watch for youre so worried usually about dirty needles and that sort of thing that you dont dont really watch for an active needle whats meant by an active needle well its not s its needle thats not stuck but its needle that is fluid or fluent its needle that moves around its needle that that is pretty easy to handle now these new mark vis new mark vs meters and so on and there is mark vi too but that meter is so easy to set up to high high high sensitivity that you can very easily lie get it to lie you can get it to tell you lie that it all it looks like it has more fluid needle than it has and in great if im if im trying to pull withholds or something like that well i pull out my crank on one of these new modern meters and i crank it all the way up sensitivity 128 and the sensitivity knob set over to 32 and everything on the fire you see and my trained and educated thumb having an awful time trying to keep that needle at set because i want that thing to read all its going to read but thats thats trying to clean things you understand thats trying to clean withholds thats doing very picky particular job of the kind where it doesnt matter if you clean clean once in while if you leave the withhold on the case youve had it dont you understand so that kind of auditing yes yes crank it up man thats what its made that way for and all other kinds of auditing deeeowwwdown i run one of those meters ordinarily at routine 6 never run one of those things higher than sensitivity 8 never never run it higher than that for listing and items and that sort of thing crank it way down and get make sure sometimes you can be fooled you can get that 128 button down there and its all over to 128 and youre trying to crank your meter down and yet youve doubled and tripled and quadrupled your sensitivity down below so get that thing set over at minimum and your tone arm set about 80 and you can do almost any reading you want to read and then kick the sensitivity i said tone arm i meant sensitivity knob kick your sensitivity knob to about 16 while youre doing mid rud and just move it up and down between 16 for doing your mid ruds or since mid ruds and move it back to 8 and frankly thats about as high as you would ever expect one of those meters to have to perform performing them wide open causes lot of trouble causes the auditor lot of trouble and causes lot of comm lags in the session now theres about where your meter ought to read and where you ought to be handling your meter and now im talking now about the sensitivity 8 set meter when i say an active needle and that that needle shouldnt be stuck that needle shouldnt be hanging up that needle should be moving and it drifts easy and when we mean needle active we mean that it drifts easily or moves easily the pc has big think you see and the needle goes pprrrr and the thing is rising and all of sudden strikes back couple of divisions and it ticks and tocks and it sweeps up and it goes down and so forth your needle isnt sitting around your needle isnt sitting around stuck your needle doesnt you havent set your needle at set and then it just sits at set and it just goes on sitting at set well of course this would mean tone arm action was out too but do you know you can have tone arm action present and the needle not active or fluid you can have tone arm action with gummy needle and you want to get educated enough so that you can see this because its an important good indicator youre getting some tone arm action the tone arm is going up and down little bit and so forth but that needles kind of going throbthrob clocketyclock dirty see thats one of the symptoms but actually doesnt move much itll go on reaching upsurge or it or climbing surge or itll do fall and so forth on the things its supposed to fall on but it it acts gummy and when you see it there that is good indicator gone good indicator is your needle ought to be cleanly swinging about and if youve got cleanly swinging about meter then your pc your needle your pc is running very smoothly and theres probably very little wrong in the session thats thats good indicator good indicator that clean active needle now going on down the line here taking up few more of those things here it gives you pc not troubled with new mass appearing when item is given well thats routine 6 indicator but i would say the pc is not being troubled with new pains and somatics and pressures and upsets by reason of an auditing question or its repetition id say it was good indicator that your pc was running easily and if he is hitting somatics theyre discharging your good indicator is that any somatic the pc runs into is fluid it is in and out it is momentary its twitch any pressure is prrrrrp and then off and so forth those are all good indicators the pressure or pain or somatic that moves in and gets heavier and then stays there and so forth inevitably and invariable means something is real wrong youre doing something wrong but what what you want the som when you get rid of somatics on pc it ought to be flick and spick and swish and pang and its in and out dont you see the shoulder all of sudden hes got some pressure on his shoulder and then all of sudden he gets hot and its gone thats good indicator youve given him an auditing command and he gets pressure on his shoulder you give him another auditing command and hes got bit more pressure on his shoulder give him another auditing command hes got the same pressure on his shoulder another auditing command and hes got the same pressure on his shoulder another auditing command and hes got the same pressure ohhh nuts man theres good indicator has started missing somatics arent arent fluid they arent going in and out and so forth turning on and off you want to get changing somatics in session in other words and this of course is an r6 indicator ri given the pc blowing tone arm down when pc asked if it is it well thats normal but you ought to have your tone arm go down when the pc hits cognition and thats good indicator pc cognites needle down tone arm down good indicator now further blowdown of ta as the pc goes on talking about something that doesnt matter its just right here in the good indicators but actually theres normal session indicator thats comparable to this which is that youre getting more action once pcs talking if youre not getting tone arm action when the pcs talking theres something wrong theres something wrong here thats not not too going too good distinct needle slash two inches or so when the pc is asked if new item solves or is solved by ri found just before and so forth in normal session it turns into the same indicator i gave you before which is simply expected meter behavior nothing unexpected in this meter behavior full dial slash comes under the same one the next one nothing unexpected in the meter behavior meters behaving the way it ought to behave and heat on an item list now good indicator is pc gets warm and stays warm in auditing or gets hot and unheats and so forth while auditing pc does not get chilled in auditing thats bad indicator and these all these heat items are the same now of course if you could audit somebody with pain ever and so forth this would be very unusual indeed and is not even desirable so at lower levels you run and if the pc never gets somatic never has pain and so forth in auditing you wonder whats going off so in lower levels its occasional somatics is good indicator somatics are good indicator any kind of somatic pain or so forth thats good indicator routine 6 we change horses you get pain theres something wrong which is vast difference in these things now we get tone arm riding between 25 and 375 acceptable or 225 and 30 which is excellent and you will find that that is good indicator at any level thats fine for any level now good tone arm action on finding items or good tone arm action on spotting things for any level good tone arm action on spotting things but you already got your divisions for various levels of auditing and so on and they all hold good and that youre getting that expected ta action is good indicator getting the expected ta action for any level of processing is good indicator of course the best good tone arm action is i just gave you that the right item reading with only some coaxing well thats peculiarly routine 6 i would say that youre getting reads on what you and the pc think is wrong id say that was good indicator getting reads on what you and the pc think is wrong youve agreed that something or other that theres been hell to pay about little brothers or something of the sort and youre busy discussing this and you suggested it and the pc followed in with it and youve discussed it back and forth and and behold that subject is giving needle and ta action that subject is giving needle and ta action well thats real good indicator you youre dealing with things that the pc thinks it is and that you think it is and youre getting tone arm action now if youre dealing with things that you think it is and the pc thinks it is and youre not getting any tone arm action and so forth then somebody is wrong it may be you and it may be the pc but certainly good indicator is missing from the session and the good indicator is is that you and the pc in thinking over what the score is about his case and so forth get tone arm action on what you think it is not something else all right and this is very important very important indicator for any level pc with ptp doesnt mean that its bad indicator that the pc has ptp but if the pc is running along between sessions and during sessions with ptps its good indicator unless of course the pc is in total propitiation and cant even compos mentis then of course thats another horse of another hue but theres theres what that is with pc isnt developing horrendous ptps pc that develops horrendous ptps between sessions and so forth thats bad indicator good indicator the pc isnt developing lot of balderdash between sessions and isnt developing ptps in session and so forth thats good indicator you can take look at the pc and you find this pc isnt developing lot of ptps but just cheerfully happily cogniting and going on and so forth and so on its very good indicator pc that develops ptps in session about session haha bad indicator which has its own story because were only taking up good indicators here and pc with question as to what was the right goal or item now that works out in all levels this way is the pc afterwards doesnt come around to the auditor and say do you think that was really the reason i had the lumbosis see the pc stays certain of the auditing solution pc remains certain of the auditing solution thats good indicator it doesnt mean terribly much that they are uncertain of the auditing solution thats not necessarily bad indicator but it certainly is good indicator that the pc remains certain that that was the solution to the situation and they said soandso and soandso and so on they dont afterwards say well wahwahwahwahwahwahwah im not sure sure sure whether the because wahwah that thats all the reverse of the good indicator so the pc remains certain and of course this is grade iii indicator of any level pc not critical or arc breaky any pc that is critical of the auditor is arc broken now i can guarantee that and i dont know how many auditors i have been dismayed that i couldnt quickly teach this to they learn it eventually but its its just pc says well i dont know i so on and so on and so on it was this that sharp tone of voice that youre using and so forth and the auditor is always so willing to be reasonable i dont know why you run yourselves down like this theyre so willing to be reasonable ill take that much chitchat in session for exactly measured actually measured actually by astronomical instruments onethousandth of millisecond im right in there bang boom zoom because its not reasonable to that pc would be critical of the auditor in session i dont care if ive just dropped the silverware on the floor you understand thats not reasonable to why isnt it reasonable because the pc is there to be helped and im there to help the pc and i am doing my best to help the pc and that the pc is then critical well i dont find that reasonable i dont care what mistakes i made it still is never reasonable to and it never will be reasonable to because every single criticalness on the part of pc can be run back to an arc break that the pc has just had or to an overt the pc has on the auditor or withhold the pc has not disclosed and those are the reasons for the critical pc ill tell you whats happened i have actually committed horrible blunders in session see i mean almost tipped the desk over type of thing dont you see just whoa you know and pc would just say oh well all right this is so what and so on so you tipped over the desk you know you know lets get back to what i was running here well did it distract your attention its all right didnt matter now what i was talking about here is my father had this happen too often see the pc didnt pay any attention but this time you see i just adjust my tie and the pc says i cant stand this terrific motion that is going on in this session hehhehhehhehheh then im expected to believe that its because i adjusted my tie that upset the pc hey come off of it this is why you need to know good indicators see that would never upset anybody so there must then be one of the other things which i just mentioned present in the session so pc happy with satisfied with auditor regardless of what auditor is doing is good indicator and you state that for all levels and you wont be wrong and thats very extreme one and you wont be able to understand it sometimes or anything of the sort ive seen auditors committing the most horrible blunders and their pcs perfectly happy with them and so forth well thats because auditor behavior and activity actually doesnt influence to any great degree the attitude of the pc what influences the attitude of the pc is an arc break that of course is influenced earlier by the auditors behavior or the pcs got an overt on the auditor or the pc has missed withhold of some kind or another and they influence the pcs attitude toward the auditor but the auditors actual activity as long as that auditor is even halfway trying as long as hes in there sweating as long as hes working as long as hes trying to get his job done at all doesnt influence the pcs attitude how do you like that so you can broaden this to pc happy and satisfied with auditor is another good indicator of course this is aside of the fact the pc is cheerful and so forth you got it pc says oh and soandso and soand so well theres something gone wrong in that session man that has to do with the pcs case has to do with blunders of some kind or another and any auditor thats reasonable about how he of course deserves to be criticized for the horrible things he has done of course is just missing the best indicator of all hes got thats bad indicator and something wrong doesnt matter what the pcs saying theres something wrong in the session and it isnt actually the auditors tone of voice theres something else wrong and if the auditor starts monitoring his tone of voice and so forth hes total chump then he never gets in and finds out whats wrong in the session dont you see so the reasonable auditor messes up pcs like mad all right now the pc not protesting the auditors actions comes under the same heading which i just gave you the pc looking younger by reason of r6 auditing actually thats true of almost any level of auditing pc looking younger better skin tone eye color these various things are good indicators but not very common ones but they are good indicators the pc without weariness in other words the pc feels more energetic is the good indicator pc without pains or aches or illnesses developing during auditing now always regard any pain ache or illness that pc develops during auditing as due to some error in auditing some bypassed charge usually has occasioned this and pc should actually be without pains aches or illnesses developing during auditing now we dont mean that he shouldnt have somatics we mean that he shouldnt get sick he shouldnt have terrible pain in his stomach which lasts for day or two and at midnight last night why he all of sudden was taken with an awful pain in his chest and that sort of thing while he was being audited and so on that means something was missed in the auditing something is wrong and that something needs correcting now pc wanting more auditing is good indicator as you already know pcs confidence now we can just in finding goals and items and so forth we say pcs confidence well pcs confidence weve got good indicator pc is getting more confident pc is confident is good indicator pc getting more confident is another good indicator there are two indicators there which are both good getting more confident about what well actually i can get pc so darned insouciant that hes practically insulting to as an auditor im perfectly happy you know pc saying look at all the look at all the stuff i found in the sess you know youre sitting there and the pc wandering around in rat maze you know and the pc saying well im getting pretty good i dont mind saying but i found fifteen fifteen items that fast in the session and so forth and so forth and yesterday i only found ten you know and today i found so thats fine oh good great great and of course they just forget that you did anything at all thats all right with man its all right with i dont have to be told im doing good job i know my good indicators now okay this by the way is the best thanks an auditor gets and the best guarantee that hes doing good job of auditing you see if all these good indicators are present he knows hes doing good job of auditing and doesnt have to be thanked now the pcs itsa free thats good thats good indicator but pcs itsa so extensive you cant get any auditing in that is not good indicator see in other words the pcs itsa is free but just covers the subject doesnt beat it to death you know pc says it and thats it pcs itsa can be so extensive that it becomes bad indicator because the pc is using his itsa to stop the auditor from auditing and that is bad indicator too extensive too involved and too disrelated an itsa it betokens various things and theres various grades of bad indicators there so wed say pcs itsa is free but not too extensive thats for any level and thats good indicator thats two good indicators actually and the auditor seeing how goals goals goals well we can just reduce that to the auditor understanding how come thats that way in the case the pc says well the reason i really have bad foot is because there were all these moon rockets see and they kept going overhead all the time and so forth and then my name my name at that particular time was israel and so forth and we had big library and it had ten tomes of tums in it and so forth and thats how i have bad foot and the auditor says what the hell where did where did we get how why what which which door where did he go where did he go where did he go well the auditor didnt understand what the pcs talking about the auditor didnt understand the pc that thats pcs not saying comprehensible things which is bad indicator but the fact that the auditor can see how it was is the good indicator that applies to any level of auditing the auditor can see how it was how it happened that way can see can see that that is the way it was the auditor can see that thats good indicator pc says well i dont know i got into this car and it went down over the hill and ran into tree and it certainly pushed my chest in for while and i was in the hospital for while and i had plaster cast on and weve just found out this whole incident and so forth and the auditor sees oh yeah thats how hed thats how hed have restricted feeling chest plaster cast restricted feeling chest thats good indicator in other words the pc is saying things that make sense the pcs addup makes sense if the pcs addup doesnt make sense thats not good indicator now the auditor sees how and this is just some more of the same thing auditor sees how ris solve ris thats just comes under the heading of the one i just gave you and the life of this person making sense the way this person tells his life and adds it up and that sort of thing it makes sense it makes sense thats good indicator but you have somebody who tells you well you see actually actually i was for very long time page boy at the catfish hotel and then i quit and thats how i became bank president and you dont make any sense out of this well thats thats bad indicator now that just the rest of this is more or less the same but and youve covered the last one there of pc not developing heavy ptps or somatics between sessions or in sessions
