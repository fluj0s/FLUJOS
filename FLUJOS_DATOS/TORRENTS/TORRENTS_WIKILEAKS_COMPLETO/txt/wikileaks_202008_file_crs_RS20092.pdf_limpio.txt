the federal debt the law authorizes the us government to accept gifts of money or other property which are to be used for the reduction of the public debt it provides for the deposit of cash gifts or

not need to issue treasury securities as debt shrinks savings accrue to the government in reduced interest payments brief histori cal overview the program was introduced as an act to authorize the
