bolivians find themselves again facing the social unrest that has plagued their country since 2003 but which had subsided after morales took office the fourth president in as many years morales rose to power promising revolution that would deliver more inclusive society new constitution nationalization of natural resources and land reform morales has delivered on some of his promises but is facing increasing difficulties governing bolivia which he himself has exacerbated this year by condoning and even encouraging street protests against those who oppose him while we support morales stated goal of social inclusion serious questions exist about his commitment to democracy and to the rule of lawour top priorities here particularly given his demonstrated impatience with compromise cuban and venezuelan advice interference and assistance are an additional area of concern 2 sbu summary continued although bolivias macroeconomic outlook remains strong in the short term morales nationalization of hydrocarbons and the february 9 move against nonus interests in the mining sector will threaten new investment trade should be key to bolivias future and congress extension of atpdea benefits was wellreceived here the gob has shown little real interest in longterm trade agreement on counternarcotics the morales governments mixed results on counternarcotics reflect its confused strategy encouragement of coca cultivation and thus more cocaine coupled with increased interdiction efforts your visit provides an opportunity to encourage morales to follow democratic path and to respect us mining interests to take counternarcotics issues more seriously and to become true partner in fighting the flow of illegal drugs and to take advantage of free trade and other opportunities including the millennium challenge account mca end summary bolivia background notes 3 sbu landlocked bolivia is the highest and most isolated of the latin american republics once over 780000 square miles bolivia lost large chunks of its land to chile and paraguay leaving it with some 424000 square miles roughly three times the size of nevada aymara indigenous groups dominate paz and the highlands the quechuas populate the cities of sucre and cochabamba and surrounding areas the rich lowlands known as the halfmoon states tend to be less influenced by indigenous cultures the government recognizes 38 different indigenous groups and over 60 percent of bolivians identify themselves as indigenous making bolivia the most indigenous country in latin america bolivia is country of contrast with small prosperous minority of its population immersed in modern business and technology and the overwhelming poor majority still mired in poverty and living relatively unchanged by progress 4 sbu rapidly urbanizing bolivia is the second poorest country in latin america with poverty afflicting twothirds of its population in 2005 its gdp was approximately usd 85 billion agriculture accounts for roughly 145 percent of bolivias gdp and soybeans grown in eastern bolivia are the major cash crop extraction of minerals and hydrocarbons make up an estimated 10 percent of gdp with manufacturing accounting for another 12 percent lack of economic opportunities has fueled mass migration to argentina brazil spain and the united states as well as ruraltourban and westerntoeastern migration within the country social unrest 5 sbu shortly after indigenous coca leader evo morales oneyear anniversary as president bolivians find themselves again facing the social unrest that has plagued their country since 2003 but which had subsided after morales took office the fourth president in as many years morales rose to power promising revolution that would deliver more inclusive society new constitution nationalization of natural resources and land reform sharp political strategist morales has delivered on some of his promises and has maintained high popularity rates however his first year in office has brought morales to terms with the difficulties of governing bolivia he has exacerbated the challenge by condoning street protests against those who opposed him cocalero ambush of bolivian antidrug forces in the chapare mining clash in huanuni 500000person strong demonstration in favor of regional autonomy in eastern bolivia january riots in cochabamba and february 7 protest by miners in paz have presented morales with serious challenges defending democracy 6 sbu while we support morales stated goal of social inclusion serious questions exist about his commitment to democracy and to the rule of lawour top priorities here particularly given his demonstrated impatience with democratic rules and compromise bolivia convened constitutional convention in august 2006 which to date has failed to make any progress largely due to executive branch interference and morales opposition to bolivian constitutional norms and traditions before the convention may begin its work it must decide what vote will be required to approve constitutional changes the gob has taken hardline approach repeatedly refusing to compromise with the opposition morales has packed the supreme court using recess appointments instructed his party to pass questionable land reform law and military treaty with venezuela in latenight senate session november 28 and permitted violence against opposition hunger strikers as well as the kidnapping of an opposition prefect most recently the gob is widely thought to have instigated the january protests in cochabamba aimed at sacking an opposition prefect despite gob denials evidence exists that the administration paid transported and fed armed cocaleros who were bussed to cochabamba to riot against an oppositionled local government in addition to frequent public attacks on the opposition morales also has targeted bolivias prefects governors eastern bolivia because it seeks regional autonomy the judiciary and the press one place where were not big brother 7 sbu in addition to internal pressures cuban and venezuelan advice interference and assistance continue to be serious concern cuban doctors and newlyinaugurated hospitals bring medical care to isolated communities venezuela has agreed to purchase bolivian soy has provided micro credit financing to small businesses has donated tractors to bolivian farmers and has funded community radio stations to broadcast the gobs messages most recently the venezuelan government has agreed to buy essentially all of bolivias tainted beef otherwise quarantined by an outbreak of hoofandmouth disease as well as its industrialized coca these venezuelan programs receive frequent public acclaim from bolivias poor on the other hand middle class bolivians resent venezuelas growing presence and influence and have balked at the bolivian military singing the venezuelan national anthem and depending on venezuelandonated helicopters to transport their president regionally bolivia has strengthened ties with chile but has alienated brazil and argentina at various points over the past year largely because of its nationalistic but incoherent hydrocarbons policy nationalization of resources and trade 8 sbu although bolivias macroeconomic outlook remains strong in the short term morales nationalization of hydrocarbons and moves against nonus interests in the mining sector where the bulk of us investments lie threaten new investment on may 1 2006 morales announced gob nationalization of the hydrocarbons sector despite the presence of bolivian troops in hydrocarbons fields the reality was less dramatic instead of traditional nationalization the gob required companies to sign new contracts under duress and gave bolivias state oil company ypfb control over the entire hydrocarbons chain the main impact has been to halt new investment in the sector which bolivia needs to meet domestic demand and fulfill contractual obligations to brazil and argentina as political measure however the nationalization remains wildly popular 9 sbu with respect to the mining sector highlevel gob officials have given repeated assurances that the morales administration will respect existing us mining interests however the gob has reiterated threats to nationalize the mining industry and on february 9 took over smelter owned by swiss company glencore which had been sold by expresident gonzalo sanchez lozada we continue to urge the gob to respect existing mining concessions and to limit tax and royalty hikes 10 sbu trade is the key to bolivias future congress extension of andean trade promotion and drug eradication act atpdea benefits was wellreceived here ensuring the continuity of thousands of jobs however highlevel gob officials refuse to take serious steps toward free trade agreement instead advocating the extension of the unilateral trade preferences we have explained that fast track trade promotion authority expires in june and that the new us congress is not likely to extend it the morales administration however continues to want something for nothing coca casts shadow 11 sbu the morales governments mixed results on counternarcotics reflect its confused strategyencouragement of coca cultivation coupled with increased interdiction efforts despite the embassys attempts to focus the relationship elsewhere counternarcotics is often the negative focal point of the bilateral relationship given president morales leadership of the chaparebased coca federations this is not surprising morales repeatedly called for zero cocaine not zero coca drawing distinction between illegal drugs and legal use of coca leaf which is also chewed or brewed as tea it should be noted that bolivian coca production vastly exceeds licit demand as the gob tacitly accepts having refused to proceed with market study funded by the eu which would show just that 12 sbu per capita rates of illegal drug use in urban bolivia approach us levels confirming that bolivia is consumer country and not merely producer narcotics affairs section nassupported demand reduction efforts focus on local and regional partners due to central government indifference nas and deasupported interdiction programs have been successful under the morales government comparing 2006 to 2005 cocaine seizures were up 23 percent destruction of base labs and maceration pits were up 55 and 54 percent respectively while bolivian cn forces have improved coordination and efficiency the increased seizures are due in part to increased supply 13 sbu anecdotal evidence suggests that coca plantings have grown dramatically since morales election edging out other licit and lessprofitable crops and just as coca planting has increased eradication is down the gob achieved its goal of eradicating 5000 hectares in 2006 but has gotten off to slow start in 2007 the morales government has been unwilling to enforce bolivian law or informal agreements limiting coca cultivation has stalled the launch of the licit demand study required by bolivian law and now is considering raising legal limits from 12000 to 20000 hectares nationwide to include the chapare this increase would place bolivia in violation of its own law and treaty obligations in an attempt to justify increased coca growth the gob has announced plans to legalize and industrialize coca for use in products such as toothpaste demand for which is notional at best comment 14 sbu your visit presents an opportunity to further our strategy of engagement with the gob we have expressed serious concerns about the morales governments commitment to democracy that includes separation of powers checks and balances an active political opposition and free press we continue to emphasize that what morales says matters as much as what he does in terms of his attacks on the united states on counternarcotics we have continued to support interdiction and eradication efforts demand reduction programs and capacity building while engaging in frank discussions about the gobs shortcomings and redirecting our support where it has greatest impact ie to interdiction via usaid were spending about 90 million annually to further social and economic inclusion of bolivias historically marginalized indigenous groups and to support democratic institutions and processes including decentralized governance in addition usaid encourages economic growth for the poor through exports and trade and also provides assistance in the areas of health alternative development and environmental protection your visit provides an additional opportunity to encourage morales to follow democratic path and to respect us mining interests to take counternarcotics issues seriously and to become true partner in fighting the flow of illegal drugs and to take advantage of free trade and other opportunities including the millennium challenge account mca end comment
