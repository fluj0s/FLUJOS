impacts across the world but especially among poor people in lowincome developing countries since 2000 year of low food prices wheat prices in international markets have more than tripled corn prices have doubled and rice prices rose to unpreceden ted levels in march 2008 such increases in food prices have raised concerns about the ability of poor people to meet their food and nutrition needs and in number of countri have lead to civil unrest more than 33 countries most of which are in subsa haran africa are particularly affected by food prices increases the world bank has estimated that more than 100 million people are being pushed into poverty as result of foodprice escalation number of interrelated fact ors have been identified as causes of the rising food prices droughts in australia

food pri ces have raised concerns about the ability of poor people to meet their food and nutrition needs and in number of countries have lead to civil unrest food pr ice escalation affects th cost of

around the world but especially asian riceproducing countries have introduced export restrictions in response to high prices for food grains some count ries have introduced grain export restrictions to augment domestic supplies and hopefully contain the effects of high prices on th eir own consumers such export restrictions are intended to au gment domestic supplies and hopefully contain the effects of high pri ces on consumers however such measures exacerbate the food supply situation in importing countries rising oil and energy prices have affected all levels of the food production and marketing chain from fertilizer costs to harvesting transportin g and processing food these rising fuel costs are reflected in higher food prices the costs for transporting food aid from the united states to beneficiaries in developing countries are already high in fy 2007 for example of every dollar provided for us food aid about 56 cents represented the cost of transporting commodities9 rising fuel rices could make shipping food even more expensive in 2008 higher incomes in emerging markets like china and india have resulted in strong demand for food commodities meat and processed foods and higher prices in world markets the increased demand for food and energy in emerging markets is considered by many to be structural change that will affect the supply and demand for food and feed well into the future increased demand for biofuels has reduced the availability of agricultural products for food or feed use some think that the competition between crops for food and crops for fuel will affect food supply and prices for years into the future the food price impact of biofuels demand has caused some policy makers to suggest that biofuel subsidies nd mandates be rec onsidered others

in various ways as noted above some food exporting count ries have restricted ex ports while such moves can increase the availability of domestic supp lies in the short run it can lower domestic farmers incentives to produce and reduce the availability of supplies to importing countries number of food importing countri have reduced or eliminated import duties so as to reduce the cost of food some have introduced price controls while at the same time augmenting input subsidie s for farmers to induce them to increase production few other countries have addr essed mounting food prices by

onsideration in the debate over the reauthorization of food aid programs in the farm bill now under consideration in congress could affect the way in which the united st ates provides emergency food aid these include providing legislative authority to purchase nonus commodities for emergency food aid in countries or regi ons close to where food emergencies are occurring and earmarking portion of food aid for development rather than emergency uses allocating some title ii funds to local or regional purchase high transportation costs and lengthy delays before us commodities arrive at their destinations in emergency situati ons prompted the administration in its 2007 farm bill proposals to recommend that th administrator of usaid be given the authority to use up to 25 of the funds available for pl 480 title ii to purchase commodities in locations closer to where they are needed19 the rationale for this proposed new authority is that it would increase the timeliness and effectiveness of the us response to food aid emergencies by eliminating the need to transport commodities by cean carriers20 according to the administrations proposal savings achieved in transportation and distribution costs would be available for additional commodity purchases thus increasing th overall level of the us response to emergencies in addition local or regiona l purchases would also shorten the time it takes to get food supplies to where they are needed provide for flexibility in the choice of commodity and contribute to local economic devel opment proponents of local or regional purchase argue that it also would be less likely to disrupt receiving country markets21 the administration indicated that most of us emergency food aid would continue to be provided by us commodities the housepassed farm bill hr 2419 did not endorse the administrations proposal but the bill did stipulate that 40 million of the funds appropriated for usaids international disaster and

the development effectiveness of food aid does tying matter report prepared for oecd paris 2005 24 barrett op citits 2007 farm bill food aid recommendation was not the first time that the administration proposed allocating funds for local or regional purchase the presidents fy2003 budget request contai ned proposal to shift 300 million from pl 480 title ii to idfa to purchase food for emergency relief in markets closer to their final destinations rather than in the united states as required under pl 480 the proposal however proved controversial with farm groups agribusinesses and the maritime industry that supply and ship commodities for title ii and with many private voluntary organizations pvos that rely on food aid to carry out development projects in poor countries major concern of the pvos is that allocating title ii funds to localregional purchase w ould undercut political support for the food aid program and reduce the volume of commodities available for both emergencies and deve lopment projects the conference report hrept 109255 accompanying the fy2006 agriculture appropriations act pl 10997 addressed the issue of converting portion of pl 480 commodity food aid into cash by stating the conferees admonish the executive branch to refrain from proposals which place at risk carefully balanced coalition of interests which ve served the interests of international food assistance programs well for more than fifty years the presidents fy2007 and fy2008 budget requests also contained proposed appropriations language to allow the administrator of usaid to use up to 25 of pl 480 title ii funds for local or regiona l purchases of commodities in food crises the senate report srept 109266 accompanying the fy2007 agriculture appropriations bill explicitly rejected this proposal sta ting that the committee does not agree with the administrations proposal to shift up to 25 of the public law 480 title ii program level to usaid to be used for direct cash purchases of commodities and other purposes proponents admit that there would be some risks if local markets are unable to absorb large increases in food demand that local purchases could represent the quality of local food products and ability to transport food locally are also potential problems one study of the world food programs experience with local and regional purchases found that such risk s are manageable however and could be avoided22 another study of global food aid tr ansactions found that local food aid procurement was 66 less expensive than shipments directly from donor countries23 an estimated 60 of all food aid from all donors is locally or regionally procured24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34478crs12 25 personal communication from the washington office of the

represented 114 of total development assistance from dac member countries while by 2006 the percentage of bilateral velopment assistance accounted for by us agricultural development assistance had fallen to 23 of the total provided in terms of us assistance for agriculture in comparison with total us assistance aid for agriculture declined from 20 in 1980 to 3 in 2006 other oecd data show that although the total amount of aid for agriculture has decreased there has been relative in crease in the proportion of agricultural development assistance going to africa in recent years but this has been an increasing share of decreasing total however the partnership to cut hunger and poverty in africa an organization that advocates for increas ed support for african agricultural development found that us assistance to african agriculture had increased in real terms between 2000 and 2004 the world bank and usaid are two aid agencies that are promoting agricultural development and grow th in lowincome countries33 both indicate that african agricultural development should be priority but competing aid priorities congressional earmarks and institutional factors could make it difficult to reorder us development assistance priorities us assistance to agri culture focus on africa the us agency for international development usaid provided almost 600 million of development assistance to africa in fy2006 of that amount 3538 million was allocated to wide range of agricultural activities such as research and development of new agricultural technolog ies including biotechnology assistance with managing natural resources incl uding water resources and support for agroforestry development report prepar ed by the partnership to cut hunger and poverty in africa chaired by peter mcpherson examined us agricultural development assistance to africa during the period 2000200434 it identified two main factors that affect usaids allocation of resources to agricultural development these are competing priorities and congressional earmarks that influence funding for agricultural velopment assistance and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34478crs16 institutional factors that affect the scale and potential effectiveness of development resources competing priorities and congressional earmarks priorities established by usaid officials such as giving higher priority to assisting development of african agriculture ar difficult to translate into budgetary allocations because decisions are shap ed by so many other executive branch institutions and by congress according to the partnership usaid funds devoted to agricultural development compete with allocations to other important priorities for us foreign assistance notably health including hivai ds education and humanitarian assistance mainly pl 480 food aid funding for healthrelated assistance in africa has grown dramatically through usaid and special presidential initiatives to fight hivaids tb and malaria congressional earmarks the partnership says limit the flexibility of agricultural development assistance at th country level the partne rship estimates that 90 of usaids development assistance devoted to agriculture is preallocated to specific areas such as trade capacity building mic ro enterprise development biodiversity and plant biotechnology congressional earmark s in the view of the authors of that study limit the flexibility of development ssistance programs to respond to the most important needs at the field level and thus reduce the effectiveness of assistance institutional factors the partnership found that spending on agriculturerelated objectives in afri ca from 2000 to 2004 was spread across 24 countries and four regional programs resulting in aver age annual funding of about 6 million per year per country these funds were further dispersed among multiple contractors and grantees this approach th partnership conclude s raises questions over whether agricultural projects are larg enough to have lasting effect and whether their combined effects collectively generate sustainable development impact the partnership asserts that us aid agriculture program managers must compete for development resources with ot her sectors on the ba sis of quantifiable and nearterm results reporte d through usaids internal management system this process the partnership suggests may put projects that have longerterm impacts such as investment in infrastructure or in human capacity at disadvantage visàvis projects that have shorter term impact the partnership questioned the effectiv eness of coordination of agricultural development assistance within usaid am ong other us agencies that provide agriculturerelated assistance and with other bilateral donor countries and international institutions it highlighted the absence of mechanism for usaid to closely coordinate agricultu ral development strategy re source allocation and field program activities with these other us agencies especially the us department of agriculture other donors and multilate ral development institutions improved coordination according to the partnership w ould help to decrease costs and increase the effectiveness of assistance by integra ting priority setting and resource allocation and by boosting the scale of such efforts final institutional c onsideration raised by the partnership is that costs of us development assistance are higher because of the costs incurred by tying aid to procurement from us sources including the requirement that us food aid must be proc ured in the united states and shipped onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34478crs17 35 see crs report rl32427 millennium challenge account by curt tarnoffusflagged vessels and by the requirement to use pre dominately us

through marketoriented progrowth policies good governance and investment of their own resources in health and education can qualify for assistance under the mcc the partners hip says that the mcc has potential importance for agricultural devel opment in africa for two reasons the mcc represents large and potentially larger pool of resources for development assistance congress appropriated almost 1 billion in fy2004 15 billion in fy2005 and 1752 billion in each of fy2006 and fy2007 these funds are available until expended spreading such large volume of funds over relatively few countries could
