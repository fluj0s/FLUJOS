congressional research service the library of congress crs2 billion has been provided either as part of regular annual appropriations for the department of defense or by transfer from regular dod budget accounts2 recurring issue in congress has been whether funding for ongoing operations such as those in iraq afghanistan and elsewhere should continue to be provided in supplemental appropriations bills and in additional emergency accounts or should instead be considered as part of regular annual defense budget requests this would require that the administration provide the usual extensive budget justification material prepared in support of regular defense requests and it would make funding subject to the usual oversight that congress carries out in the normal defense authorization and appropriations process3 one element of the debate has been what the precedents are this report briefly reviews the main precedents including funding for the korean conflict the vietnam conflict the persian gulf war of 19901991 and smaller military contingency operations in the 1990s in brief the precedents are as follows supplementals have been the most frequent means of financing the initial httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22455 stages of military operations4 in general however past administrations have requested and congress has provided funding for ongoing military operations in regular appropriations bills as soon as even limited and partial projection of costs could be made in vietnam the johnson administration requested supplemental appropriations of 700 million for fy1965 and then submitted budget amendment for 17 billion for the regular fy1966 defense appropriations bill subsequently substantial funding was requested and provided in regular appropriations bills for fy1967 and fy1968 and additional funding was also provided in supplemental appropriations the amounts the johnson administration requested in regular appropriations bills in those years were sufficient to cover projected costs of operations for only part of the fiscal year on the premise that additional costs were uncertain the fy1967 request was based on the official 2 ibid table a1 shows 225 billion provided in regular appropriations bills and 86 billion provided through transfers 3 the fy2005 and fy2006 defense appropriations acts both included provisions expressing the sense of the senate that funding for ongoing operations should be requested and provided in regular defense funding bills see section 8138 of the fy2005 defense appropriations act pl 108287 and section 8117 of the fy2006 defense appropriations act pl 109148 also for several years defense appropriations acts have included provision requiring that the presidents budget request include separate budget justification documents for costs of military contingency operations see section 8100 of the fy2006 defense appropriations act 4 crs reviewed initial funding for military operations from world war ii through kosovo in stephen daggett budgeting for wars in the past crs congressional distribution memo march 27 2003 it is available to congressional offices on request crs3 premise that the war might be successfully concluded by the end of the fiscal year when costs grew supplementals were requested in the early 1990s funding for ongoing operations in southwest asia and in bosnia was provided in supplementals rather than in regular appropriations bills in the fy1996 defense appropriation act however congress directed the administration to include subsequent funding for ongoing military contingency operations in its requests for regular defense appropriations funding the clinton administration complied with this directive although operations in kosovo were initially funded with supplemental appropriations funds for ongoing missions including kosovo after the initial stages were requested in regular dod budget submissions brief summaries of funding for the korean conflict the vietnam conflict and operations in the 1990s follow korea httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22455 following the outbreak of the war in korea congress provided supplemental appropriations of 328 billion for the department of defense for fy1951 which covered costs of operations in korea and also of general worldwide buildup of military forces in fy1952 almost all of the funding for operations in korea was provided in regular appropriations except for 14 billion which was deficiency appropriation for operations in korea provided on june 28 1952 after the end of the fiscal year5 for fy1953 congress provided all funds for operations in korea in regular defense appropriations bills table 1 shows the breakdown of total department of defense appropriations for

congress provided funding for the war in regular defense appropriations bills as soon those bills were on the calendar even before full and accurate estimates of costs could be projected subsequently the johnson and nixon administrations also requested and congress provided supplemental appropriations for operations in southeast asia for fy1966 fy1967 fy1968 and fy1969 when costs exceeded the initial estimates from fy1970 through the end of the war funding was provided only in regular appropriations bills table 2 provides yearbyyear estimate of costs an estimate of the amounts initially

from us bureau of the budget the budget of the united states government for the fiscal year ending june 30 1967 january 24 1966 note the amounts shown as being provided in regular appropriations bills are estimates made at the time by the congressional quarterly based on information from the department of defense and congressional committees those estimated amounts do not correlate directly with costs of the war that were compiled later by the dod comptroller the following is chronology of funding for operations in southeast asia in may of 1965 the administration first asked for and congress provided 700 million supplemental in the summer of 1965 the administration requested and congress agreed to budget amendment of 17 billion for vietnam in the then pending regular fy1966 defense appropriations bill in january of 1966 as troop levels in southeast asia were climbing the administration requested supplemental of 123 billion for the remainder of fy1966 and regular appropriations for operations in southeast asia of 103 billion for fy1967 both were requested when the fy1967 budget was submitted the premise of the fy1967 request was that operations might be successfully concluded by the end of the fiscal year although it was widely expected that an increase in the number of troops deployed to vietnam would be needed later the johnson and nixon administrations requested funding for operations in southeast asia in the regular appropriations bills for fy1968 crs6 and fy1969 and later requested additional supplemental appropriations for specific unfunded costs subsequently funding for operations in southeast asia was provided only in regular not in supplemental appropriations bills in sum in the case of vietnam the johnson administration asked for emergency supplementals at the onset of the war but also requested funds in regular appropriations bills as soon as those bills were on the congressional agenda even though troop levels were in flux and the duration of the conflict was not foreseen later overseas contingency operations persian gulf war of 19901991 the bulk of funding for the first persian gulf war was provided in supplemental appropriations of 42 billion for fy1991 costs declined rapidly after combat operations were over so additional funds were not needed either in supplemental or in regular appropriations bills httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22455 somalia southwest asia haiti bosnia kosovo in the early 1990s operations in somalia southwest asia including operations provide comfort southern watch and northern watch haiti and bosnia were funded annually in successive supplemental appropriations acts in action on the fy1996 defense appropriations bill however congress decided to include funding for ongoing operations in southwest asia in regular appropriations bills rather than in supplementals and it directed the administration to request funding for ongoing military operations in regular bills in the future6 subsequently in the fy1997 defense budget and in later requests the clinton administration included funding for ongoing operations including operations in southwest asia and in bosnia in the regular defense budget in action on the fy1997 defense appropriations bill congress established transfer fund called the overseas contingency operations transfer fund ocotf appropriated funds for operations in bosnia into the ocotf and required reports on transfers from the fund later funding for operations in kosovo was initially provided in supplemental appropriations bills but as soon as an ongoing peacekeeping operation was underway administrations requested and congress provided funding in regular defense appropriations bills 6 for detailed discussion of the congressional mandate that
