oth preclude suits against the gun industry history maryland and dc in 1985 the maryland court of appeals announced that it was changing the common law to hold the manufacturers and marketers of saturd ay night special handguns strictly liable to innocent persons who suffer gunshot injuries from the criminal use of thei r products kelley v rg industries inc 497 a2d 1143 1159 md 1985 this ruling changed the common law in tha t the common law holds manufacturers and sellers strictly liable liable without regard t negligence for injuries caused by products only if they are defective whether in their manufacture th eir design in that safer version of the product was feasibl at the time of manufacture or because of failure to warn users of th products hazards saturday night specials in general were not defective in any of these senses the maryland legislature howe ver overturned the court decision and maryland annotated code article 27 36ih now prohibits liability except in traditiona l circumstances or if the def endant conspired with or willfully aided or abetted the criminal who used the firearm the district of columbia city council by contrast enacted the assault weapo n manufactur ing strict liability act of 1990 dc code 62392 providing an manufactu rer importer or dealer of an assault weapon or machine gun shall be hel d strictly liable in tort without regard to fault or proof of defect for all direct an d conseque ntial damages that arise from bodily injury or death if the bodily injury or death proximately results from the discharge of the assault

bridgeport chicago mia new orleans new york newark and philadel phia are among those that have recently filed suit or plan to file suit against gun manufacturers and gun marketers these suits are based on different lega l theories but they all seek to recover the cities expenses resulting from the use of guns the expenses sought va ry among the lawsuits but include the costs of medical treatment for victims of gunshot wounds additional police protection washing blood off the streets counseling survivors of murder victims decreased property values and other things the lawsuits in general do not seek to change the common law as marylan d briefly and dc did by holding defendants strictly liable for nondefective products rather they are based on traditional legal theories such as design defect negligen t marketing public nuisance and violating local antigun laws the design defect claim s allege that guns are manufactured either without adequate locking or personalizing devices that would prevent children or other unauthorized users from firing them th negligent marketing claims allege among other things that guns are sold to stra w purchasers who purchase g uns not for themselves but for someone such as convicted felon who is disqualified from buying gun although the legal theories behind the cities gun suits are not necessaril unprecede nted the fact that cities rather than individuals are bringing these suits i s generally unprecedented though the cities gun suits were as the wall street journa l march 12 1999 noted indisputably spawned by the states suits

law its hb 189 provides the authority to bring suit and right to recover against any firearms or ammunition manufacturer trade association or dealer by or on behalf of any governmental unit shall be reserved exclusively to the state bill introduced in florida would make it crime punishable by up to five years in prison and 5000 fine for any local government official to file suit against gu n manufacturerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20126crs3 congresss response hr 1032 106 congress the firearms heritage protection act of 1999 woul dth prohibit any pending or future qualified civil liability action from being brought in any federal or state court it would define such an action as civil action brought against manufacturer or seller of firear m or ammunition or component part of either product for damages resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of the product it woul d allow such suit only if the defendant had ready been convicted of transferring firearm with knowledge that it would be used to commit violent crime hr 1049 106 congress the firearms industry responsibility enforcement actth would create federal cause of action that cou ld be brought by anyone damaged because of the discharge of firearm against the manufacturer distributor or retailer of th firearm if the firearm had been in interstate commerce and the manufacturer distributor or retailer was negligent in i ts manufacture distribution or sale the plaintiff in such an action could sue not only on his own behalf but on behalf of the political subdivision of state nd the state in which such individual resides to recover the medical and w enforcement costs of the state or political subdivision arising out of the discharge in the state or political subdivision of firearms the latter damages would be paid to the state or politica l subdivision note that the damages sought on behalf of state or politica l subdivision would be medical and law enforcement costs arising out of the discharge of firearms in th plural this suggests that single plaintiff could recover for state or political subdivision all the medical and law enforcemen t costs arising out of the discharge of all firearms that the defendant had negligently manufactured distributed or sold if plaintiff recovered these cos ts then subsequent plaintiff presumably could recover from the same defendant only such costs as arose from the defendants negligence after th injury to the first plaintiff hr 1086 106 congress the gun industry responsibility act provides in anyth civil action by state or unit of local government against manufacturer of firearms to recover damages relating to the sale distribution use or misuse of firearm the state or unit of local government may in addition to other damages recover any federa l damages associated with the claim the bill defines federal damages as th amount of damages sustained by the federal government including damages relating to medical expenses the costs of continuing care and disabilities law enforcemen t expenses and lost wages state or unit of local government seeking to recover federal damages would b required to notify the attorney general who would then have 30 days to enter n appearance in the action if the attorne general does not do so or does so but does not proceed wi th the action within six months after entering an appearance then the state or unit of government may continue to seek federal damages other wise it may not if state or unit of local government recovers federal damag then it would have to turn 13 over to the federal government hr 1233 106 congress the firearms rights responsibilities and remedies actth of 1999 would create federal cause of action on behalf of state unit of loca l government organization business or other person that has been injured by or incurred costs as result of gun violence such plaintiff would be authorized to bring suit i n federal or state court against manufacturer dealer or importer who knew rhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20126crs4 reasonably should have know that its design manufacturing marketing importation sales or distribution practices would likely result in gun violence s 560
