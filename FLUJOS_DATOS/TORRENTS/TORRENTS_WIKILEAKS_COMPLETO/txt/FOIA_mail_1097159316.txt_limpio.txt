from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to ben santer santer1llnlgov subject re more vertical profile plots date thu oct 7 102836 2004 ben thanks for the plots i gather from karl that youll be in seattle and not at the hc review ill be in seattle also and am missing the hc review so we can catch up on things last week was the first meeting of ar4 you have likely been contacted by kevin and also maybe by brian soden about writing something on tropopause heights it would perhaps be useful to send them these figures and maybe also to david parker for our chapter kevin is coordinating the ua and circulation sections im doing the surface tp and extremes and the final summary ive been too busy to think about anything yet we have mix of abilities in the but brian david p dave easterling and albert klein tank of knmi are solid the iranian argentinian romanian kenyan dont seem up to too much but this is life in the ipcc remember ebby the fact that hadcrut2v is close to pcm may be fortuitous but good nonetheless if you subsample pcm with cru coverage you say the pcm trend will reduce the paper and report with adrian shows that if you look at the full era40 surface t data then the reverse happens not large increase though most comes from the sh so there are issues of what era40 is doing over the southern oceans antarctica and australia are key ill be talking about this work in seattle i dont have any idag work to give you not done lot plan to look at the 1740 event in europe when time permits if you want any of my ppt for your idag talk you can look through in seattle good to catch up in weeks time hope you and nick are well away next week in delhi at gcos workshop cheers phil at 0150 07102004 you wrote dear jerry ram and jim here are the profiles of zonallyaveraged atmospheric temperature change that you requested as i mentioned in yesterdays email ive prepared couple of different versions of these plots first there are two different analysis periods january 1979 through to december 1999 and january 1958 through to december 1999 second temperature changes are expressed in two different ways in terms of linear trends per decade and in terms of the total linear changes over the two analysis period so there are four different vertical profile plots rwrr 1 bsanter climate 194436 oct 6 1627 ccsp_vp_lt_19791999ps rwrr 1 bsanter climate 142312 oct 6 1627 ccsp_vp_lt_19581999ps rwrr 1 bsanter climate 201997 oct 6 1643 ccsp_vp_tlc_19581999ps rwrr 1 bsanter climate 198109 oct 6 1704 ccsp_vp_tlc_19791999ps all the relevant information is encoded in the file name lt denotes linear trend and tlc denotes total linear change personally i have preference for the total linear change plots if you compare panel f the pcm all forcing case of the tlc plots for 19791999 and 19581999 the much larger total changes over the longer analysis period are visually obvious this is not the case if changes are expressed in degrees cdecade i note that as requested by roger pielke in exeter the plots are appropriately area weighted all profiles of zonallyaveraged atmospheric temperature change are ensemble means each ensemble mean was calculated from four individual realizations there is subtraction of control run drift which probably is not significant factor at this point in the perturbation experiments ive also updated the two plots that i sent you yesterday which show globalmean and tropicalmean profiles of atmospheric temperature change these plots now include observed nearsurface temperature trends estimated from hadcrut2 and hadcrutv the latter is the variance corrected version of hadcrut2 pcm all and hadcrut nearsurface temperature changes are in good agreement both for global and tropical averages im pretty sure that in the globalmean case subsampling pcm all results with hadcrut coverage would yield slightly warmer pcm all 2m temperature trend in view of the muted warming of 2m temperatures at high southern latitudes in all these areas are not well sampled in hadcrut it would be nice to show these plots of global and tropicalaverage changes in chapter 5 i think they make some useful points hope all of this is helpful with best regards ben ps id like to acknowledge the assistance of charles doutriaux and mike wehner in producing these plots considerable data processing was involved in generating these six figures benjamin d santer program for climate model diagnosis and intercomparison lawrence livermore national laboratory po box 808 mail stop l103 livermore ca 94550 usa tel 925 4222486 fax 925 4227675 email santer1llnlgov prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk
