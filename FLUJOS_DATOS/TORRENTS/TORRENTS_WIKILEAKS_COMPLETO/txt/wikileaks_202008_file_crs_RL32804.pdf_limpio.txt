unconstructive in february 2006 taiwan president chen shuibian suspended the activities of the national unification council symbol of taiwans commitment to unification with china citing in part the 2005 antisecession law as reason for his action both the prc and taiwan moves raised us concerns about crossstrait stability another matter of growing us concern was chinas increasing global reach and the consequences that the prcs expandi ng its international influence have for us interests to feed its appetite for resources china during 20052006 steadily signed trade agreements oil and gas contr acts scientific coope ration agreements and multilateral security arrangem ents with countries around the world some of which are key us allies some us observers viewed these activities as threat to

of the view that china is sincere in its desire to prevent nuclearization of the korean peninsula saw pyongyangs october test as blatant disregard for prc views and interests signal that beijing has little leverage with pyongyang and serious challenge to prc standing as credible interlocutor on the north korean issue the test was preceded several months earlier by series of missile unches that north korea conducted on july 4 2006 an event which elevated the north ko rean issue to an even more prominent position in the us political agenda with china the evolving prc reaction in th weeks following the october 9th test appeared to encapsulate the conflicting political and strategic motivations thought to affect chinas policymaking on north kor ea beijings initial reaction was unprecedentedly harsh and speculation in the press and by some american experts at the time was that the prc now would be forced to become more coercive in its north korea policy1 statement released

korea and an immediate freeze of north korean financial assets6 after the vote however china said it would not participate in inspections of north korean cargo transiting its borders out of fear such inspections would lead to conflict then reversed that position within days after heavy pressure from the united states subsequent press reports stated that chinese banks had begun blocking financial transactions with north korea7 and that chinese officials were preparing to reduce oil shipments and take other actions if north korea refused to return to the six party talks8 six party talks after over year of stalemate and months of intensive diplomacy behind the scenes sixparty talks on north koreas nuclear program began again in beijing with two meetings held in julyaugust 2005 and september 2005 with both the north korean and us sides appearing to ve moderated their agendas the talks resulted in the adoption of the first written agreement arising from the talks joint statement of principles drafted with heavy chinese involvement in the joint statement the north koreans agreed to dismantle their nuclear program and the united states and the four other participants agreed to discuss providing north korea with light water reactor at an appropriate time but in the days following the release of the joint statement it became evident that the united states and the north koreans had different vi ews about the proper sequencing and timing of these two events the fifth round of sixparty talks was held in beijing in november 20059 the road to the north korean nucl ear crisis began in october 2002 when pyongyang told visiting us officials that it was conducting uranium enrichment program in violation of its pledges under the 1994 usnorth korean agreed framework the crisis continued to esca late as the united states japan south korea and other countries suspended energy assistance to north korea and the latter withdrew from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and

accelerated us commitment for regional missile defense program to name only two but in 20052006 beijing still stopped short of promising to put furthe r pressure on north korea and continued to prop

risks of selling american energy assets to the prc11 energy economists and business repres entatives who saw the cnooc offer as economic or security threat to us interests stressed that unocals us production is small 57000 barrels day in total us output of 73 million barrels day pointed out that most of unocals production assets are in asia and committed in longterm supply contracts to the asian market and said that unocal has technology that needs to be protected for security reasons12 opponents of the deal raised concerns about us security they asserted that us oil reserves and energy companies are vital strategic assets and that the united states would be economically vulnerable if they were ow ned by communist country that unocal platforms in alaskas cook islands inlet and

as much as chevron would some state governments pressed for assurances that the proposed cnooc purchase would not adversely affect cal obligations such as environmental cleanup and pension and health care benefits14 some members of congress appeared most concerned about the potentia l security risks in the cnooc deal on june 30 2005 the h ouse approved an amendment 33392 by representative

of china released on may 24 2006 zoellicks september 2005 speech em phasized the benefits of uschina cooperation but focused on urging the prc to become responsible stakeholder to not only reap the

be reunified with china either peacefully or by force beijing has long ma intained that it has the option to use force should taiwan declare independence fro m china on december 27 2004 the prc

at all costs chinese leaders are supporting these longstanding claims with more than 700 missiles deployed opposite taiwans coast and with program of military modernization and training that defense
