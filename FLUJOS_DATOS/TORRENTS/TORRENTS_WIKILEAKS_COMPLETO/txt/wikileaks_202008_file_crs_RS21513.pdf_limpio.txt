the 2003 fall of its nemesis saddam hussein has soured since the january 15 2006 death of amir ruler jabir ahmad aljabir sabah brief succession dispute among rival branches of the ruling sabah family was resolved and the then prime minister shaykh sabah alahmad aljabir alsabah abo ut 78 the younger brother of the late amir became amir on january 29 2006 amir sabah subsequently overturned tacit agreement to alternate succession between the jabir and salem branches of the family and he appointed members of his jabir branch as his crown princeheir apparent his halfbrother shaykh nawwaf alahmad sabah age 67 and as prime minister his nephew shaykh nasser muhammad ahmad sabah age 66 the highest ranking salem in the cabinet is dr mohammad sabah who kept his foreign minister post and simultaneously is deputy prime minister tensions between the two branches of the family have since simmered although the 2006 succession crisis was handled peacefully and was unprecedented for the involvement of the elected national assembly in brokeringmediating role differences between the government and reformists in the elected national assembly have added to the tensions within the ruling family to produce continued political deadlock since the amirs death in 2006 the assembly established by kuwaits november 1962 constitution is the longest serving allelected body among the gulf monarchies fifty seats are elected and up to 15 ministers serve in it exofficio amirs of kuwait have on several occasions 19761981 1986 1992 2003 2006 used their power to dissolve the assembly when it aggressively challenged the government the assembly can vote confidence in ministers and can veto government decrees made when the assembly is not in session political parties are still not permitted but factions can compete as currents or trends kuwaitis have parallel tradition of informal political consultations in nightly diwaniyyassocial gatherings held by elites among recent assembly suspensions amir sabah did so in may 2006 when 29 opposition membersan alliance of liberals and islamistsdemanded to question the prime minister over the governments refusal to endorse proposal to reduce the number of electoral districts to 5 from the current 25 the opposition wanted to increase the size of each district so that it would be more difficult to influence the outcome through alleged vote buying or tribal politics in the june 29 2006 election the opposition which attrac ted youth support under the orange banner won 34 out of the 50 seats the election was the first in which women could vote or run but none of the 27 female candidates out of 249 won seat the schisms between the opposition and the government became irreconcilable in march 2008 when the assembly insisted on second pay raise for state employees beyond one granted by the cabinet in february 2008 as response to spiraling inflation the government refused and on march 17 2008 the cabinet resigned the amir dissolved the assembly and set new elections for may 17 2008 those elections were the first held since the reduction of electoral districts from 25 to 5 was accepted by the amir and passed into law

by one to total of five seats progovernment and other independent tr ibalists hold the remaining fourteen seats as in the 2006 election none of the 27 women candidates won seat almost immediately thereafter newly appointed cabinet caused an uproar amongst islamists who opposed the ministerial appointment of tw women the two female cabinet members are nuriya alsebih who was reappointed as the education minister after surviving january 2008 noconfidence vote and mudhi alhumoud liberal academic who was appointed as state minister for housing and administrative deve lopment another woman ms masouma mubarak who was the first female minister ever in kuwait resigned in september 2007 after some members of parliament blamed her for mismanagement in late 2008 it has been burgeoning tension between the majority sunnis and the minority shiites that has aggravated underlying political crises possibly as spillover of sectarian tensions in postsaddam iraq sectarian recriminations flared in

and municipalities fadi safar shiite was detained briefly in march 2008 and questioned over his connection to the local branch of hezbollah but formal charges were never filed in november 2008 the cabinet resigned when three sunni assembly deputies requested to question prime minister shaykh nasser over corruption allegations and his decision to permit the visit of an iranian shiite cleric who was perceived as having slighted sunnis howe ver on december 1 2008 the amir reappointed shaykh nasser as prime minister pending formation of new cabinet but he did not suspend the assembly hoping to avoid yet another early election these sunnishiite tensions have occurred even though the sabahs have expanded shiite representation in the cabinet to three ministers up from one that was customary
