products regulatory challenges summary scientists and engineers can now examine design and manipulate materials at the molecular level termed nanoscale between 1 and 100 billionths of meter the us government has invested heavily to ensure that american industry remains global leader in the field because the products of nanotechnology are seen to have great economic potential and offer possible solutions to national problems ranging from energy efficiency to detection of ag ents of biological warfare optimism about nanotechnology is tempered however by concerns about the unknown potential of nanoscale materials to harm the environment and human h ealth some have called for federal regulation of pot ential environmental human health and safety ehs risks arguing that the lack of federal ehs regulations increases the risks of unanticipated adverse consequences due to human or environmental exposure to engineered nanomaterials the cost of such consequences would depend on their actual as well as publicly perceived severity frequency and reversibility the cost to the nanotechnology industry could be gr eat if consumers responded to potential threat of harm by indiscr iminately rejecting all products of nanotechnology rather than the offending nanomaterial or an i ndividual application others oppose federal regulatory requirements arguing that they might unnecessarily delay the environmental health and economic rewards exp ected from nanotechnology questions about the need for and ideal form of nanotechnology regulations are exceedingly difficult to address given the cu

nanotechnology research as they strive to define the characteristics of nanomaterials the potential ehs risks and how they might be addressed challenges include the wide variety of nanomaterials and applica tions lack of basic inform ation about their properties lack of conventions for naming measur ing and identifying nanomaterials the proprietary nature of some critical information the need to prioritize federal resource needs and possible lack of clear stat utory authority or ppropriate regulatory framework to anticipate or respond to any identified risks for more information about the national nanotechnol ogy research agenda appr opriations and authorizing legislation see crs report rl34401 the national nanotechnology initiative overview reauthorization and appropriations issues these difficulties may be surmounted over time without significant legislative action or congre ss may choose to intervene if it does it might choose any of several approaches possible approaches include increasing funding for workshops in standardization or other research relevant to identifying and possibly ameliorating any environmental or human health nd safety concerns associated with nanomaterials changing the allocation of research money among agencies or the interagency research management structur adopting nationa l or international research strategy or enacting legislation that authorizes mandates or constrains agency actions to require information coll ection or to restrict production sale use or disposal of nanomaterials each risk management approach has potential

physical chemical and biologi cal properties of engineered nanoscale materials lend themselves to huge array of applications that some analysts believe will transform industries fost er sustainable economic grow th deliver more effective treatments for chronic diseases and vastly improve energy efficiency many nations including the united states are eager to lead this nanotechnology revolution and to reap its benefits the european union has been particularly active but there also is intense activity in japan china and other nations in the united states and some other nations enthusiasm and investment in nanotechnology are somewhat restrained how ever by questions about the possible environmental human healt h and safety ehs risks associated with this new technology does nanotechnology pose risk s to human health or the environment that are not being adequately controlled if so how will consumers here and abroad react if possible hazards are identifie d should commerce in nanomaterials or associated products be subjected to some vel of government regulation if so do federal agencies have sufficient statutory authority expertise and resources to regulate potential ehs risks of engin eered nanoscale materials and derivative products the answers to such questi ons may determine the nature timing distribution and extent of the social and economic costs and bene fits associated with nanotechnology some groups are calling on congress to re gulate engineered nanoscale materials and derivative products to control potential ehs risks arguing that lack of federal

nanotechnology nanotechnology encompasses broad range of techniques for producing and manipulating tiny particles thin films and other materials at such minute dimensions that quantum effects have measurable influence on the constituent atoms1 at this scale the basic chemical physical and biological properties of materials can vary with slight increases and decreases in dimensions between 1 and 100 billionths of meter for example slightly smaller or larger nanomaterials may be more or less magnetic or able to conduct electric currents or they may absorb and reflect different wavelengths of light thus for example nanoparticles of gold can be re d yellow or blue depending on size and shape even when the properties of nanoscale and bulk materials are similar they may be enhanced at the nanoscale because of the very high surface area of nanoparticles relative to their total volume thus for example relatively small doses of therapeutic drugs contained in nanoparticles ma be more effective than larger doses of the same drugs c ontained in larger particles nanotechnology in the united states the ability to manipulate molecules to exploit particular properties pr omises wealth

evidence that some na noparticles may be hazardous for example certain nanoparticles are known to be toxic to microbes7 and epa has reported some studies that have found nanopa rticles generally but not always are more toxic than larger particles of identical chemical composition8 other studies indicate that some nanoparticles are toxic in way that cannot be explained by differences in particle size alone9 yet such studies are rare and nanoparticles are diverse so that one study with one kind of partic may not be informative with respect to the properties of other kinds of particles moreover scientists have demonstrated that toxic nanoparticles may sometimes be made nont oxic by changing the surface chemistry of the particles for example by oxidizing the exposed atoms10 the unknown potential of individual nanomat erials to harm the environment or human health might lead to consumer re jection of the entire range of consumer products incorporating nanotechnology especi ally if consumers pe rceive that there is inadequate federal oversight as explained by one witn ess who testified before the house committee on science the per ception that nanot echnology will cause

inclusive and there are other categorization schemes but this scheme accounts for the vast majority of commercial applications in 2007 agencies also are doing research on environm ental health and sa fety applications or implications of nanotechnology12 they face many challenges including those discussed below diversity of materials and applications nanomaterials vary widely in size structure properties and atomic or molecular identities that is chemical composition some are relatively simple materials composed primarily of single element in particular crystal form ch as carbon nanotubes but even carbon nanotubes may be of various lengths and thicknesses and may be relatively pure containing few unneeded ements or contaminated by unknown substances the properties being explored or exploited by researchers and devel opers of products may result from any combination of these features which may vary from batch to batch supplied by carbon nanotube ma nufacturers or distributors13 for example carbon nanotubes may be dope d to deliberately include other substances to obtain particular electric charge or other property alternatively core nanomaterial may be coated or covered by nanoscale film embedded in plastic or otherwise modified some carbon nanotubes are specifi cally treated to prevent agglomeration into larger particles many other elements and compounds may be used to produce materials through nanoengineering and some are consider ably more complex than carbon nanotubes currently most commercial pr oducts fall into four categor ies nanotubes which may be carbon silicon or another substance metal oxides quantum dots and naturally occurring clays14 the physical electrical magne tic and other prope rties of these different materials vary due to chemical composition but also due to overall dimensions and shapes of particles some products of nanoengineering do not even consist of nanoscale materials but rather incorporate spaces that are nanoscale the risk associated with these diverse materials may depend more on the application than on the material and th potential uses of nanomaterials are countless for example because risk vari with degree of exposure risk posed by nanomaterial is likely to vary depending on whether it is embedded in plastic or some other substance that might reduce exposure is freestanding and easily dispersed through air or water or is coated with more biologically active organic molecule in order to enhance exposure moreover risks would be expected to vary throughout the life cycle of product from manufactur through use recycling treatment or disposal thus the potential risk from na nomaterial in cosmetics may be greater orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34332crs7 15 computational toxicology presumably is form of risk

erial synthesis andor preparation including continuedless than the risk of the same material washed into swimming pools or lakes in addition to the potential risks of routin manufacture use and disposal risks associated with accidental even potentially catastrophic releases should be considered this diversity means that traditional regulatory toxicology and risk assessment which typically proceed chemical by chemical would be prohibitively time consuming and expensive thus vicki colvin executive director of the international council on nanotechnology i at rice university proposes different approach which proceeds by corre lating material properties with effects on the environment and human health to determine the general factors that affect toxicity colvin calls this risk forecasting15 lack of data characterizing nanomaterials the structure and chemical composition of small sample of nanomater ials produced in laboratory can be well understood and defined at least for relati vely simple materials like buckyballs however the consistency of structure nd chemical composition within and between batches of manufactured nanomat erials varies widely it is possible to measure the numerous properties of nanomat erials but it is difficult nd expensive so properties other than the ones of partic ular interest are not known for example researchers generally do not investigate nanomaterial to determine the temperature at which it will melt or boil or the degree to which it is soluble in water or any other solvent even among researchers whose interest focuses on toxicity there is agreement about which data might be usef ul and therefore few data are collected scientists have not yet determined whic h physicalchemical pr operties for example size shape composition stability or elect ric charge will be most important in determining ecological and toxicological properties for example at recent meeting of researchers interested in studying toxicity they agreed only that it is probably most important to determine materials surface reactivity rather vague notion of how readily surface molecules comb ine with other substances to which they are exposed that would be measured in various ways depending on the material16 in addition they generated long list of pr operties of possible in terest and shorter list of properties that defin itely should be investigated before toxicity is assessed17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34332crs8 17 continued postsynthetic modifications eg neutraliza tion of ultrafine titanium dioxide particle types and

development of physical standards that is reference materials for each nanomaterial of interest physical reference standards are needed to allow identification of materials being examined without standard samples of materials for comparison materials being studied cannot be identified with precisi on making research results impossible to interpret21 vicki colvin executive director of icon has argued that experts repeatedly identify the development of standards fo r conducting and reporting research as the critical first step in ehs research for nanotechnology22 they need protocols that specify for example what constitutes toxicologically relevant dose or whether chemical purity is critical property so that research reports will provide information useful to ehs risk analysts such sta ndards could be devel oped through workshops but there is federal funding fo r such workshops she contends23 others have suggested that funding is necessary to pe rmit travel to workshops by academics and federal employees24 this concern is addressed in bills to reauthorize the nni hr 5940 as passed by the house and s 3274 as introduced proprietary nature of information much of the ongoing research and development of nanomateria ls is being conducted by private entities with an economic interest in protecting inform ation about their work these entities generally will not voluntarily reveal details about producti on processes or even the chemical composition or physical structure of their nanomaterials due to concerns about competition potential ffect of regulatory deci sions and potential liability furthermore due to the very technical and often resourceintensive nature of nanotechnology development scientists working for pr ivate entities generally are familiar with limited set of nanomaterials while one laboratory studies carbon nanotubes another might focus exclusivel on metal oxides or even on single metal oxide this means that scientists

adequate to the taskneeded to detect patterns in the rela tionships between toxicity and other characteristics of various na nomaterials without such data there is basis for building theoretical models for hypothesis testing in short the proprietary nature of nanotechnology arguably impedes the scientific study of nanoscale matter and nanotoxicology in particular by discouraging data sharing difficulty of communicating among academic disciplines only few laboratories have been able to generate data for divers categories of nanomaterials and none has access to information about the full spectrum of materials in development there is some hope how ever that scientific understanding of nanomaterials might be advanced by augm enting data on synthesized materials with available data on naturally ccurring or incidentally pr oduced nanomaterials such as those found in dust or diesel exhaust few years ago more than 500 peerreviewed publications were available on naturally occurring nanopar ticles in addition there were more than 10000 peerreviewed article s on incidental nanopa rticles that result largely as byproducts of human activitie s such as mining cooking and metal working25 on the other hand synthesized nanom aterials vary in many ways from those that are naturally occurring26 accessing data is one problem but unde rstanding the meaning of data across academic disciplines is another at an epa workshop on characterizing nanoparticles toxicologists nd physicists struggled to express their concerns to one another and admitted frankly their ignorance of the others areas27 agreement on common terminology is likely to help but the lack of commonality is deeper than terminology perhaps in time scientists collaborating routinely at interdisciplinary research centers and occasionally at work shops may help to bridge the gap limited resources there are limited federal resources available to evaluate ehs implications and regulate nanomaterials because the overall budgets of the executive agencies that are responsible for monitoring and regulating potential risks to human health and the environment have been steady or declining in recent years while the

it should be noted that given the rudimentary understanding of nanomaterials it is not surprising that relatively large portion of research funding goes to basic scientific studies such research is

ovide adequate authority for federal regulators over nanotechnology such laws were not written with nanomaterials in mind44 as result agencies woul d have to deve lop new policies produce guidance and possibly issue regulati ons to translate st atutory requirements with respect to nanomaterials these tasks almost certainly would be controversial because agencies would be making deci sions that might on the one hand delay or restrict commerce or on the other hand allow entrepreneurs to market products whose effects on health or the nvironment are unknown or uncertain one concern about existing environmental health and safety statutes is that most apply to specific category of ch emical products inte nded for particular application for example as food additive drug cosmetic pes

the act on the other hand current laws sometime s exclude certain nanomaterials from requirements for instance tsca section 8b1 clearly excludes from its requirements substances that are produced and used only in research laboratories this exclusion might apply to most of the various nanomaterials currently in existence less clearly tsca excludes nanomaterials that are not chemical substances as defined in the law48 tsca section 2 defines chemical substance as any organic or inorganic substance of particular molecular identity that is not mixture based on this definition it might not be clear whether certain nanoparticles consisting of co re inorganic material coat ed by an organic material would qualify as tsca chemical substance or mixture other nanomaterials like nanotubes or fullerenes have clear chemical identities in terms of chemical composition and crystal structure but have variable properties due to differences in size or shape of particular particles size and shape are not normally considered in identifying molecular identity or in distinguishing one chemical substance from another therefore epa has indicated that it does not consider size relevant feature under tsca4950 but of course size is central issue with nanomaterials in some cases it is the regulations rather than the statute itself that complicate agency decisions and actions with respect to nanomaterials for example laws often direct agencies to exclude from regulatory requirements small quantities of chemicals particularly chemicals not yet in commerce if the agencies define small quantities in terms of weight as epa does for purposes of the periodic tsca inventory updates nanomater ials may well be excluded because few are produced in large quantities by weight another example might be the exclusion of nanomaterials from food add itive regulations if the f ood and drug administration were to decide that they fit into category normally exempted such as that for substances

from imposing reporting requireme nts legislation might be necessary congress could direct or constrain agency action that would require manufacturers of nanotechnology materials or products to determine physical and chemical properties to conduct toxic ity tests or to report information that already is reasonably available and potentially rele vant to ehs either requirements or constraints could be pha sed into effect in order to sure that requirements would be commensurate with risk and investments by the regulated community for example increasing demands for information could be tied to the introduc tion or marketing of new applications new products or threshold quantities of products alternatively agencies might be instructed to refrain from requiring longterm and costly studies at least until certain producti on threshold is attained for some chemical substances and app lications regulatory agencies already have certain regulatory authorities for example under the toxi c substances control act tsca section 8d epa requires that manufacturers submit lists of unpublished health and safety studies known to have b een conducted and copies of such studies on request if that authority is not sufficient too broad or not clear with respect to nanomaterials tsca and other statutes could be amended alternatively reporting and testing requirements limitations or prohibitions could be included in freestanding legislation third option mig ht be to tie requirements for reporting or testing to legisla tion authorizing research funding these options might have unintended c

the potential econo mic benefits of the new technology might be more quickly realize d but the risks of unanticipated adverse consequences might be greater the co st of such consequences would depend
