violations in federally assisted programs after alexander v sandoval in alexander v sandoval 1 narrow 5 to 4 majority of the us supreme court ruled that private individuals may not sue state agencies under title vi of the 1964 civil rights act over claims of unintentional or socalled disparate impact discrimination briefly 601 of title vi enacted prohibition on discrimination because of race color or national origin in any federally assisted program or activity2 responsibility for effectuating this antidiscrimination principle was lodged with federal departments and agencies that administer federal grantinaid programs specifically such agencies are directed by 602 of the act to issue regulations and to undertake administrativ enforcement proceedings potentially leading to termination of federal funds to any noncomplying recipient whether state or local government or private program sponsor section 602 regulations of most agencies specify policies and practices of grantees that violate title vi require assurances of compliance by public or private entities seeking federal funds and provide formal procedures for complaint investigations and compliance reviews the regulations mandate compliance with nondiscrimination requirements as condition for continued funding and provide for possible termination of federal assistance to recipients who fail to comply pursuant to 602 title vi regulations of the department of justice doj and other title vi agencies prohibit not only intentionally discriminatory practices but also the use by recipients of criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination3 nearly two decades ago in guardians assn v civil service commission 4 splintered 5 to 4 majority of the justices concluded that 601 of title vi demanded proof of discriminatory intent but upheld agency implementation regulations prohibiting disparate impact discrimination under 602 justice white wrote for the majority that compensatory damages could be awarded only for intentional title vi violations and that victims of disparate impact discrimination were limited to prospective relief

and white each argued that showing disparate impact was sufficient to prove violation of 601 without showing discriminatory intent although seven justices rejected this conclusion three of them brennan blackmun and stevens joined justices marshall and white to form majority concluding that 602 permits federal agencies to promulgate regulations that prohibit disparate impact discrimination the threshold question before the court is whether the private plaintiffs in this case need to prove discriminatory intent to establish violation of title vi and the administrative regulations promulgated thereunder i conclude as do four other justices in separate opinions that the court of appeals erred in requiring proof of discriminatory intent guardians 463 us at 584 steven j dissenting joined by brennan and blackmun jj two justices rehnquist and white were persuaded that although violation might be established only equitable relief ie monetary damages is available for unintentional violations of title vi two others powell and burger believed that private remedy should be given at least four justices believed that both compensatory and prospective relief were appropriate 9see eg

york city transit authority subway and bus system the majority of whom are protected minority group members had private cause of action under title viway of dicta in alexander v choate 5 case involving 504 of the rehabilitation act of 19736 the court reiterated the guardia ns finding that actions having an unjustifiable disparate impact on minorities could be redressed through agency regulations designed to implement the purposes of title vi explaining that congress had delegated to the agencies in the first instance the complex determination of what sorts of disparate impact upon minorities constituted significant social problems and were readily enough remediable to warrant altering the practices of the federal grantees that had produced those impacts7 thus prior to sandoval an implied private right of action to enforce 601 of title vi in intentional discrimination cases had been plainly recognized by the supreme court similarly it seemed title vi agencies could take formal administrative actions to prevent practices by federal grantees that had discriminatory effect on protected minorities less certain however was whether private litigants could sue for disparate impact discrimination since the court had never explicitly held that such remedy exists under the 602 regulations8 nonetheless most federal appeals courts had allowed private rights of action to enforce title vi regulations including disparate impact9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31077crs3 1028 cfr 42104b22000at issue in sandoval was the state of alabamas englishonly policy requiring all aspects of its drivers license examination process including the written portion to be exclusively in english in rejecting mexican immigrants claim that the state policy violated title vi because of its disparate impact on ethnic minorities five justice majority ruled that congress did not intend private right of action to enforce title vi except as remedy for intentional discrimination federal regulations prohibiting state practices that have discriminatory impact regardless of intent could not provide basis for private lawsuits sandoval however did not directly confront federal agency authority previously acknowledged by the court to enforce title vi compliance administratively with rules condemning practices discriminatory in their effect on protected minority groups thus at least for now disparate impact rules like those mandating language assistance for nonenglish proficient clients of federally financed programs may still be enforced by the government just not by private litigants in addition as justice stevens emphasized in his sandoval dissent an alternative avenue of relief for title vi disparate impact claims may be available under another civil rights statute 42 usc 1983 discussed infra but given the lengths to which the court went to address an issue on which the federal appellate courts were substantially in agreement sandoval may augur future perils for substantive agency rules condemning disparate impact under title vi the sandoval decision in 1990 the state of alabama amended its constitution declaring that english is the official language of the state thereafter the alabama department of public safety implemented policy of administering drivers license examinations only in english martha sandoval representing class of nonenglish speakers filed suit arguing that the policy had the effect of discriminating against individuals because of their national origin in violation of dojs disparate impact regulations as noted those regulations promulgated under 602 bar recipients of federal grantees from utilizing criteria or methods of administration that have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race color or national origin10 both federal district court and the eleventh circuit agreed that congress created private cause of action under title vi to enforce disparate impact regulations the us supreme court in five to four decision reversed justice scalia joined by chief justice rehnquist and justice oconnor kennedy and thomas spoke for the majority justice stevens joined by justices souter ginsburg and breyer filed dissent justice scalias opinion noted that private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by congress in examining the act the court found that the private rights creating language in 601 of the act person shall be subject to discrimination is absent from 602 the text and structure of 602 focused on the regulatory role of federal agencies not the rights of persons protected or conduct of funding recipients and placed elaborate restrictions on agency enforcement and fund termination proceedings such factors militated against finding any congressional intent to create freestanding private right of action to enforce the disparate impact regulations the express provision of one method of enforcing substantive rule suggests that congress intended to preclude others justice scalia rejected argumentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31077crs4 11438 us 265 1978 1241 us 677 1979that courts had duty to effectuate the statutes purpose by providing private remedy or that 602 must be interpreted in light of the contemporary legal context of the 1964 act when implied rights of action routinely found judicial favor we have never accorded dispositive weight to context shorn of text legal context matters only to the extent that it clarifies text in essence the majority opinion embraced three basic propositions first private individuals may sue to enforce 601 and obtain both injunctive relief and monetary damages secondly the 601 remedy applies only to claims of intentional discrimination third justice scalia assumed but did not decide that although outside the scope of 601 agency regulations under 602 could validly proscribe activities that have disparate impact on racial groups but because the title vi precedents were equivocal on the point and because of considerable tension with the rule of regents of the university of california v bakke11 and guardians assn that 601 forbids only intentional discrimination the court was unwilling to permit private right of action to enforce the disparate impact regulations it is now clear that the disparate impact regulations do not simply apply 601 since they indeed forbid conduct that 601 permits and therefore clear that the private right of action to enforce 601 does not include private right to enforce those regulations nor could language of the regulation create right of action that congres s did not since agencies may play the sorcerer s apprentice but not the sorcerer himself accordingly sandoval leaves undisturbed at least for the present federal agency enforcement of title vi regulations for federal programs incorporating disparate impact or discriminatory effects standard however private actions to enforce disparate impact claims are precluded and the ultimate question of whether the doj regulation was authorized by 602 that is of the validity of disparate impact analysis in the title vi context remains open for some future review by the court justice stevens in dissenting opinion joined by justices souter ginsburg and breyer argued that cannon v universi ty of chicago12 had upheld disparate impact private causes of action under both title vi and title ix of the 1972 education amendments describing as unorthodox and haphazard the cases limiting 601 to intentional discrimination the dissent felt the court had disregarded the principle of deference to the construction of statute by the agency charged with administering it in addition the majority opinion was criticized for ignoring the contemporary context of title vis adoption which supported recognition of private rights of action implications civil rights advocates argue that many supposedly unintentional practices like the english language requirements in sandoval have discriminatory impact on racial and ethnic minorities as well as women the disabled and other protected classes other examples which have been the target of private lawsuits include racial profiling by police placing waste treatment plants or other environmentally toxic and undesired facilities in predominantly minority neighborhoods height and weight hiring standardshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31077crs5 1328

and other selection procedures in employment or education requiring plaintiffs in such cases to uncover the smoking gun of discriminatory intent these groups argue imposes an undue burden unlikely to be met on private parties seeking to enforce federal nondiscrimination standards in this respect sandoval may have broader consequences than the courts recent sovereign immunity jurisprudence because the restriction on private disparate impact enforcement actions applies with regard to all potential title vi defendants whether public or private federal grantees and not just the states in addition the decision may have significance beyond title vi applying to private suits to enforce the disparate impact regulations under other statutes such as 504 of the rehabilitation act of 197413 title ii of the americans with disabilities ada14 and the prohibition on gender discrimination in education under the education amendments of 197215 all of which have remedial provisions that refer to title vi or are comparable to it the supreme court for example has assumed without deciding that 504 covers disparate impact discrimination16 and adas title ii expressly requires that regulations be interpreted consistently with 50417 any earlier conclusions as to private right of action may now be ripe for separate reconsideration in light of each statutes peculiar legal and legislative history moreover beyond limiting private actions to enforce title vi disparate impact regulations sandoval could be read as legally undermining the validity of the disparate impact standard itself although the court assumed for purposes of deciding the case that the regulations were valid that supposition is weakened by the majoritys rationale for finding the agency rules insufficient to support private right of action the opinion states that 601 which prohibits only intentional discrimination creates private right of action for claims based on that provision alone and its implementing regulations section 602 in its view is the statutory predicate for the disparate impact regulations but may not provide authority for private right of action challenging any activity not unlawful under 601 query however if the 602 disparate impact regulations are not closely enough related to 601 to support private right of action are they sufficiently linked to the latter to be valid at all since 602 only authorizes agencies to issue rules to effectuate the provisions of 601 moreover were the court in some future case to transpose its recent 5 of the fourteenth amendment jurisprudence the implications may be foreseeable that is while congress is constitutionally empowered to prohibit acts that are not themselves violation of the equal protection clause eg unintentional acts with racially discriminatory effects any such prophylactic congressional legislation or agency rules under title vi must be congruent and proportional to actual violations found to exist18 this standard could put most agency disparate impact regulations in some constitutional jeopardyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31077crs6 19121 s ct at 1530 n 13 stevens j dissenting 20id at 152021 21id at 1523 22145 f supp2d 505 dnj 2001a question left unanswered by sandoval is whether there may be an alternative statutory route for redressing claims of disparate impact discrimination in federally assisted programs justice stevens dissent indicated that plaintiffs in the case had separate cause of action under 42 usc 1983 reconstructionera civil rights law permitting private individuals to sue governmental officials or others acting under color of law for violation of any right privilege or immunity secured by the federal constitution or laws it remains unsettled however whether 1983 reaches violations of agency regulation s and the sandoval majority did not address the issue moreover 1983 claims require showing that any alleged deprivation of federal right was perpetrated by state actors so that discrimination by private organizations receiving federal funds though subject to title vi would not be covered allowing 1983 action therefore could lead to the arguable anomaly of making title vi disparate impact regulations enforceable against governmental defendants but not private recipients of federal largesse another approach perhaps is suggested by the dissents assertion that facially neutral actions having disparate impact may be evidence of intentional discrimina tion19 which remains actionable even in the majoritys view justice scalia on the other hand appears to invite clear statement rule as the test for private causes of action against states and perhaps nonfederal state actors generally20 which could pose an added limitation on both title vi and 1983 actions and the majority opinion foreshadows another argument that by providing for administrative termination of funds for disparate impact violations 602 may evidence congressional intent to preclude any private right of action21 nonetheless since sandoval us district court in new jersey has determined that 1983 action is appropriate for private individuals to enforce environmental justice claims pursuant to title vi regulations of the environmental protection agency in south camde n citizens in action v new jersey department of environmental protection 22 citizens group sued the state environmental agency for issuing an air permit to cement facility in predominantly minority community less than week before the supreme court decided sandoval the district court granted the plaintiffs request for preliminary injunction ruling that the agency failed to consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the operation of the proposed facility and that plaintiffs established prima facie case of disparate impact discrimination based on race and national origin in violation of epa regulations under 602 south camden did not involve any claims of intentional discrimination in light of sand oval the south camden court reconsidered its prior ruling but found that private citizens may still enforce the 602 disparate impact regulations through 1983 action in so holding the court noted that justice scalia acknowledged that the validity of the 602 regulations themselves were not contested in alexander but were instead presumed to be valid furthermore the court observed that there was critical distinction between congress intent to create private right of action under 602 of the act which the sandoval court found did not exist and the very differenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31077crs7 23pl 102166 105 stat 1071 1991question of whether congress intended to create such remedy under 1983 therefore the south camden court concluded that the sandoval ruling was limited to foreclosing private rights of action under 602 the approach taken by the south camden court necessarily depends on the validity of the 602 disparate impact regulations an issue explicitly questioned but not decided by the supreme court in sandoval until the high court revisits the question and determines whether or not these regulations exceed statutory authority provided by title vi the future of disparate impact claims based on unintentional discrimination whether in the context of englishonly rules environmental justice or otherwise remains uncertain of course because the issue is one of statutory rather than constitutional interpretation congress may address it as it did when it responded to series of court decisions narrowing the scope of federal equal employment opportunity law with passage of the civil rights act of 199123
