markets evaluating some risks the us may face summary the last 30 years have seen rapid expa nsion of trade in goods and assets and general rise of economic interdependen ce across the world economy globalization is the popular term given to this ongoing pr ocess to most economists globalization is seen as force that enhances the power of the market and gives greater scope for realizing the gains from trade this is an enriching process with improved economic wellbeing growing out of increased speci alization of world production and elevated economic efficiency to others however globalization is seen as clear threat to their economic wellbeing pe rceived to be retarding the growth of worker wages increasing wage inequality undermining domes tic social relations and raising the exposure of the american economy to foreign economic contagion the 108th congress is likely to have to focus attention on trade liberalization initiatives with singapore nd chile and perhaps the free trade with the americas initiative each of these initiatives will likely raise the heat under these simmering issues with globalization the concern that expanding trade erodes the wages of american workers stems from the observation of two recent trends in us wage behavior one there has been significant slowdown in the rate of adva nce of worker real wages two there has been marked increase in the inequality of wages between skilled and lessskilled workers this report suggests however that there is likely little causality running from rising level of trade to poor domes tic wage performance slow average wage growth is fully and credibly linked to poor productivity growth small share of rising wage inequality can be linked to trade but most of this trend appears to be more soundly rooted in rising demand for skilled workers nevertheless there are i ndustries and workers advers ely affected by expanding trade in these circumstances an increasingl urgent concern is that as more trade occurs with countries that do not play by the same economic and social rules as the us there will be steady undermining of the economic position of workers in the us and the undermining of important soci conventions and institutions that frame the terms for acceptable economic competition there is strong sentiment that there is difference between economic gains generated by comparative advantage based on factor endowments or consumer preferen ces and gains generated by comparative advantage based on institutiona l choices in the exporting country that conflict with the norms of the importing country where trade with country that has different social standards inflicts economic harm on domestic workers the case can be made that trade liberalization cannot be treated as an end in itself without regard to how it affects broadly shared values at home the economic benefits of larger and more integrated international capital flows are significant but increased crossborder capital flows also carry the elevated risks of contagion from negative foreign economic shocks and financial market instability the size orderliness and resiliency of us financial markets leave the us well disposed to take full advantage of the benefits of these asset flows with minimum of riskhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30891contents introduction 1 g l b l i z t i n n d u s w g s2 g l b l i z t i n n d t h v r g l

interdependen ce across the world economy globalization is the popular term given to this ongoing process in the united states the real volume of trade in goods has grown twice as fast as real output bringing total trade exports plus imports from about 10 of gross domestic product gdp in 1970 to 28 in 2001 trade in assets eg ba nk accounts stocks bonds and real property has grown even faster with crossborder asset transactions for example rising by multiple of nearly 220 5 billi on to 1123 billion between 1970 and 2001 the united states has been much involve d in this process of globalization both as leader in securing successive rounds of trade liberalization and the establishment of the world trade organization wto as well as an active participant in world trade as in the past many would expect the us to play pivotal role in any further opening of the global trading system without us leadership many believe that the prospect of successful multilateral liberalization would likely be nil at the same time however u s trade policy makers had and will likely continue to face substantial domestic backlash against fu rther moves toward globalization recent manifestations of this tre nd have been an eight year hiatus before congress againhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30891crs2 1 fasttrack refers to procedures initiated under the enactment of trade act of 1974 to implement trade agreements negotiated by the president those procedures established mandatory deadlines limited debate and amendment requirement on congressional deliberation of trade agreements this aut hority expired in 1994 and was not renewed until 2002 see c rs report rs20039 fasttrack implementation of trade agreements issues for the 107th congress by lenore sek granted presidential fasttrack authority1 and major political initiative to seek new protection for the steel industry trade initiatives with chile and singapor and perhaps the free trade for the americas initiative will likely come before the 108th congress these moves towards freer trade can be expected to raise th heat under number of simmering concerns over the effect of expanding trade and trade policy responses on the us economy what are the burdens of rising tide of imports on the american worker what standing should concerns bout labor and environmental standards have in trade liberalization initiatives what are the risks to economic stability of the near explosive growth of crossborder asset flow s questions such as these are likely to be central to upcoming policy debates over the united states role in an ever more globalized economy to most economists globalization is seen as force that enhances the power of the market and gives greater scope for realizing the gains from trade this is an enriching process with improved econo mic wellbeing growing out of increased specialization of world production and evated economic efficiency to others however globalization is seen as clear threat to their economic wellbeing perceived to be retarding the growth of worker wages increasing wage inequality undermining domestic social relations nd raising the exposure of the american economy to foreign economic contagion there can be doubt that market forces in the process of raising the economic wellbeing of the nation may worsen the p light of many subgroups the free market as the economist joseph schumpeter noted is force for creative destruction markets create wealth by continually reallocating resources to more efficient uses that increase total wellbeing but that process of reallocati on must also destroy inefficient uses of resources deteriorating the economic circumstances of those whose job or business is eliminated or downgraded critical dimension of successful market economy is how well it manages the achievement of higher efficiency and the adjustment of those hurt by these dynamic wealthcreating forces much popular and political debate about globalization however is heavily shaded with the image of rising international tr ade particularly with lowwage developing economies that do not compete fairly as threat to the us workers economic wellbeing in addition great er asset market integra tion raises the specter of economic and financial instability abroad quickly spreading harm to the united states for many it would seem globalization is felt to be more destructive than creative this report will examine three prominen t concerns about gl obalization and us economic performance one the effect of tr ade on worker wages particularly thosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30891crs3 2 for further discussion of these trends see murphy kevin m changes in wage structure in the 1980s how can we explain them mo university of chicago 1992 and also crs report 97142e earnings inequality in the 1980s and 1990s by gail mccallionof lessskilled workers two the question of trade and fairness namely trade with countries that have much lower worker nd environmental standa rds and three the expanding crossborder trade in assets and the risk of fi nancial and economic instability globalization and us wages the concern that expanding trade erodes the wages of american workers stems from the observation of two recent trends in us wage behavior coincident with rising globalization one there has been significant slowdown in the rate of advance of worker real wages for example between 1980 and 2001 real hourly compensation in the business sector had relatively slow cumulative increase of 243 two there has been marked increas in the inequality of the distribution of wages between skilled and lessskilled workers as measured by education levels for example the difference between the earnings of the college educated and those with high school education ro about 20 between 1970 and 20002 trade can have strong effects good nd bad on worker wages the plight of the worker adversely affected by imports comes quickly to mind on the other hand workers in industries that ex port benefit from expanding trad what is perhaps less well understood is that because all workers are also consumers they will benefit from the expanded market choices and wer product prices that trade provides there is necessary reason to assume that the overall effect of trade on workers is bad but sound economic analysis also suggest s that trade even as it raises overall wellbeing can also sharply alter the distri bution of income among the several factors of producti on including labor this section of the report first evaluates critically whether an increasing level of trade and interdependence has played role in the slow growth of the average level of real wages of american workers and then examines whether rising globalization has made the distribution of worker wages more unequal globalization and the average level of wages effect of relative labor abundance we consider first whether an expanding level of trade is responsible fo r slow average real wage growth economic theory suggests that increased trade wh ile making the overall economy better off can have strong effects on the distribution of income among factors of production that theory points to the possibility that if bor is relatively more abundant in the rest of the world than at home an expansion of trade with the rest of the world could increase the effective supply of worker s to the us economy and reduce worker wages relative to rewards paid to othe r factors of producti on most importantly capital since trade has clearly raised th living standard of the country general decline in the real wage of us workers would have to mean that labors share of the economic pie has shrunk this has not occu rred however labors share of nationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30891crs4 3 the white house economic report of the president february 2001 p 306 4 see us department of commerce bure au of economic analysis survey of current

activity vol 2 washington brookings institution 1993income shows significant trend up or down over the past four decades typically falling between 68 and 72 depending on the year examined3 effect of the terms of trade real living standards depend not only on workers share of domestic production but also on their ability to exchange that output for foreign output ie to realize ga ins from trade that gain can be eroded if import prices rise faster than home prices causing fall in the real purchasing power of any given level or share of national income the ratio of us export prices to import prices the terms of trade is measure of changes in the home economys share of the gains from trade it is plausible that expanding trade in world economy increasingly populated w ith technologically capable foreign producers could have put downward pressure on us export prices reduced the terms of trade and lowered the real wages of workers the data do not support that scenario however the terms of trade di d fall in the 1970s but the cumulative effect on real income was relatively small less than 2 decline over the decade through the 1980s and the 1990s the us rms of trade have slowly risen tending to increase worker real wages rather than erode them4 effect of the trade deficit what about our persis tent large trade deficits over the last 18 years have they dampened worker wage growth first trade deficits are not symptom of globalization and rising level of trade rather they are mainly consequence of domestic macr oeconomic behavior such as high rate of domestic investment relative to dom estic saving that has pushed domestic spending beyond domestic production requiri ng net inflow of goods trade deficit to sustain the excess domestic spe nding as such these trade deficits do not represent reduction in domestic output nor reduction in the demand for labor second even if the trade deficits had redu ced domestic output the size of those trade deficits and the potential scale of the effect on domestic labor markets is far too small to explain the slow growth of american real wages5 evidence from us multinationals the recent behavior of us multinational manufacturing companies gives some added confirma tion that there has not been any sharp swing in the demand for labor away from domestic sources and toward foreign sources it is estimated th at us multinational firms account for about half of all domestic manufact uring employment making them good barometers of trends in the tradeable goods sector par ticularly if those trends are reflective of changing economic attractiven ess of different countries as locations for production if lowwage countries provide significant cost advantage then we would expect to see shift of employment from the domestic parent to these foreign affiliates the data reveal however that multinational manufacturing employment has fallen both at home and abroad between 1977 and 1993 domestic employment in these firmshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30891crs5 6 for these data and discussion of this phenomenon see lawrence robert z globalization and trilateral labor markets the trilateral commission 49 p 32 7 see lawrence robert and matthew slaughter op cit and lawrence robert z and robert litan globaphobia the wrong debate over trade policy the brookings institution washington 1998fell about 21 or about 26 million jobs while employment in their plants in the rest of the world fell 17 or about 830000 jobs if we look at manufacturing affiliates in only deve loping countries employment did increase about 5 or about 85000 jobs but these gains amount to less than 4 of the reduction of domestic manufacturing employment this implies that the multinationals us workers have maintained their relative productivity conse quently there is great outrush of us multinational firms to increase employment in their lowwage affiliates at the expense of their domestic counterparts6 effect of slow productivity growth if rising level of trade is not the culprit behind slight real wage growth wh at is we know that wages are basically function of how productive workers are high levels of productivity output per worker are associated with high wages and rapid productivity growth is associated with rapid wage growth therefore it is highly credible that the sharp slowdown in average productivity growth since the early 1970s in the united states is the cause of slow wage growth over the same period measures of us worker compensation appropriately deflated usin g price index for the goods workers produce gives measure of inflation adjusted or real compensation that moves in step with the trend path for productivity over the last 25 years in other words workers share of the economic pie is not getting smaller the pie is just not growing as fast as it once did underscoring the importance of productivity growth for wage growth more rapid productivity advance evident since 1997 has b een associated with more rapid growth of real compensation7 globalization and the inequality of wages the effect of relative suppli of labor on wage inequality even if expanding international trade has not adversely affected the average level of wages it can still have distorting effect on the distribution of wages among workers labor is not homogeneous resource and market forces including trade can help one class of worker while hurting another in recent years wages have been steadily skewed in favor of highskilled workers relative to lowskilled workers it is conceptually possible that expanding trade particularly with c ountries that have relative abundance of lowsk illed workers will tend to increase the effective supply of lowskilled workers availabl to the us economy and thereby put downward pressure on the wages of lowskilled workers in america other forces unrelated to trade could give the same outcome however for example strong general increase in the demand for skilled workers presumably growing out of the evolving pattern of final demand increased demand for skillintensive products and the nature of technological ch ange requires higher and higher inputs of skill what does the evidence show this remains an area of some contention yet the weight of evidence from most careful studies suggests that trade has been minor factorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30891crs6 8 see cline william r trade and wage inequality institute for international economics washington dc 1997 and borjas george nd richard b freeman lawrence f katz

in wage inequality8 for international trade economists looking at this issue critical bit of evidence regarding trades effect on the distribu tion of wages is the behavior of the prices at which goods trade foreign workers do not compete with home workers directly but indirectly through the price of the goods they produce if foreign lowwage workers provide an efficiency advantage over domestic workers then that advantage must through trade manifest itself as lower price of the foreign goods in the home market reduced profitability of the domestic industry that competes with the low price import induces reallocation of resources toward more profitable skill intensive applications and general decrease in the demand for and wage of domestic lowskilled workers in this chain of causation the critical factor is not the volume of trade but rather traded goods pr ices this leaves us with the empirical question have the prices of import comp eting goods that use lowskilled workers intensively fallen relative to the price of goods that use highskilled workers intensively with appropriate deference to data problems rela tive prices have not moved in pattern consistent with the conjecture that trade has adversely affected lowskilled domestic workers9 in some cases there is evidence that this critical price ratio has moved in the opposite direction in direction cons istent with trade helping lowskilled workers relative to highskilled workers reasons for trades limited effect on wage inequality t h t globalization has so far d relatively minor effect on the level and distribution of us worker wages is perhaps less surp rising if one consid ers that despite the sizable growth of trade with lowwage veloping countries such trade still remains relatively minor component of total us trade and is particularly small when compared to the total size of the us economy imports from countries where wages are less than half of us wages was qual to 26 of gdp in 1990 up only slightly from 18 in 196010 by and large for the united states the great bulk of trade in manufactures is with other highwage econo mies it has been estimated that in 1990 the tradeweighted average hourly manufacturing wage of us trade partners was 88 of that in the united states not rge enough difference to cause the observed change in wage inequality11 thus trades impact on the domestic labor market can also be expected to be small this is reinforced by the data on us multinationals employment changes in recent years that is those data are also consistent with thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30891crs7 12 see krugman paul growing world trade causes and consequences brookings papers on economic activity 1 1995 13 see grilliches zvi capitalskill complementarity review of economics and statistics no465 1967 p51notion that there has been differential shift of employment toward lowskilled foreign workers and away from lowskilled domestic workers an upper bound for trades effect on wage inequality of course as trade with developing countries grows so might its contribution to wage inequality economic analysis suggests however that there may be an upper bound to this potential effect and that it could be reached fairly quickly as the cost differences between home and foreign pr oduction widen it is credible that condition of complete specialization might be reached after only relatively small price disadvantage appears that is the united states would find it most efficient to stop producing the import competing goods as increased specialization leads to trade in noncompeting sectors if there is domestic industry that uses lowskilled labor intensively in the production of tradeable goods there can be downward pressure on us wages caused by trade with developing countries12 it is also important to be mindful that trade can also set in motion other forces that can have favorable effect on all domestic workers for example econo mies of scale can be more fully realized through expanding trade further trade may heighten competition and raise efficiency such forces may be strong enough to allow all f actors of production to see their real return rise what is causing wage inequality many economists argue that biased technological change likely is the primar cause of rising u s wage inequality modern production techniques ve generally raised the demand for skill in the labor market in effect skill is suspected of becoming more complementary to capital and lessskill more of substitute for capital thus the process of capital accumulation and technological change will tend to raise the wage of skilled labor and to lower the wage of lowskilled labor13 other minor causes might be immigration deunionization and falling real minimum wage so far the evidence does not give full picture of the na ture and extent of this process trade and fairness even though the evidence is that trad has had little overall effect on wages in the united states there are industries nd workers adversely affected by trade expansion their plight gives rise to the c oncern that trade with countries that do not play by the same economic and social ru as the united states can undermine the economic position of us workers wo rse it can undermine important social conventions and institutions that frame the terms for acceptable economic competition most importantly this include s labor standards th at set rules for minimum age maximum hours health and safety norms as well as collective bargaining rights and envir onmental standards that regula industries use of land air and water employers in many deve loping countries it is observed do not meet labor standards common in dvanced countries nor are they subject to the samehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30891crs8 14 the discussion in this section dr aws extensively on rodrik dani has globalization gone too far institute for international economics washington dc 1997costly environmental standards of the advanced nations the cost advantages afforded by these lower production sta ndards it is argued will steadily put competing american industries and most often lowskilled american workers at major disadvantage as well as erode tablished domestic social relations from the standpoint of economic gain or loss does such unfair competition matter cheaper product regardless of how it was made cheaper is an overall gain to the importing economy it is certainly possible for those who gain to compensate those who lose and still be better off ad equate compensation in practice is most often problematic however of course the loss to the displaced worker in the import competing industry is the same whether caused by unfair foreign practices or state of the art technologi cal prowess yet the former is often seen to be far less acceptable14 under what circumstances does fairtrade represent valid argument against free trade there are three possible situations while the economic case argues against restriction in all three cases the degree to which other social requirements are met varies when trade conflicts with domestic social norm for many people the acceptance of the gains from trade will hinge on whether those gains emerge from process where all trading parties adhere to social norms of fair play for example different child labor rules can fford basis for trade the united states with long held restrictions on child labor in its domestic practices can find it economically beneficial to trade with count ry that has low level or restriction against child labor lower child labor standards could give production cost advantage to the foreign producer if the exports of the low labor standards country compete directly with us industries th price advantage of those lower standards will encourage higher level of imports to the united states these imports will come at the expense of domestic production us workers in the affected industry will lose jobs with time these workers may find new jobs but most likely at lower wage in the aggregate both nations are economically better off through this exchange but the distribution of income has been changed in the united states as the income of the import competing workers falls is this an acceptable outcome or should trade policytariffs quotas etc be used to protect the affected domestic workers from this outcome the hard core economic response would be that this is an acceptabl outcome and that the use of trade policy to alter it would be inefficient reducing the gains from trade hurting domestic consumers and hurting workers in the fore ign export industry it may be concluded that the harmed american workers can be more efficiently helped with income transfers and adjustment assistance the gains from trade are large enough to compensate the displaced workers nd still leave everyone better off while this is certainly an efficient outcome it is however an outcome that likely violates prevailing social norm ie domestic adult workers should not havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30891crs9 15 possible exception would be in stances of dumping that are predatory and part of plan to establish monopoly power such predat ory practices reduce economic welfare in the longrun and preventing them is in our economic interest however predatory pricing appears to be rare to compete against child labor and will be seen as unacceptable to many if it is unacceptable to have child labor in purely domestic context why would it be acceptable to have domestic workers living standard reduced by competing indirectly through trade with countries with mo re lax child labor laws the overriding sentiment in this circumstance is that there is difference between gains from trade generated by comparative advantage based on factor endowments or consumer preferences and trade generated by comparative advantage based on institutional choices in the exporting country that conflict with the norms of the importing country in this circumstance where trade with country with different social standards inflicts economic harm on domestic workers the case can be made that trade liberalization can not be treated as an end in itself without regard to how it affects broadly shared values at home economic activity occurs in social and moral context which tells us that there are unacceptable ways of imposing burden on fellow citizens in concept trade restriction can be justified in this case to protect the strongly held social norm in practice however under the rules of the world trade organization wto it would be imp roper to use trade policy to curtail imports from countries using child labor b ecause wto rules while prohibiting trade in products made by prisone rs generally do not allow discrimination on the basis of the mode of production of course wto rules do have the so called escape clause mechanism that allows seeking relief from damage caused by certain types of import surges we can imagine an elaboration of the escape clause mechanism that could be used for providing relief from dama ge done by unacceptable modes of foreign production in its current form however wto rules governing the use of that mechanism provide very limited scope for using trade restrictions and has been little used by member nations when trade does not conflict with domestic social norm when trading partners have essentially the same economic and social framework there may be another commonl cited unfair trade practice foreign dumping of exports dumping is the selling of good fo r price that is less than the cost of production economic analysis clearly demons trates that the lower price of the dumped import raises overall economic wellbeing in th importing country but particular workers and firms that comp ete with the imported product will likely be hurt is this like the childlabor case bove situation where an alleged unfair practice is violating domestic social norm and therefore an appropriate target for restrictive trade policy price cutting is not generally seen as violating strongly held domestic social norm rather price cutting is most often basic element of competition in the market place that serves efficiency and overall wellbeing and is widely practiced in the domestic economy15 wto rules make provision for nations using trade restrictions as part of an antidumping policy becau it is relatively easy to invoke an antihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30891crs10 16 see rodrik opcit p 82dumping safeguard mechanism has been wi dely and often used device for seeking relief from surging imports that are harming particular workers and firms in the home economy many economists argue that th antidumping safeguard mechanism is being greatly overused rodrik for example believes there has been excessive use of the antidumping procedure which s ubverts the trade regime gives safeguards bad name and crowds out an effective outlet for legitimate concerns16 industries harmed by dumping however believe such measures are necessary to preserve level playing field trade without effect on th distribution of income the fairness issue takes somewhat different form if im ports from country with lower social standards do not compete with any domestic industry in this circumstance there is effect on the distribution of income in the us nor are there any harmed domestic workers objections to trade with these nations must arise out of humanitarian concerns for foreign workers and citizens if s then the standard economic argument against the use of restrictive trade policy to attempt to force more humanitarian outcomes abroad may have more resonance restrictive trade policies in this case do not protect any domestic practice nor remove any economic burden they will however lower economic welfare at home and abroad foreign workers in the exporting country would most likely be rmed as reduced demand for the products they produce pushes them out of job or at best into some inferior alternative those who acknowledge such values but oppos using trade restrictions may argue that other mechanisms would be more efficient response direct technical or financial assistance for examples might be tter serve raising labor and environmental standards than would restrictive trade po licy others holding these values who believe access to the us market is pot ent incentive for moderating other countries behavior often advocat trade restraints reconciling economic efficiency and social fairness resolving questions of fairness is likely to be central to any continuation of the process of trade liberalization among nations negotiations aimed at increasing global market integration will likely be concerned with issues that extend well beyond differences at the border to include domestic social and political arrangements in such cases policy res ponses based only on an economic basis are very likely to be insufficient yet the current wto rules governing international trade do not provide an efficient mechanism for reconciling often divergent economic and social goals the failure of the wto meetings in seattle in december of 1999 has meant that there is clear vi sion of how and when future multilateral trade negotiations would proceed overcoming th is state of drift in the world trading system may require the us to take pivotal leadership role in shaping vision for the world economy in contemplating that future form several points drawn from the discipline of economics and the insights of political ec onomy might be useful first economics makes clear that the very existence of gains from trade arises from some economically exploitable difference if all nations were like in resource endowmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30891crs11 and social institutions there would be little reason to trade crucial question underlying the efficacy of trade and continue d market integration is what differences particularly in social norms are an acceptable basis for mutually beneficial trade second the power of the market to bring steady economic improvement does not grow out of good intentions rather it is the quite unint ended consequence of entrepreneurs pursuing their own self interest and seeking profit from what small advantages might exist in developi ng economy in many poor nations the acceptability of having children work long hours and of denying labor the right to collective bargaining may be the only way they perceive to produce tradeable good today and improve economic wellbeing in the future third the united states and other adva nced nations have an interest in improving economic conditions in poor nations rising pr osperity helps to undergird political and social stability but it also likely enhances the willingness and ability of these nations to adopt higher bor and environmen tal standards finally to some degree concerns about unfair trade might be allayed if harmed workers in the us were more c onfident of receiving equitable compensation and other adjustment assistance insura nce against adverse labor market outcomes has been part of social bargain in the us and other advanced countries that has enabled these nations to make fuller use of the wealth creating potential of the market economy including trade liberalization if further global market integration is to occur it may be necessary to reevaluate the sufficiency of our social insurance programs expanding trade in assets and the risk of instability capital markets have achie ved higher degree of globalization than has goods trade and carry somewhat distinct set of potential problems and policy concerns the extent of capital market integration is evident in the huge increases in cross border flows in most financial realms ove r the last 22 years these include bank deposits securities stocks and bonds and fore ign exchange beyond their size asset transactions are far more fluid than goods transactions able to move quickly and change direction just as quickly the economic benefits of international capital flows are significant the presence of well functioning international asset markets can extend the benefit of international trade well beyond the gains associated with the exchange of goods and services international capital markets can facilitate more efficient allocation of saving and investment across nations allowing an optimal spreading of consumption spending over time international trade in assets can also enable greater diversification of investme nt portfolios leading to reduced investor risk in conjunction with flexible exchange rates high capital mobility also enhances the power of monetary policy and alters how monetary forces are transmitted and distributed through the economy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30891crs12 17 for further discussion see international capital markets developments prospects and key policy issues imf september 1998 increased capital market integration also carries risks one risk is that with more points of economic and financial contact there is also raised probability for the inward transmission of negative economic shocks sometimes called contagion effects another risk is seen arising from the great size and fluidity of asset markets themselves which give them the potential to be destabilizing and able to generate periodic economic crises the unsettling prospect in this regard is that in the current international financial system with large volumes of highly mobile international capital an economy is open to assault by currency speculators who may incite excess volatility of exchange rates and other ssets and impose economic instability and hardship on the us economy exposure to external shocks increased interdependence increases the points of contact among the economies of the world most often these enhanced linkages are positive construct that help raise economic efficiency but from time to time they can play negative role as conduits for economic contagion with increased globalization economic maladies on the other side of the world will spread more quickly perhaps bringing undeserved economic misfortune to us citizens expanding trade in goods and assets nd the associated increase of global market integration will increase the ri sk of economic shocks carrying from one economy to another in practice however such shocks are seldom carried from the initiating country to others on the same s cale this attenuation of the transmitted shock is largely due to differences in econo mic size and to differences in the degree of integration the us is far larger then any single trading partner further trade for the us is small share of total economic activity taken together these two factors most often assure that foreign economic calamity has small ripple effects on the united states of course these factors can be expected to exert less and less of an attenuating effect as trade interdependence and the relative size of our trading partners grows but there are other forces that will likely work to attenuate the impact of foreign economic shocks factors that dampen international shocks first well functioning markets will provide automatic offsets to external shocks through movement of exchange rates interest rates and pr ices second quickly responding and prudently applying economic policy most often monetary policy can help to mitigate the effects of external shocks third factor attenuating the impact of external shocks is that increased global integration also allows shocks to be absorbed by far larger global market thereby arguably reducing the effect on any individual economy fourth to the extent they provide more rapid and more comprehensive flow of market information about risk and profita bility of investment prospects around the globe integrated asset markets help facilitate quicker adjustment to disruption and more efficient allocation of the worlds limited saving in both the shortrun and the longrun17 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30891crs13 for the united states in particular fi nancial markets have breath and depth that affords high degree of resiliency to financial and ec onomic storms recent troubles in asia highlight the problems that large flows of financial capital can pose for systems that have relied too heavily on the banking system for financial intermediation and have not adequately regulated and s upervised that system in contrast the us financial system empl oys an array of well developed financial intermediaries stock markets bond ma rkets and banks that achieve higher proficiency at risk management and subjects those institutions to high level of regulation and supervision impact of the asian economic crisis on the united states in recent years the american econom has prospered despite substantial economic ills in japan europe and mexico nor have troubles in seve ral asian countries had sizable effect on the united states during these crises the us has maintained vigorous economic growth achieved reco rd low levels of unemployment and avoided any reacceler ation of inflation the asian crisis did have an impact however in that it contributed to substantial widening of the us trade deficit sizable inflows of asian capital seeking high and more certain us asset yields pushed up the dollar exchange rate weakening exports and encouraging imports several tradeable goods sectors of the economy were hurt by these changes on the export side agriculture and commercial aircraft experienced damped export sales on the import side the steel industry and the textile and apparel indus tries came under considerable pressure from low price competition from the cris esaffected countries on the other hand there have been econo mic benefits derive d from that crisis lower import prices have elevated real income in the united states and dissipated inflation pressures in add ition large capital inflows have kept domestic interest rates lower than they otherwise would be boon to us borrowers and interest sensitive sectors such as housing and consumer durables weighing risk and reward increased global in tegration probably does raise the exposure of the us economy to ex ternal shocks but such integration also boosts the rewards to the economy through imp roved efficiency so far there is conclusive evidence that the added risk exceeds the added reward while individual sectors were hurt the overall us economy weathered recent inte rnational financial storms with little difficulty and some benefit moreover we have seen that the prudent application of domestic macroec onomic policy can do much to assure that on balance the rewards from this ongoing process continue to exceed the economic risks asset price volatility and periodic misalignments beyond their potential for transmitting ec onomic shocks inte grated financial markets themselves can be the source of problems specifically those markets may produce excess volatility of asset prices most importantly exchange rates causing economic disruption and costly adjustment because exchange rates communicate important economic signals to those involve d in international tr ade and investment the argument can be made that any tendency for foreign exchange markets

971021 the asian financial crisis by dick k nantooverreact to events will transmit confusin g and errorfilled data to international traders and investors causing misallocation of global resources has volatility been excessive it is difficult to determine what constitutes excessive volatility where one person perceives volatility and disruption another sees global asset markets workin g quickly and usefully in response to changes in econom ic fundamental s that affect risk and profitability whether international asset markets overr eact and whether such overreaction carries more costs than their efficiency benefits warrant is an open question while exchange rates have in recent years appeared to be rather volatile evidence does not point to significant increases in the variability of other asset prices and even the increase in exchange rate volatility has not been conclusively shown to be excessive in the sense that it has gone beyond what could be attributable to an efficient market function18 the currency crisis of seve ral asian countries in the late 1990s highlights these issues the international capital market clearly induced sharp and painful depreciations of the foreign exchange valu of those countries currencies yet what is also increasingly evident is that th countries were pur suing questionable macroeconomic policies had suspect banking and financ ial practices and promoted imprudent exchange rate ma nagement regimes international asset markets serve economic efficiency by reacting quickly and strongly when evidence of bad fundamentals emerges19 thus globalization and rapid capital flows in this view have positive role in limiting the ab ility of countries to pursue incompatible and unsound economic and financial policies on the other hand to the extent that there is degree of overreaction by currency and other asset traders it is possible that economies will be forced through measure of unnecessary adjustment in such cases there are international adjustment mechanisms for assistance an economic role of the international monetary fund imf for example is to provide adjustment aid to help weather international financial crises but we might keep in mind that the economic purpose of imf assistance in such circumstances is not to bailout enterprises generally rather it is to offset the unnecessary adjustments forced by the currency markets overreaction it is possible that the global markets in conjunction with well targeted economic assistance may be workable nd efficient mix enhancing the operation of the world economy and providing indirect benefit to the us as it improves the wealth and stability of our economic neighborhood the problem of asset price misalignment more critical issue for the united states and other industr ial economies in an interna tional environment of large and rapid capital flows is the pros pect of asset prices becoming misaligned that is straying and remaining for time well beyond level that is consistent with underlying economic fundamentals this wa s likely true for the dollar in the 1984 85 period for the us stock market just prior to the crash in 1987 and for the japanese yen in 1995 such misalignmen ts often impose disp roportionate burdenshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30891crs15 on sectors of the economy eg exchange rate impacts on tradeable goods sectors and their correction is potentially disruptive to the wider economy eg inducing financial market instability misalignments are difficult to identify at the time they are occurring because there is usually substantial margin of uncertainty about whether given level of asset prices is inconsistent with macr oeconomic fundamentals those fundamentals will most often be consistent with asset prices moving in the direction they are moving the problem is deciding if they have moved too far once identified misalignments can be hard to correct because of the huge volumes of private capital flows that may need to be offset the corrective actions of the central bank of one nation may be unable in so circumstances to counter the tide of private capital supporting the alignment in these cases coordinated intervention by several governments may be more effective at correcting the misalignment such coordinated strategy did help to correct the soaring dollar in 1985 and the overvalued ye n in 1995 such acti ons are also thought to carry an important signaling function in the sense that their effectiveness does not stem so much from the quantity of their financial market actions but from their role as an indicator of the participating governments commitment to more sustainable economic policies in general the gove rnments of the indus trial economies may not have shown capacity to always avoid th periodic policy missteps that induce asset market misalignments to an extent however they have revealed capability to deal effectively with the misalignments in way that is not overly disruptive to economic activity foreign finance and economic stability related concern with globalized asset markets is that countri with open capital markets will from time to time be recipients of large net inflows of financial capital which will just as quickly leave these rapidly shifting funds can be destabilizing force creating inflationary pressure and pushing up the real exchange rate on the other hand capital inflows can be useful and efficient source of financial capital the desirability and undesirability of such inflows will hinge critically on the factor or factors that caused them if the capital inflow is the consequence of flawed or misguided macroeconomic policies then such capital flows may quickly desert the economy and perhaps precipitate crisis if on the other hand those inflows are caused by sound economic policy and good l ongterm investment prospects then such inflows can be enduring and beneficial conclusion there is little doubt that the process of trade liberalization and the development of ever more integrated global markets has been on balance an enriching endeavor for the united states and the world economy nevertheless it has of late become particularly contentious pr ocess with very vocal opposition at the moment there is mixed interest for undertaking new r ound of multilateral liber alization of trade in goods and services for the advanced nations like the united states the moderate and widely dispersed benef its of more open trade are countered by localized and sharply felt costs for many poorer trad ing nations it is often the case that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30891crs16 benefits of expanded trade will be reduced or not realized if they are compelled to operate their industries subject to the cos tly social and economic rules that the advanced nations maintain breaking this impasse will require leadership and the united states has played central leadership role in past trade liberalization initiatives for the united states to assume that role now it may have to assuage the heightened concerns of its citizens about the costs and risks accompan ying the process of globalization while the data indicate that the costs of trade to the united states are less than commonly perceived concerns do exist it may be th case that an adequate response to these concerns will require reform and expansion of the us system of social insurance for workers but it may also require an expanded scope and use of the wto escape clause mechanism to more readily allow trade policy remedies in cases where trade is undermining strongly held social nor ms but an enhan ced escape clause can only emerge from new multilateral negotiations expanding trade in assets proceeds with greater speed and with less encumbrance then does trade in goods it s eems clear that short of dramatic shift in the form of the world trading system large and often rapidly shifting flows of international capital are fact of life irresistible and irreversible the size orderliness and resiliency of us financial markets leaves the united states well disposed to take full advantage of the benefits of these asset flows with minimum of risk however the importance of global stability points to the united states having an interest in helping to deve lop and support an inte rnational financial architecture that will extend the benefits of international capital to the worlds smaller economies that often fare less well with global capital markets
