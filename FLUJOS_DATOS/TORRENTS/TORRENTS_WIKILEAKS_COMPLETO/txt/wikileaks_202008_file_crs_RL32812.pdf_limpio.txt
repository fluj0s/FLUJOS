httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32812crs3 budget estimates and proposals cbos first budget report for fy2006 the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 20062015 january 2005 contained ba seline estimates and projections for fy2005 through fy2015 the report timated fy2006 deficit of 295 billion down from the estimated fy2005 deficit of 368 billion by fy2010 the baseline deficit estimate had fallen to 189 billion under th baseline assumptions cbo increases discretionary spending at the ra of inflation doe s not include extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts after 2010 and allows the alternative minimum tax amt relief to expire as currently sche duled the effects of these assumptions increase receipts in the nearterm because of the reversion of the amt to previous law and increase receipts by substantial amounts after fy2010 when most of the tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 expire under current law the result of the assumptions that cbo must follow likely understates the size and persistence of the deficit over the next 10 years the cbo baseline assumptions showed th budget remaining in deficit through fy2011 80 b illion followed by surpluses through fy 2015 141 billion the reduction in the deficit after calendar year 2010 leading to the surpluses is largely explained by the required inclusion of the ex piration of major tax cuts in the baseline estimates producing rapi d increase in revenues cbos budget reports generally include the estimates inc luding higher or lower debtservice costs of selected policies not included in the baseline estimates they usually reflect possible future policy such as making the tax cuts permanent fixing the expanding coverage of the amt or ch anging the rate of discretionary spending growth in cbos january 2005 report maki ng the tax cuts permanent increased the fiveyear fy2006fy2010 cumulative deficit including higher debtservice costs by 156 billion and by cumulative 19 trillion over the 10year period fy2006 fy2015 cbos estimate of reforming the alternative minimum tax produced 218 billion fiveyear cumulative increase in the deficit and 503 billion increase over 10 years fy2006fy2015 if discretionary spending were to grow at the rate of gdp rather than at the rate of infl ation the fiveyear cumulative deficit would increase by 378 billion and the 10year cu mulative deficit would increase by 17 trillion freezing discretionary appr opriations at the fy2005 level would reduce the fiveyear cumulative deficit by 294 billi on and the 10year cumulative deficit by 13 trillion president bushs fy2006 budget called for extending and making permanent most of the tax cuts adopted in 2001 and 2003 the budget showed this reducing receipts by 53 billion between fy2006 and fy2010 and by 11 trillion between fy2006 and fy2015 these timates do not include the resulting higher debtservice costs resulting from the change the admin istrations total rece ipt proposals which include other revenue changes would re duce fiveyear receipts by 106 billion and 10year receipts by 13 trillion the administrations budget again used slightly modified set of assumptions to produce the omb current services base line estimates moving the proposed and baseline estimates somewhat closer together instead of following the traditional method of constructing ba seline estimates the administrations fy2006 currenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32812crs4 services baseline assumed the extension of certain tax provisions that by current law are scheduled to expire excluded the future cost of onetime events and included timing adjustment to the calculation of federal pay increases for fy2006 the differences produced an administration current services baseline deficit estimate 9 billion smaller than the traditi onal baseline timate by fy 2010 the administrations estimated baseline defi cit was 16 billion smaller than the traditional baseline deficit estimate the administrations budget provided limited amount of information for the years beyond fy2010 the budget did incl ude estimates of the cumulative proposed revenue changes and proposed mandatory spending changes for the periods fy2006 through fy2010 and fy2006 through fy2015 but it contained information for the individual years after fy2010 the presidents budget included list of 150 discretionary program eliminations or reductions according to administration documentation these changes would produce approximately 11 billion in budget authority not outlay savings in fy2006 the documentation did not indicate the size of the outlay savings that would result from the reduced budget authority cbos march 2005 report analyzed the presidents policy proposals using cbos own underlying assumptions and budget estimating methods the analysis produced smaller deficits in the first couple of years of the five year period in the presidents budget and somewhat larger defic its in the later years cbo extrapolated the policy proposals throug h fy2015 find ing the budget remaining in deficit throughout the period in cbos estimates and projections the deficit falls as percentage of gdp from an estimated 26 of gdp in fy2006 to approximately 13 of gdp in fy2012 where it remains through fy2015 the housepasse d budget resolution hconres 95 closely followed the presidents budget the nate passed budget resoluti on sconres 18 deviated from the house resolution by including smaller mandatory spending cuts in reconciliation instructions larger tax cuts in reconciliation instructions and higher discretionary spending cap the senate made these changes to the senate budget committees reported resolution the changes moved the house and senatepassed resolutions further apart making reaching an agreement difficult and time consuming the conference agreement on the budget resolution passed by the house and senate on april 28 2005 in cluded revenues of 2195 b illion outlays of 2577 billion and deficit of 383 billion the resolution also included three reconciliation instructions that would over five years reduce mandatory spending with the sources of the savings spread among several committees of jurisdiction in the house and senate by 35 billion redu ce total revenues by 70 billion and raise the debt limit to 8965 trillion over the five years covered by the budget resolution its proposals would produce larger deficits than would have occurred without the included policy changes cbos marc h 2005 baseline deficit estimate was 298 billion while the resolution had proposed deficit of 383 billion under the budget resolution proposals the cumulative fi veyear deficit for fy2006 through fy2010 was 1797 billion under cbos march baseline policy changes the fiveyearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32812crs5 cumulative deficit was 1232 b illion more than 550 billion smaller than the amounts proposed in the budget resolution the july 13 2005 omb release of the midsession review had reduced deficits in fy2006 and subsequent years throug h fy2010 because of the higher than expected receipts flowing into the treasury in 2005 cbos august 2005 update had similar pattern of changed deficit estimates cbo expected less persistence in the higher receipts and longterm impr ovement in the budget outlook compared to its march budget report the federal response to the devastati on caused by hurricane katrina and the lesser damage from hurricane rita has pr oduced and will continue to produce substantial but uncertain budgetary re sponses in fy2006 and likely into fy2007 the higher spending has already added tens of billions of dollars to spending and the deficit in fy2006 the revised budget data for fy2006 from the cbo and omb budget reports for fy2007 showed higher deficit estimates compared to the july and august 2005 estimates enacted legislation change s in expected economic conditions and technical modifications ll contributed to the changes in the budget estimates ombs february 2006 revisions show receipts 12 b illion higher than in its july 2005 estimate and outlays 96 billion larger than its july estimate cbos new estimates show fy2006 receipts 32 billion larg er than its august 2005 estimate and its outlays 54 billion larger than its augu st outlay estimate according to cbos january 2006 report legislation adopted si nce its august 2005 report increased the deficit by 41 billion while changes to cb economic forecast reduced the deficit by 21 billion technical changes increased the deficit by 2 billion the net effect for cbo was 23 billion increase in the estimated deficit for fy2006 cbo released revised baseline estimates and its estimates of the administrations policy proposals in march 2006 for fy2006 cbos revised baseline estimates were almost unchanged from its january 2006 estimates cbos estimates of the presidents proposals his proposed policy modifications to the fy2006 budget contained in his fy2007 budget submission showed higher receipts and lower outlays and smaller deficit than was shown in the administrations fy2007 budget from february 2006 however this deficit estimate was larger than the cbo baseline deficit estimate for fy2006 in july 2006 omb published its midsession review for the fy2007 budget cycle which included revised budget data for fy2006 substantially higher than previously expected receipts reduced the fy2006 deficit estimate from the administrations 423 billion ficit estimate in february to 296 billion in july the higher receipts seem to have come from increased corporate income taxes and nonwithheld individual in come taxes with little time left in fy2006 it ends on september 30 2006 final budget totals for fy2006 are likely to be similar to the estimates in the msr cbos august 2006 budget report the budget and economic outlook an update showed similar improvement in the deficit to 260 billion for fy2006 as with the msr the redu ced deficit resulted from higher receipts rather than reduced outlays cbos repor t did not show any improvement in the longerterm budget outlookhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32812crs6 2 some things are known with certainty about the direction of future spending and receipts demographics can partly determine the shape of future budgets in the next decade the growing retirements in the baby boom generation will rapidly drive higher the spending for social security and medicare as well as other fe deral spending or tax breaks for the elderly because virtually all those who will become ligible for these benefits are alive today estimating the growth in the populations ligible for these programs is relatively straightforward 3 the current year is the fiscal year we are in 2006 the budget year is the year that the presidents budget covers 2007 and that congress will pass legislation to implementthe treasury provided final budget da ta for fy2006 on october 11 2006 in the final monthly treasury statement of receipts and outlays of the united states government september 2006 small revisions to these numbers can be expected when they appear in the presidents fy2008 budget documents in february 2007 uncertainty in budget projections all budget estimates and projections are inherently uncertain their dependence on assumptions that are themselves subject to substantial variation over short time periods makes budget estimate s and projections suscepti ble to fairly rapid and dramatic changes2 small changes in economic conditions from those used in the estimates particularly the rate of gdp growth can produce large changes in the budget estimates according to cbo pe rsistent 01 increase in the growth rate of real gdp beginning in january 2006 w ould reduce the deficit including interest costs by 58 billion cumulatively over five year period this change would reduce the cumulative deficit by 272 billion over the next 10 years reductions in the rate of growth would increase the deficit by similar amounts over th same time periods figure 1 is from cbos january 2006 budget and economic outlook cbo indicates that the most likely deficit or surplus outcomes as percentages of gdp through fy2011 are clustered in the center of the figure in the darkest area the lighter shades indicate the less likely outcomes the distance from the top to the bottom of the image in the chart the fan represents the range within which cbo predicts that the deficit or surplus s 90 chance of occurring in fy2011 this ranges from surplus of almost 5 of gdp to deficit of appr oximately 6 of gdp the presidents fy2007 budget included chapter in the analytical perspectives volume titled comparison of actual to estimated totals the chapter examined the causes of the changes from the initial budget estimates for fy2005 early in 2004 through the actual results fo r that year end of september 2005 like the cbo information this provides anothe r example of the uncertainty surrounding budget estimates the chapter included chart based on historical experience that indicates the possible range of surplus or deficit outcomes with 90 certainty the range for the current year and following year which the administration calls the budget year rise from 260 billion to 535 billion3 by five years beyond the current year the range within which the surplus or deficit has 90 chance of falling exceeds 11 trillion

fy2007fy2016 january 2006 p 17 note this figure calculated on the basis of cbos forecasting track record shows the estimated likelihood of alternative projections of the budget deficit or surplus under current policies the baseline projections fall in the middle of the darkest area of the figure under the assumption that tax and spending policies will not change the probability is 10 percent that actual deficits or surpluses will fall in the darkest area and 90 percent that they will fall within the whole shaded area actual deficits or surpluses will be affected by legislation enacted in future years including decisions about discretionary spending the effects of future legislation are not reflected in this figure4 budget projections are very dependent on the underlying assumptions about the direction of the economy expected future government policy and how these interact along with other factors such as changing demographics that affect the budget any deviation from the assumptions used in the budget estimates such as faster or slower economic growth higher or lower infl ation differences from the expected or proposed spending and tax polic ies or changes in the technical components of the budget models can have substantial eff ects on the budget estimates and projections budget action cbo and the administration released their first budget reports for fy2006

which policy proposals can be measured for outlays the modified baseline used this year assumes emergencies are onetime only that federal pay adjustment assumptions reflect the usual january 1 start of inflation adjusted raises rather than october 1 and the debt rvice interest payment changes resulting from these and revenue related modifications are included in the baselineas it did in last

the supplemental appropriation the administration proposed for fy2005 see below although unknown the amount is unlikely to be zero this implies that the administrations initial outlay estimate for

the budget re solution shows cumulative mandatory spending totaling 9068 trillion the 34 billion fiveyear reduction in mandatory spending in the reconciliation instructions is 037 little over one third of one percent of cumulative mandatory spending over the period the house and senate fy2006 budget re solutions hconres 95 sconres 18 spring 2005 and the conference agreemen t held total outlay growth to less than 5 from fy2005 to fy2006 for the period fy2005 through fy2010 the resolutions showed outlays growing at 38 to 41 annual rate these outlay totals included in the allowances func tion 50 billion in budget authority and 32 billion in outlays for fy2006 that is expect ed to used for the global war on terror8 additional funding was assumed or provided for the war on terror in the budget resolutions in subsequent years the reduction pr oposed for discre tionary spending and nondefense discretionary spending in particular in the budget re solution conference agreement differs markedly from the growth in mandatory spending and total outlays total outlays grow at an average annual rate of 38 between fy2006 and fy2010 mandatory spending grows at an averag annual rate of 61

discretionary defense spending would grow at an average annual rate of 31 even without assumptions about futu re spending for operations in iraq and afghanistan or the global war on terror si nce defense discretionary spending grows nondefense discretionary spending must fall fairly rapidly for total discretionary spending to fall and it does nondefense discretionary sp ending falls at an average annual rate of 35 from fy2006 to fy2010 the proposed reduction in non defense discretionary spendi ng would cut it both per capita and as percentage of gdp the two resolutions and the conference agreement included reconciliation instructions to slow barely growth in mandatory spending between fy2006 and fy2010 the house instructions were fo r 69 billion in savings while the senate included 17 billion in mandatory spending savings the conference agreement included 35 billion in mandatory savi ngs for the fy2006 through fy2010 period the conference agreement also included discretionary spending cap for the house of 917 billion in outlays 843 billion in budget authority for fy2006 similar to the discretionary spending levels included in the house and senate versions of the budget resolution for fy2006 the cap did not include the 50 billion allowance that is expected to b ecome defense suppl emental appropriation sometime during the yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32812crs15 the administrations midsession review msr omb july 13 2005 increased the fy2006 outla estimates by 46 billion ove r the presidents outlay estimates in the fy2006 budget in february most of the increase 37 billion came from additional war funding the rest was combination of small policy changes and the effect of technical and economic revi sions on outlays the inclusion of the administrations proposed social security policy changes the proposed personal or private accounts raised the new outla estimates above th administrations previous estimates beginning in fy 2009 as has been the administrations practice the msr did not include any estimates for future costs for the operations in iraq and afghanistan such costs which are likely to occur in future years will raise outlays in those years above the levels shown in the msr cbos midyear update august 2005 revised fy2006 outlays upward by 84 billion most of which reflected the adop

in the march 2005 cbo baseline estima tes cbo estimates usin g alternative assumption that reduce funding for iraq and afghan istan and the war on terror over period of time produced 10year cumulative

gdp achieving these reductions would require reversal in the patte rn of spending since fy2000 see figure 2 and possibly unprecedented constraints and reducti ons in discretionary spending the administrations outlay estimates would reduce discretionary spending as percentage of gdp in real terms and as measured per capita to their lowest levels since world war ii cbos august 2006 update raised fy2006 baseline outlays by 14 billion combination of higher spending coming fro m legislation and lower spending coming from changed technical assumptions the changes had little effect on fy 2006 outlays as percentage of gdp raising them from 202 to 203 over the period covered by the cbo projections fy2006 through fy2016 outlays would be larger in each year by as much as 08 of gdp final outlay numbers for fy2006 were 2654 billion 182 billion larger than in fy2005 and 86 billion above the presiden ts original request february 2005 they were smaller than the adminis trations outlay

of the tax cuts in 2010 the house resolution included 106 billion in re venue reductions over five years 45 billion of which were included in reconciliation instructions the senate in amending the

reduction under rec onciliation in the budget resolutions would not be large enough by an estimated 5 billion to accommodate all of the tax breaks that expire that year among those tax breaks expiring

or cbo see table 3 individual income taxes were 126 larger than they were in fy2005 and corporate income taxes were 272 larger surge in corporate profits and non withheld income produced much of the growth in income taxes most analysts do not expect the rapid growth in federal receipts to continue deficits and surpluses deficits and surpluses are the residuals left after congress and the president set policies for spending and receipts surpluses in which receipts are greater than outlays reduce federal debt he ld by the public which can lead to lower net interest payments among other effects deficits in which outlays exceed receipts increase government debt held by the public ge nerally increasing net interest payments assuming change in interest rates reducing the deficit and eventually reaching balanced budget or generating and keeping surplus the government had its first surplus in 30 years in fy1998 was major focus of the budget debates in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s the presidents fy2006 budget proposals february 2005 had estimates of the fy2006 deficit falling to 390 billion 30 of gdp from an fy2005 deficit of 427 billion 35 of gdp the defic it would fall to an estimated 207 billion 13 of gdp in fy2010 the presidents budget indicated that its policies if adopted would halve the deficit as per centage of gdp by the end of fy2010 this goal would likely not be reached if add itional amt relief is imp lemented additional defense supplementals are adopted or n ondefense discretionary spending grows rather than falls after fy2006 achieving the administrations defic it reduction proposals would require over five years strict limits on the growth in domestic discretionary spending modest reduction from baseline estimate s in some entitlements slowing defense spending growth and letting amt relief to laps after 2005 the proposals included some revenuereducing tax cuts increasing other changes needed to reduce the deficit15 an inability to hold to these spending nd revenue levels ta sk that has proven difficult in the past would result in larger deficits than those expected in the presidents budget httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32812crs22

the next three decades under current law from about 42 percent of gdp to more than 6 percent together the growing resource demands of social security medicare and medicaid will exert pressure on the budget that economic growth alone is unlikely to alleviate consequently policymakers face choices that involve reducing the growth of federal spending increasing taxation boosting federal borrowing or some combina tion of those approaches17 the administration indicated similar c oncerns about the outlook for the budget over the long term but tied much of its di scussion to the presidents proposed

of the last few years have not produced the difficult fiscal future but they appear to have made an alr eady difficult situation more difficult the budget and the economy the budget and the economy

economic conditions that lasted from 2001 into 2003 played minor role directly and indirectly in the dete rioration of the budget outlook over those years cbo expects continued economic growth during calendar year s 2005 and 2006 which should result in higher revenues and lowe r spending than would occur if the economy were to grow at slower rate because there is way of predicting the timing of economic ups and downs especially as estimates run into the future cbo projects that gdp will grow at rate close to potential gdp for the period 2007 through 201518 under governmental policies that are in fiscal balance return to normal economic growth growth close to that of potential gdp should reduce or eliminate deficit or produce surplus in both the presidents budget and in cbos budget reports the budget under current policies expe riences shrinking deficit but does nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32812crs26 move into surplus throughout the forecast period under cbos alternative policies the deficit grows as percentage of gdp it does not shrink or disappear during period of expected normal economic growt h this result implies that the budget particularly if using the alternative assumptions has basic fiscal imbalance that cannot be eliminated by economic growth to produce balanced budget or one in surplus requires spending re ductions or tax increases for
