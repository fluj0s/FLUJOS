insurance the report then looks at premiums and costsha ring in hsaqualified hdhps as reported by ahip and two other sources one focused on nongroup and the other on group coverage finally the repor t

covered by hsa plans americas health insurance plans report march 9 2006 hsa pla ns triple in 10 months americas health insurance plans press release jan 26 2006 ahip re ports its findings as virtually census since its members represent nearly all insurance comp anies and nearly all of the member companies responded to the survey according to ahip its reported number may be an undercount if for example an insurer that offers hsaqualified hdhps is not an ahip member or if large employer offers selffunded hsaqualified hdhp without the help of an ahip member serving as thirdparty administrator tpadata on enrollment in hsaqualified hdhps enrollment in hsaqualifie d hdhps has grown to nearly 32 million individuals according to the latest estimates from ahip these numbers include not only the primary policyholders or covered workers but also their covered family members in health insurance lingo these numbers are for all covered lives these estimates of coverage in january 2006 are triple the number timated in march 2005 which was double the number from september 2004 the results are based on responses from ahip member companies which represent nearly all the health insurance plans offering hsaeligible plans ahip reported that insurers are ffering hsaqualified plans in more markets and to wider array of large employer group small group and individual customers2 for 28 of the 32 million enrollees in hsaqualified hdhps it is unknown whether that coverage was obtained throug h the group market or the nongroup market as shown in figure 1 additionally among the 14 million for whom group coverage was reported 17 did not specify whether that hsaqualified hdhp was obtained from small employer or large one ahip members reported their membership in large and smallgroup markets according to their internal reporting standards thus there may be differences in plans definition of large and smallgroup markets because the characteristics of plans not reporting the detailed information may differ markedly from plans reporting the information it is difficult to draw strong conclusions about the entire 32 million enrollees base d on only the plans reporting details nonetheless although the precise share of rollees in different categories is uncertain there has been substantial growth in hs aqualified hdhps in term s of total enrollees across all of the categories as shown in table 1 again it is not known how many of these individuals actually set up an hsa or if so contributed to it data on contributions to hsas in 2005 should be available fro m the internal revenue service in 2007 the ahip results found that 31 of thos who were newly enrolled in an hsa qualified hdhp through the nongroup market in january had been uninsured prior to enrolling in that coverage this percentage was calculated among insurers reporting the information these insurers covered less th an half of the hsaqualified hdhp enrollees in the nongroup market thus the results may be biased if the insurers who did not provide the information had significantly di fferent percentage of enrollees previously uninsured the same caveat applies to the percentage of small employers offering an hsaqualified hdhp who did not previously ffer coverage 33 the ahip study did not provide results regarding the number of rge employers previously not offering health insurance this is probably because the number was very low since the percentage of large employers not offering health insurance is usually estimated at 5 or lesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22417crs3 source congressional

reporte d similar plan information for group coverage4 these results are shown in table 2 there are number of reasons why the results in table 2 differ by source of data for example the ahip estimates of premiums and costsharing in hsaqualified hdhps were based on what insurers reported for their bestselling product the characteristics of these products and the people who tend to enroll in them may be different from the other products and those enrollees the eh ealthinsurance numbers are from people who enrolled through their website enrollees who purchase health insurance online for example may differ substantially from thos who obtain health insurance though local insurance agent the kaiserhealth research and educational trust hret survey faces limitations common to all surveys for example only 48 of the employers contacted for the survey responded employers that did not respond may have systematically different characteristics that could bias the results among firms that offered health insuran ce in 2005 one in five 20 offered plan with deductible of at least 1000 for sing coverage and 2000 for family coverage according to the kaiserhret employer survey however most of these plans were not hsaqualified perhaps because the plans outofpocket maximum was higher than the statutory limit of firms offering an hdhp only 12 had one th at was hsaqualified moreover among firms that offered an hsaqualified hdhp onl 15 of eligible employees enrolled in the plan5 the employer survey by mercer huma n resource consulting provided 2005 results for consumerdirected health plans cdhps which include hsas as well as health reimbursement arrangements hras hras are solely employerfunded accounts with balances usually forfeited to the employer when the worker terminates employment mercer considered it surprise that so few small employers offered cdhp proponents said hsas would expand access to coverage by providing lessexpensive option for small employers who might not othe rwise offer coverage this theory hasnt panned out use of cdhps by this group employers with 10 to 499 workers reached only 2 in 2005 while the percentage offeri ng any form of health plan dropped from 66 to 63 however the survey indicat ed that 12 of employers with 10 to 499 workers were very likely to offer cdhp in 2006 compared to 2 the previous year6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22417 crs5 table 2

accounts us government accountability office report gao06271 jan 2006 at httpwww gaogovnewitemsd06271pdfhsaqualified hdhps for federal employees in january 2005 hsaqualified hdhps first became available to federal employees through the federal employees health benefits program fehbp which is administered by the office of personnel management pm the us government accountability office gao analyzed the firs tyear experience of these 14 plans and as of march 2005 their 7500 enrollees according to op ms preliminary estimate s there were 12400 enrollees in fehbps hsaqualified hdhps in march 2006 this section summarizes the gao findings7 the experience in fehbps new hsaqua lified hdhps was compared to another new fehbp plan that was not an hdhp that plan was traditiona l preferred provider organization ppo among the subscribers that is the federal employees or retirees under whose name enrollment occurred th average age in the hsaqualified hdhps 46 and the new nonhdhp 47 was below that of fehbp subscribers overall 59 this was because smaller share of retirees enrolled in new plans regardless of whether they were hdhps excluding retirees subs cribers in the hdhps and in the new nonhdhp had an average age of 44 and for all fehbp plans an average age of 47 the gao report also compared the income of federal employees who signed up for the various plans specifically the percenta ge of federal employees who had salaries of 75000 or more in the hsaqualified hdhps 43 of the federally employed subscribers had salary of at least 75000 this percentage was much higher than in the new nonhdhp 14 and among all fehbp plan s 23 in other words federally employed subscribers in the hdhps were much more likely to be highincome compared to subscribers in the other fehbp plans three of the 14 plans referred to as th multistate hdhps comprised 96 of the fehbp hsaqualified hdhp enrollment in 2005 the characteristics of these three plans were compared to nonhdhps offered by the same carriers the deductibles in the hdhps were slightly more than double the ca rriers non hdhp ppo deductibles hdhps are permitted to cover preventive serv ices without being subjected to the deductible for qualifying for an hsa all of the multistate hdhps took advantage of this exception with enrollees paying the same or less for preventive services than the traditional plan enrollees the average monthly portion of the pre mium paid by employees was 91 for the hsaqualified hdhps single cove rage and 99 for the traditional plans in addition these hdhps also made contributions to individuals hsas these contributions averaged 82 per month arguably offsettin g much of the employees contribution to premiums
