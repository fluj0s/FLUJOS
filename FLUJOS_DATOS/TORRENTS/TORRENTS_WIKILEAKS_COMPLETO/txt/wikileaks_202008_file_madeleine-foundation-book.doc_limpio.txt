portuguese resort of praia da luz dr kate mccann claimed that she had walked up to her apartment to do halfhourly check on her three children found the madeleine was not in her bed and immediately reported that her daughter madeleine had been abducted there then began the most famously publicised effort in world history to find an allegedly missing child four months later in september 2007 the doctors mccann were made arguidos by the portuguese police in the disappearance of their daughter the term arguido does not have an exact english equivalent but may be translated provisional suspect but in july this year 2008 the portuguese authorities announced that they had insufficient evidence to bring any charges against either doctor concerning their daughters disappearance their status as suspects was therefore ended the mccanns proclaimed themselves cleared though in fact the investigation into madeleines disappearance has merely been shelved not abandoned for most of the 18 months since madeleine went missing the british media tv radio and newspapers have continued to portray madeleine and the mccanns as innocent victims of an evil abductor in addition they blame an incompetent bungling malicious portuguese police force for even thinking of suspecting the parents of involvement in madeleine going missing this is despite the fact that police forces throughout the world who are called on to investigate alleged child abductions of young children from their own homes always fully investigate the parents and those close to them bearing in mind the strong probability that the parents abduction claim may be false amongst all the media hype and debate on the likely fate of madeleine and the claims of those involved we have lost sight of the fact that little madeleine even if she was abducted is longer with us because her parents deliberately chose to leave their three children all aged under four unsupervised so they could enjoy another night out wining and dining with their friends over 100 yards walk away unable to see or hear their three young children indeed it is known that on one occasion they were called back to their apartment by mark warner staff to attend to one of their children probably madeleine who had been crying out in distress for at least an hour and quarter apparently pleading daddy daddy leaving their children unattended whilst out at the nearby tapas restaurant with their friends is something they have publicly admitted to doing for either five or six nights in row for example in long article in the independent on sunday on 5th august 2007 the accounts given by the mccanns and their tapas 9 friends of how often they checked their children and about what really happened on 3rd may contain numerous contradictions see for example reason 20 below and have frequently changed over time these varying accounts made things more difficult for the portuguese police as they tried to investigate madeleines disappearance for example they originally claimed that they were checking their children every hour then we heard every 15 minutes and finally they settled on every half hour to put it mildly there are many doubts as to whether the mccanns were checking their children regularly while they were dining out if at all but the biggest question of all is this was madeleine really abducted as the parents claim and as the british media seem to believe we dont think so and in this booklet we lay out 60 different reasons for doubting their claim key reason for writing our booklet is the fact that the british media have consistently failed to offer us either full information about the case or any serious analysis of what might really have happened the madeleine foundations view on what really happened to madeleine is precisely the same as the view held by the senior portuguese detective who initially led the complex investigation mr goncalo amaral he was removed from the investigation on 3rd october 2007 due to intense british government pressure matter we deal with in appendix 1 some will say the mccanns are innocent until proven guilty others will say leave this to the proper authorities and let them do the investigating or the portuguese police didnt find enough evidence to charge then leave them alone we say simply that the british public is entitled to fair presentation of the facts and an analysis of them which point not to madeleine having been abducted but in an entirely different direction in the madeleine mccann case we have truly extraordinary example of couple suspected of serious crime against their child not only being protected by our government but also being lauded in the british press at the same time and even in the case of dr gerry mccann receiving bravery medal at police ceremony those who seek out information about the case have used their minds to try to understand what might really have happened to madeleine and who have reached the conclusion that the mccanns and their friends are clearly failing to tell the whole truth about madeleines disappearance have been dubbed mccannhaters or worse these facts alone suggest that there are major issues surrounding this case that every british citizen should be aware of we assert therefore that the british public is entitled to examine whether the mccanns claim of abduction stands up you have been invited to give generously to find madeleine many of you have done so including some like pensioners who donated their weekly pension who could ill afford to do so many children gave up their pocket money for weeks to help find madeleine the british media have repeatedly promoted the claim that madeleine really was abducted equally and especially since the mccanns succeeded in winning over Â½ million libel damages against several british newspapers the british media have avoided printing stories that conflict with madeleine having been abducted the key question which we address in this booklet is was she really abducted or did she die as result of an accident perhaps from over sedation or from another crime we are now in much better position to examine the evidence in the case than three months ago now that the portuguese police have revealed many details about their investigation placing literally thousands of documents and other evidence online much of what was previously merely press speculation and rumour such as the breathtaking and sinister evidence provided by the british cadaver dog eddie and bloodhound keela has now been confirmed these two highly trained dogs who have never been wrong in detecting the scent of death and blood found both the smell of human cadaverine the socalled smell of death and of blood in the mccanns apartment and in the renault scenic car they hired in late may 2007 eddie found the smell of death on the clothes of dr kate mccann and madeleine and on the pink soft toy cuddle cat which was regularly carried by dr kate mccann when she did tv interviews at the mccanns rented house in praia da luz in july 2007 other forensic evidence has now been disclosed recent revelations of witness statements made to the police provide proof for example that the mccanns and their friends have given very conflicting and changing accounts of events in praia da luz in may 2007 what is most important in this case is the truth the whole truth only if we all know the truth or we can get as close to it as those involved in madeleines disappearance will allow can we respond accordingly and make the right decisions about this case and learn the right lessons for the future we invite you to consider carefully the 30 main reasons set out here and further 30 subsidiary reasons weve added at the end for doubting the claim that madeleine was abducted we hope they will help you to understand what may really have happened to madeleine mccann in praia da luz on 3rd may 2007 b the 30 key reasons for doubting the doctors mccanns abduction claim 1 stranger abductions of an infant from family home almost never happen in such cases of missing young children we always need to examine whether the family may be involved sadly throughout the world every year many infants and young children die in their own homes due to accident neglect negligence or deliberate act in some cases especially where very young children are concerned parents decide to hide the body claiming their child has been abducted statistics have been kept in some countries about the proportion of alleged stranger abductions of an infant from familys home or from temporary residence elsewhere such as being on holiday they show that in the vast majority of cases of socalled stranger abductions of infants from family home it later turns out when the full facts emerge that member of childs family has been involved in the childs death having tried to cover it up by falsely claiming their child had been abducted we give some suggestions for further reading on this subject in appendix 2 page 56 last year 2007 for example there was the case of twoyearold baby grace whose body was found battered and decomposing in plastic box on sand dunes near galveston on the gulf coast of the usa eventually dna tests linked the body to parents in the us who months earlier had told police that their baby had been abducted sparking massive nationwide search then there was the case of the dead baby found by police hidden in the attic of couples home once again the guilty parents had falsely claimed their baby had been abducted more recently in the us the mother of two yearold caylee anthony reported her as missing month after she had disappeared but forensic evidence now suggests that caylee died at her mothers home in suspicious circumstances and as we were preparing the final draft of our booklet six yearold antoine b went missing in midfrance the mother and her new partner claiming hed wandered off whilst they were dining at nearby restaurant but forensic evidence being yielded as we go to press suggests he was killed in his own home now the above statistics and case examples do not in any way prove that the mccanns were involved in madeleines death nor that they like many other parents before them have done have cunningly made up an abduction cover story but what we do say and what the statistics tell us is that wherever parent claims that complete stranger has lifted their infant child from their home and taken the child away we should immediately view their claim with grave suspicion we need to examine their claim test it check it out which of course is what the portuguese police have also tried to do in this case we need to see what positive evidence if any there is that madeleine was abducted we also need to see if there is evidence that may point in another direction for example the possible involvement of the parents since the reports of madeleine going missing the media have frequently highlighted how many children go missing every year we concede that there are certainly occasional cases of stranger abductions however the vast majority of cases of missing or abducted children usually fall into one of the following two categories teenage children who run away from their parents and b children snatched by former spouse or partner during custody disputes very small number of children are also c snatched by stranger abductors whilst outdoors and away from their homes think for example of sarah payne and the soham girls holly wells and jessica chapman and an even smaller number are d snatched by child traffickers whilst outdoors and away from their homes though this phenomenon is not known to occur in western europe then in addition there are very occasional instances of babies snatched from hospital or other public places by mothers desperate to have baby but we repeat and this is most important in cases where parents of infant children claim that their children have been abducted from their family homes or from temporary residence elsewhere such as holiday hotel or caravan in nearly every case it turns out that the child has died in the family home due to an accident neglect negligence or deliberate act in these circumstances it is usually member of the childs own family or extended family or friend known to the family who is responsible for that death hundreds of examples of such cases have occurred in recent years alone in the us following the abduction of child called megan by known paedophile megans law was passed which provides for parents to be informed if known sex offender is living in their area but in the uk the childrens commissioner said we are concerned that version of megans law could detract from the fact that children are actually most at risk from people known to them against this background where we have seen that in the vast majority of cases of young children reported stolen from inside their family home the child is dead and the family is responsible we now turn to examine 29 other key specific lines of evidence which suggest that madeleine mccann was not abducted 2 the evidence from two highly trained cadaver dogs who found the smell of death in several places in the holiday apartment where the mccanns were staying and in car they hired three weeks later as suspicions grew in the minds of the portuguese police that doctors kate and gerry mccann might know what had happened to their daughter and might even have been involved in some way in her disappearance the police turned to the british police to help them determine whether madeleine might have died in apartment 5a in praia da luz where her parents had been staying from 28th april to 3rd may the day she was reported missing they turned for advice to experienced leicestershire detective mark harrison who after weeks visit to praia da luz in july 2007 in which he analysed all the evidence advised that the portuguese police should proceed on the working assumption that madeleine had died in the mccanns apartment and her body hidden or otherwise disposed of he then brought in top police dog handler mr martin grime who had two highlytrained springer spaniels under his command eddie who could detect human cadaverine the socalled smell of death and keela in effect blood hound who could detect the presence of blood dogs it should be noted are known to have sense of smell 10000 times as strong as that of humans which is almost beyond comprehension given that we ourselves have such highly developed sense of smell the two dogs trained and used successfully by top police doghandler martin grime over many years had the ability to use their faculties in two highly specific areas eddie who has been called the cadaver dog can detect the presence of human cadaverine special chemical released from dead body usually after the body has been dead for at least two hours sometimes as short as an hourandahalf its important to understand that eddie is trained only to scent the presence of the special type of cadaverine released by human corpse the scent of death from animals is different form of cadaverine keela is dog trained specifically to detect the presence of blood she is therefore what is popularly known as bloodhound she has been trained to ignore decomposing body materials other than human blood freezing with her nose as near to the blood as possible without touching the item to enable scientists to recover the sample quickly and efficiently she can even pick out traces of blood after clothing or weapons have been washed many times when keela was working on the abigail witchalls case she found eight pieces of bloodstained clothing in just one day claims have been made by the mccanns and their team of legal and pr advisers about the alleged unreliability of cadaver dogs including suggestions that they have on occasions mistaken pork for cadaver scent but cadaver dogs have an excellent track record and have been used successfully in several murder trials they are able to detect the smell of death up to dozens of feet below the surface and even after body has lain there for years spectacular examples of their work can be viewed on many websites on the internet in addition mr harrison and mr grime who trained eddie and keela patiently explained that the dogs had traced the smell of death human cadaverine on around 200 previous occasions they had never once been wrong an article in the daily telegraph gave us these details about the dogs quote the spaniel can sniff out blood in clothes after they have been washed repeatedly in biological washing powder and can detect microscopic amounts on weapons that have been scrubbed and washed when faced with clean crime scene mr ellis and pc martin grime keelas other handler will first send in frankie border collie and eddie another springer spaniel to pick up any general scent then they wheel in the big gun we take keela in and she will find the minutest traces of blood mr ellis said its not like looking for needle in haystack any more the other two dogs will find the haystack and keela will find the needle keela 16monthold springer spaniel has become such an asset to south yorkshire police that she now earns more than the chief constable her sense of smell so keen that she can sniff traces of blood on weapons that have been scrubbed after attacks has her so much in demand by forces up and down the country that she is hired out at 530 day plus expenses thought to be the only one of her kind the crime scenes dog earns nearly 200000 year her daily rate ten times that of ordinary police dogs puts her on more than the chief constable meredydd hughes who picks up 129963 south yorkshire police spokesman said the dogs are the only two in britain who are capable of finding human blood in small quantities they are trained to seek buried remains and are put to search on areas which look disturbed such as broken branches rubble or turned over earth at the end of last year the fbi sought the dogs help in tenyearold murder investigation in the united states unquote so what did mr martin grimes cadaver dog and bloodhound find according to the official police summary report released in july this year and confirmed by video evidence of the dogs in action in praia da luz widely available on the internet eddie the cadaver dog found the smell of death in the following places we quote the exact words of the report in the mccanns apartment apartment 5a eddie the cadaver the dog detected the scent of human corpse human cadaverine i in the couples bedroom in corner around wardrobe and ii in the living room behind the sofa close to the external window of the apartment also lighter scent of death was found in the flower beds in the back yard near the foot of the steps leading down from the patio b on family items of clothing eddie found the scent of corpse as follows i on two items of kate mccanns clothing and ii on one item of madeleines clothing tshirt c in addition eddie the cadaver dog was taken to the house that the mccanns rented in different part of praia da luz after they left apartment 5a eddie found cadaverine on what was said to be madeleines favourite pink soft toy cuddle cat which dr kate mccann always had with her when being interviewed by the media but which eddie detected lying in an otherwise empty cupboard here it should be noted that earlier eddie had found cuddle cat in the living room at the mccanns rented home tossed it in the air but not actually marked it by barking he later marked it when the police relocated it in the cupboard d on top of all that eddie sniffing the car from the outside only detected cadaverine in the car the mccanns hired on 22nd may less than three weeks after madeleine disappeared renault scenic i on the car key ii around the door of the front drivers seat these findings supported by other forensic evidence show that dead body must have begun to emit cadaverine in apartment 5a the mccanns apartment that body must have lain dead in that apartment for at least 90 minutes probably two hours or more once that smell of death cadaverine had begun to be produced it could then be transferred to other locations such as the hire car madeleines clothes dr kate mccanns clothes and cuddle cat that means that corpse that must have been dead for approximately two hours in order for cadaverine to have been produced must have been in direct contact with all of these locations floor wardrobe car clothes etc if the body had subsequently been moved it would still emit cadaverine as it was decomposing meanwhile keela the bloodhound found the smell of blood note blood not just body fluids in the living room behind the sofa close to the external window of the apartment exactly where eddie had found the scent of human cadaverine and b in the mccanns hired renault scenic i on the car key ii in the interior of the car boot we should note three very important things here the dogs alerted to the smell of deathblood separately in exactly the same places in the apartment eddie the cadaver dog only alerted to the smell of death to the mccanns apartment out of all the other ones he was taken to similarly the mccanns car was the only one in the car compound that eddie alerted to let us be very clear about where the dogs evidence takes us records have been checked by the portuguese police going back years one else has ever died in apartment 5a noone else has ever died in the renault scenic there was dead body in apartment 5a there was dead body in the renault scenic hired by the mccanns that dead body could only be one individual already dead who could have been in both apartment 5a and in the renault scenic it must have been madeleine mccann 3 the extraordinary reactions of doctors kate and gerry mccann when they were told that the cadaver dog and the bloodhound had detected the smell of death and blood in apartment 5a in the renault scenic and on the clothes of dr kate mccann and madeleine the evidence from the cadaver dog and the bloodhound were convincing enough on their own but the mccanns then went on to strongly reinforce the evidence that madeleine had died in apartment 5a by their extraordinary reactions when that evidence was first reported to most people if their child really had been abducted the news that the smell of death had been found in their holiday apartment and in their car would have prompted an outpouring of grief and concern for their child it would have prompted reactions such as who hired the car before us or is anyone else known to have died in our apartment or in the hire car but this was not how the mccanns reacted instead speaking through variety of sources including their 75000ayear spokesman clarence mitchell friends of the family and sources close to the mccanns legal team the mccanns came up with the following five explanations for why human cadaverine the smell of death and blood had been found in their apartment and in the car they hired first dr kate mccann claimed at first indirectly via her mother not directly that the smell of death may have been found on her clothes because she was said to have been in close proximity with fewer than six corpses in her last two weeks at work so far as this excuse for the presence of the smell of death is concerned there is doubt as to whether she did actually visit six corpses that has never been verified by the mccanns further those doctors who have to certify the cause of death do not always handle the body nor handle it long enough or closely enough for the smell of death to be transferred to clothes it also seems unlikely that person who really had worked in such close proximity with corpses would take the same clothes on holiday with them that they used in working close to corpses b second dr kate mccann claimed that the smell of death was found on the pink soft toy cuddle cat because she sometimes took cuddle cat to work the presence of the smell of death on cuddle cat was particularly difficult for the mccanns to explain as newspaper report based on police sources put it kate didnt contradict the fact that her two pieces of clothes and the stuffed animal cuddle cat had been signalled by the english dogs trained to find cadaver odour she justified it by her profession kate mccanns mother alleged that as doctor at the leicester health centre she was directly present at six deaths before she came to portugal on holiday giving the same excuse for madeleines stuffed animal that was with her in the months after her daughter disappeared dr kate mccann once again claimed that the smell of death must have been transferred on to cuddle cat by her working on the corpses during the two weeks before going on holiday to work quite apart from it being unlikely that mother would take childs favourite stuffed animal to work never mind having it with her when she was close to corpses it appears that experts say that it is not usually possible for the smell of death to be transferred in this way even if the smell of death could be transferred in such way which the experts rule out the mccanns would still have to account for the presence of the smell of death in their apartment and on the car they hired three weeks after madeleine went missing c third the mccanns claimed that if dna thought to be madeleines was found in the boot of their car then it could have come from the childrens dirty nappies which they carried in the boot first it is unlikely though certainly possible that anyone would carry dirty nappies around in this way second it must be remembered that the bloodhound keela found the smell of blood in the hired car not just body fluids the dirty nappy excuse therefore also doesnt stand up to scrutiny d fourth the mccanns claimed that the smell of death could have come from rotting meat that dr gerry mccann was taking to the local rubbish dump from time to time this is also impossible as the scent from dead animals does not produce the same cadaverine as human cadaver scent the cadaver dogs are trained to detect only human cadaverine probably dr gerry mccann didnt realise this when he made his comment fifth the mccanns said that any blood found in the flat apparently found having oozed underneath the tiles in the living room behind the sofa and where the wall and the floor meet might have come from madeleine grazing her leg when she boarded the plane or perhaps nosebleed these explanations seem highly unlikely given the amount of blood that would be needed for small amount to seep through the tiles the knee incident occurred elsewhere the day their holiday began any light bleeding would surely have stopped well before they even got to praia da luz in addition it is hardly likely that blood from graze on the knee would be located at the edge of room where the wall joins the floor nosebleeds usually leave only few spots of blood if any on flooring being largely contained by clothing or handkerchief or similar over the nose its highly unlikely that madeleine would have sat still while copious quantities of blood poured from her nose on to the tiled floor right by the living room wall in addition to these excuses for the apparent presence of both the smell of death and madeleines blood the mccanns and their evergrowing team of pr advisers and lawyers immediately poured scorn on the evidence of the cadaver dog and the bloodhound they quickly cited for example an irish court case where the judge would not accept the cadaver dog evidence alone because it was not corroborated they claimed there were irish and american lawyers who had been able to cast doubt on cadaver dog evidence pointing to us study which allegedly showed that cadaver dogs could be fallible yet cadaver dog evidence has played vital part in securing the conviction of murderers in number of countries and we know from mark grimes that eddie and keela had never once been wrong in over 200 cases where they detected the smell of death or blood let us ask ourselves also whether pouring scorn on the evidence of cadaver dog in another court case would be amongst the first reactions of genuinely loving grieving parents on being informed that the smell of death had been found in their apartment and car 4 the forensic evidence of the dna of blood found in the living room of the mccanns apartment and in the renault scenic hired by the mccanns analysed by the forensic science service here in england there have been claims and counterclaims about the significance of the forensic evidence obtained by the forensic science service fss in birmingham on samples of blood or body fluids found in the mccanns apartment and in the boot of the car they hired the mccanns and their spokesmen have claimed that the fss results did not confirm that it was madeleines dead body in the apartment and in the car so let us look carefully at what the fss found in apartment 5a the apartment the mccanns rented for the week eddie the cadaver dog and keela the bloodhound both clearly and independently from each other marked precisely the same location behind the sofa in the living room which had been moved by the mccanns from its original location the tiles where keela scented the blood were carefully removed first analysed by portuguese laboratory and then sent to fss the blood found by keela was by then degraded quite probably it was said due to cleaning agents having been used to clean the area where the dogs detected the corpse scent and the blood as result the fss lab was able to check only 5 markers from that site each one of those 5 markers matched madeleines dna or to rephrase this different way there were markers that could not have come from madeleine so the idea that it was her blood could most certainly not be ruled out far more conclusive evidence was found in the renault scenic registration 59da27 the car hired by the mccanns eddie the cadaver dog and keela the bloodhound both clearly marked the same car and the same location within the car the blood found there by keela beneath the carpeting in the well of the car was also degraded but the fss lab was able this time on its first analysis to find 19 markers of which 15 markers matched madeleines dna again meaning that there were markers within these 15 that could not have come from madeleine with 15 markers out of 19 all matching madeleines dna that would give analysts 999 confidence that the blood samples were from madeleine the dna of the degraded blood was found not to match with the dna of the twins sean and amelie further indication that the blood was madeleines these were the initial results that the fss initially communicated to senior investigating officer goncalo amaral and his team the law differs from country to country as to how many out of an individuals 19 or 20 dna markers are needed by the courts to prove that any dna sample comes from that individual many countries accept 15 markers out of 19 as sufficient proof under portuguese law however the courts require all 19 markers to be confirmed this was what is called low copy number dna and so all 19 markers could not be obtained we might add here that when the british police crosscheck the dna of suspect with its database said to consist of 25 million people of people who have been arrested on suspicion of crime they use only 10 markers out of 19 in order to establish dna match the scientist who invented dna fingerprinting two decades ago professor sir alec jeffreys said however that using 10 markers to obtain sufficiently reliable match was insufficient proof he went on to state that 15 markers would provide sufficient evidence to be conclusive he said the current dna database uses 10 distinct markers to obtain match and this means there is still residual risk of false match they should use about 15 markers 15 markers would close the possibility that the match from crime scene sample is genuine but fluke to find 15 out of madeleines 19 markers present means that the chances that the traces of blood in the hired car came from anyone other than madeleine were fewer than only 1 in 1000 the key point to be made is this these initial fss results on their own showed better than 999 chance that the blood in the mccanns hired car was madeleines for some experts and under portuguese law 15 markers out of 19 bearing in mind the high level of proof required in criminal trial stops just short of providing absolute proof that the blood is that persons but we must take these strongly indicative results with all 5 markers in one sample and 15 in another that could not have come from madeleine together with all the other evidence in this case we can surely say with confidence that the chance of those 15 markers belonging to someone other than madeleine is nexttonothing especially when we take into account other significant forensic and circumstantial evidence these initial dna results then amount to more evidence in the case pointing very strongly in the direction of madeleine being dead in her holiday apartment on 3rd may 2007 the day she disappeared and then her body being transported in the renault scenic at least three weeks later in case reported in october this year killer was convicted thanks to relatives dna the forensic science service and police used familial searching to uncover close relative of craig harman from surrey who had criminal conviction and was on the dna database the relatives profile matched the dna on the brick by 16 out of 20 points this led police to harman whose dna gave perfect match he eventually confessed to the drunken act of violence it must be said however that this first analysis given to the portuguese and leicestershire detectives in june was overridden month later when the fss issued more detailed report by now as the former senior investigating officer goncalo amaral confirms in his book political interference in the case had begun with successful attempts being made to get the fss to water down their initial conclusions by july the initial samples had been retested and were now found to contain 37 markers or alleles not just the original 19 the sample appeared to have been contaminated by staff of the fss laboratory though there were now reported to be 37 markers there were still of course 15 that were match to madeleines dna that fact that the fss appear to have contaminated the sample does not negate the match it simply makes it somewhat less certain that the blood was madeleines by the time they issued their more detailed report the fss said that they were only able to confirm that the results of the analysis were indicative that the blood found was madeleines they later added that the results were too complex for meaningful analysis we need to bear in mind that whilst the portuguese police have released some fss analyses and statements they have not yet released others to the public including the reports of their first tests which gave the strongest indications that the blood was madeleines the leading portuguese detective on the case is clear that intense political pressure was successfully brought on the fss to modify its earlier results whilst the leading british detective on the case stuart prior was overheard to be furious with the fss when he learnt of their watereddown opinion it seems he also believed that there had been political interference to secure less conclusive result 5 dr kate mccanns refusal to answer any of the questions put to her by the portuguese police especially question 41 it has now emerged that dr kate mccann refused to answer any one of 48 separate questions that the portuguese police asked her after she was made an arguida true she had her lawyer with her and it is said that in refusing to answer any questions she was acting on legal advice but what mother truly distraught at the abduction of her daughter would refuse to help the police with what they wanted to know parents who were innocent of any wrongdoing in relation to their daughters disappearance would surely do all that they possibly could to assist the police list of the 48 questions asked by the portuguese police none of which were answered by dr kate mccann has since been published and is widely available on the internet one of the questions 41 asked was surprise to many the portuguese police asked dr kate mccann if the mccanns had discussed or made plans for the legal care of madeleine to be taken over by relative if this was indeed true this would question the mccanns description of their relationship with madeleine as wholly positive and loving some light was thrown on this issue early on in the case when relative of the mccanns declared that there was always someone with kate during dr gerry mccanns frequent weekend absences at conference and other speaking engagements it was never explained however why dr kate mccann needed someone with her to care for the children while her husband was away following dr kate mccanns refusal to answer questions and after dr gerry mccann was also interviewed by the police the british government flew the mccanns back to england on special easyjet flight from then on any questioning of the mccanns was almost entirely under their own control the portuguese police had to go through british government channels to get permission to interview the mccanns and their tapas 9 friends the polices potential questions were vetted and approved by both the british government and the mccanns lawyers the portuguese police had to submit their questions in advance for home office approval in what are called rogatory letters whatever ones personal view on the british governments role in the investigation ie whether it went well beyond the norm or not the portuguese police were heavily restricted in their investigation to level which suggests wilful interference in effect the mccanns though being suspects in madeleines disappearance were throughout able to evade effective questioning innocent parents who knew that their child had been abducted would surely cooperate fully and without reservation with the police and help them with all the information that they possibly could 6 publicly agreeing to take lie detector test and then refusing when serious accusations against the mccanns first surfaced they promised that they would take lie detector test to clear their names but when various lie detector experts offered to provide their services the mccanns suddenly changed their minds and refused to cooperate this was totally in keeping with their earlier behaviour on being questioned when dr kate mccann apparently on the advice of her lawyer exercised her right to remain silent in her police interview by taking the status of an arguido ie suspect 7 the sheer impossibility of the abduction happening as claimed here it is important to examine closely what the mccanns and the friends who were with them in praia da luz have said about the possibility that madeleine was abducted we give long answer because this issue is crucial in enabling us to assess whether the mccanns and their friends are telling the truth or not we will come to their constantly changing stories about how the alleged abductor may have entered the apartment and other major contradictions in their accounts of the events of 3rd may later in this document see reasons 16 and 20 the scenario that the mccanns and their friends have produced runs as follows they say that the abductor must have been watching the apartment for several days before snatching madeleine on 3rd may that they the mccanns went down to the tapas bar at the ocean club at around 830pm that evening though that timing is disputed by others who say it may have been up to halfanhour later that dr matthew oldfield checked the apartment from the outside at around 900pm to 903pm that dr gerry mccann returned to his apartment 5a from the tapas bar to check on his children at around 905pm to 907pm that dr gerry mccann was briefly in all four rooms of their holiday apartment during which time he checked his children he also says he spent an unusually long time in the loo about 5 minutes he tells us that he paused briefly over madeleines bed and thought to himself how very lucky he was to have such beautiful child that dr gerry mccann noticed that the door to the childrens room was wider open than before he says that at 830pm it had been open at an angle of about 45 degrees half open he remembers he says that when he went to check the children at 905pm the door was now open at an angle of 60 degrees two thirds open that the door so dr gerry mccann claims was now at 905pm open more than it was before at 830pm may suggest that the abductor was already in the room when he checked on the children though he says he only realised this possibility some months after the events of the day it is clearly an unlikely scenario dr gerry mccann says the abductor might have been hiding behind the door or in wardrobe while he spent several minutes doing his check on the children that dr gerry mccann left the room after checking on the children at around 909pm or 910pm he then says he encountered tv cameraman jeremy jes wilkins on the road back to the tapas bar at the ocean club and was talking to him for about 1015 minutes between 910pm and 925pm jeremy wilkins confirms the meeting but says it only lasted three minutes see reason 16 below that ms jane tanner partner of dr russell obrien saw man walking purposefully with child in his arms along the top of the road running alongside the mccanns apartment we will come to the reliability of ms tanners observations later she initially said the man had been walking in the opposite direction she has stuck to her account that she saw this man at almost exactly 915pm that the mccanns left their apartment unlocked this contrasts with what they said on may 3rd when they claimed the abductor had forced entry into the apartment by jemmying open the shutters they changed this story very soon afterwards when the evidence did not support that please see reason 9 in this leaflet below the mccanns now say therefore that the abductor must have entered their apartment through the unlocked patio door that the mccanns now claim that the fact that the window to the childrens room was found open and the shutters partly open means that the abductor must have opened the window and the shutters which the mccanns had left closed from the inside climbed through the window and taken madeleine through that window that when dr kate mccann says she returned to the apartment to check on the children at 1000pm she knew instantly that madeleine had been abducted and then so did gerry minutes later when he is supposed to have arrived at the apartment dr kate mccann later told tv interviewer that because of the requirement for secrecy about the police investigation she could not explain why she knew instantly that madeleine had been abducted the photographs of the apartment taken by the portuguese police on the day after madeleine was reported missing do not show anything which would clearly point to an abduction certainly not damaged shutters now that the portuguese police have suspended their investigation into madeleines disappearance the mccanns have still not volunteered any explanation of why they both knew instantly that madeleine had been abducted going by the above scenario which the mccanns and their tapas 9 friends have maintained the abductor if there was one must have either entered the apartment before dr matthew oldfields check at around 903pm and dr gerry mccanns check at 905pm907pm the version the mccanns now want us to believe or after dr gerry mccann left at 909pm910pm and before he was allegedly seen by jane tanner at 915pm the problems with this abduction scenario there are many problems associated with the specific abduction scenario above that the mccanns and their tapas 9 friends have generated for start the portuguese police did forensic examination of the window sill through which it is claimed that the abductor must have climbed out with madeleine the portuguese police said that they found trace of any other person having made any impression on the windowsill moreover in addition the lichen on the outside windowsill appeared to be totally undisturbed and b the portuguese police only found dr kate mccanns fingerprints on the window noone elses all of this tells us that the abductor if indeed there ever was one did not escape with madeleine through the window further the window is high enough in the childrens room to make it physically very difficult for an abductor to climb through it it was reported to be 91cm above the floor exactly three feet the abductor would therefore have had to climb some three feet with madeleine with him in his arms or over his shoulder in addition he would have to have managed this feat without leaving any forensic traces on the windowsill madeleine must have weighed at least two stone 12kg task such as this would have meant balancing against the window frame itself in which case traces of clothing fibres would have been found even then it would have been almost impossible to climb through this window even if madeleine had been asleep it is surely even more unlikely that the abductor could have laid madeleine down on the floor or bed in the childrens bedroom then climbed out of the window and then reached back inside the bedroom to pick madeleine out of the room all of this without madeleine waking up this whole abduction operation would clearly have been still more difficult either if madeleine had woken up whilst being abducted or one or both twins had done so to maintain the abduction scenario therefore it is necessary to believe that madeleine slept through the entire abduction operation moreover to escape via the window as the mccanns claim the abductor would have had to open the shutters mark warners however explained that it was only possible to open the shutters from the inside they are operated by pulling cord or strap on the inside it is highly relevant fact again confirmed by mark warners that when these heavy metal shutters were opened the whole process is extremely noisy but noone heard the shutters being opened moreover the childrens room was directly overlooked by tall block of apartments on the other side of the street had the abductor really climbed out of that window he would have been in the view of dozens of windows overlooking apartment 5a we now know that the shutters to apartment 5a were actually closed when the police and mark warners staff arrived to check them the mccanns initial explanation for this fact were that the shutters must have been closed by the abductor as well as opened by him we have seen that the shutters could not be opened from the outside this claim by the mccanns that the abductor must have tried to close the shutters behind him prompts two related and very obvious questions 1 having gained entry through an open patio door what would possess an abductor to leave via threefoot high closed window with the shutters also closed the mccanns convoluted abduction scenario would require him to have opened the windows and shutters then tried to close the shutters behind him when he could have simply walked through the alreadyopen patio doors and 2 why and how having allegedly scooped up madeleine in his arms and opened the window and the shutters would he have had the time and the physical ability to then close the shutters all without making any sound or leaving any trace without being seen by anyone and without waking either madeleine or the twins moreover all this would have had to have been accomplished in the dark unless the alleged abductor switched the lights on when he entered the apartment and then remembered to switch them off again as he was making his exit noone saw any lights on in the apartment the mccanns have admitted that they left the children in the darkness when they went out for their evenings entertainment therefore to sum up according to the mccanns scenario the abductor would have to have first either picked an opportunity to enter the apartment after the mccanns had left for the tapas bar at between 830pm and 900pm or entered the apartment immediately after he had seen first dr matthew oldfield and then gerry mccann enter and leave the apartment at around 909pm910pm note if the former of these two alternatives then the abductor must have been in the apartment with dr gerry mccann during the five minutes or so he was checking on the children as dr mccann indeed claimed last year second walked through the open patio door without being seen third found madeleine in the dark fourth picked her up without waking her or the twins fifth opened the window without leaving any fingerprints sixth opened the shutters with nobody hearing him doing so and once again without leaving any fingerprints seventh climbed through the window carrying madeleine with him again without being seen by anyone and again without leaving any fingerprints and eighth he would then have had to close the very noisy shutters using controls operated from the inside while still having madeleine in his arms or having laid her down on the patio the operation of climbing through the window would have been physically very difficult if not impossible to do without even brushing away even tiny piece of the yearsold lichen growing on the windowsill or b leaving any clothing fibres or other forensic evidence he must in addition have accomplished this whole operation in near total darkness and without being seen or heard by anyone except for the highly suspect evidence of jane tanner which we will deal with later if he had madeleine in his arms and bearing in mind he was in near darkness he would have been unable to see anything below her or much to either side as he fumbled through the window and shutters and tried to escape from the apartment precincts why he would do this when there was an open patio door to walk back through is utterly incomprehensible the only reason the mccanns came up with this wholly improbable scenario is that they had to explain to the portuguese police and to the outside world why the normally closed window was open and the normallyclosed shutters were partially open this whole incredible abduction scenario unconfirmed by any forensics whatsoever and indeed contradicted by dr kate mccanns fingerprints on the window is so impossible to believe that we can surely say this did not happen now let us look for moment at the mccanns theory that the abductor had been casing the joint for several days beforehand and then pounced and abducted madeleine when he had the chance the mccanns claim that he would have been closely watching them including observing what the mccanns claim as their routine of halfhourly checking though to be frank the evidence suggests that neither they nor their tapas 9 friends checked on their children halfhourly or even at all whilst they were out wining and dining the mccanns have gone further and have suggested in lengthy tv interview for the bbcs panorama programme that the abductor must have been making notes on their movements allegedly carefully observing the times of their departures from the apartment but this does not seem plausible given that neither the mccanns nor their tapas 9 friends have given any details of how often if at all they were checking on their children whilst out wining and dining another problem about the mccanns abduction scenario is that there is nowhere that the abductor could have been observing the mccanns apartment without being seen unless that is he was living or operating from one of the flats opposite the mccanns apartment some of which overlooked it it is understood that the occupants of these flats have all been investigated and their statements corroborated none of them had anyone in their flat who was watching the mccanns apartment nor was anyone seen acting suspiciously or hanging around in that area during the week the mccanns and their friends were there the other obvious problem about the claim of an abductor casing the joint is this suppose an abductor had been watching the mccanns apartment day in and day out on the mccanns own timeline he would have seen the mccanns leave for the tapas bar at 830pm if therefore as claimed an abductor had been watching the premises he would presumably have chosen this moment to abduct madeleine ie immediately after drs gerry and kate mccann had left for the tapas bar on their own account at around 830pm yet if he had entered the flat just after the mccanns left at 830pm how come he was not long gone 3540 minutes later when dr gerry mccann did his check after all dr gerry mccann now believes that the abductor may have even been present for the entire five minutes or so that he was doing his 905pm to 910pm check yet further difficulty for this improbable scenario is that dr matthew oldfield claims that he did two checks one at around 855pm900pm various times have been given for this alleged check and the other around 930pm dr oldfield claims that during his 900pm visit he checked from the outside but saw and heard nothing he also said that the shutters were tight shut if indeed the abductor really had entered before both dr matthew oldfields alleged check around 900pm and dr mccanns check around 905pm then he was exceptionally lucky to put it mildly not to have been detected by either man there are equal if not even greater problems with the suggestion that the abductor entered the apartment and removed madeleine only after drs oldfield and mccann had done their checks would any abductor really have dashed into the apartment after first seeing dr oldfield checking the outside of the apartment at around 900pm and then seen gerry spending five minutes or so checking between 905pm and 910pm it would surely have been far too risky and if he entered the apartment after dr gerry mccann left at 910pm he would scarcely have had time to enter the flat remove madeleine open the window and shutters close them behind him etc and then be seen by jane tanner at 915pm sadly british newspaper or magazine has offered an analysis like the one above of the unlikelihood of the abduction having occurred in the way the mccanns and their tapas 9 friends claim it must have happened british people interested in the true facts of the case have had to rely on websites internet forums and blogs for such analysis 8 the mccanns immediate and insistent cry of abduction excluding all other possibilities at around 1000pm on thursday 3rd may the abduction alert was triggered by dr kate mccann reportedly screaming and shouting shes gone and theyve taken her and then running down to the tapas bar to alert her friends who were allegedly all wining and dining there but with the mccanns later admitting that they may have left the patio door open could not madeleine have perhaps wandered off and either been found by someone or perhaps fallen and hurt herself after all there had been reports that madeleine had in fact run out of the apartment one night earlier that week and been found hiding in the bushes outside the apartment dr gerry mccann effectively conceded this when he told police in his statement that madeleine ran off ahead one night on our return to the apartment but ran out of the apartment hiding from us yet dr kate mccann was to say in number of tv interviews later that i knew instantly that she had been abducted questioned on tv about why she immediately thought that she refused to elaborate she hid behind the claim that she could say nothing further about her reasons because of the portuguese judicial systems secrecy rules apparently making it crime to discuss any aspect of the investigation yet she was happy to discuss number of other aspects of the investigation which she felt much more comfortable answering even though these were also covered by the same secrecy rules the couple then immediately proceeded to inform the british media both directly and through friends that madeleine had been abducted they informed their nearest relatives that madeline had undoubtedly been abducted dr gerry mccann told her motherinlaw susan healy that night theres been disaster madeleine has been abducted while dr kate mccann later spoke to her mother and said shes gone mum shes gone later the mccanns were to tell some of their relatives that the abduction line must be maintained at all costs they repeatedly told their relatives that there was other possibility very soon after madeleine was reported missing dr gerry mccann spoke to his wife kates mother mrs susan healy during that conversation mrs healy struggling to understand what might have happened to her granddaughter began offering other possible explanations as to why she might have disappeared but gerry mccann was adamantly insistent that kates mother must believe that madeleine had been abducted he stressed to her that it was vital that she like he and his wife kate should believe what he was telling her quite apart from all the above and contrary to the mccanns insistence that madeleine always slept like log once she had fallen asleep family members reported that madeleine did in fact have tendency to wake up and wander after being put to bed this was confirmed in two important ways by dr gerry mccann admitting that when he saw the door to the childrens room open wider than usual if he did that is his immediate thought was that madeleine might have woken up and gone to get drink or gone to the toilet she would hardly be likely to do this if she always slept soundly b by dr kate mccann claiming that she and her husband deliberately left the patio door open in case there was fire and the children woke up clearly also whatever the true explanation for madeleine running around in the bushes outside the mccanns apartment she had mind of her own the immediate flat denial by the mccanns that there was any other possible explanation for madeleine being missing other than having been abducted was in itself suspicious 9 the mccanns false claim that the abductor had forced entry by jemmying open the shutters the mccanns were very clear from the word go that madeleine had been snatched from apartment 5a because they said initially the metal shutters to the property had been forced open from the outside how do we know they said this we know it from the mccanns relatives who all reported to newspapers and other media that this is what kate and gerry mccann had told them their story was that the abductor had jemmied open the shutters from the outside and then climbed in through the window the abductor had had to do this the mccanns assured the police and the media because the apartment was locked the abductor would then have had to climb out of the window again and close the metal shutters by pulling them down using control strap from the inside but within hours both the portuguese police and staff from mark warners the holiday company with whom the mccanns and their friends were staying had thoroughly checked the shutters their unanimous view was the shutters have not been forced open there were signs of forced entry following that evidence the mccanns rapidly changed their story they now made up an elaborate new version of possible events as we have discussed above they said that on reflection perhaps they had left the patio door unlocked and that the abductor must have walked through the open patio door then climbed out of the window with madeleine opening the window opening the shutters then closing the shutters behind him many people pointed out however how unlikely it was that couple would knowingly leave holiday apartment unlocked with things like passports and valuables inside never mind three defenceless sleeping children all under four years old the forensic evidence that the shutters had not been forced open then gave the mccanns further problem as the press asked if the patio door was left unlocked then perhaps madeleine opened it and wandered off the mccanns were so anxious to maintain the abduction theory that they then insisted madeline was not strong enough to have opened the patio doors that story in turn contradicted the earlier claim by dr kate mccann that the patio doors had been kept unlocked so that the children could escape in case of fire if dr kate mccann was now right in insisting that madeleine was not strong enough to open the patio doors it would of course have been utterly pointless to leave the patio doors unlocked in case of fire 10 the shutters could only be opened from the inside and only kate mccanns fingerprints were on the window dr kate and dr gerry mccann claimed that at 1000pm they found the shutters the windows and the curtain all open at first as we saw above they claimed that the abductor forced entry that way later they changed their story to suggest that the abductor must have come in another way and climbed out of the window but the police only found the fingerprints of one person on the windows dr kate mccann the window was also found to have been very recently cleaned that strongly suggests that it was her not the abductor who opened the window doubt during the evening of 3rd may in order to create the abduction scenario 11 contradictions between the account of jeremy wilkins and the accounts of dr gerry mccann and jane tanner when jeremy jes wilkins tv producer also on holiday at the ocean club complex during the same week gave an initial statement to the police about bumping into dr gerry mccann at just after 900pm prior to talking to him for three minutes he told police that he met dr mccann on the road beneath the mccanns apartment one unconfirmed report was that wilkins had seen dr mccann checking the shutters from the outside we may also mention here that there are number of contradictions concerning this brief meeting between jeremy wilkins and mr gerry mccann including wilkins says the meeting lasted just 3 minutes dr gerry mccann claimed it was 10 to 15 minutes big discrepancy b wilkins says he crossed the road to talk to him whilst dr gerry mccann claims it was he who crossed the road to talk to wilkins c the two men disagreed about the subject matter of their conversation d ms jane tanner claimed she saw both men as she walked right past them but neither man recalls seeing ms tanner 12 the failure of both the doctors mccann and their friend jane tanner to talk to each other for 24 hours about her claimed sighting of the alleged abductor according to many reports and confirmed in an article by david james smith in the times published in december 2007 the mccanns and their friend jane tanner did not talk to each other for at least 24 hours some reports claimed it was two days about what she claimed to have seen at 915pm that night namely person walking off with child looking like madeleine the mccanns maintained that they found madeleine gone at 1000pm on 3rd may jane tanner has claimed throughout that she saw man carrying child walking purposefully across the top of the road as she was walking away from the tapas bar at 915pm on 3rd may dr kate mccann cried out at 1000pm on 3rd may that madeleine had been abducted dr gerry mccann followed suit and word soon spread that madeleine was missing after neighbours heard the commotion mark warners within 30 minutes activated their missing child procedures soon dozens perhaps hundreds of people were looking around praia da luz for madeleine the police had been informed and soon put out an alert wanting any information that could help to determine what happened to madeleine many sources confirm that the mccann absolutely insisted from the word go that madeleine had been abducted during the first 48 hours after she was reported missing there was massive search for her by police and local people but according to an article by david james smith in the times which included an exclusive and extended interview with the mccanns jane tanner and the mccanns did not speak to each other for 48 hours because each of them was too busy other reports said it was 24 hours it must be clear to anyone who ponders this point that if there really had been an abduction and if jane tanner really had seen him as she claimed then tanner would have spoken to the mccanns and the police about what she saw without moments delay she has since claimed that she did not realise the significance of what she had seen most people will accept that this is simply not credible claim we will deal with other reasons why we cannot rely on anything jane tanner has said later on in this booklet see reason 16 of our booklet below the failure of jane tanner and gerry mccann to talk to each other about the abductor is all the more extraordinary when it became clear in august 2008 that within two hours of the report that madeleine had been abducted jane tanners partner russell obrien had prepared rough notes on the events of that evening which included the entry jane saw stranger walking with child 920pm it seems clear that it was part of the plan of the mccanns and their tapas 9 friends to rely on jane tanners alleged sighting from the word go in order to prove that there really had been an abduction from the outset jane tanner said she had little idea of what the man looked like but was insistent in confirming that he could have been carrying madeleine if she had been so sure why did she not tell somebody as soon as everyone realised that madeleine was missing her delay in giving this information to police despite its initial lack of clarity see reason 16 in our booklet would have greatly increased any abductors chance of escape if there really had been man in the vicinity especially one who might have been carrying child it was clearly information the police would want to be able to follow up immediately if jane tanners sighting had been genuine there is possible rational explanation for her delaying reporting what she saw for 24 hours or maybe even longer her delay never mind all the inconsistencies in her story suggests that her various accounts may have all been fabrications see below in reason 16 13 the insistence of gerry mccann in releasing description of the abductor based solely on the claims made by jane tanner and with the reluctant consent of the portuguese police on friday 25th may the portuguese police under severe pressure from gordon brown as was admitted publicly at the time see appendix 1 of our booklet issued vague description of possible abductor the description as relayed on the bbc news bulletin that night ran as follows white aged 3540 5 10 in height wearing beige or light trousers and wearing dark jacket and shoes as we now know this description issued over three weeks after madeleine was reported missing was based solely on jane tanners dubious sighting the issuing of this description was against the advice of the portuguese police and only happened after future prime minister gordon brown had intervened by phoning the portuguese police and insisting that the police issue description in addition mr brown asked that gerry mccann be authorised to make statement direct to the press accompanying the release of this description by the portuguese police we may note also that some time after this description was issued dr gerry mccann became upset and criticised the portuguese police maintaining that the height of the man should have been stated as 5 7 the police had recorded the height given by jane tanner as 170cm to 175cm the metric 175cm converts to 5 9 whereas 170cm converts to 5 7 quite why dr gerry mccann made such fuss about this minor discrepancy is not clear in his statement made with his wife in front of many of the worlds cameras and journalists he gave description of an abductor so vague as to be virtually useless here is his full statement verbatim we very much welcome the decision of the portuguese authorities to release details of man seen by witness here in praia da luz on thursday 3rd may the night of madeleines disappearance the release of this important information follows an earlier meeting that we had with senior portuguese police officers meeting that kate and i both found to be amicable and very constructive we feel sure that this sighting of man with what appeared to be child in his arms is both significant and relevant to madeleines abduction and we would appeal once again for anyone who may have seen him or anything else suspicious on or around the 3rd of may to come forward and tell the police for instance was this man seen anywhere else in or near the town with child or what appeared to be child which direction was he heading in did he have vehicle whether you are local resident or holidaymaker who has since returned from portugal any information matter how unimportant you think it could be may be vital to help the portuguese and british police to find our daughter as we said yesterday we wish for nothing more than for madeleine to be home with us safe and well kate and i would also like to make it clear that as this is very much an ongoing investigation we will not be making any more public statements for the time being thank you months after this description was issued based solely on jane tanners statement to the police ms tanner came up with quite different description now claiming for example that the man looked swarthy and mediterranean we deal with that in more detail below the reason of course why the police were reluctant to issue this description at the time was because by then they had good grounds for suspecting that jane tanners claimed sighting was fabricated plus many other indications that the mccanns abduction claim was false 14 ignoring advice not to highlight madeleines coloboma eye defect the mccanns in the early stages of the investigation ignored the clearest possible advice from the portuguese and british police not to highlight madeleines eye defect the coloboma an iris defect where the black pupil of the eye has partly leaked into the rest of the iris if madeleine were still alive said the police giving out this information would have put madeleine at much greater risk of death in giving that advice their experience was that if the abductors were holding madeleine and realised that she could be identified very easily by the public they might then decide to kill her the mccanns went further and even trademarked madeleines coloboma on top of that dr gerry mccann cynically told one interviewer that the trade marking of madeleines eye defect had been valuable marketing ploy the parents conduct suggests that they knew madeleine was already dead they deliberately ignored sound advice not to make madeleine so recognisable that the abductors if she had been abducted and was still alive might have to kill her all the mccanns publicity posters strongly emphasised the coloboma placing madeleine at even greater risk it is also worth noting that the decision of the mccanns and their advisers to announce all claimed sightings of madeleine in the press giving details of possible locations and claiming for example that their private detectives were right on the trail of the kidnappers etc were also all actions which would have put madeleine at greater risk if she really had been abducted any information about the possible location of an abducted or kidnapped child is usually withheld by the police in order of course to avoid endangering the childs life 15 making longterm plans to mark madeleines alleged abduction whilst at the same time claiming she was alive and could still be found on 3rd june 2007 just one month after madeleine had disappeared dr gerry mccann was already planning big event to mark madeleines abduction he told the press we want big event to raise awareness that she is still missingit wouldnt be oneyear anniversary it will be sooner than that he had talked specifically of approaching celebrities like elton john to front major fundraising concert many people pointed out that parents one month after their daughter had gone missing and who were still frantically hoping their daughter would be found would even be thinking of planning for fundraising and publicity generating events several months ahead unless that is they had more than shrewd idea that madeleine would never be found less than month later on 28th june 2007 dr gerry mccann said i have doubt we will be able to sustain high profile for madeleines disappearance in the longterm how on earth we might ask could any father talk about organising concerts to generate publicity and plan to sustain longterm high profile for madeleines disappearance months into the future when there was still the possibility that the police might any day bring them news that madeleine had been found either alive or dead furthermore well in advance of 11th august which would be day 100 after madeleine disappeared dr gerry mccann and his pr advisers were already planning how to mark the 100th day since her abduction put simply dr gerry mccanns words are not those of someone who genuinely believes that his daughter has been abducted and that there still remains reasonable prospect of finding her they are much more likely to be the words of someone who knows perfectly well that their daughter will not be found in october 2007 the times reported on the mccanns plans for film or documentary about madeleine as follows clarence mitchell the mccanns spokesman would not speculate on whether gerry and kate would play themselves in any movie or whether their roles would be played by celebrity actors he said while it may be hugely entertaining and bit of fun to think of cast lists we are million miles away from that sort of thing the possibility of film or television project is expected to be discussed further when directors of the madeleine fund meet later this week 16 jane tanners everchanging stories of what the alleged abductor looked like and other problems with jane tanners accounts the accounts of jane tanner as to what the abductor might have looked like have changed significantly over time and there are number of other reasons for casting severe doubt on her stories we might note first as we saw above that within two hours or less of madeleines disappearance being reported three of the tapas 9 men dr russell obrien dr david payne and dr matthew oldfield were conferring about agreeing timeline about that evenings events and writing notes for the police most parents unlike these three would have made sure that their own children were safe and then joined in the local hunt for madeleine in the streets of praia da luz dr russell obrien made the notes he wrote 21h1021h15 jt ie jane tanner sees alleged abductor carrying child not only did the mccanns at 1000pm immediately claim that they knew there had been an abduction but also it seems the group already knew there had been an abductor this makes jane tanners initial failure to talk to dr gerry mccann about what she was supposed to have seen and the subsequent problems with jane tanners description of the abductor and her changes of story which we will now examine all the more strange and deeply suspect ms tanners first description of the abductor she claimed to have seen was that he was white had short hair was of average height and build and was carrying bundle maybe blanket she also claimed that she had seen the abductor on her way back from visiting her apartment to check on her two children and said that the abductor was walking in northerly direction ie away from the beach then when she gave second statement days later and of course after she had had time to confer with the mccanns she changed her story and told the portuguese police that she distinctly remembered seeing blondehaired girl wearing pyjamas with pinkish aspect once again there is rational explanation as to why she did not remember these details when first questioned by the time ms tanner gave her second statement dr gerry mccann had already displayed on the worlds tvs the type of pinkandwhite eeyore pyjamas that she had allegedly been wearing on that last night he held up amelies pyjamas telling us that these were identical to madeleines pyjamas except slightly smaller size in ms tanners second statement in most peoples minds there could be doubt she was telling the world that she really had seen the person who had carried madeleine away yet her description of the abductor was still vague at the time that she says she saw the abductor 915pm in early may it was already nearly dark twilight being about 830pm to 900pm she could not have had really clear sight of the abductor as there was minimal street lighting besides that she says she only saw him sideways on and as he was said to have been walking purposefully ie quickly across the top of the road she would have only noticed him for maximum of 34 seconds by the time of her second statement ms tanner changed two very important details from her initial account to the police now she said the abductor was heading southwards towards the beach she also said that she saw him not coming back from her apartment but going towards it from the tapas bar it may fairly be asked how she could have got both these matters so wrong it is another clear sign that she is fabricating her story suggesting in fact that neither account is true full six months after madeleine disappeared the mccanns and their pr advisers issued new description complete with artists impression of the man they said had snatched madeleine once again this new artists impression of the abductor was based solely on jane tanners alleged recollections but this time we were told that after several months ms tanners recall of what she had seen had dramatically improved contrary to the wellknown fact that over time peoples recollections fade how did this come about we were told in all seriousness that cognitive therapist had been working with ms tanner in several sessions and had enabled her to have clearer recollection of what she saw the identity of this cognitive therapist and hisher track record was not disclosed to us except that she was said to be american in addition we were told that an fbi trained forensic artist had helped her to draw her new much improved recollection of what the abductor looked like these references to cognitive therapist and an fbitrained artist were doubt meant to convince an increasinglysceptical british public that there was real basis for ms tanners memory having been so miraculously revived after an interval of six months we may ask however what purpose was served by releasing the highlypublicised artists impression whole six months after madeleine had disappeared it is also of more than passing interest that this mysterious fbitrained artist was found for the mccanns and for jane tanner by none other than the dubious private detective agency hired by the mccanns metodo 3 we say more about their activities in reason 21 below against that background let us now examine in more detail jane tanners new much more definite recollection released in november 2007 she now remembered that the abductor had long hair not hair short on top as she had claimed before she claimed on the panorama programme of 19 november the one thing i remember is the hairhe seemed to have quite lot of dark reasonablylongtotheneck hair she now said that his hair was sleek and black details she had apparently been unable to recollect the day after she saw him longer was the man white she now thought that the man looked more local or mediterraneanlooking and had swarthy skin his build now changed from medium to slim virtually the only details that remained unchanged were that he was wearing dark jacket lightcoloured or beige trousers and dark shoes all of this was based she claimed on sideways glimpse of him for what could have been more than three to four seconds in the dark in faint sodium lighting but the new artists impression based on ms tanners recovered memory revealed one very special new detail it included sketch of exactly the kind of white pyjamas madeleine was supposed to have been wearing that last night even down to the frills on the pyjama bottoms back in may 2007 when first questioned all she could recall was seeing bundle or blanket but now she boldly said i could tell it was child and i could see the feetand the bottom of the pyjamas and i just thought that childs not got any shoes on because you could see the feet moving away from the everchanging descriptions of the abductor there are other significant problems about ms tanners accounts first her account of how and when she saw the alleged abductor does not match the evidence of dr gerry mccann and another holidaymaker there at the time jeremy wilkins shortly after madeleines disappearance ms tanner was asked by the portuguese police to draw sketchmap of where she was when she claimed she saw the abductor after having initially said that she was on her way back to the tapas bar when she saw the abductor wilkins and dr gerry mccann she now produced sketch for the portuguese police which showed her on her way to her apartment to check on her two children as she passed by on the same side of the road both dr gerry mccann and the person he was talking to jeremy wilkins yet the bbc panorama programme on 19 november 2007 seen by millions and extensively researched by the bbc showed graphic with dr gerry mccann crossing the road to talk to wilkins with tanner on the opposite side of the road moreover neither of them recalls seeing jane tanner on the road at that time dr gerry mccann then had problem in that during the panorama programme jane tanner had placed him on the opposite side of the road while wilkins had placed them on the same side as jane tanner dr gerry mccann could hardly alter the testimony of mr wilkins and to argue publicly with him would only bring his motives into question so he was forced to confirm in his own statement that he and wilkins were indeed on the side of the road just by the patio steps to his apartment contrary to the graphic used in the panorama programme if jane tanner really had passed by them on the same side of the street as she originally claimed in her sketch to the police there is way that they could not have seen her put simply the accounts of dr gerry mccann wilkins and ms tanner contain significant contradictions the only thing agreed is that dr gerry mccann and wilkins were talking for at least three minutes dr gerry mccann claims it was much longer but neither dr gerry mccann nor wilkins saw either the abductor or jane tanner when they were having their conversation why did ms tanner get wrong all these details about dr gerry mccann talking to jeremy wilkins noone else was in the street at the time and indeed all indications suggest that praia da luz was very quiet at the time of the year early spring the question arises therefore did she really see dr gerry mccann and jeremy wilkins or far more likely did she perhaps hear of their meeting through other means and then had to think how she could explain having passed by them without being seen all of the above points when considered together serve to suggest very strongly that her various and varying accounts of seeing dr gerry mccann jeremy wilkins and the abductor may have been complete fabrications 17 dr gerry mccanns absolute insistence that the abductor was the man allegedly seen by jane tanner we have seen above that there are severe doubts to put it mildly about jane tanners account of having seen an abductor an additional reason for doubting that there ever was an abductor is dr gerry mccanns total reliance on her claimed sightings as his basis for issuing descriptions of the abductor if the abduction had really happened how for example could dr gerry mccann have known that ms tanner herself wasnt involved the portuguese police it is now clear were doubtful from the outset about the validity of jane tanners sighting and for very good reasons they refused to use it as the basis for issuing formal description of the alleged abductor yet just few days after jane tanner had given her initial vague description to the police dr gerry mccann insisted on going ahead with public description of man who he thought had abducted madeleine see reason 13 of our booklet above it was vague description and accompanied by sketch so vague as to be useless it merely showed an eggshaped head with some straight hair on the top and was immediately dubbed eggman the description was issued against the advice of the portuguese police who only agreed to release it after personal intervention from then chancellor of the exchequer now the british prime minister gordon brown this has been confirmed on the record it has also been confirmed that during the period leading up to gerrys description of the alleged abductor he spoke on the telephone nine times to gordon brown why would dr gerry mccann rely on such patently fabricated description probable answer is because by then three weeks after madeleine had been reported missing he was desperate to sustain the abduction story with what he represented to be credible sighting of the abductor fortunately for him and his wife the media did not probe the credibilty of the description at the time strangely the mccanns have always avoided commenting on another claimed sighting of man carrying child that night namely that by mr martin smith an irishman from drogheda county louth emerging from murphys bar near the beach at around 950pm he and his family had walked right past man carrying girl said to be about four years old the man was said by mr smith to have averted his gaze when he passed the smiths the portuguese police report about mr smiths evidence stated on 26th may mr smithdescribed by leicestershire police as decent man who was not looking for fame came to portugal to give statement to the portuguese police and told them that he saw in street in praia da luz man carrying child in his arms with the childs head resting on the mans left shoulder the man was 5 9 to 5 11 tall 3435 years old with short brown hair carrying blonde girl wearing pyjamas roughly four years of age mr smith then added these details the man was carrying the child with her head against his left shoulder and her arms hanging down alongside the body she had bare feet pale skin blonde shoulderlength hair and was wearing light coloured or pink pyjamas the portuguese police report continued on 20 september mr smith once again contacted the authorities he was distressed explaining that when he saw the mccanns on the tv news on 9 september getting off the plane that had just landed in england he said the way gerry mccann was carrying his sean on his shoulder was exactly the same way the unidentified man he had seen in praia da luz had been carrying the blonde girl he had seen he said he was now nearly certain that it was dr gerry mccann that he had seen walking towards the beach at 950pm on 3rd may two weeks later however the man leading the portuguese investigation goncalo amaral was sacked in further statement made on 23 january this year mr smith said he could only be 60 to 80 sure that the man he had seen was dr mccann that plus the fact that dr gerry mccanns friends provided an alibi testifying that he could not have been where mr smith saw the man as he was with them in the tapas bar at the time persuaded the new investigating team to conclude that mr smiths evidence was longer of interest two things are noteworthy about mr smiths evidence the initial description that mr smith gave of the unidentified man matched that of dr gerry mccann almost perfectly second the mccanns and their advisers would never comment on the smith sighting though they repeatedly made use of jane tanners unreliable claims to back up their description of the alleged abductor 18 the commitment of the mccanns and their tapas 9 friends to pact of silence about what had happened to madeleine in june portuguese newspaper sol contacted both dr gerry mccann and his close friend dr david payne to ask them some questions about the events leading up to madeleines disappearance dr payne was reported to have reacted angrily he told the sol journalist we have pact this is our matter it is our business only this rapidly became known as the infamous pact of silence of the mccanns and their friends which is how sol titled their article since then most of tapas 9 apart from the mccanns have indeed remained almost totally silent about the events which led to madeleines disappearance among them only jane tanner has spoken on the record at length and that was merely to give rambling and wholly unconvincing account of her seeing the alleged abductor to the panorama programme on 19th november 2007 why it must be asked would the mccanns friends refer to pact of silence about what they know when there is an international effort to find madeleine there can only be one rational explanation namely that they all share guilty secret which they wish to hide the mccanns urgent flight back to the relative safety of england after they were made official suspects and their subsequent refusal to attend second reconstruction of the events of 3rd may in order that the discrepancies in the tapas 9 friends statements could if possible be cleared up are simply further evidences that their secret pact is intended to prevent anyone discovering what really took place that day according to press reports not one of the tapas 9 group agreed to the portuguese polices request to take part in second reconstruction these facts undermine any little credibility that any of them have left that they are really interested in finding out what happened to madeleine 19 the failure of the mccanns friends to search for madeleine the night she disappeared according to number of reports which have never been contradicted while hundreds of people including staff of mark warners and many local people searched the area around the ocean club apartments for hours after madeleine went missing not one of the mccanns friends known as the tapas 9 bothered to do so they all went to bed that night confirmation of that was provided in an article written by bridget odonnell jeremy wilkins partner of the guardian in december 2007 one of the three tapas 9 men knocked on the door of wilkins and odonnell at around 100am to say madeleine has been abducted jes wilkins asked if they needed help searching wilkins was told by the unnamed tapas 9 doctor reports odonnell there is nothing you can do nor were there any reports of the friends searching in the days following that is consistent with them knowing that madeleine was already dead 20 frequent changes to their story and numerous contradictions there is so much that could be written about how the mccanns and some of their tapas 9 friends have changed their stories in addition there have been so many contradictions within and between their evidences that it is only possible here to give the very briefest of summaries the point is often made that if you ask number of witnesses who have seen the same incident to give their accounts their stories may well vary in certain details there may be apparent inconsistencies between them however in such circumstances you will seldom get so many outright contradictions and certainly not multiple changes of story in order to try fit them to story socalled backfitting here is very short list of some of these many significant contradictions 1 dr kate mccann was said to have read bedtime stories to the children on the night madeleine went missing but in another version it is claimed that dr gerry mccann read the bedtime stories 2 the mccanns initially claimed that they locked all their doors including the patio doors and that the abductor had forced or jemmied open the shutters then when the police and mark warners disproved their false claim the mccanns changed their story and said that they must have left the patio door open and so the abductor must have left through the shutters and climbed out of the window 3 originally the mccanns said they left the door near the childrens door unlocked then when the police cast doubt on that story the mccanns said it was different door the patio door that they must have left unlocked 4 multiple changes of story by dr matthew oldfield about when he is supposed to have carried out his checks at apartment 5a on the night madeleine disappeared 5 multiple changes of story by the mccanns and some of their tapas 9 friends about how often they were checking their children first they said hourly in another quote it was said to be every 15 minutes and finally they all agreed to say every half hour 6 one of the nannies charlotte pennington changed her story about when she last saw madeleine on 3rd may 7 dr gerry mccann was said to be have been hanging around tennis courts at 530pm600pm but other accounts say he was having high tea with all the family and charlotte pennington at the same time 8 the times that dr gerry and dr kate mccann are claimed to have arrived at the tapas bar on the evening of 3rd may vary from 830pm to 858pm 9 dr matthew oldfield says all of the tapas 9 except dr kate mccann were at the tapas bar when the alarm was raised but jane tanner says she was absent at this time 10 jane tanner says she saw the abductor but dr gerry mccann and jeremy wilkins were in the same road at the same time but did not see him 11 jane tanner said in her statement and in drawing she did for the police that she walked up the lefthandside of the street right past dr gerry mccann and jeremy wilkins but on the panorama programme she changes this to say they were on the opposite side of the road 21 the hiring of very dubious firms of socalled private investigators much has been made of the mccanns decision to use costly private investigators to search for madeleine allegedly because the portuguese police were negligent in not following up proper leads here we look at what action the mccanns and their helpers have taken with regard to private investigators and examine the track record of these investigators that may tell us something about whether the mccanns really think that madeleine was abducted on 25th may 2007 just 22 days after madeleine was reported missing in bbc interview with jane hill the mccanns were asked if now that they had already netted 300000 in the helping to find madeleine fund they would use any of that money for private investigators dr gerry mccann responded the advice we have received is that private investigations will not help at the moment despite this clear claim the control risks group whose activities include private investigation announced in september that they had been helping the mccanns since may and were in regular contact with them throughout although control risks group say that their work includes carrying out various forms of private investigation there was evidence that they had ever had any experience or successes in the field of tracing missing persons let alone missing children it is complete mystery what their role was and how much money the helping to find madeleine trust fund paid them the mccanns then went on to hire very dubious spanish detective agency metodo 3 at cost of several hundred thousand pounds all for obvious benefit or results once again this firm of private investigators had known track record in finding missing children on the contrary they were much better known for their expertise in the fields of money laundering and fraud also we may note that this was spanish agency and based in barcelona right on the very opposite side of the iberian peninsula which includes both portugal and spain their headquarters were therefore some 500 miles from praia da luz many of those involved in running metodo 3 had controversial histories its director and leading detective mr francisco marco was described simply as crook by leading portuguese criminologist mr moita flores well known portuguese writer joana morais volunteered the opinion that i trust in mr moita flores opinion about francisco marco many of the metodo 3 detectives were once arrested in phonetapping scandal linked to leading politicians and businessmen five senior members of metodo 3 including francisco marco were held in 1995 amid claims of industrial and political espionage with marcos mother martina fernandez lado 57 who founded the agency in 1985 being led away in handcuffs she was arrested as she handed client cassette containing an allegedly illegally phonetapped conversation at the same police raided metodo 3s barcelona offices seizing handguns ammunition listening equipment cassettes and transcripts of taped phone calls subsequently mrs lado was found to have made phone calls offering telephone tapping servicce for fee of around 20000 mrs lados husband francisco marco poyuelo and mr marcos brother francisco gabriel fernandez lado were also arrested it must be added for the record that none of them were subsequently convicted of any offence sergio sancelestino an employee of spanish telephone company telefonica was suspected of illegal phone tapping and was proved to have close links with employees of metodo 3 one spanish private investigator told the daily mail metodo 3 have portrayed themselves as the best investigators in the world the truth is they are nothing of the sort their murky background is riddled with controversy marco claimed at one time that his agency had 40 people employed fulltime or parttime in the search for madeleine it is far from clear what these claimed 40 people might have been doing the controversy over metodo 3 was not helped by the mccanns and their supporters giving out totally contradictory information about who was funding them on the one hand it was claimed by the mccanns multi millionairebacker brian kennedy to spanish tv channel antena 3 that he was wholly funding metodo 3 yet on 29 november 2007 dr gerry mccann on his blog wrote that the helping to find madeleine trust fund was paying the 50000 month fees both could not be right during the autumn of 2007 mr marco claimed that we believe she is in an area not very far from the iberian peninsula and north africa adding we have proof of her movements after her kidnap and we know she was alive the day after her disappearance we are not certain when she left portugal i talk of certainties because we know which group may have her or could have kidnapped her to then sell her on i cannot say who she is with because we are putting together conclusive proof that we can present to the authorities mr marco also made widelypublicised claims in the runup to christmas 2007 that metodo 3 were closing in on the abductors that he knew who snatched madeleine and that metodo 3 were not maybebut very close to finding him he bragged that he was 100 sure that madeleine was still alive and would be home by christmas many british tabloids covered this emotive story on their front pages without questioning marcos clearly extravagant claims in february 2008 the times published an article by reporter christine toomey about metodo 3 titled madeleine mccann and metodo 3 private eyes public lies it is well worth looking at one or two extracts from her article first toomey noted that on the day mr marco bragged about madeleine mccann being home by christmas metodo 3 moved from cramped premises above grocers shop specialising in sausages in barcelonas commercial district to multimillionpound suite of offices in grand villa on one of the citys most prestigious boulevards at the time metodo 3 were four months into contract with the mccanns worth reported 600000 in total second on visiting these plush new offies toomey noted there is discernible ringing of telephones little sign of activity of any kind other than woman searching for lead to take pet poodle for walk and the occasional toing and froing of workmen putting finishing touches to the sleek remodelling of the office complex opposite the boardroom is an openplan area of around half dozen cubicles equipped with banks of phones and computers most are empty when i arrive before her interview with mr marco starts his cousin jose luis warned toomey sternly we wont answer any questions about maddie maddie is off limits is that understood she continued after talking to marco for halfanhour i concluded that what motivates him as much as if not more than his professed desire to present madeleine with the doll he boasts he carries around in his briefcase to hand to her when he finds her is sense of selfregard selfpublicity and money toomey noted that up to its involvement in the madeleine mccann case metodo 3 specialised in investigating financial swindles industrial espionage and insurance fraud during her interview with marco he referred to his sixyearold learning to read claiming because he can read about the madeleine mccann case he knows i am the most famous detective in the world asked about why the mccanns chose metodo 3 he answered because we were the only ones who proposed coherent hypothesis about the disappearance of their daughter our principal line of enquiry is paedophiles yet by contrast in an interview published just three weeks earlier in the newspaper vanguardia marco had claimed that metodo 3 had around 40 people here and in morocco working there on the basis that madeleine was smuggled to morocco where blonde girl like madeleine would be sought by familiies as status symbol marco went on to claim that metodo 3 was receiving an average of 100 calls day from the four quarters of the globe and to have half dozen translators answering them in different languages toomey describes how the interview with marco ends when i ask him to elaborate on the 23 missing children he claims his agency has located in the past marco eases himself away from the table for the first time tilting far back in his chair he cannot talk about that on the grounds of confidentiality he says shortly after this his cousin jose luis who has sat mostly silent until now calls time on the interview with chopping motion of his hand in february 2008 another metodo 3 private detective known as antonio jimenez or antonio jr aged 53 working for the mccanns as their detective in charge of special operations was charged with stealing 400 kilograms of cocaine nearly half ton from an illegal shipment of 1500 kg said to have been worth 25 million on ship coming from venezuela he had been chief inspector of the drugs and organised crime unit for the barcelona police at the time those 400 kilos of cocaine went missing from the port of barcelona but he had left the police to work for metodo 3 in august 2005 just when an internal investigation was looking into how those 400 kilos had disappeared he was remanded in custody by barcelona court on on charges of breach of trust corruption corruption of public officials and illicit criminal association it had been antonio jimenez of metodo 3 who had travelled to morocco and whilst he was there was able somehow to find number of witnesses who claimed to have seen madeleine it was around the time of jimenezs trip to morocco that the moroccan government took the unusual step of expelling man who had been visiting hotels and garages in various parts of morocco offering people money if they could claim to have seen girl looking like madeleine coincidence perhaps then it was revealed in summer this year that the mccanns and the helping to find madeleine fund had spent some 1 million on firm of private investigators called oakley international described by the mccanns pr spokesman clarence mitchell as the big boys thus suggesting they were intenationally reputed and experienced private investigators but enquiries revealed that the firm was only set up in 2007 and consisted of people nobody had ever heard of once again oakley international had absolutley track record of successfully investigating the disappearance of missing children to sum up the mccanns have hired three socalled private detective agencies after nearly yearandahalf it is doubtful that they have obtained any useful information whatsoever about the whereabouts of madeleine on the other hand they may secretly have been carrying out other missions for the mccanns not one of these three agencies has any proven track record of searching successfully for missing or abducted children one of them metodo 3 is tainted with much more than whiff of criminality within its ranks another firm oakley international has only just been set up and quite simply has track record for anything the mccanns or we should say the helping to find madeleine fund appears to have spent up to 2 million or more on these three companies so far with discernible result putting two and two together we suggest that the purpose of spending some 2 million on shady firms of private investigators with record whatsover of successfully tracing missing children was not to find madeleine the mccanns and the fund trustees must have had other purposes in mind 22 the mccanns rush right from the outset to hire team of top lawyers including the appointment of britains top extradition lawyer it has been widely reported and not denied that team of lawyers flew out from leicestershire within 48 hours of madeleine being reported missing possibly the very next day how several lawyers could help find an abducted child has never been explained nor has it been explained who asked these lawyers to fly out to praia da luz and who paid for them shortly after that the mccanns had got sufficient funds organised to afford top lawyers in both britain and portugal again how lawyers could help to find madeleine is not clear the likely purpose of all these lawyers was not to help find madeleine but rather to defend the mccanns and possibly some of their tapas 9 friends as well from serious criminal charges it suggests that from the outset the mccanns and their tapas 9 friends knew they would probably come under scrutiny and investigation when the mccanns were about to made suspects in the investigation of their daughters disappearance they rushed to hire the uks top extradition lawyer michael caplan qc who successfully represented general pinochet when the spanish government tried to extradite him to spain for crimes against humanity as many have pointed out innocent parents would not need team of lawyers out with them within 48 hours nor would they need britains top extradition lawyers if they had done nothing wrong and madeleine really had been snatched by an abductor they would surely have been happy to co operate in full with the portuguese police and would not have needed any lawyers it is of perhaps of more than passing interest that one of the mccanns portuguese lawyers mr pinto abreu has been accused in the past of proposing that his clients engage in illegal activities 23 not staying protectively close to the twins after madeleines disappearance according to dr kate mccanns account on seeing madeleines bed empty and the twins fast asleep in their cot she rushed down to the tapas bar crying madeleines gone or according to other accounts theyve taken her in doing so she left behind her twins as she admitted herself in an unlocked room allegedly believing with absolute certainty that there was an abductor in the vicinity she her husband and her friends had mobile phones on them so she could have easily summoned them to help her by mobile phone she therefore exposed the twins to immediate potential risk of also being abducted especially as she says was so utterly convinced that madeleine had just been abducted moreover the mccanns continued to leave their twins at the ocean club crÃ¨che during the period immediately after madeleine disappeared preferring to spend time not with their two remaining children but instead visiting the pope the white house and campaigning parents whose child had truly been abducted by stranger would be especially protective towards their other children and want to be close by their side as much as possible it is possible for example that if madeleine had really been abducted staff of the crÃ¨che or those known to them could have been responsible for or implicated in the abduction as thousands of other parents have pointed out any parent who was really distraught at the loss of child after genuine abduction would not have let their twins out of their sight they would have clung to the precious two they had left in the world 24 the mccanns apprehension about their phone calls and emails being monitored the mccanns expressed anxiety when rumours surfaced about the possibility that the portuguese police might be monitoring their telephone calls and that their emails might be intercepted it must be asked what innocent parent genuinely concerned that their child had been abducted and anxiously awaiting news of possible sighting of her would worry about that 25 kate mccanns decision to wash cuddle cat the pink toy despite the mccanns belief that it may have been handled by the abductor and the two versions of where cuddle cat was left the mccanns gave the police and the media two quite different versions about where madeleines favourite toy cuddle cat had been found when dr kate mccann entered her apartment at 1000pm on may 3rd one version was that cuddle cat had been left on high shelf or ledge the other version eventually supported by photo released by the portuguese police showing cuddle cat lying on madeleines bed was that the abductor had left cuddle cat on her bed it would be clear from the above and from the doctors mccanns unshakeable conviction that madeleine had been abducted that there was distinct possibility that the abductor might have left his dna on cuddle cat yet dr kate mccann decided to wash cuddle cat allegedly because cuddle cat was dirty with suncream by doing so however she and her husband would both have known that they might thereby have washed out any possible dna traces that the abductor if there ever was one would have left on the soft toy in relation to cuddle cat many mothers have also pointed out that the last thing they would do to missing childs favourite cuddly toy would be to thoroughly wash it the smell of their child would still be on it ironically despite dr kate mccanns washing of cuddle cat the cadaver dog eddie still managed to detect the smell of death human cadaverine on the toy animal the chemical cadaverine is almost impossible to remove from an article even by washing finding the smell of death on madeleines favourite toy even after dr kate mccann had cleaned it was another clear pointer to madeleine having died in apartment 5a in praia da luz the cadaver dog eddie detected the scent of death on cuddle cat when he was sent to detect the presence of cadaverine if any at the house the mccanns were renting in praia da luz after they had had to leave their holiday apartment he did so finding cuddle cat hidden away in cupboard an odd place to find it given that dr kate mccann always made sure it was with her for the cameras whilst mentioning cuddle cat it seemed from early on that cuddle cat was being used essentially as conscious prop for the cameras by dr kate mccann rather than being an object of genuine sentimental value several times dr kate mccann was seen to deliberately ensure that cuddle cat could be seen by the cameras even specially removing it from her handbag so that the cameras could see it as we have noted eddie the cadaver dog found the smell of death on cuddle cat in cupboard at the house hired by the mccanns in praia da luz 26 failing to cooperate fully with the portuguese police despite repeatedly promising to do so and frustrating searches of their mobile phone records the mccanns insisted from the beginning that they would fully cooperate with the portuguese police when the police began investigating the possibility that the mccanns themselves might be involved in madeleines disappearance they immediately claimed that they were being framed they were initially hesitant to supply their mobile phone records to the police despite the fact that dr gerry mccann was known to have received many sms text messages on the day madeleine disappeared and possibly have made or received other calls those details could have thrown light on the mystery of madeleines disappearance the portuguese police asked the mccanns to supply their mobile phone account records explaining that they might contain valuable information which would further help them to understand the events leading up to madeleine disappearance it is now known that dr gerry mccann wiped his sms text message records before reluctantly consenting to the police examining his mobile phone the portuguese police believed that they could gain further understanding of the events leading up to madeleines disappearance if they could examine the mccanns previous three months telephone records the mccanns refused the police applied to the courts to see the records the mccanns lawyers opposed the application luckily perhaps for the mccanns portuguese judge refused the polices application citing human rights laws on the right to privacy 27 having ready supply of preprinted photographs of madeleine ready for the police as soon as they arrived on the night of 3rd may within just two hours of madeleines disappearance if not even earlier the mccanns had ready supply of posters featuring madeleines face the mccanns claimed that they had produced them on the spot using their digital camera and by getting access to printing machine at the ocean club but police enquiries at the club did not find any printer that could have produced those particular types of photo posters this led to the portuguese police to strongly suspect that they had been preprepared earlier in the day somewhere away from the premises 28 not releasing the famous last photo of madeleine taken at the poolside for three weeks and only after dr gerry mccann had returned to england the famous last photo of madeleine was claimed by the mccanns to have been taken at 229pm ie after lunch on thursday 3rd may by the ocean club poolside it was said to have been taken on dr kate mccanns digital camera it shows seriouslooking dr gerry mccann amelie to his left and to amelies left smiling madeleine clearly enjoying something she is looking at offcamera the mccanns said that they had taken many photos on that digital camera during their holiday there was therefore apparent reason why the police could not have used this last photo of madeleine straightaway to make known her face to the public as it was the most recent of her it would have been the most helpful to the police and of course to the public who were being asked to look for her those who are familiar with digital photography have analysed this crucial last photograph and several claim that there is evidence that the photo could well have been photoshopped that is deliberately manipulated to produce false result they say that the original photograph does seem to have been taken at 229pm on 3rd may but that madeleine may have been added in later from another photograph even simpler the date and timestamp in the digital photo could easily have been altered within minutes using free software downloaded from the internet whether these views are right or not it is curious to say the least that this famous last photo was produced to the police only after dr gerry mccann flew back on his own to england for couple of days in late may he took kates digital camera with him and certainly had the opportunity to arrange the photoshopping of that last photo if that was his intention in addition it is strange that only one other holiday photo of madeleine from that digital camera has ever been produced the one of madeleine in white hat on the tennis court and holding three tennis balls key figure in the early days after madeleines disappearance was mr alex woolfall public relations guru employed by major public relations and advertising firm bell pottinger and seconded to mark warners in an article in the summer of 2007 woolfall claimed the mccanns had not slept they were trying to work out what to do that might help generate images of her they were desperately keen to publicise her face the article continued the mccanns had photographs of madeleine on their digital camera which mr woolfall began transferring to laptop computer woolfall said to kate mccann lets try to identify pictures where her face is visible downloading the images was very difficult process for them it was upsetting woolfall talks of photographs in the plural if there were so many why was only that one photo ever released why did it take three weeks and why did it appear only after dr gerry mccanns visit to england 29 the body language of the doctors mccann signs that they were not telling the truth to some observers particularly women who appear in general to read body language better than men the body language of the mccanns has throughout not been consistent with their believing that madeleine had been abducted the photo on our back cover for example shows the mccanns on saturday 12th may nine days after madeleine went missing and on what would have been her fourth birthday few people can understand how they could look so cheerful so soon after the realization that they may have lost madeleine for ever it must of course be admitted that not all people react in the same way following loss or disaster some express their emotions more openly than others others consciously try to hide their emotions or have developed stiff upper lip type of personality said to be trait of the english where their emotions are suppressed and much more difficult therefore to read but even after making allowances for this the body language of the mccanns has been extraordinary to give just one example around the time of the oneyear anniversary of madeleines disappearance the mccanns agreed to do an interview with bbc tv east midlands the presenter described how the doctors had had to steel themselves to go through with this agonising interview in which they once again described how distraught they were at the loss of madeleine yet as viewers could see for themselves because the bbc editor allowed the cameras to roll for few seconds after their interview ended they rose from their seats laughing and joking with each other just after they had answered the last question with their usual solemnity and gravity on the internet in general and on youtube in particular many examples of strange atypical body language and verbal responses by the doctors mccann can be seen examples include avoiding eye contact with the interviewer and turning their heads away from the interviewer when difficult subjects for them were raised physical expression limited and stiff with few arm and hand movements hand arm and leg tending to be directed toward the body smirking especially by dr gerry mccann at inappropriate moments hesitancy and defensiveness over difficult questions overreacting to awkward questions eg dr gerry mccann walking out of an interview with spanish journalist and removing his microphone hands touching face throat or mouth scratching nose or behind the ear never showing any real signs of distress gestures or expressions not matching their verbal statements the doctors inability to find any way of sending message to madeleine on tv when invited to say something to her dr kate mccann could only say she knows we love her while dr gerry mccann said nothing not looking at each other throughout interviews it was therefore surprise that after the mccanns did major interview with spanish tv company in october 2007 some 70 of viewers in telepoll after the programme thought that the doctors were not telling the truth similarly in an opinion poll carried out in britain the previous month 80 of respondents also felt that the mccanns were not telling the whole truth 30 only carrying out drugs test on the twins after five months the mccanns initially refused to take their twoyearold twins to be tested for the presence of drugs or sedatives in their system although they later admitted that they thought the children could have been drugged by the abductor but they then waited nearly five months before engaging an agency to carry out independent tests by which time of course had any traces of sedatives been present in the twins bodies on 3rd may they would by then have long since disappeared the results of these tests have never been publicly disclosed and it is not known for the presence of which drugs the agency tested the mccanns publicly claimed that these tests proved that the twins had never been sedated but if they had really wanted to test for the presence of drugs or sedatives the time to have done that would have been immediately after madeleine disappeared why did the mccanns not carry out test at that time perhaps both being doctors because they knew that if they had been giving unauthorized sedatives to their children the presence of those drugs would have been revealed by any tests c 30 other reasons for doubting the abduction claim we have highlighted above what we consider to be 30 very persuasive reasons for doubting that madeleine mccann was abducted but these are by means the only reasons why goncalo amaral the detective who led the investigation into madeleines disappearance and so many other people around the world do not believe that madeleine was abducted and why they believe that instead the parents and perhaps some of their tapas 9 friends were involved in some way in madeleines disappearance they suspect that madeleine died in apartment 5a in praia da luz and that the mccanns with help from some or all of their friends have covered up madeleines death and hidden or disposed of her body here we summarise 30 more reasons for doubting the abduction claim in particular order some of these reasons may not convince you and some may seem insensitive yet they are all genuine reasons which have persuaded members of the public invited by the mccanns and the media to believe the abduction story to doubt their abduction claims 31 putting their needs above the childrens needs the mccanns were willing in the first place to put their needs above their childrens by leaving them alone in strange holiday apartment in foreign country in the darkness and without light on six nights in row whilst they were out eating and drinking with friends their claims of halfhour checking have been seriously undermined by the account of neighbour mrs pamela fenn who heard madeleine crying daddy daddy for 75 minutes on the evening of may 1st when the mccanns were out for food and drinks at the tapas bar good illustration of their general attitude towards their children can be gained from examining this extract from an article written by david james smith in the times in december 2007 the mccanns spent some minutes talking to couple from hertfordshire two more tennis players at the next table who were eating with their young children as they chatted gerry thought how lucky he was his children asleep nearby that he and kate were free to come and enjoy some adult time at the restaurant and not have to sit with their children as this couple were 32 focussing on the alleged evil abductor instead of admitting responsibility for their negelct the shame of having left three young children on their own vulnerable to all manner of risks including abduction would have caused most parents to be acutely embarrassed but the mccanns have continually minimised their responsibilty whether madeleine was abducted or died in apartment 5a stranger abductions are truly rare events prevention is better than cure in many spheres of life and most certainly where the protection of young children is concerned yet not once have the mccanns warned the public about the dangers of leaving young children on their own they have never campaigned alongside child protection agencies such as the nspcc to raise the profile of young children left home alone by their parents at time when cases of young children being left on their own is increasing instead they embarked on campaigning for an amber alert system to be operated if and when child has been abducted but this surely is classic case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted the way to stop horses bolting is to lock the stable door similarly the way to prevent stranger abductions of young children is to look after them properly not leave them on their own vulnerable to all kinds of risks and distress the mccanns even claimed that social services official had informed them that leaving children on their own in dark apartment whilst they were out drinking over 100 yards away and checking on them every halfhour if that indeed is what they are doing was well within the bounds of responsible parenting not surprisingly they did not name the official by contrast the stated official advice of the nspcc is very clear never leave young children on their own even for few minutes of course if there is genuine abduction there must be systems in place to raise the alarm swiftly and as far and wide as necessary but to expend energy on better alert systems for abductions rather than to prevent them happening in the first place is to put the cart before the horse sadly far too many journalists celebrities and ordinary people were alltoready to say weve all done it ie leave young children on their own giving the world the false impression that most britons would think nothing of leaving their children in their hotel room or apartment and spending the evening drinking the spokesman for the doctors clarence mitchell even claimed on an irish tv show that it was part of british culture to go on holiday and leave ones young children on their own in their bedrooms once they had gone to sleep and then go off wining and dining without them the mccanns have constantly excused and justified what was their conscious decision to put their own fun before their childrens welfare 33 minimising the distance they were away from their apartment the mccanns have on many occasions deliberately minimised how far away they were from their children whilst in the tapas bar they repeatedly said it was like dining in your back garden in the early days dr kate mccann said they were 20 yards away subsequently both the mccanns repeatedly claimed they were just 50 yards away the basic facts about the distance of their apartment from where they were wining and dining in the tapas bar are as follows the apartment was about 65 yards 200 feet away as the crow flies b this distance was across large swimming pool c most of the apartment including the room in which their children was sleeping could not be seen from the tapas bar even if they were outside on the terrace which they were not and were looking in that direction d at the time vegetation obscured most of their vision of the apartment to walk from their table in the tapas bar to the entrance to the apartment has been measured at around 120 yards 360 feet it would take about minuteandahalf to reach it 34 allowing their friends to walk in to the apartment and contaminate the crime scene despite the mccanns professed belief that they knew instantly that madeleine had been abducted and despite dr kate mccann stating that she had already searched the apartment three times before sounding the alarm the mccanns have publicly admitted allowing their tapas 9 friends to walk all round the apartment even opening cupboard doors etc thus contaminating any forensic evidence that the abductor if there was one may have left had they really believed that an abductor had been present in their apartment they would surely have said dont touch anything incidentally despite numerous reports to the contrary in the british press the portuguese police did seal off apartment 5a as crime scene as soon as practicable the mccanns pr team however has repeatedly and falsely claimed that the portuguese police failed to seal the crime scene 35 the strange words and phrases the mccanns have used in referring to the alleged abduction when dr gerry mccann initially reported madeleines disappearance to his motherinlaw mrs susan healy he said theres been disaster its disaster itself very odd term to use if there had been an abduction or kidnap and especially as he said it only short while after madeleine had apparently gone missing this led mrs healy to say in tv interview i thought he was talking about car accident it took while to realise what had happened mrs healy later said that dr gerry mccann was so hysterical on the phone that i was unsure what he was saying later dr kate mccann phoned her mother and said shes gone mum shes gone on another occasion dr kate mccann said describing the abduction i know the situation we were in that night i know that what happened is not due to the fact of us leaving the children asleep i know it happened under other circumstances what was the it it sounds more like it is referring some other event than the alleged abduction another bizarre description of the alleged abduction occurred during the panorama programme transmitted on 19 november 2007 describing how the abduction must have happened and pressed by her interviewer richard bilton that the abductor must have had only small window of opportunity during which to snatch madeleine she replied in very causal laidback manner theyd been watching us over matter of days im sure erm you know they know erm you know they must have known you know that gerry had just been into the apartment and thenshe makes fast swish of her arms and loud guttural click in the throat described by many on the internet as whoosh clunk erm youre right there was only small window of opportunity but you know the real effect of witnessing how she describes this apparently most tragic event in her life can only really be appreciated by watching the clip of it on youtube httpukyoutubecomwatchv1rqazjmbco 36 dr gerry mccanns brother immediately giving up his fulltime job to help with the fundraising company dr gerry mccanns brother john mccann immediately gave up his fulltime job with pharmaceuticals company despite having house wife and children to support this might seem like selfless generous act but we might ask how did john mccann know in advance that madeleine wouldnt be found within the next few days or weeks leaving himself high and dry with job if she was found it strongly suggests that he too knew that madeleine would not be found it must be emphasised that he did not say that he had taken temporary leave of absence from his job he had chosen to resign 37 the body language of dr gerry mccann when asked by spanish tv journalist whether he and his wife had ever sedated the children when dr gerry mccann denied to lady spanish tv interviewer that he and his wife had ever sedated any of the children his denial was accompanied by several telltale signs of lying including more rapid speech looking away from the interviewer and nervously scratching his left ear 38 claiming that they refused babysitter because they did not want to leave their children with stranger the mccanns initially gave as their reason for not paying the 1000 fee for babysitting service for the night of 3rd may nor on any other night that they did not want to leave the kids with stranger yet this socalled stranger would in fact have been one of the nannies who had already been looking after madeleine the twins and other children at the kids club and the crÃ¨che for the past six days so any babysitter would have known madeleine and the twins by having contact with them at the kids club and crÃ¨che the mccanns excuse for not employing babysitter that night was therefore patently untrue in addition the technical services director of the ocean club resort silvia batista stated that earlier on 3rd may the very night that madeleine disappeared she in person offered childminding services because the hotel is responsible for its clients children but the mccanns rejected that 39 the happiness of the doctors mccann soon after madeleine disappeared as revealed on many photographs of them the mccanns emerged looking triumphant happy and smiling and waving at the congregation outside as they came out of the catholic church in praia da luz on 12th may 2008 which would have been madeleines first birthday see photo on back cover other pictures show dr gerry mccann smirking on this occasion just before he came out of the church most parents on such an emotive anniversary and so soon after their daughter had gone missing would not be able to cheerfully wave to crowds shortly after this the mccanns cooperated with photo shoot for sunday newspaper with the mccanns beaming contentedly with the twins that was followed soon afterwards by dr gerry and dr kate mccann smiling as they held up banner announcing the formation of the helping to find madeleine fund and released thousands of yellow balloons these actions say many are not those of truly distraught parents in the immediate aftermath of having lost one of their precious children many other photos of them smiling contentedly or even laughing in the weeks after madeleine was reported missing may be viewed on the internet 40 phoning their relatives as soon as they thought that madeleine was missing couple who had left their children on their own whilst out wining and dining and who then discovered that one of their children had gone missing would be likely to be far too embarrassed to phone their relatives immediately out of deep shame they would be far more likely to search frantically for their missing daughter ask for police help and only phone home to their relatives when it was becoming reasonably clear that she was not going to be found immediately yet the mccanns phoned round all their relatives almost immediately announcing that madeleine had certainly been abducted and that it was disaster plus of course notifying innumerable media contacts either themselves or via friends within the first few hours that madeleine had definitely been abducted 41 dr kate mccann referring in her diary to her husband putting on another great performance for the tv cameras dr kate mccann claimed that relative had urged her to start keeping diary following madeleines disappearance this was said to be to show to madeleine when she was found there are many strange aspects about this diary which we do not have space to discuss here in particular dr kate mccanns retrospective diary entry for 3rd may the day madeleine was reported missing is very sketchy omitting many significant details about that days events one point we wish to draw attention to here is dr kate mccanns description of tv interview carried out by her husband as putting on another great performance we have already noted how dr kate mccann always produced the pink toy cuddle cat for the cameras she was also reported on the bbcs panorama programme to have deliberately walked at the back of their house in praia da luz in front of the waiting cameramen apparently crying and clutching cuddle cat cameraman testified on the programme that the consensus among the cameramen was that this was simply performance for the cameras interestingly the mccanns close friend and madeleines godfather mr jon corner who produced documentary film of the mccanns which the panorama programme used described his role as backstage all of these matters reinforce the impression in many peoples minds that we are witnessing an acting performance by the mccanns 42 the distressed reactions of roman catholic priest father pacheco after he talked to the doctors mccann father pacheco the priest at the roman catholic church in praia da luz was reported as suffering extreme distress when he confided initially to his fellow church members and later to the press and public that the mccanns had told him things about madeleines disappearance which under strict catholic rules he was not allowed to disclose even to the police the strictlyenforced rules of the catholic church confession booth mean priest can be sacked or defrocked to put it technically if he ever reveals to the outside world one word of what has taken place during confession even if that confession reveals that the confessor has committed serious criminal offence even if the person concerned confesses to murder or child abuse or other serious offences priests are only allowed to disclose confession secrets within the roman catholic hierarchy 43 sleeping normally after just 5 days dr kate mccann publicly admitted that both she and her husband were sleeping normally again just five days after madeleine disappeared the experience of other parents whose child has been abducted or has gone missing or has died is always very different they invariably report that they suffer enormous distress at their loss and are usually unable to sleep soundly until months after the event 44 doing normal everyday things immediately after madeleine disappeared but not searching for her the mccanns went jogging every day after madeleines disappearance even making careful notes of their times then displaying all this information on dr gerry mccanns daily blog he even arranged tennis matches and played tennis while hundreds of others were physically searching the area around praia da luz in the days following madeleines disappearance the mccanns later admitted publicly that they spent time at all physically searching for their lost daughter 45 comparing losing madeleine to being told youre overdrawn on one occasion tv interviewer asked dr gerry mccann what he felt like on learning that madeleine had gone missing he answered it was like going to the bank and finding yourself over your student overdraft 46 the tapas 9 friends of the mccanns failing to tell the police that they had all been leaving their children unattended whilst out wining and dining none of the tapas 9 friends admitted to the portuguese police that for the previous five nights of the holiday they had all been leaving the children alone in their apartments whilst they wined and dined together this would have been highly relevant for the police to know given that the mccanns and the tapas 9 friends were trying to advance the scenario of an abductor who might have been watching their apartments over number of days 47 the various excuses offered by the doctors mccanns as to why they didnt take the children with them when they went out on 3rd may the mccanns offered several excuses for why they did not take the children with them when they went out on 3rd may the night after they publicly admitted that madeleine over breakfast that morning had told them that she and sean had been crying whilst they were out the night before they claimed that they could not go together with the children to venue about halfamile away because they didnt have suitable buggy with them in fact they did have buggy with them the mccanns had earlier given as another excuse for not taking the children to the tapas bar the claim that children were not allowed there or alternatively were not welcome those excuses were later proved invalid by the mccanns themselves when on their own evidence they said they had chatted in the tapas bar with couple with children from hertfordshire at around 900pm on 3rd may the day madeleine disappeared in any case the mccanns later admitted to times journalist david smith that they were glad to get away from the children in the evening and have some peace yet the mccanns were away from their children for most of the day as they were in the kids club and crÃ¨che from 930am to 1230pm and again from 230pm to 500pm 5Â½ hours of the day 48 the mccanns refusal to follow up apparently promising sightings one week there was rash of sightings in malta yet the mccanns decided to stay on in portugal coordinating the mass release of hundreds of thousands of yellow balloons worldwide rather than visit malta most parents under similar circumstances would have hastened to malta the same happened when there was promising sighting of madeleine reported in cafÃ© in holland 49 only answering press questions with at least two hours advance notice the mccanns stipulated that for all media interviews the press had to present all questions to them at least two hours in advance of the interview adding that they would only answer those questions and others innocent parents who have genuinely lost their child and have nothing to hide would not insist on such onerous conditions being imposed on tv interviewers 50 claiming that the abductor might have drugged the twins the mccanns suggested that the abductor might have drugged the twins they did so to try to explain why neither twin woke up either when the abductor is supposed to have taken madeleine nor amidst all the shouting when the alarm was raised the mccanns came up with this theory while being filmed by family friend jon corner in august after leaks from the portuguese police suggested the children might have been sedated so they would all sleep soundly while the doctors and their partners were wining and dining we have already seen above how unlikely it would have been for any abductor to be able to remove madeleine at the time and in the manner stated the claim by dr gerry mccann that an abductor might also have had time to administer some kind of sedative to the twins simply adds another impossible layer to an already improbable abduction scenario 51 noone has come forward to claim the huge reward despite huge total of 25 million reward money being offered for anyone who can give reliable information as to madeleines whereabouts noone has come forward reward of that size will often produce at least one person who is prepared to reveal what they know about serious incident 52 the rapid setting up of the private company trust fund but the refusal to say how much has been received and what its been spent on the mccanns set up the private company trust fund helping to find madeleine fund with amazing rapidity determination and effort there are many indications that they deliberately set up this lucrative fund knowing fine well that madeleine would never be found they and their fellow trustees have been highly secretive about how much money the fund has received and what they have spent it on despite the enormous public support they have received and despite attempts by the madeleine foundation and journalists to discover how much has been donated and where the money has gone as we explained above in what we said about the bona fides of the three private investigation companies that the mccanns and their fund have used to date there are grave suspicions that the money has not been spent on genuine search for madeleine 53 dr gerry mccann roaring like bull dr gerry mccann was reported as going around praia da luz soon after madeleine went missing roaring like bull this does not sound like typical reaction of male parent whose child has gone missing more like fake attempt to appear distressed usually one parent tries to comfort the other 54 dr gerry mccanns focus on the best possible outcome for us in the first few days after madeleine went missing dr gerry mccann was asked how he was feeling and what he wanted people to do he said pray for us pray for madeleine we are obviously hoping for the best possible outcome for us then after significant pause and only as an afterthought did he add and madeleine it is one of many indications that the mccanns have been the true focus in this story not madeleine 55 the long delay in dr kate mccann answering the question on womans hour about when she last saw madeleine when dr kate mccann was asked on womans hour whether the last time she saw madeleine was when she was quietly asleep in her bed there was very long pause several seconds before she quietly said yeah she was it was quite evident to listeners that she had had to think hard about that particular question on the spur of the moment as to what her answer should be 56 claiming they would never leave portugal until madeleine was found then leaving as soon as they were made formal suspects the mccanns made many pronouncements they would never leave portugal until madeleine was found yet as soon as they were made arguidos or official suspects they left portugal in great hurry helped by the british government consulting top extradition lawyers in portugal and britain as they did so 57 using outofdate photos of madeleine for their look for madeleine campaign instead of using an uptodate photo of madeleine for the look for madeleine campaign the mccanns instead used older pictures where madeleine is clearly looking much youngerlooking thus making it more difficult for those looking for madeleine to have an uptodate idea of what she looked like 58 the mccanns spokesman saying it would be hugely entertaining to think of cast list for film about madeleine the mccanns spokesman clarence mitchell when discussing last autumn the possibility that film might be made by filmmakers img of the disappearance of madeleine mccann said while it may be hugely entertaining and bit of fun to think of cast lists we are million miles away from that sort of thing the mccanns did not disassociate themselves from this flippant reference to it being hugely entertaining to think of cast lists over the matter of threeyearold girl who had been abducted and was still missing 59 the mccanns inconsistency as to whether madeleine was likely to wake up or not in the early days when asked why they were so certain that madeleine had been abducted rather than wandered off dr kate mccann said madeleine and the twins never woke up once asleep yet days later when confronted by journalist about why they had not used babysitter when one was available dr kate mccann replied we didnt want our children waking up and finding stranger in the apartment 60 the popes decision to withdraw all support for the doctors mccann just over three weeks after madeleine disappeared the mccanns met with the pope benedict xvi who publicly blessed photograph of madeleine before the worlds media the vatican thereafter carried very prominent pages on their website featuring the mccanns and their emotional search for madeleine the mccanns had frequently made their strong catholic faith very much an issue and were frequently described as devout catholics yet 48 hours before the mccanns were made formal suspects the pope withdrew all references to madeleine further references to the mccanns campaign and their fund to find madeleine have been made on the vatican website since then it seemed to many seasoned observers of the roman catholic church that the pope had received strong indications that the mccanns abduction claim did not stand up written by tony bennett for the madeleine foundation october 2008 appendix 1 summary of evidence of british government involvement in the case of missing madeleine mccann from almost the moment that the mccanns reported madeleine missing there was intense british government involvement in the case this included frantic diplomatic and government assistance to the doctors during the early weeks and months and was followed by attempts at the very highest level that is by less than the current british prime minister gordon brown to remove the senior investigating officer in the case the experienced and respected detective mr goncalo amaral the british governments efforts were successful mr amaral was removed from his post on 3rd october 2007 just five months after madeleine disappeared here we give just the briefest outline of british government involvement in the case an unprecedented level of support for couple who after all became suspects of involvement in their daughters disappearance possibly extending to being responsible for their daughters death in praia da luz and the hiding or disposal of her body the rapid provision of consular assistance within just two hours of madeleine disappearing the following report appeared in the online edition of the daily telegraph timed at 0001 one minute past midnight on friday 4th may 2007 threeyearold british girl has gone missing while on family holiday in portugal the foreign office said today portuguese police are investigating the disappearance from holiday complex in praia da luz in the western algarve foreign office spokesman said that he understood the girls parents had gone to have dinner once their children were asleep last night but returned to check on them only to find the girl had gone missing they reported it straight away he said adding that consular assistance was being offered not only was the british ambassador in portugal already involved even before midnight on 3rd4th may the matter was already in the hands of the foreign office and foreign office spokesmen were on hand to brief the daily telegraph the british government therefore appeared committed to believing and supporting the mccanns abduction claim right from the outset without having even had time to properly check the facts and the surrounding circumstances b the statement by the british ambassador to portugal mr john buck on 8 may 2007 just five days after madeleine disappeared further clue to the toplevel involvement of the british government in this case came just five days later in this statement to the media by mr john buck british ambassador to portugal in praia da luz on tuesday 8th may ladies and gentlemen good evening as you know i spent quite lot of time with the mccann family on friday nb 4th may the day the mccanns were also being interviewed by the portuguese police and over the weekend and also supporting our consular staff here in the algarve i wanted to come down today to see kate and gerry again and to continue to support our consular staff whove been dealing with this case continually now for number of days i also wanted to assure myself personally that the necessary links between british and portuguese experts here on the ground are working well and they are as you know we have had three family liaison officers from the leicestershire police here with the family acting as point of communication with the portuguese police as i think you also know additional experts arrived today to work with their portuguese colleagues on this investigation i dont want to say anything in detail about the investigation but it might be helpful if i said word or two about the background this is and must remain portuguese police investigation as you know the portuguese police operate under portuguese law and portuguese law puts constraints on what they can say publicly and the information they can release against that background i have been in touch closely over the last few days with cabinet ministers here in portugal with the prime ministers office and with the portuguese police authorities they all assure that everything possible is being done to ensure the safe return of madeleine we continue to work closely with the portuguese authorities they are very pleased with the collaboration with the british authorities they are in close touch with interpol and europol and i know that kate and gerry with whom ive just been speaking for the past hour are very grateful for their efforts thank you very much c the despatch of cabinetlevel official to oversee public relations in the case one of the british governments most highlypaid spinners of information mr clarence mitchell was despatched almost immediately to portugal to conduct and oversee public relations for the mccanns his job at the time was the highlevel position of head of the media monitoring unit for the central office of information post established primarily to ensure that the governments line on any particular issue was promoted in the media in may 2007 he was seconded to the foreign office for the special assignment of proactively handling press relations about the disappearance of madeleine mccann he was later allowed to retire prematurely from the civil service in september 2007 in order to become employed exclusively by the mccanns to act as their pr spokesman at salary said to be 75000 year d the despatch of another top government official sheree dodd to help with the mccanns pr the former daily mirror journalist and longserving senior government spokeswoman ms sheree dodd was also deployed in the early days as an additional media liaison officer for the mccann family in addition to mr mitchell see also next point this appointment added to the already truly exceptional level of help being given by the british government to the mccanns within days of madeleines disappearance toplevel team of up to dozen maybe more lawyers pr professionals foreign office and consular officials were working flat out to back up the mccanns abduction claim this was truly unprecedented amount of highlevel support especially given that the only sighting of an abductor was the unreliable claims of jane tanner to have seen man with bundle british embassy staff who were suspicious about the mccanns were transferred to other posts away from the embassy staff at the british embassy who were suspicious about the abduction claims of the mccanns were according number of sources removed from their posts and transferred elsewhere see for example this spanish newspaper for germanspeakers httpwwwsazaktuellcomnewsdetailkey8489start1appreviewhtm two headings in that newspaper ran as follows 1 british diplomats who found drs kate gerry mccann suspicious were removed from portugal and 2 government involved more than normal the maddie case gets new political dimension it is known that ms sheree dodd mentioned above was removed from her position of media liaison officer for the mccanns in portugal after she voiced concerns with the british embassy about the truthfulness of the mccanns abduction claim there were several reports from reliable sources that she did not buy the mccanns account of events and had said so to her colleagues f dr gerry mccanns nine phone calls to the future prime minister of the uk we know on the record that dr gerry mccann spoke to the current british prime minister gordon brown nine times on the telephone in middle and late may one of these calls was from dr gerry mccanns mobile telephone number whilst he made trip to the fatima shrine in portugal the contents of those conversations have not been publicly disclosed but they seem to have centred on attempts to force the portuguese police to release description of an abductor which they did not think would take their investigation forward see next point g gordon browns pressure on the portuguese police to publicly release description of nonexistent abductor we have the evidence on the record that the portuguese police felt forced by overwhelming pressure from gordon brown himself personally to consent to releasing statement about possible abductor despite the fact that at that time and even today they had credible evidence of nor description of any abductor except for the unreliable and constantly changing accounts of jane tanner by that time the portuguese police as has been well documented had already begun to suspect the parents of some involvement in madeleines disappearance and did not believe their claims that madeleine had been abducted h the british government arranging for the mccann to see the pope on his own admission in videorecorded interview clarence mitchell who was then employed as the head of the media monitoring unit for the central office of information boasted of having arranged for mccanns to visit the pope he did this using government connections and by speaking to the roman catholic archbishop of england cormac murphy oconnor i the british government arranging for dr gerry mccann to visit the white house and meet us attorneygeneral alberto gonzales dr gerry mccann was able in july while on short visit to the united states to visit the white house and meet personally with then attorney general of the united states alberto gonzalez those visits could only have been arranged with british government help photos of dr gerry mccann visiting senior officials on capitol hill helped raise the profile of the mccanns and madeleine still further j foreign secretary david miliband admits to having number of telephone conversations with the mccanns but wont say how many during 2007 clarence mitchell by then the fulltime pr spokesman for the mccanns claimed that after the mccanns were made arguidos provisional suspects they had not received any help from or even been in contact with any senior ministers of the british government however an enterprising member of the public decided to ask question about mr mitchells claim under the freedom of information act 2000 here are extracts from the reply he received from the foreign and commonwealth office i can confirm that the foreign secretary has communicated with the mccann family on number of occasions however any further details relating to this have been withheld under section 362c of the freedom of information act which if disclosed would or would be likely to prejudice the effective conduct of public affairswe had to apply public interest test to determine whether or not the information should be released we recognise that there is public interest in transparent and open governmentbut we have to balance this with the need to reassure british nationals in need of consular assistance that we will protect details relating to their situation in this instance there is clearly an expectation that the details of all communications were confidential and would not be made public for this reason we consider that the public interest in maintaining this exemption outweighs the public interest in release the foreign secretary has not communicated with either clarence mitchell or the private company helping to find madeleine leaving stone unturned ltd it should be noted however that from may to september 2007 mr clarence mitchell was seconded to the foreign and commonwealth office of which mr miliband was the secretary of state moreover dr gerry mccanns brother mr john mccann was reported to have claimed that he had also spoken to mr miliband mr john mccann was founder director of the private trust company helping to find madeleine leaving stone unturned ltd and continues to be director k tony blair and his wife cherie blair talk to the mccanns days after madeleine disappeared dr kate mccann was persuaded by relatives to keep diary which incidentally she backdated to cover the events of thursday 3rd may dr gerry mccann was labour party member had good connections within the party and aspired to be parliamentary candidate for them in view of those connections it was perhaps not surprising that dr kate mccann was able to write in her diary for sunday 17th june cherie blair phoned to find out how we werei also had the chance to speak to tony who told that we werent to hesitate to ask him if there was something he could do at the time tony blair was the british prime minister the entire labour party establishment seem to have assumed that the mccanns were telling the truth in claiming that madeleine had been abducted and wanted to actively help them l gordon brown was told that goncala amaral would be removed from the portuguese investigation before amaral himself even knew goncalo amaral the portuguese senior investigating officer revealed publicly that prime minister gordon brown had been told that he amaral would be dismissed from the investigation into madeleines disappearance two hours before he himself was informed that he was to be removed from his post two other staff were also taken off investigation this appears to be very powerful evidence that the british government wanted him and his immediate colleagues dropped from the investigation we should ask ourselves why the only possible reason could be that amaral and his team were getting ever closer to obtaining sufficient evidence to prove that the mccanns claim of madeleine being abducted was lie the impetus behind the investigation into madeleine mccanns disappearance was not maintained after amaral was removed from the enquiry we may note here that in 2005 mr amaral and his portimao team of detectives successfully prosecuted the killers of 8yearold joana cipriano her own mother and uncle they received lengthy jail terms both initially claimed that joana had gone missing and might have been abducted the investigation was fraught with difficulties the mother maintaining for long time that joana was missing however due to mr amarals painstaking accumulation of forensic evidence joanas uncle later admitted to the brutal killing of poor joana together with joanas mother he even described the despicable acts he committed in murdering joana and then disposing of her body by hiding it in secondhand car and conveying the car to spanish vehicle crushing company m the comments of goncalo amaral and his removal from the investigation we have the very powerful evidence of goncalo amaral the man in charge of the investigation into madeleines disappearance for the first five months who told us all that there was heavy british government interference with his investigation he was then apparently removed from the investigation in october 2008 largely for spelling this out his main public relations assistant said the same about british government pressure and was also removed from his association with the investigation mr amaral said this in tv interview on 31st july 2008 those who knew socially got an opinion based on my connection with the socalled maddie case during the investigation and after being removed from it i was the target of the most terrible accusations from the british press some local commentators and man named clarence mitchell whose role is not very well understood on the eve of the publication of the book you already know about note the truth about lie this gentleman was sending threats that i should take care i was stunned let make it clear that i consider this to be an unacceptable tone coming from citizen of the oldest democracy in the world take care why because i might step on banana skin while walking is mr mitchell concerned about my health i do not think so we all perceive his threatening tone in portugal we are not used to people speaking that way nor is this the view we have of the british people but there are always some people that fall short of their standards criminal investigation need not be politically correct nor fear veiled threats shortly before he was dismissed amaral had given an interview to portuguese newspaper diario noticias in which he was quoted as saying the british police have only been working on that which the mccann couple want them to they have only investigated tips and information developed and worked on for the mccanns forgetting that the couple are formal suspects in the death of their daughter when interest was shown by the british police in clearly bogus email sent to prince charles about the case from disgruntled former employee of the ocean club in praia da luz in which she claimed that madeleine had been abducted by woman in some kind of act of revenge mr amaral stated publicly this story about abduction for revenge is another lead being worked on for the mccanns everything said by employees of the ocean club current or former has already been investigated by the portuguese police mr amaral clearly knew by that time that the british government was working to orchestrate and maintain the abduction smokescreen whilst at the same time frustrating the attempts of mr amaral and his team to obtain sufficient evidence to bring charges against the mccanns n the british government was directly involved in brokering an agreement for the mccanns to return to the united kingdom as the daily telegraph reported on 10th september 2007 as the mccanns were returning to england as those negotiations with the portuguese authorities about the mccanns returning to england were going on the foreign office was firing on all cylinders in its efforts to help the mccanns the agreement that allowed gerry and kate to go back to the uk was reached through direct contacts between the british foreign office the portuguese justice and foreign office ministers and portuguese judiciara with the help of john buck the uk ambassador in portugal at the time justine mcguiness and david hughes members of the mccann team of advisers played also an important role in those contacts the british government ensured that madeleine mccanns medical records were not supplied to the portuguese police on page 81 of goncalo amarals recentlypublished book verdade da mentira the truth about lie chapter 4 he claims that the portuguese police officially requested from the british government that the medical records of madeleine beth mccann be supplied to them either the department of health or the regional health authority for leicestershire or both frustrated the request they delayed replying to the portuguese police and ultimately refused to cooperate given that that medical information about the family could have been helpful to the portuguese investigation we must ask why it was not produced p the madeleine mccann case was discussed by gordon brown with both the portuguese prime minister and portuguese president of the european parliament at the eus lisbon summit in october 2007 again we have it on the written record that the case of madeleine mccann was specially discussed between jose manuel barroso the portuguese president of the european parliament the portuguese prime minister jose socrates and british prime minister gordon brown at the european unions lisbon summit in october 2007 when the lisbon treaty was signed why would criminal investigation into the disappearance and possible homicide of threeyearold british girl be discussed at summit conference which was primarily about concluding european treaty that had been the subject of fierce controversy and been planned for years why was the british government so concerned about the outcome of the madeleine mccann investigation that it felt it had to discuss madeleine alongside all the other burning european questions of the day summary it is therefore obvious that the british government was very actively involved in this investigation from the start and at the very highest levels of government other citizens of the uk or indeed of other countries whose child goes missing in mysterious circumstances have nothing like the same level of involvement from their government in addition the british government has been evasive about its role which has surely been not about finding madeleine but much more about protecting the mccanns and their tapas 9 friends this is only very short summary relating to british government involvement in this case much more could be written on the subject and perhaps one day will be appendix 2 sources of information on the madeleine mccann case this booklet has been compiled from variety of sources these include newspaper and magazine reports and articles including portuguese and spanish sources bbc news reports including the bbc
