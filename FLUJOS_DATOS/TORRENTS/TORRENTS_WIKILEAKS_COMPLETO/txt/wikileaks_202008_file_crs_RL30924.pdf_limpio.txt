division updated august 8 2002 abstract the commission on 21st century production agriculture emphasized that discussions on future peanut program policy recognize the regional importance of peanuts to speciﬁc areas and the potential negative impacts on small landholders it suggested that four options be examined as potential modiﬁcations to the existing program 1 phased reduction of the quota system with compensation made to existing quota holders 2 allowing quota to move across state boundaries 3 making subsidies available to food manufacturers to encourage their purchase of domestically produced peanuts and 4 oﬀering marketing loan beneﬁt for peanuts and direct payments to producers of quota peanutshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30924congressional research service the library of

agricultural policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30924peanut program evolution from supply management to market orientation summary the 2002 farm bill radically overhauls the peanut program by completely replacing the supply and price management system in place for more than 60 years it repeals the limit set on the amount of pea nuts that farmers can sell domestically for food consumption and substitutes in large pa rt the revenue this quota system with its high level of price support had guaran teed them with an infusion of annual government payments to historic pea nut producers the new programs price support and income subsidy features c overing the 2002 to 2007 crops are similar to those authorized for producers of other crops these will ensure that historic producers receive return roughly comparable to what they accessed in the past after taking into account they will longer have to rent or buy quota actual returns will vary among farmers depending on whethe r they had produced quota peanuts and had incurred the additional cost of renting quota as part of this historic change owners of peanut quota will be compensated for limination of an inco megenerating asset as background the 19962001 peanut progra m largely kept intact the broad outlines of previous policy except for two changes reflecting compromise between growers and shellers the market ers of peanuts to food manufacturers and calls by others for the programs repeal congress in 1996 reduced the quota loan rate by 10 to 610 per ton other changes were intended to ensure the program operated at nocost to taxpayers the house during farm bill debate rejected program opponents efforts to modify th agriculture committeereported package by 3vote margin from 1996 through 1998 program opponents pr essed for further change but failed in securing passage of amendments offered to agriculture spending bills in other action three emergency farm aid packages in the 19992001 period provided total of 170 million in supplem ental income payments to peanut growers another issue that lawmakers addressed in 2000 and may again face is whether to assist growers to cover th eir share of program losses the new program reflects an approach pr oposed by many peanut farmers in the southeast the largest peanut producing re gion and some in the southwest who had concluded that the quota program could not be sustained for political and economic reasons they were concerned that th quota system could not be defended much longer against opponents food manufacturer s and those ideologically opposed to government management of food commodity who had sought for many years to reform the program these farmers also realized changes were needed to address competitive pressures from increased pea nut and related produc t imports under the terms of current and anticipated trad agreements and that additional budget resources made available for commodity programs could facilitate policy change with peanuts marketed internationally at price much lower than the level at which the past program supported the us price of food peanuts the peanut quota structure and import restricti ons by controlling the supply and significantly affecting the price placed the cost of the peanut program largely upon the buyers of peanuts manufacturers and consumers the new programs changes shift these costs largely to the federal govern ment and taxpayershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30924contents recent developments 1 u s p n u t m r k t 1features of the 19962001 peanut

nearly 28 d ecline from the 13 billion annual average in the 199092 period lower production and cash receipts in th most recent period reflect the impact of two significant policy changes made by the 1996 farm bill 1 setting the amount producers can sell domestically the poundage quota equa l to projected us food demand1 and 2 lowering by 10 the support level for peanuts sold to meet us food demand2 higher imports also have contributed to lower receipts imports of peanuts raw peanuts and the peanut equi valent of peanut butter in 2000 accounted for 14 of domestic food use compared to 2 in 1991 increased imports reflect the market access commitment s made by the united states under various trade agreements and the incentive for other count ries to sell into the higherpriced us market compared to other export alternatives3 just over 46 of the 2000 peanut suppl was consumed as food domestically of the remainder 12 was cr ushed into oil viewed as premium cooking oil and into meal used as protein supplement in livestock feed rations sales overseas accounted for about 11 with the europ ean union canada nd japan being major export markets consumption for domestic food use fell an average 23 each year from marketing year my 198990 to my199596 largely due to changing demographics primarily smaller numbers of children among the babyboomer generation health and dietary concerns about the fat content in peanuts and competition from other snack foods that had prompted consumers to shift away from higherpriced peanut products toward lowe rpriced snack products in reversal of this trend starting in my199697 us p eanut consumption for food has increased an average 18 each year observers specu late that this recent trend might reflect decline in concern over fat in foods growing awareness by consumers of studies that show eating peanuts may be beneficial to health and increased retail promotion by peanut product manufacturers of th peanuts used for domestic food use

significant changes made by section 155 of the 1996 farm bill pl 104127 reduced the level of min imum price guarantees available on domestically marketed peanuts quota p eanuts and effectively eliminated the programs future budget exposure the congressional budget office at that time projected that the detailed changes made to key quota provisions would generate more than 400 million in budget savings over the fy19972003 period in 1999 2000 and 2001 congress authorized 170 million in supplemental income payments to peanut growers as part of broad fina ncial assistance packages approved for the agricultural sector4 the new program enacted by the 2002 fa rm bill will first apply to the 2002 peanut crop beginning with harvest whic h starts in august without the price support poundage quota and ma rketing assessment featur described below see peanut program in the 2002 farm bill on pages 12 18 for details program overview the peanut programs purpose historica lly has been to support the incomes of peanut producers and ensure ample domes tic peanut supplies through the 2001 marketing year it differed from the grains rice and cotton programs in that usda did not made direct payments to peanut growers notwithstanding the supplemental income assistance congress extended in recent years rather growers income has been supported primarily through usda acti ons taken to manage peanut supplies and by making available the price guarantees set in statute unlike the voluntary nature of usdas grain and cotton progra ms the peanut programs features were mandatory on all farmers if those that produced quota peanuts voted to approve poundage quotas in referendum held d ecember 1997 948 of those voting favored poundage quotas as result quotas applied to farm mark etings of peanuts through the 2001 crop the following summarizes the main features of the 1996 enacted peanut program price support two levels of price suppor t benefits were available to producers depending on the end use and des tination of the peanuts sold benefits were extended in the form of nonrec ourse loans that usda extended to three areawide marketing associations see program administration below nonrecourse means that an association pledged the peanuts acquired from growers for which payment is made as loan colla teral peanuts marketed for food use in the united states quota peanuts were ligible for high level of price support peanuts exported or crushed into peanut oil and meal referred to as additionals were eligible only for much lower leve l of suppor t the higher quota support level reflected the historical premium assigned to peanuts sold domestically into the highvalue edible use market and covere d production costs the lower support level for additionals reflected the much lower ma rket value of peanuts sold for export or crushing operating under complex pro cedures each association under contract with usdas commodity credit corporation ccc sells and disposes of acquired quota peanuts at not less than specified pr ice levels and of ac quired additionals athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30924crs4 market prices to the extent that sales did not cover loan proceeds extended to growers the difference losses was made up by tapping association profits with the remaining losses absorbed by the ccc until changed by the 1996 farm bill as required by statute the quota loan rate for the 19962001 crops was frozen at 610 per ton 305 cents per pound this change effectively reduced quota support by 101 from 1995s 67836ton 3392 centslb level also the 1996 farm bill retained the requirement that usda set the loan rate for additionals at level that ensures the ccc does not incur losses from their sale and disposal and that also takes into account demand for peanut oil and meal expected prices of other vegetable oils and protein meals and ex port demand for peanuts usda on february 15 2001 announced that the additionals loan rate for the 2001 crop will be 132 per ton 66 centslb the same as for the 2000 crops but 43 less than the 175 per ton set for additionals marketed from the 1998 and 1999 crops income support to peanut growers for the 1999 2000 and

rates spelled out in fy2000 ag riculture appropriations section 803a of pl 10678 were set equal to 5 of the quota or additional loan rate usda accordingly disbursed 55 million to eligible peanut growers another emergency farm aid package speci fied the payment rate for the 2000 crop quota and additional peanuts section 204 of pl 106224 usda made 61 million available under this provision in spring 2001 similar provision was included in the farm aid package pl 10725 signed into law august 13 2001 it required usda to disburse 54 million in suppl emental payments to peanut growers by

mechanisms limited the amount of peanuts allowed to be sold in the domestic ma rket the national poundage quota and import restrictions both tools served to ma nage the amount of peanuts supplied for primarily us food use poundage quotas national poundage quota limited the quantity of peanuts that producers sold for domesti c consumption see buyback exception below the national quota was distribut ed among eligible states based on each states previous years share of the quota and then distributed by farm to quota holders based largely on past production history producer holding or leasing farm quota received price protection at the high price support vel either by selling to commercial buyers or effectively transferri ng ownership of their unsold peanuts to usdas designated marketing agent in retu rn for price support benefits farmer could sell peanuts produced in excess of hi s farm quotas referred to as nonquota or additionals primarily fo r export or crushing into peanut oil and meal farmer without quota could produce as much as he wanted but was required to market them as additionals for export or crushing however when quota peanuts fell short in meeting domestic food demand as result of lower production due to poor weather andor of changing manufacturer preferences for peanut type any farmer could sell additionals as quota peanuts unde r the buyback provision as producers shellers and users adjusted to the new market environment created by the 1996 farm bill changes buybacks in the 1996 1997 and 1998 marketing years accounted for much higher share of domestic peanut sale s for food than in previous years about 10 15 versus 13 buyback activity in the 1999 and 2000 marketing years fell significantly apparently in reaction to farmer concern about the losses they were forced to absorb as result of such activity associated with the 1998 crop the 1996 law required usda to announ ce national poundage quota equal to projected us peanut consumption for food and related uses excluding seed use of this quota tool was intended to guard against surplus and to eliminate the programs budget exposure under prev ious farm bills usda each year was required to set the national quota defined then to also include seed use at not less than specified statutory minimum even if usdas projection showed food use would be lower the 1996 law eliminat ed the minimum provision under the revised definition usda on december 13 2000 announced that the 2001 crops national poundage quota w ill be 118 million tons 236 billion pounds the same level as set for the 1999 and 2000 quota us das decision to retain the same quota level for the third consecutive year reflected in part its assessment that 1 domestic peanut consumption for food had leveled off and 2 projected increased peanut imports allowed to enter under trade agreements continued to displace domesticallyproduced peanuts that othe rwise would enter us food marketing channels the 2001 quota level repres ented 126 reduction from the minimum 135 million ton national poundage quota that was in effect for the 19911995 crops import restrictions with peanuts marketed internationally at price much lower than the level at which the peanut program supports the us price of food peanuts the quantity of pea nuts and certain products allowe d to enter the us market to compete with domestic peanut

quotas are in effect indefinitely the nafta provisions also apply indefinitely unless the united states or mexico we re to withdraw upon notice from the agreement the 1996 and 2002enacted peanut prog

associated with loan making and quota management totaled 53 million in fy1999 199596 debate on the peanut program the peanut program enacted as part of the 1996 farm bill largely kept intact the broad outlines of prior us peanut policy but addressed two issues the level of price support available for quota peanuts and pr ogram cost in hearings held by the house and senate agriculture committees growers argued that the program supported rural economies urged that its basic structure be maintained and suggested few changes peanut shelle rs and some peanut product manufacturers though argued for significant reductions in the quota price support level these two groups argued such change was critical to the longterm survival of the peanut industry and was needed to reverse dec lining consumer demand for peanut products other food manufacturers and th eir coalition partners favored outright repeal of the program arguing government should not play role in managing supplies and dictating prices reflecting these divergen t views house floor debate in february 1996 was particularly intense the ag riculture committees proposed modifications to the existing program were retained by only 3vote margin 212209 the closeness of this vote energized program oppone nts to press for further change in the floor amendments they offered later in 1996 and again in 1997 and 1998 see next section the final provisions included aspects of the peanut growers proposal and splitthedifference compromise between the 1995 crops 678ton quota loan rate and peanut shellers call for support vel around 550ton reflec ting this the enacted measure reduced pr ice support on quota peanuts marketed domestically 10 to 610ton while growers in late 1995 had opposed any support reduction manufacturers argued that the committee proposed reduction was not deep enough to reverse the decline in domestic pea nut consumption so food manufacturers had argued for an even steeper cut down to 450ton peanut program legislation in 19972001 bills introdu ced in 105th congress representatives shays and lowey on june 11 1997 and sena tor santorum on november 13 1997 introduced hr 1864 and s 1535 respectively to phase out the current peanut program at the end of th 2001 crop year the house bill was similar to the amendment that representative shays offered during 1996 farm bill floor debate in february 1996 that was rejected on 212209 vote both bills proposed to reduce the 610 per ton price support level for peanuts marketed for domestic food use quota peanuts to 550 for the 1998 crop 515 in 1999 480 in 2000 and 445httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30924crs8 in 2001 s 1535 also required usda to dd carryover stocks to projected domestic food use in determining each years na tional poundage quota level taking into account imports government purchases nd buyback activity other provisions permitted the unlimited sa lease and transfer of quota across county and state lines the sale of additionals also for seed to us government agencies and for domestic food use to offset projected im ports capping the in itial disbursement of loan proceeds to producers at 80 in 19982001 and revising the process for sharing loan losses beginning with the 2002 cr op both bills would have made available nonrecourse loans at not more than 350 per ton hr 1864 woul d also have authorized loan deficiency payments to be made to producers who choose not to take out nonrecourse loans with both bill s proposing to repeal the current supply management system effectiv october 1 2001 there would longer have been any distinction between quota and additional peanuts in admin istering all price support operations supporters of both bills point ed out that the depressionera program was anticompetitive and restricted who can grow and sell peanuts to small number of farmers at the expense of consumers they argued that these proposals provided for fair transition period for farmers and lenders to adjust to new market following which the peanut program w ould operate like most other commodity programs supporters of the peanut prog ram countered that changes made by the 1996 farm bill reduced the quota support leve l by 10 and eliminat ed all government costs they questioned the impetus to debate the program each year and argued that the 1996enacted provisions should be given an opportunity to work another measure hr 1875 introduced by representative crane on june 12 1997 proposed to permit us firms to impor t mexican peanuts into free trade zones ftzs to be processed into peanut butte r and paste for sale in the us market dutyfree imports of mexican peanuts ar capped under nafta but there is limit on the amount of peanut butter produced from mexican peanuts that can enter according to an ap wire story the president of the peanut shelling company which also operates peanut butter plant seeking this change said this proposal would have put american companies on equal footing with mexican peanut butter manufacturers without forcing them to move to and build new plants in mexico peanut growers countered saying that the plan would co st farm jobs because mexican peanuts entering ftz would displ ace americangrown peanuts their spokesman pointed out that peanut shellers and manufacturer s not located in proposed ftz would also have been at disadvantage house floor amendments debated during 105th congress in the late 1990s opponents of the peanut program turned to the appropriations process to pursue their objectives in house floor debate on the fy1998 agriculture appropriations measure hr 2160 re presentative neumann on july 24 1997 offered an amendment that effectively would have required usda to administer peanut program for the 1998 crop with loan rate for quota peanuts not higher than 550 per ton if enacted this proposal w ould have reduced the quota price support level 60 or almost 10 from the minimum 610 per ton then available this amendment drew from provision in hr 1864 that called for the same amount of reduction in quota price support the hous rejected this amendment on vote of 185242httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30924crs9 during floor debate suppor ters of the amendment argued that the quota features of the program limited the s upply of peanuts and thus kept the price of peanuts paid by consumers higher than would be otherwise members mentioned that the domesticallysupported price was lmost twice the world price of peanuts in part because of the added costs that pr oducers incurred in acquiring andor renting quota two members added that usdas implementation of the 1996 farm bills program had created an artificial govern mentinduced shortage of peanuts an example of government price fixing that ignored consumer interests others argued that the program benefitted an elite few those who owned 68 of the quota nationwide according to gaos 1993 repor t due to inheritance or purchase but that did not farm peanuts themselves as result they claimed the program supported quota holders at the expe nse of consumers and taxpayers the amendments opponents countered that the 1996 changes ended direct taxpayer support of the peanut progra m saving 434 million over 7 years and made it market oriented several mentioned that the govern ments contract made in the 1996 farm bill provided peanut growers with safety net that should not be violated and should be allowed to work as enacted it was pointed out that growers already had to adjust to 10 reduction in their support price and must live with that level now for 7 years without any adjustment fo r inflation several argued that the proposal represented an effort by large g reedy food corporations to increase their profits at the expense of small family farmers and rural communities claiming that consumers would not see cheaper peanut bu tter and candy bars it was further noted that even though farmers have already ex perienced price cut manufacturers have not passed on one penny of sa vings to household consumers during house floor debate on the fy1999 agriculture appropriations measure hr 4101 on july 23 1998 representative neumann again offered an amendment that would have required usda to admin ister peanut program for the 1999 crop with loan rate for quota peanuts not high er than 550 per ton in the debate that followed many of the arguments made in 1997 were again presented the house rejected this amendment on 181 244 vote legislative activity in 106th congress bills intr oduced senator santorum on april 14 1999 introduced s 802 slightly different from s 1535 offered in the 105th congress to phase out the current peanut program at the end of the 2001 cr op year representative shays introduced an identical bill hr 2571 on july 20 1999 these measures would have reduced the authorized 610 per ton price support level for peanuts marketed for domestic food use quota peanuts to 550 for th 2000 crop and 500 for the 2001 crop quotas would have been eliminated for th 2002 and subsequent year crops starting in 2002 all peanuts produced would have been eligible for nonrecourse loans at not more than 350 per ton new section would have amende d the national school lunch act to require upon enactment that peanuts and products purchased by usda for donation under six nutrition programs be bought at preva iling world market prices and that such purchases be only of additional nonquota peanuts the bills supporters argued that the propos ed changes would correct the inequities of the peanut quota system result in price support

nut program effective with the 2002 crop affected the marketing of 2001 quota peanuts this development is expected to result in substantial reduction in the returns th at peanut growers receive for

though complex these changes in the process to be followed to cove r losses within and between associations were intended to place greater responsibility for absorbing losses on those individual producers and regions that actually generate them depending on other deci sions that usda makes the cumulative impact of this prioritized losssharing mechanism was intended to bring program costs down to zero to reach 60 million usda in late 1999 faced pressure from growers to apply the marketing assessment funds collected in the 199698 period to cover in part these losses growers of quota peanuts expresse d concern that if the last loss sharing provision was triggered they would face pa ying an assessment of up to 95 per ton for every ton of 2000 crop quota peanuts marketed according to usda estimates further language in the fy2000 agri culture appropriations conference report expected usda to use f unds collected but not yet transferred to the us treasury to offset these losses to addre ss this issue secretary of agriculture dan glickman on january 10 2000 approved th use of 28 million to reduce projected 1999 losses which in turn reduced the assessment that southeast growers faced paying later in 2000 even with this d ecision assessment funds collected during fy2000 were not expected to cover the ba lance of expected 1999 quota peanut losses 32 million as result quota growers in the southeast region faced the prospect of paying an additional ssessment in 200001 because such payment would have cut into grower income received in the 200001 marketing year some groups advocated the option of designating the assessments collected in future years to cover 1999 losses this approach was reflected in provision incl uded in p l 106246 section 2101 of title ii chapter 1 th at directed usda to borrow from the commodity credit corporation to cover the balance of these losses at that time growers were expected to pay off this loanas the ccc collected marketing assessments from them in 2000 2001 and 2002 until the entire amount was repaid similar situation has again develope d with respect to the 2001 crop high peanut yields contributed to 30 increase in production comp ared to 2000 though usda expects domestic food cons umption primarily filled by quota peanuts to recover somewhat in the 2001 02 marketing year the prospect of much lower peanut prices under the new program an ticipated last fall to be authorized in the 2002 farm bill see below encouraged buyers to minimize their inventory anticipating that prices in the 200203 season c ould be about half of this years level shellers cut back on purchases of 2001 crop quota peanuts reflecting the decline in the price of quota pea nuts farmers in the southeast as of late january 2002 had placed about 20 of their quota peanuts under loan with buyers for this sizable quantity of highpriced peanuts the pr ospect has increased that producers will experience loss as the areawide marketing associations sell these peanuts at much lower prices into the export or crushing ma rkets as the loss sharing provisions take effect available resources including the marketing assessments collected and intended to repay 1999 crop losse s will not be sufficient to cover projected losses according to one estimate the financial loss that growers in the southeast face ranges between 140 to 180 per ton if the ei ghth loss sharing provision is activated peanut producers in other producing regions also reportedly face absorbing losses which are expected to be much lower under 10 per ton

government payments the congressional budget office cbo has estimated that the new program w ill cost almost 29 billion over the farm bills authorized sixyear period the enacted peanut program effectively transfers the cost of the peanut program from consumers primarily food manufacturer s to the federal government under the pre2002 policy manufacturers paid high er prices for fooduse

payments proposed for peanut quota owners would not be subject to either set of payment limits and conditions the house approach calling for sepa rate peanut paym ent limit acknowledged that some

and more stringent eligibility criteria on payments made to an individualentity or married couple under all commodity programs including the new peanut program the sena position reflected the

peanuts repeal the quota system altogether starting with the 2004 crop with compensation to quota holders and require the s ecretary of agriculture to purchase peanuts and peanut products for

benefit more from the new support mechanisms than they would under continuation of the quot program and its relatively high support level its report stated that peanut shellers food manufactur ers and consumers would pay less because of the much lower support level the lower prices though would be offset by substantial increase in usda outlays to maintain producer income gao also expected that the new support measures will reduce incentives for increased imports17 an initial analysis by usdas economic research service similarly points out that the production incentives created by the 2002 farm bills peanut and other commodity programs will vary among diffe rent types of produ cers eg whether farmer had produced prima rily quota peanuts or produ ced additional peanuts or whether the farmer has hi story of peanut production18 the factor identified as key in influencing if farmer plants p eanuts is whether expected program benefits andor the projected peanut market price cover the variable costs associated with producing peanuts19 another issue some farmers will consider looking at both market prices and program benefits is whether producin g peanuts results in higher returns compared to producing other crops some observers expect that peanut pr oducers shellers nd food manufacturers will proceed cautiously in adapting to the peanut program changes since sales of peanuts in the united states have never been subject to the same market forces that other crops have been for years analysts can only speculate at this time what the farm and wholesale price of fooduse peanuts mig ht be and how that will over time affect producers and users decisions on producin g and purchasing peanuts respectively observers will also be watching to s ee the extent to which food
