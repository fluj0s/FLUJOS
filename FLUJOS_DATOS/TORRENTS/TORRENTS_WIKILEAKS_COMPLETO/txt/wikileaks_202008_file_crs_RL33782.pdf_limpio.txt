manufacturers offer to ot her purchasers of their drugs there are many practical and legislativ steps necessary before federal drug price negotiation for medicare beneficiaries could take place repealing the noninterference clause is n ecessary first step but may not be sufficient to lead to federally negotiated prices if the secretary were to engage in activities that affect drug prices on

for prescription drugs1 the medicare drug plans or their agents negotiate pr ices with the drug manufacturers the framework created by the law emphasizes competition among the medicare drug plans to obtain price discounts the medi care drug plans have incentive to provide the drug benefit to beneficiaries as efficiently as possible while simultaneously attracting enrollees through low pre miums and costsharing requirements the democratic party included affordable health care as one of the six for 06 initiatives as part of this effo rt the house passed hr 4 on january 12 2007 bill that requires the secretary of hhs to negotiate prescription drug prices for medicare beneficiaries as of this writing the senate finance committee has not reported prescription drug negotiation bill in

for federal involvement in determining drug prices and costs there are number of approaches that the federal government could adopt to affect prescription drug prices and expend itures few rely primarily on the power of government to dictate an outcome such as imposing statutory mandates and setting administered prices others emphasize more marketoriented approaches such as soliciting competitive bids from voluntary participants reference pricing approach combines elements of both by dictating some aspects of the price but also allowing market forces to work some of these methods are currently employed by federal government progra ms see below while others have been adopted by governments in other countries3 many of the methods are used together statutory mandates through statutory mandates the governme nt could set the re imbursement level or the price that the government would pay for each drug or require that pharmaceutical manufacturers provide pr edetermined discount to government purchasers the federal ceiling price and federal upper limits under the medicaid program are examples statutorily manda ted discounts see discussion below price ceilings the government can set the maximum reimbursement rate for drugs by establishing price ceiling drug prices could be less than the ceiling but not more the federal ceiling price also falls in this category reference pricing under reference pricing system drug reimbursement rate s are not directly fixed by the government but are tied th rough predetermined manner to another measure that may be dynamic

prices are currently not available to the secretary because of the noninterference provision these include activities that would fall unde r the scope of explicit nd implicit authorities provided in the medicare statute but that might face legal challenges if currently attempted by the secretary on the basis that they could be construed as interfering with the negotiations between drug

before fede ral drug price negotiation for medicare beneficiaries could take pl ace initially the noninterference clause would need to be repealed however repealing the nonint erference clause may not in itself be sufficient to lead to federally negotiated prices the current hhs secretary is reported to have stated th at he does not want the pow er to negotiate and does not believe that he would be able to do better than an efficient market12 in response some reports suggest that legislative propos als would also include mandate for the secretary to actively negotiate drug prices one option for any forthcoming legislation might be to omit detail or specifics an aide to the incoming speaker is repor ted to have stated that congress does not need to hammer out all the details there are lot of smart people in the administration including the secretary who can look at how were buying drugs and figure out the best wa of negotiating better prices with drug companies13 should the authority for the secretary of hhs follow that given to the secretary of the va in negotiating drug prices there is still uncertainty as to whether the activities of hhs will replicate the activities of the va or whether they would produce similar results there are substantial differences between medicare and va that draw into question whether one experien ce could be indicative of the other the va is direct provider of care and has its own health care facilities as result the va has national formulary as well as its own warehouses the va through its health care system is the purchaser of prescription

cover the dr ugs marketed by those manufacturers23 in 2003 there were reported to have been mo re than 550 manufacturers participating in the medicaid drug rebate program in 2004 federal rebate s amounted to 22 of total medicaid spending on pres cription drugs before rebates24 the medicaid experience and medicare part d the costsaving mechanisms and experiences of the medicaid program differ significantly from those of the va but also hold lessons for th medicare program first the medicaid program obtains significant discounts throug h the ful and rebate programs that are facto mandatory cost savings are obtained through statutory authority with little or bargaining involved and minimum percentage discounts are specified in statute the medicare part d program is not currently structured for the federal government to impose similar discounts or to establish administered prices for drugs nor for price negotiations regarding prescr iption drugs the medicare program does collect information about reba tes from part d plans but has not used the data for purposes of obtaining lower drug prices from the plans second in contrast to the explicit pr ohibition in the noninterference provision against federally established formularies for medicare beneficiaries states are allowed to establish open formularies for beneficiar ies not enrolled in medicaid managed care plans25 all drugs offered by manuf acturers with drug rebate agreement must be covered nd all drugs must be availabl through review process unless they are on the list of excluded categor ies in addition states are permitted to subject to prior authorizati on any covered outpatient drug26 using this authority some states have instituted prior authorization programs using preferred drug lists requiring that nonpreferred drugs be subject to prior authorization litigation over states use of preferred drug lists has occurred however courts have rejected arguments that medicaid pref erred drug

not formularies 28 42 usc 1396r8d1a 29 for instance making medicaid reimburseme nt of prescription drugs conditional upon the manufacturers including their product in th federal supply schedule is substantial incentive for pharmaceutical companies drug lists for prior authorization programs courts have noted that such lists do not place any drugs in noncovered category the essence of formulary and that the medicaid statute specifically provides that prior authorization program established by state under graph 5 is not formulary28 if the noninterference provision and formul ary and price setting restrictions are repealed the secretary must still decide whether or not to adopt formulary and decide how restrictive it might be at th national level these decisions would be much more difficult and problematic if th formulary prohibition is not repealed and other forms of ne gotiating leverage29 are not provided then the bargaining power of the secretary would reflect the leverage available to the secretary through authority granted elsewhere in statute for instance his ability to encourage conduct and disseminate research on drug prices and their comparative effectiveness the ability to review and approve plan bids and the st rength of the secretarys influence through persuasion as well as ot her credible threats consequences of increased federal involvement in the determination of drug prices and costs if the secretary were to engage in activities that affect drug prices on behalf of medicare part d beneficiaries the implications could be wideranging and potentially quite significant the direct effects on beneficiaries drug companies wholesalers pharmacy benefit managers are potentially great but the longterm and secondary effects on the overall population and the indus try may also be significant and are important to consider ability to achieve discounts the main argument advanced by advocates for granting the federal government the power to negotiate is that lower pri ces for prescription drugs might be obtained from pharmaceutical manufacturers and passed on to medicare beneficiaries by using the market power of roughly 437 million medicare benefi ciaries proponents argue that the pharmaceutical companies woul d provide deep discounts to the federal government in order to prevent the loss of significant portion of their market

medicare part d plans the first year of experience with the medicare prescription drug benefit has produced lowe rthanexpected program expenditures which supporters of the progra m attribute to the lower drug prices that drug plans have been able to negotiate in response to strong competition critics counter that the lower expenditures ar result of lowerthanexpected enro llment and preference among enrolled beneficiaries for plans with lower premiums and less generous drug coverage the argument that the size of the medicare market would provide federal negotiators with an advantage over pr ivate plans in obtaining discounts from pharmaceutical manufacturers has been questioned32 large pbms such as advance pcs 75 million covered individuals medco health solutions 65 million and express scripts 57 million have significan t market power and an established track record in negotiating prescription drug di scounts for large populations the size of the market itself is not as important as the ability to influence and direct the consumption patterns of that market much of the pbms ability to achieve price concessions from manufacturers reflects their ability to influence drug consumption behavior and to potentially move market share through financial incentives involving varying costsharing tiers formularies that offer the possibility that certain products will be excluded and drug management strategies including step therapy for these reasons and others critics claim that pbms with large numbers of medicare part d enrollees would be able to negotiate di scounts and

may still be ab to obtain substantial discounts but it may depend on what specific bargaining power is available to the secretary as noted above all pharmaceutical companies ve an incentive to have their products listed on the fss because participation is tied to eligibility for medicaid reimbursement drug availability for beneficiaries proponents of marketbased decentralized approach believe that by having variety of organizations negotiating different prices more choices will be available to medicare beneficiaries and therefore better patient out comes instead of being limited to the discounted drugs medicare ne gotiates they say discounts for the plentitude of organizations offering prescription drug plans will result in broader range of drugs being discounted in this view beneficiaries w ill then be able to choose the plan that best meets their individual prescr iption drug needs and acquire them at competitive market prices one study claims that the number of drugs available under the va formulary is more restrictive than those available from private medicare part d plans35 the report also claims that the drugs on th va formulary are older than drugs on formularies used by private plans howe ver these assertions and their underlying logic have been challenged by the va and others the vas formulary is not necessarily more restrictive than those of private insurers and the claim that va formulary drugs may be older is not necessa rily an indication that va beneficiaries are receiving lowerquality health carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33782crs13 36

ontroversial and reflects wide range of potential responses some research claims that the conse quence of decreased revenue and profits resulting from low negotiated prices will be reduced investment in research and development declining i nnovation and fewer new drugs brought to market other studies indicate that there has not been strong re lationship between the amount of research and development funds expende d by the pharmaceutical industry and the introduction of new drug pplications to the fda one report claims that governmentm andated negotiations would reduce the development of new lifesa ving drugs by about dozen annually and estimates that federal price negotiations would yiel d loss of 5 million lif eyears annually an adverse effect that can be valued c onservatively at about 500 billion per year41 other research suggests that the relationship between pharmaceutical research and development costs and ne w drugs is not so sensitive gao found that over the last decade the increase in research and development expenditures as reported by the pharmaceutical industry has not been matche d by the growth in the number of new drug applications ndas gao examin ed

of th federal governme nt negotiating drug prices is that prices might become more consistent and less variable across beneficiaries medicare pa rt d beneficiaries who bel ong to different pdpmapd plans face different prices depending on wh at the individual organizations negotiate and pass on to beneficiaries in savings in response to the panoply of medicare drug plans available some observers includi ng patient advocacy groups have suggested that that the plethora of choices is not universally viewed by beneficiaries as positive outcome growing body of research suggests that individuals faced with many choices may find that having more alternatives can be counte rproductive one study found that plans that offered more 401k opti ons had lower particip ation rates compared to plans

suggested placing limits on the number of medicare part d plans to alleviate the difficulties some beneficiaries have had in choosing from among such broad set of plans45 effect on overall costs and population health the effect of lower drug prices on overall health care costs and population health is varied if lower prices lead to higher rate of filled prescriptions among beneficiaries who previously underused needed medications then the increase in prescription drug use may lead to improve d outcomes there is also the potential savings if the increased drug treatments are substitutes for more expensive and less effective care for instance if hypertension can be managed with medicines that obviate the need for rgical interventions alternatively higher outofpocket pr ices for prescription drugs have been found to reduce the use of drug s by patients consistently46 recent research suggests that this effect may also persist over time with implications for higher overall health care costs one study found that beneficiar ies facing higher outofpocket costs for prescription drugs not only use fewer dr ugs contemporaneously but the reduction persists and is stronger in the second year overall the expenditure savings on prescription drugs are largely offset by incr eases in spending for outpatient services which tend to increase in

drug prices th rough the va and the medicaid programs have had noticeable effects on the industry the medicare program with similarly large number of beneficiarie s who consume more drugs per capita might have even more dramatic effects the function of wholesalers is ofte n overlooked in discussions about the pharmaceutical industry but they play an important role in the experience of the va although the va solicits bids that have llowed for multiple wholesalers in recent years the va has awarded the contract to single company recent estimates place the value of the contract at 3 billion year for the selected contractor to illustrate the importance of the va contract and how significant industry observers consider it to be the share values of the drug di stributor amerisourcebergen corporation fell 116 and the company lowered its 2004 ear nings estimate by almost 10 after losing the contract to the mckesson corporation48 the medicare market for prescription drugs is significantly larger than the va market and if structured similarly the federal contracts with the medicare program stand to carry similar or greater impacts for the industry effect on drug prices in other markets because of the complex relationships in drug prices across different types of buyers the effect of changing one price such as negotiating discount for medicare beneficiaries may have indi rect consequences on other prices while drug prices paid by medicare beneficiar ies may fall in the short r overall drug prices may increase in the long run for other consum ers specifically for the under65 population under this argument pharmaceutical companies might increase the prices they charge to other buyers in response to th lower prices negotiated by the federal government for medicare beneficiaries s imilarly as the best price increases the prices for other buyers who calculate reimbursements that are referenced to the best prices would also rise potentially aff ecting both va prices and medicaid prices finally those who oppose government invol vement in prescription drug price negotiations claim that the government would be setting prices not negotiating they cite the experience in other parts of the medicare program where provider reimbursement under parts nd b are set by the medicare program and claim that the federal government would impose similarly rigid pricing schedule on the prescription drug market whether this comes to pass depends on the specifics of how the legislation and subsequent regulations are written and which approach is chosen to implement any given authority to affect drug prices on behalf or medicare beneficiarieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33782crs17 49 hr 4 section 2ai1 reads i n general notwithstanding any other provision of

authority to establish formulary we believe that the secr etary would not be able to encourage the use of particular drugs by part d beneficiaries and as result would lack the leverage to obtain significant discounts in his negotiations with drug manufacturers under current law pdps are allowed to establish formularies subject to certain limits and thus have some ability to direct demand to drugs produced by one manufacturer rather than another the pdps also bear substantial financial risk nd therefore have strong incentives to negotiate price discounts in order to control their cost s and offer coverage that attracts enrollees through features such as low premiums and co stsharing requirements therefore the pdps have both the incentives and the tools to nego tiate drug prices that

scored the bill as having ne gligible effect on federal spending cbo anticipates that the secretary would be unable to negotiate prices across the broad range of covered part d drugs that are more favorable than those obtained by pdps under current law specifically the ab sence of the authority to establish formulary would limit the secretarys ability to influence the outcome of negotiations as

cbos evaluation of s 3 is very similar to its assessment of hr 4 in letter dated april 10 2007 cbo wrote that modifying the noninterference provision would have negligible effect on federal spending because we anticipate that under the bill the secretary would lack the leverage to negotiate prices across the broad range of covered part d drugs that are more favorable than t hose obtained by pdps under current law without the authority to establish fo rmulary or other tools to reduce drug prices we believe that the secretary would not obtain sign ificant discounts from drug manufacturers across broad range of drugs53 cbos letter also noted that the provisions of the bill that would permit congressional support agencies access to part d data and establish prioritized list of potential
