act of 19961 imposes upon local exchange carrier lec the duty to provide interconnection with its network that is at least equal to that provided by the local exch ange carrier to itself to any requesting telecommunications carrier 47 usc 251 c2c the 1996 act also requires that before lec can enter the market for the provision of longdistance telecommunications service it certify by means of competitive checklist that it has complied with the interconnection mandate which includes requirement that it provide access to operations support systems oss2 state regulators in this case the new york public service commission psc pprove 251 interconnection agreements and the 271 application to provide longdistance services is made to the fcc after the psc and the fcc investigated complaints from verizons competitors that verizon was not meeting its oss obligations and that their orders were not being fulfilled the fcc entered consent decree pursuant to which verizon paid 3 million fine the psc issued orders requiring verizon to pay 10 million to its co mpetitors both regulatory bodies imposed heightened reporting re quirements on verizon3 trinkos complaint was filed as class action the day after the fcc s consent order was entered the case the complaint alleged that verizon continues to resist competitive entry by carriers seeking to compete entirely with their own facilities and consequently that customers of verizons competitors have been injured in their business or property by reason of verizons exclusionary and anticompetitive behavior trinko further characterized verizons actions as attempts to exclude or reduce the market share of rivals in the provision of local phone service on basis other than efficiency4 he charged that notwithstanding the fccs recognition of the problem regulatory agencies have been unable to ensure that incumbents provide reasonable access to the facilities competitors need in the local market fcc enforcement is sporadic

research service march 10 2003 12 540 us at 408the prospect that the fcc would actually withdraw section 271 long distance authority is far too speculative to provide any meaningful deterrence5 the six justices of the supreme court w ho reached the merits of the case looked initially to the effect of the 1996 act on trad itional antitrust principles the opinion noted first that as trinko had asserted the act doe s create certain affirmative duties on the parts of lecs nevertheless they found trinkos antitrust claim was not necessarily viable that congress created these duties however does not automatically lead to the conclusions that they can be enforced by the antitrust laws 6 refusing to end its inquiry by observing that regulatory regimes often preclude antitrust enforcement however the court also noted that the act contains an antitrustspecific savings clause providing that nothing in this act or the amendments made by it shall be construed to modify impair or supersede the applicability of the antitrust laws7 examining trinkos claims pursuant to 2 of the sherman act wh ich prohibits monopoliz ation or attempted monopolization8 therefore the court emphasized that although the savings clause in the 1996 act preserves claims that satisfy exis ting antitrust standards it does not create new claims that go beyond them9 monopolization is not necessarily per unlawful the court pointed out if the monopoly has been achieved by means of so superior skill or product or some historic accident10 the opinion then proceeded to examine the exception to the general rule that barring collusion the sherman act does not restrict the longrecognized right of trade or manufacturer engaged in an entirely private business freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal11 the exception to the foregoing principles that encompasse s the antitrust rule that monopolist may have duty to deal with competitors was stated by the court in aspen skiing co v aspen highlands skiing corp 472 us 585 1985 there th court found that under certain circumstances refusal to cooperate with rivals can constitute antic ompetitive conduct and violate 212 in aspen skiing the court was dealing with situation in which monopolist who owned three of the four mountains in the skiing area and who had been dealing with competitor who owned th fourth mountain had withdrawn that cooperation the monopolist 3mountain owne r had even refused to deal when the competitor offered to pay him th retail price of the ski lift tickets to the three mountains so that he the competitor could offer hi s guests tickets to all four mountains aspen skiing in which the defendants pricing behavi or thus plausibly revealed distinctlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21723crs4 13 id at 409 14 id at 409 411 15 the doctrine has been briefly described as the existence of necessary component of potential competitors business which is both unavailable from any source other than the defendantcompetitor and cannot be duplicated by the plaintiff either at all or other than at great expense andor time 16 phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp ntitrust law 773e at 150 2003 supp 17 540 us at 411anticompetitive bent is as this opinion not at or near the outer boundary of 2 liability13 in the instant case the court was looking not at monopolist which had withdrawn its cooperati on from competitor but rather at monopolist which had had imposed upon it by the 1996 act the duty to coope rate with wouldbe competitors the refusal to deal alleged in the pr esent case does not fit within the limited exception recognized in aspen skiing the complaint does not allege that verizon voluntarily engaged in course of dealing with its rivals or would even have done so absent statutory compulsion here therefore the defendants prior conduct sheds light upon the motivation of its refusal to deal upon whether its regulatory lapses were prompted not by competitive zeal but by anticompetitive malice the contract between the cases is heightened by the difference in pricing behavior in aspen skiing the defendant turned down proposal to sell at its own retail price suggesting calculation that its future monopoly retail price would be higher verizons reluctance to interconnect at the costbas ed rate of compensation available under 251c3 tells us nothing about dreams of monopoly we do not believe that traditional antitrus t principles justify adding the present case to the few exceptions from the proposition that there is duty to aid competitors14 the essential facilities doctrine15 is similarly unavailing quoting from generally recognized authoritative antitrust commentators the court observed that it has been stated that essential facility claims should be denied wh ere state or federal agency has effective power to compel sharing and to regulate its scope and terms16 trinko believes that the existence of sharing duties under the 1996 act supports his case we think the opposite the 1996 acts extensive provision for access makes it unnecessary to impose judicial doctrine of forced access to the extent trinkos essential facilities argument is distinct from its general 2 argument we reject it17 the justices who concurred in the judgme nt stevens souter thomas relied on the fact that they saw only an indirect re lationship between the defendants alleged misconduct and the plaintiffs asserted injury therefore they would not have decided this complex case finding at the outset th at trinko had standing to

asserted violation of the antitrust laws but they eschewed such literal reading because tri nkos asserted injury was purely derivative of that suffered by att they feared ither the possibility of duplicative recovery of antitrust damages or the da nger of complex apportionmen t of antitrust damages18 congressional reaction response in the 108th congress possible future response congressional

perceived as giving green light to all manner of anticompetitive be havior by the regional bell telephone companies representative conyers characterized the deci sion as horrible blunder that dealt serious blow to competition in the teleco mmunications industry both indicated that congressional action to redress the possible negative impact of the judgment might be forthcoming19 in may 2004 representatives nsenbrenner and conyers introduced hr 4412 which would have adde d section to the clayton act20 to make unlawful actions such as those taken by verizon21 the effect of the proposed provision would have allowed successful judicial challenge to verizons actions inasmuch as the antitrust damage authorization is for suit to recover treble damages for injury attributable to anything forbidden in the antitrust laws22 on the other hand representative tauzi n chairman of the house energy and commerce committee expressed his approval that the supreme court had decisively reiterated that the regulati on of the telecommunications industry should be the purview of the fcc and the state public utility commissions rather than judges all across the country23 it may be that when congress inserted th antitrust savings clause in the 1996 act many members believed that the clause was preserving an unlimited private right of action on the part of otherthandirectly aff ected parties to sue under the antitrust laws but as this case indicates the savings clause may be of little effect in instances such as this in which it is found that traditional antitrust

various crs analystscomprehensive reform of th communications act of 193424 there are several congressional options that might have the effect of providing the breadth of private action some members of congress appa rently thought they had assu red first congress could amend the savings clause to clarify that the phrase the antitrust lawsmeans the literal words of the statutory provisions but excl udes any judicial interpretation of them second congress could include specifi c language as hr 4412 in the 108th congress would have done to the effect that acti ons such as the allegedly monopolistic ones challenged in verizon do in fact violate the antitrust laws third congress could amend the enforcement provisions of the 1996 act so that even if there had already been regulatory action certain provisions of the act would remain enforceable by private individuals who are not competitors of lecs but rather their customers or customers of wouldbe or actual competitors fourth congress could characterize violation of any or some mandatory competitive obligations of the act as prima facie evidence of violation of the antimonopoly provision of the an titrust laws 15 usc 2 congress could also of course choose to allow the cu rrent law to remain unchanged with respect to the antitrust character of the lecs actions
