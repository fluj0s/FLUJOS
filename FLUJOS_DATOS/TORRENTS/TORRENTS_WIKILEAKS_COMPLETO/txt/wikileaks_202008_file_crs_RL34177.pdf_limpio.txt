herein is provided in greater detail in the original report wh ich will be updated as necessary although elements of the informati on and intelligence fusion function were conducted prior to 911 often at state po lice criminal intelligence bureaus the events of 911 provided the primary catalyst for th formal establishment of more than 40 state local and regional fusion centers acr oss the country the value proposition for fusion centers is that by integrating various streams of information and intelligence including that flowing from the federa l government state local and tribal governments as well as the private sector more accurate picture of risks to people economic infrastructure and communities can be developed and translated into protective action the ultimate goal of fu sion is to prevent manmade terrorist attacks and to respond to natural disa sters and manmade threats quickly and efficiently should they occur fusion centers are statecreated entities largely financed and staffed by the states and there is one model for how center should be structured state and local w enforcement and criminal intelligence seem to be at the core of many of the centers while many of the centers have prevention of attacks as high priority little true fusion analysis of disparate data sources identification of intelligence gaps and pr oactive collection of intelligence against those

that which has not been vetted verified and validated finished intelligence which includes information of unknown credibility has been through an analytical process whic h has resulted in conclusions and judgments being made as opposed to evidence which is generally gathered in support of prosecution intelligence is gathered to inform policymakers and those individuals responsible for taking actions including national security law enforcement and public safety officials while intelligence may occa sionally be introduced into legal proceedings generally it is not 2 the fusion center guidelines define fu sion center as collaborative effort of two or more agencies that provide resources expertis and information to the center with the goal of maximizing their ability to detect

information to include federallyown ed and operated collaborative efforts like federal bureau of investigation led joint rrorism task forces jttfs or high intensity drug trafficking area hidta the aut hors however limit their discussion of fusion centers to those 40 largely state and regiona l entities created to enhance the ability of the jurisdiction to prevent mitigate and in some cases respond and recover from manmade threats attacks and natural disasters summary of fusion centers core issues and options for congress introduction this report summarizes the ma in points of crs report rl34070 fusion centers issues and options for congress by todd masse siobhan oneil and john rollins it highlights the value proposition of such centers as well as the obstacles and risks they face all of the information provided herein is provided in greater detail in the original report wh ich will be updated as necessary background the creation of post911 intelligenceinformation1 fusion centers2 does not represent totally new concept but suggest s an extension of pre911 state and local law enforcement intelligence activities most state policebureau of investigation agencies have run intelligence or analytic units for decades many of the fusion centers examined for this report were the outgrowth of those units prompting some to refer to fusion centers as state police intelligence units on steroidshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34177crs2 3 for example the national strategy on counter terrorism states that the paradigm for combating terrorism now involves the applicati on of all elements of our national power and influence not only do we employ military power we use diplomatic financial intelligence and law enforcement activities to protect the homeland and extend our defenses disrupt terrorist operations and deprive our enemies of what they need to operate and survive see the national strategy for combating terrorism september 2006 p 1 according to the director of national intelligence dni terro rist threats to the homeland to our national security interests and to our allies remain the preeminent challenge to the intelligence community see annual threat assessment of the director of national intelligence testimony of ambassador john d negroponte before the senate select committee on intelligence january 11 2007 p 2 4 see the national strategy on homeland security july 2002 p 7 5 this vision is promoted by the program manager information sharing environment pm ise which was created by intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 section 1016 and was placed under the administ ration of the office of the director of national intelligence the functions but not necessarily the authorities of the ise transcend the boundaries of the federal intellig ence and law enforcement communities see chapter seven sharing with partners outside the federal government in information sharing environment implementation plan office of the director of national intelligence november 2006 conceptually fusion centers differ from their predecessors in that they are intended to broaden sources of data for analysis and integration beyond criminal intelligence to include federal intelligence as well as pub lic and private sector data furthermore fusion centers broaden the scope of state and local analysis to include homeland security and counterterrorism issues despite being an expansion of existing subfederal intelligenceinformation activities fusion centers represent funda mental change in the philosophy toward homeland defense and law enforcement the rise of fusion centers is representative of recognition that nontraditional actors state and local law enforcement and public safety agencies have an important role to play in homeland defense and security in addition there has been shif t towards more proactive approach to law enforcement in the united states numerous national strategies have assessed the primary threat to us national security as terrorism both at home and abroad3 indeed the national strategy on homeland security provides that the american people and way of life are the primary targets of our terrorist enem and our highest protection priority4 the means for combating this threat are broad and encompass all elements of national power to include nontraditional sectors fr om law enforcement perspective it has been argued that state and regional intelligence fusion centers particularly when networked together nati onally represent proactive tool to be used to fight global jihadist adversary which has both centralized and decentralized elements this network of fusion centers is envisioned as central node in sharing terrorism homeland security and law enforcement information with state local regional and tribal law enforcement and security officials5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34177crs3 fusion center value proposition conceptually the argument that fusion centers represent vital part of our nations homeland security relies on at least four presumptions intelligence and the intelligence process plays vital role in preventing terrorist attacks it is essential to fuse broa der range of data including non traditional source data to create more comprehensive threat picture state local and tribal law enforcement and public sector agencies are in unique position to ma ke observations and collect information that may be central to the type of threat assessment referenced above having fusion activities take pl ace at the subfederal level can benefit state and local communities and possibly have national benefits as well even if one accepts these four presumptions important questions arise regarding the current andor potential efficacy of fusion centers given the fractured development of grassroots fusion centers around the country and the broad nature of federal guidelines on the subject th ere appears to be onesizefitsall structural or operational model for fusi on centers in order to determine the development and utility of fusion centers the following common themes and more importantly common questions should be examined do fusion centers solve the pre 911 information sharing problems and as such make americans safer can fusion centers work if they arent part of an integrated philosophy of intelligence and security who benefits from fusion centers who should staff fund and oversee them what role if any should fusion centers play in the intelligence community ic what role should federal agencies play in fusion centers to include funding do fusion centers represent shift in the security v civil liberties pendulum how active and proactive if at all should fusion centers be in the collection of intelligence that is not directly tied to specific and identifiable criminal act is some basic level of common st andards necessary in order for fusion centers to offer nationa l benefit moreover does the federal government have an in tegrated national fusion center strategy what concrete results does the federal government expect from fusion centers how is th federal govern ment assessinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34177crs4 fusion center performance and do fe deral funds align with these expectations and possible mission shortcomings is the current configuration of 40 plus fusion centers with in some cases several operating within one state the most efficient organizational structure is the current approach to creating authorizing funding and supporting fusion centers sustainabl what are the risks to the fusion center concept and how have those risks been specifically weighed and balanced against the stated goals of fusion center operations potential risks for fusion centers there are several potential risks associated with fusion center development one risk focuses on the hazards associated with creating fusion centers without the requisite philosophical and organizational changes necessary within the intelligence and law enforcement communities to sustain the work of the centers the other risks focus on factors that could ultimately diminish political and popular support for fusion centers and ultimately result in their demise or marginalized contribution to the national homeland security mission potential risk underlying philosophy some might argue that the rise of st ate and regional fusion centers may have been premature that is the establishm ent of these entities in the absence of common understanding of the underlying discipline creating fusion center is tangible action that seeks to enhance state andor regional coordination and cooperation to prevent and mitigate and in some cases respond and recover from homeland security threats however othe rs ask if fusion center development occurs devoid of more fundamental transformation is any real progress made another philosophical concern stems from the differe nt conceptions of intelligence among the intelligence and law enforcement communities in the absence of common understanding about what constitutes inte lligence fusion center development and progress may be impede d ultimately without common framework among disparate fusion centers and other homeland security agencies it is possible that benefits of the their efforts will remain narrow rather than having national impact while fusion center guidelines represent movement to provide fusion centers with common framework and were generally wellreceived by the centers arguably the 2006 fusion center guidelines have the fo llowing limitations 1 they are voluntary 2 the philosophy outlined in them is generic and does not translate theory into practice and 3 they are oriented toward the mechanics of fusion center establishmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34177crs5 6 some might argue that the entire concept fo r fusion centers particularly those aspects involving the incorporation of private sector data that may not be accurate or based on any criminal predicate is fundamentally flawed if there is little legal recourse for c itizens to challenge information related to them that re sides in commercially available databases and such information is included in fusion center operations privacy rights and civil liberties could be undermined 7 see shane harris issues and ideas fusion centers raise fuss in national journal february 10 2007 8 ibid 9 one of the prominent fusion center guidelines recommends fusion centers develop continuedpotential risk civil liberties concerns or violations the essence of fusion as outlined above is the integration and analysis of existing streams of information and inte lligence for actionable public policy ends be they counterterrorism broa der countercrime issues or natural disaster response embedded in the fusion process is the assu mption that the end product of the fusion process can lead to more targeted collection of new intelligence to include private sector data which can help to prevent crime it could be argued that through more proactive and targeted intelligence process one that has as its starting point an intelligence gap or unknown about particular threat it is possible that sophisticated criminal groups could be undermined ho wever the potential fusion center use of private sector data the adoption of more proactive approach and the collection of intelligence by fusion center staff and partne rs has led to questions about possible civil liberties abuses arguments against fusion centers often center around the idea that such centers are essentially preemptive law enforcement that intelligence gathered in the absence of criminal predicate is unlawfully gathered intelligence some might argue that the further law enforcement public safety and private sector representatives get away from criminal predicate the greater the chances that civil liberties may be violated furt hermore it could be argued th at one of the risks to the fusion center concept is that individuals who do not necessarily have the appropriate law enforcement or broader intelligence trai ning will engage in intelligence collection that is not supported by law6 the concern is to what extent if at all first amendment protected activities may be jeopardized by fusion center activities according to the american civil liberties union aclu were setting up essentially domestic intelligence agency and were doing it without having full debate about the risks to privacy and civil liberties7 furthermore the aclu is also concerned with having the department of homeland security dhs perform coordinating role at the federal level with respect to these centers we are granting extraordinary powers to one agency without adequate transparency or safeguards that hasnt shown congress that its ready for the job8 most of the fusion center representatives interviewed for this report appeared to be aware of the need to be respectful of privacy and civil liberties as result of 28 cfr part 23 the fusion center guidelines9

guidelines stipulate three levels of in vestigation into threats threat assessments preliminary investigation and full field investig ation each level has certain legal thresholds and investigative tools attached to it depending on available information these investigative tools and techniques range fro m nonintrusive open source collection to intrusive electronic surveillance the least in trusive of all levels of investigation is the threat assessment which allows the fbi to proactively use available information to identify terrorist threats and activities when the fbi receives information or an allegation about possible terrorist activity and the matter can be checked out promptly through relatively nonintrusive techniques see us department of justice fact sheet attorney

conferences and dhs provided techni cal assistance training as well as interactions with peer fusion centers veral fusion centers had or were in the process of creating governance board to serve an oversight function especially on civil liberty concerns in one case fu sion center cited concern for civil liberties as the reason it had specifically chosen form er judge to sit on its governing board many centers also claim to have privacy policies couple of which were reviewed by local aclu or other civil lib erties organization representatives11 however few of the centers had aggressive outreach prog rams to explain to the public the type of intelligence activities their centers could and could not engage in this report is not meant to provide an authoritative legal interpretation of related law due to disparate state laws authorizing fusion center or criminal intelligence activities for purposes of criminal intelligence systems most fusion centers operate under federal regulations in addition to any applicable state policies laws or regulations12 at the federal level the authorities which guide the fbi in collection of intelligence are the attorney generals guidelines for fbi national security investigations and foreign intelligence collection 13 at the state and local levels if there is any analogue to the attorney generals guidelines for multijurisdictional criminal intelligence systems it is 28 code of federal regulations cfr judicial administration chapter 1 department of justice part 23 criminal intelligence systems operating policies many centers cite 28 cfr part 23 as the guiding legal mechanism for their criminal intelligence operations by its terms 28 cfr part 23 applies to all criminal intelligence sy stems operating through support under the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of 1968 as amended from the perspective of intelligence collection the 28 cfr part 23 standard is reasonable suspicion one of the operating principles of 28 cfr part 23 is that project shall collect and maintain criminal intelligence information concerning an individual onlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34177crs7 14 see 28 cfr part 23 section 2320 and c operating principles 15 ibid if there is reasonable suspicion that the individual is involved in criminal conduct or activity and the information is relevant to that criminal conduct or activity14 further reasonable suspicion or criminal predic ate is established when information exists which established sufficient fact s to give trained law enforcement or criminal investigative agency officer investigator or employee basis to believe that there is reasonable possibility th at an individuals or organization is involved in definable criminal activity or enterprise15 the question of how to balance civil liberties with security remains an open issue congress and the country often weighs the balancing is arguably moving target driven by the countrys coll ective sense of security and safety potential risk time some homeland security observers suggest that the rush to establish and enhance state fusion centers is post911 reaction and that over time some of the centers may dissolve it could be argued that in the absence of another terrorist attack or catastrophic natural disaster over the course of the next 5 to 10 years state and regional fusion centers may be eliminated andor replaced by regional fusion organizations the state fusion regional representation organizations may be an entity to facilitate future center consolidation efforts issues that may lead to state and regional fusion center consolidati on into regional organizations include perceived lack of need by state leaders state and federal fi nancial constraints duplication of effort without show ing tangible products and services within given center and reduction of risks to given geographic location alternatively if there are additional terrorist attacks or natural disasters in the near future and fusion centers can demonstrate their tangible value by serving as proactive analytic andor operational informationintelligence hubs it is plausible that substantial additional fe deral state and local funds may flow to these centers potential risk funding related to the potential time risk is po ssible funding risk that is if the united states is not the target of successful terrorist attack homeland security funding arguably may decrease if ove rall federal funding levels for homeland security decrease it is possible that there will be some level of decrease in homelandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34177crs8 16 homeland security grant program is comprised of five interconnected grant programs 1 state homeland security program 2 urban area security

federal programs that fund andor support fusion centers ie dhs and fbi detailee programs could potentially also ffer under funding cuts it is unclear how fusion centers would fare in such situation it

several less than 20 of all fusion cente rs in large urban centers usually urban area security initiative uasi17 areas most of the statewide fusion centers are the outgrowth of the states police or investigative agencys existing intelligence resources several states ve more than one fusion center the number of fusion centers as variously defined within single state ranges from two to eight in some states these fusion centers appear to work well together or at least have taken steps to enhance their working relationship in ot her cases there appears to be friction and potentially even duplication of mission and competition between the centershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34177crs9 18 crs conducted indepth interviews based on standard protocol with 36 state fusion centers crs also

american civil liberties union aclu and state and local law enforcement were also consulted fusion center legal authority the majority of fusion centers do not opera under distinct or recognized legal authority currently the legal author ities supporting fusion centers range from nonexistent to memorandums of agreement by the partnering agencies and in one case state statut which defines the center and its responsibilities in most cases this is due to the fact that fusion centers are the outgrowth of an existing organization and as such the centers often operate as an extension of the parent entity and operate under its existing legal authority fusion center roles and responsibilities many of the firstwave centers thos created soon afte r 911 were initially solely focused on counterterrorism toda less than 15 of the fusion centers interviewed for this report18 described their mission as so lely counterterrorism since their inception many counterterrorismfocu sed fusion centers have expanded their mission to include allcrimes andor allhazard s sometimes this shift is official for others it is facto and reflected in the daytoday operations of the center but not in official documentation this shift toward an allcrimes andor allhazards focus can be explained by several factors to incl ude desire to conform to what they see as national trend the need for local and non law enforcement buyin and the need for sustainable resources approximately 40 of fusion centers interviewed for this report describe their centers mission as allcrimes however some fusion centers are concerned with any crime large or small petty or violent while others are focused on largescale organized and destabilizing crimes to include the illicit drug trade gangs terrorism and organized crime which one center d eemed homeland security focus little more than 40 of fusion centers interviewed for this report describe their center as allhazardsas well as all crimes it appears as if allhazards means different things to di fferent people for some llhazards suggests the fusion center is receiving and reviewing stream s of incoming informationintelligence from agencies dealing with allhazards to incl ude law enforcement fire departments and emergency management to others all hazards means that representatives from the aforementioned array of public sectors are represented in the center andor considered partners to its mission at some centers allhazards denotes the entitys mission and scope meaning the fusion center is re sponsible for preventing and helping to mitigate both manmade events and natural disasters for others allhazards indicates both preevent prevention role as well as postevent response and possibly recovery rolehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34177crs10 19

httpwwwngaorg cdafiles0502homesecpdf 20 the large presence of state law enforcement personnel is natural given that the majority of fusion centers are statewide entities that gr ew out of state policebureau of investigation intelligenceanalysis units of the local law enforcement agencies represented the overwhelming majority are from the largest local police departments in the country which have more resources and in some cases intelligence units for more information please reference crs report rl34070 fusion centers issues and options for congressthe majority of fusion centers interviewed for this report claim to serve solely or at least primarily analytic role th ey provide analytic support functions for operations and investigations but are not necessarily engaged in such activities those centers that are more operational in nature tended to be either largely owned and operated by single state policebu reau of investigations agency andor predominately staffed by sworn law enfo rcement personnel as compared to more analystheavy fusion centers the operational activities these centers engaged in included responding to incident scenes r unningassisting with investigations and tasking collectors the overwhelming majority of fusion center officials interviewed for this report saw their centers as primarily preventionorie nted entities in order to prevent as well as mitigate variety of threats fusion centers work to enhance information sharing conduct threat assessments and analysis and support andor f acilitate preparedness efforts in most states there is an emergency management agency andor operation center that is responsible for response nd recovery activities to both manmade and natural disasters19 however in numerous cases the fusion center is described as playing situational awareness role to support the emergency operations center eoc during events in few cases fusion centers had more active role at least two have sent analysts to the command posts at both high profile events and relevant emergencies to relay information back to the fusion center staffing in general the fusion centers studied for this report remain largely law enforcement oriented entities staffe d by state law enforcement personnel20 staffing levels at fusion centers range from 3 to nearly 250 fulltime personnel with the average number of full time staff at approximately 27 persons federal representation at the fusion centers the roles the agencies play and size of detailee staff differed significantly from center to center approximately 30 of fusion centers are collocated with federal agencys and as result that federal agencys may have significant influen ce on their development operation and even budget demands furthermore there app ears to be direct correlation between federal participation and the centers positive view of its relationship with that agency federal agencies that particip ate in various centers to various degreeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34177crs11 21 fusion center budgets were assessed on casebycase basis going back the numbers of years each fusion center was in existence and for which the center had budget data 22 as well as the detailees collocation costs nd clearances that are provided by individual federal agencies 23 numerical assessment derived from discussi on with fusion center leaders detailing the approximate funds received to date from the federal government 24 it should be noted that the ability to rece ive share and analyze information and make counterterrorism related decisions may be made difficult if the entirety of the fusion centers analytic workforce does not have the same level of security clearance 25 for information on the various security cl earances mentioned in this report see fbi security clearance process for state and local law enforcement available from httpwwwfbigovclearancesecuritycl earancehtm accessed on july 27 2007 and derrick dortch getting security clearance the washington post june 25 2004 httpwwwwashingtonpostcomac2wpdyna527682003feb10languageprinter 26 for the purposes of this report the author s attempted to focus on fulltime personnel with clearances although in some cases fusion center s have large number of cleared parttime personnel include federal bureau of investigation fbi department of homeland security dhs national guard coast guard bur eau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice and the transportation security administration tsa budgets annual budgets for the fusion centers studi ed for this report appear to range from the tens of thousands to several million dollars with one outlier at over 15 million21 similarly the sources of funding differed significantly from center to center as stated some were entirely pendent on transferring funds from existing state andor local funding streams while ot hers were largely funde d by federal grants federal funding ranged from 0100 of fusion center budgets with the average and median percentage of federal f unding at approximately 31 and 21 respectively thus it appears that on the whole fusion centers are predominately state and locally funded over the past two years the federal government has provided financial s upport to fusion centers largely through the homeland security grants22 but it appears that states continue to pay for approxima tely 80 of fusion center budgets23 access to intelligenceinformation almost all fusion centers studied for this report had pers onnel with security clearances although there were couple of exceptions that had few if any cleared personnel24 on average fusion centers appear to have 14 staff with secret clearances25 which is not insignificant considering the average staff size of the fusion centers interviewed for this report was approximately 27 fulltime persons26 clearances for state and local personnel were not restricted to s ecretlevel clearances but also included some top secret appr oximately 6 persons on average and top secretsensitive compartmented information sci approximately one person onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34177crs12 average clearances as well in some cases federal detailees to the centers held the highest level clearances in other cases state and local officials assigned to the center held tssci clearances in some cases fusion centers had cleared personnel but not the infrastructure to receive and store classified information successful fusion it is unclear if single fusion center of the forty plus that are currently in operation or soon to be has successfully adopted truly proactive prevention approach to information analysis and sharing state and its local jurisdictions appear to have fully adopted the in telligence cycle to support fusi on center operations while some states have s een limited success in in tegrating federal intelligence community analysis into their fusion centers research indicates most continue to struggle with developing true fusion process which includes value added analysis of broad streams of intellig ence identification of gaps and proactive collection of information to fulfill those gaps to prevent criminal and terrorist acts federalism and the federal role in fusion centers one of the central if implicit themes that runs throughout this report is federalism that is while fusion centers were largely established by states if the federal intent is to create network of fusion centers th at can be leveraged for both state local and federal pub lic safety and homeland s ecurity purposes there are several challenges that must be overcome crs research indicates that one of the central challenges of designing constructive and productive federal role in supporting these state and local fusion centers is working to ensure that the centers retain their state and locallevel id entity and support from those communities according to many homeland security obser vers one manifestati on of this tension lies in the need to strike balance between the national needs for consistent provider of state and local threat inform ation with the states autonomy to pursue issues deemed of importance to local jurisdictions this tension is often notable when reviewing the diverse and at times incompatible types of threat and warning products required by state leaders and cont rasted to those requested by federal homeland security and law enforcement entities part of the challenge from the federal pe rspective has been how to guide but not dictate to the owners and operators of these largely stateestablished entities prior to the provision of any fede ral financial support and once federal financial and human resources support was provided how to coordinate and target these resources for maximum overall return on investment another example of how federalism flow s throughout the fusion center issue is the legal treatment of terrorism terrorism is federal crime if it is prosecuted at all it is usually done at the federal level howeve r since the september 11th

are serving both state local and federal ends one of the centr questions becomes what is the role of the federal government in supporting these centers nd what products and services can the federal government reasonably expect the centers to produce given federal funding levels as elements of the states and regions they serve fusion centers began to develop critical mass or staying power in the years immediately following the terrorist attacks of 2001 as these centers continued to pr oliferate across the country and garnered state support federal entities began to take notice wh ile 30 of the fusion centers interviewed were establishe d prior to 2004 concrete fede ral financial support for the centers did not materialize until fis cal year 2004 when according to dhs it provided 29 million of homeland s ecurity grant program funding30 federal guidance to the fusion centers followed shortly thereafter in july 2005 finally in 2006 human capita l support in the form of dhs and fbi detailees to the centers began taking place while dhs has provided dir ect financial support to the fusion centers through the hsgp the fbi has not pr ovided direct financial suppor t the fbis contributions have come more in the form of support for security clearances31 personnel support and other inkind contributi ons such as rent payments when centers are collocated with fbi joint terrorism task forces or field intelligence groups32 the federal government has played severa l roles in assisting states and regions to develop their fusion centers including the provision of

that fusion centers are entities established by states localities and regions to serve their own criminal emergency res ponse and terrorism prevention needs and the sensitivities associated w ith federalism there may not necessarily be federal remedy to every fusion centerrelated issue identified in this re port congress may wish to take action regarding fusion centers should congress desire to act there are at least two categories of challenges and potential options i those challenges fo r which there are unique federal remedies and ii those challenges for which ther are unique federal remedies and may be more oriented toward possible state or level governmental intervention congressional remedies coul d potentially involve broa d range of possible actions including but not limited to oversight of federal agencies and entities engaged in interaction with fusion centers requesting executive branch action on any number of fusion centerrelated issues establishi ng statutory basis for fusion centers convening additional hearings which might include state and local fusion center leaders as expert witnesses adjusting futu re funding levels for fusion centers andor considering the extent to which if at all any future fe deral funding may be conditioned on fusion centers meeting perfo rmance benchmarks established perhaps jointly by federal homeland security intelligencerelated agencies and fusion center representativeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34177crs15 options for congress given the stated need to develop na tional network of fusion centers and that certain amount of financial and human re sources have been devoted to assisting states and regions develop their fusion centers the following represent challenges and options that the federal government and specifically congress may wish to consider based on crs research and analysis concerning the issues of greatest import to fusion centers two prioritized tiers of options have been developed tier i national strategy and sustainable resources while the question of sustainable fe deral support for fusion centers was foremost in the minds of many associated with fusion centers the absence of formal national strategy for fusion cente rs was also great concern option 1 draft national fusion center strategy notwithstanding the fact that individual federal agencies and offices may have their own strategies concerning their interaction with state and regional fusion centers there remains definitive national strategy on fusion centers one option for congress is to recommend that the executive branch draft crossagency national strategy with input from the fbi dhs odni pmise dod and other intelligence community and state and regional fusion center repres entatives should such strategy be determined desirable it might address the following issues ownership and benefits who owns fusion centers and who benefits from their work federal versus state local and tribal slt roles and responsibilities to include funding what is an equitable division of labor and costs permanence statutory basis and sustainment funding if fusion centers play an important homeland security role should they be provided statutory basis at the federal level if continued federal funding is being contemplated how might it be structured to yield the most productive outcome for federal state and local fusion center clients ultimate goals and p erformance measures what gaps do fusion centers fill and how does the federal government measure performance coordinated federal interaction with fusion centers how does the federal government ensure the various agencies engaged in homeland security have coordina ted plan for fusion and efficient interaction with fusion centers relationship between fusion centers and the federal intelligence community how closely if at all should fusion centers behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34177crs16 integrated into the federal intelligence community are fusion centers members of the intelligence community adjuncts or partners with the intelligence community proxy information source or an unrelated and parallel information effort option 2 answer the sustainment funding question while respondent fusion center leaders had many high priority items concerning their interaction with the federa l government the question of sustainment funding was foremost in their minds should federal f unding to fusion efforts be continued to what end and how conditional does congre ss want federal aid to fusion centers to be the current regime of hsgp funding includes some l imited c onditions for funding fusion centers however the fu sion center guidelines remain entirely voluntary even for recipients of federal hsgp funds as result for example the federal government has formal and sy stematic means of auditing whether each center is appropriately protecting civil liber ties or using federa lly funded intelligence analysts in manner that is consistent with national goals and objectives for fusion centers should they be explicitly defi ned as outlined above should congress determine it wishes to take action on this option range of possible legislative tools are available as discussed below 2a status quo the most obvious option is to continue the current manner of funding that is using the hsgp grants as the federal mechanism to make funding available for states and localities fo r potential allocation to state and regional fusion centers this process is reliant on state grant applications and the flow of federal funds to stateregiona l fusion centers is largely termined by the subfederal designees that make homeland security grant allocation decisions within each state andor municipality furthermore fusion centers compete with wide range of homeland security initiatives for funding while certain elements of hsgp funding are geared toward supporting fusion center velopment there is targeted funding stream directly allocated to fusion centers themselves 2b status quo plus enhance fl exibility of the current hsgp or establish fusion center gr ant program within hsgp under this potential option the current grant program c ould be slightly alte red to address some of the oft cited hurdles that state and local officials believe impede the flow of federal grant funds to fusion center projects two ch alterations to be considered include increasing the duration of grant cycles in order to allow for enhanced continuity and human resource pla nning particularly for contract supported intelligence analysts building some level of autonomy into the hsgp 8020 localitiesstate split of hsgp f unding to allow state political leadership some autonomy to re allocate portion of overall hsgp funds to single designated statewide fusion center such flexibility could be conditioned on formal hsgp audits to ensure accountability and that funds reallo cated within st ate hsgp awards are consistent with the states fusion center mission and federal fusion center guidelines these audits would include input fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34177crs17 fusion center leaders state administrative agents and the states homeland security advisor 2c develop sustainment funding approach if it is determined that establishing national network of fusion cen ters serves longterm national homeland security interests it may be reasonable to design system which provides resources to state and local fusion centers commens urate with the nati onal benefit derived this presupposes the development of 1 co gent set of concrete national interests served by fusion centers 2 set of metrics that can quantitatively capture how well fusion centers are meeting these interests and goals 3 standards for minimum levels of capability and fusion center maturityand 4 thresholds linking levels of maturity to levels of fe deral funding these sta ndards and metrics could be developed as part of cooperative end eavor between federal state and local representatives possibly under the global program as with other options above the extent to which congress could conditi on such an approach is an open question 2d direct and sustainable fusion center functional support alternatively congress alone or with input from dhs the fbi and the pmise could determine that there are certain fusion center functions that provide direct value and benefits to the federa l government and as such warrant sustainable federal financial support for example it might be determined that the development of state wide intelligence systems and information and intelligence analysis are two core fusion center functions that are clearly li nked to the federal benefit derived from fusion centers as such the federal g overnment could determine that it would support these functions directly and possibly in sustainable manner if such decision were made pilot program might be established and implemented at certain fusion centers over specified time period to ascertain empirical federal benefits derived from direct suppor t of such functions 2e end federal funding some homeland security observers suggest that the lack of federal fusion center strate gy coupled with differing governmental mission expectations may prevent effectiv coordination between state and federal government homeland security organizations if the mission of state fusion centers evolves into analyzing nonterrorismrela ted local criminal activities with little consideration for meeting the needs of fe deral counterterrorism agencies congress may wish to end federal funding for state fusion center efforts tier ii creating true trusted partnership the further development of the re lationship between the federal law enforcement and intelligence communities with fusion centers may prove helpful the following measures may facilitate this relationship option 1 training given that effective informationintelligence fusion and proactive approaches to allhazard prevention and preparedness depends on common understanding of intelligence and information and the potential uses thereof an argument can be made for enhanced and uniform fusion center training crs research indicates that the diversity of ty pes of professionals rving in fusion centers can lead to differing perspectives or possibly competing visions for the fusion center retired military intelligence officers may approach intelligence differentlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34177crs18 33 see office of the director of national intelligence 100 day plan for integration and collaboration p 9from for example state fi rst responder personnel while neither approach may be best and the center might benefit from diversity of opinions common understanding of and lexicon for intelligence and its bene fits and limits amongst all level of fusion center personnel can go long way toward ensuring cohesiveness clarity of vision and produc tivity of fusion center in addition to intelligence training some homeland security observers note that fusion centers may benefit from additional and standardized civil liberties training most fusion centers surveyed claim to have institutionwide civil liberty training and awareness activities that ensure all employees are aware of how personal and corporate information can be collected received stored and combined with traditional intelligence community informa tion toward producing risk assessment for given issue of concern however this training is often agencyspecific and there may be differences between state activities and federal expectations as such congress may wish to require part of ll funding allocated toward state fusion center be used for nationally consistent civil liberties training with special attention to concerns surrounding the use of privat sector data another option would make such training precondition for receiving federal grants should congress wish to pursue this option range of possible gislative tools are available including designating federal government entity to provide oversight of these efforts amongst others as discussed below option 2 build additional lin kages to the federal intelligence community director of national intelligen ce dni michael mcconnells focus area 5 accelerate information sharing in the 100 day plan for integration and collaboration asserted that the plan include s objectives related to enhancing information sharing within the ic as well as the formalization of fusion centers that are in the process of being developed33 formalization and linkages between the fusion centers and the federal intelligence community could have many interpretations and concrete manifesta tions as outlined above s hould congress determine it wishes to take action on this option range of possible legislative tools are available as discussed below among others these linkages might take the form of continued strengthening the fusion center participation in the intelligence community through personnel exchanges such as that taking place at the interagency threat assessment coordination group itacg drafting national intelligence estimate on the potential nexus between criminal activity and terrorism enhancing mechanisms for fusion centers to task the intelligence community for information and receive feedback based on the information they provide to the intelligence communityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34177crs19 establishing mechanism for fusion centers to have input into the national intelligence priorities framework option 3 consider structural issues there is cookie cutter approach to fusion centers although the cen ters may all have so core functions the financial and pers onnel resources they have to dicate to those functions differ widely structurally the continued development of th fusion center concept could progress along any of the following albe it nonexhaustive paths should congress determine it wishes to take action on this option range of possible legislative tools are available that might influence that following potential paths of development including supporting the current path of development supporting the designation of one fusion center per state moving toward the developmen t of regional fusion centers expanding the fbi field intelligence groups to be the federal strategic analysis fusion centers and establishing of national fusion center representative organization option 4 enhance informa tion access and management there are numerous measures which congress might c onsider in this area to assist fusion centers should congress determine it wishes to take action on this option range of possible legislative tools are availa ble that might influence that path of development as discussed below consider revision to federal regulations guiding state local and tribal slt criminal intelligence systems 28 cfr part 23 require all federally funded criminal intelligence systems to be interoperable standardize reporting formats consolidate federal information sharing systems consider increasing the number of cleared slt personnel at fusion centers urge compliance with the intelligence reform and
