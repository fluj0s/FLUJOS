business problems including oil fuel procurement congressional oversight and resources for additional information frequently asked questions contracting authority and eligibility what are the statutory regulatory and other controlling authorities for how federal government contracts are awarded in general the authority for awarding federal government contracts can be found in the united states code usc and the federal acquisition regulation far the crs2 statute in the us code for the competition in contracting act of 19841 explicitly states that the federal government shall obtain full and open competition through use of the competitive procedures in accordance with the requirements of this title and the federal acquisition regulation2 the far the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars3 and the united states agency for international development usaid acquisition regulation aidar outline seven different circumstances which permit dod and usaid to use other than full and open competition in the awarding of federal government contracts the competition in contracting act cites the following exceptions to the use of full and open competition 1 there is only one responsible source available to fulfill the contract requirements 2 the federal agencys need for these goods or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the federal government would be seriously injured if this contract were not awarded 3 the federal government needs to ensure that suppliers are maintained in the event of national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization or to establish or achieve or maintain an engineering development or research capability 4 the federal government has an international agreement to make this acquisition through means other than through full and open competition 5 statute specifically authorizes or requires that the contract be made through specific source 6 the use of full and open competition may compromise national security 7 the public interest would be better served by use of other than full and open competition4 the procedures for submitting written justifications to use other than full and open competition including review requirements and delegation of authority are outlined in dfars subparts 2063031 and 206304 and aidar 7063 the bush administration has set additional criteria for eligibility for contracting in iraq memorandum issued by deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz on december 5 2003 states that he has determined that it is in the public interest to limit competitive bidding for the procurement of certain iraqi relief and reconstruction prime contracts awarded by the coalition provisional authority 1 41usc 253 cica can also be found in title 10 usc chapter 137 and was included in section 805 of the fy2004 national defense authorization act pl 108136 2 41 usc 253 a1a 3 the defense federal acquisition regulation and aidar are supplements to the far see dfars subpart 2063 and aidar subpart 7063 other than full and open competition 4 for more detailed discussion on the seven exceptions to the use of full and open competition as outlined in the competition in contracting act see crs report rs21555 iraq reconstruction frequently asked questions concerning the application of federal procurement statutes by john r luckey crs3 cpa and dod on behalf of the cpa5 see the next question for the rationale the statement can be viewed at httpwwwrebuildingiraqnet what countries businesses are eligible to compete for contracts funded with us appropriated reconstruction funds contracts issued utilizing fy2003 appropriations were provided under sole source or limited competition procedures that ultimately benefitted us firms the national security interest was key justification for excluding competition domestic as well as foreign however as most contracts were then provided by usaid and treated as foreign assistance they became subject to buy america provisions of law under the foreign assistance act of 1961 and exempt from international procurement agreements6 foreign countries could however participate as subcontractors to the selected american firms and are estimated to compose half or more of the total cost of these contracts most fy2004 appropriations managed by the cpa are being treated somewhat differently under previously mentioned december 5 2003 determination and findings report issued by deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz prime contracts are subject to full and open competition only among us firms and those of 62 other eligible countries including iraq coalition partners and force contributing nations the rationale for barring other countries firms is that it is necessary for the protection of the essential security interests of the united states countries ineligible to compete for prime contracts may still participate as subcontractors some excluded countries such as germany and france have protested the decision on the grounds that it may violate the wtos government procurement agreement gpa some us officials suggest that the contracting organization cpa is not covered by the gpa and need not allow open competition others point out that gpa rules and existing practice exempt much foreign assistance from their requirements the strength of these arguments has been questioned on january 13 2004 president bush announced that canada previously excluded as an opponent of the war but significant financial contributor could compete for contracts that have not yet been open for bids7 will israeli businesses be eligible to participate in iraqi contracts reflecting political sensitivities in the middle east israeli businesses are not eligible for prime contracts resulting from fy2004 appropriations although it has consistently backed us policy in iraq israel did not express official support at the request of the bush administration israeli firms however are eligible to participate 5 the memo cites the authority as contained in 41 usc 253 c7 and 10 uscc7 as implemented by far 63027 6 section 604 of pl 87195 as amended 7 pentagon bars three nations from iraqi bids new

httpwwwrebuildingiraqnet is responsible for selecting projects and overseeing 25 iraq reconstruction prime contracts worth up to 186 billion that were originally to be awarded by february 2004 however slipped deadlines and the accelerated sovereignty schedule have led to reevaluation of the pmos needs and capabilities by the end of march 2004 only about 22 billion of the original 186 billion had been obligated as of may contracts potentially worth nearly 8 billion of the 186 billion in fy2004 supplemental funding had been awarded among recent reasons for the slow progress are the requirement for open and competitive bidding for most of the new reconstruction contracts and interagency disputes over control of the funds security concerns escalating since march have also delayed reconstruction further previously major contract awards and management for postwar iraq reconstruction projects were administered by usaid httpwwwusaidgoviraq activitieshtml other federal agencies

orders to be approved as needed without having to compete tasks orders have the effect of acting as small contracts are awarded without benefit of competition and can be quite large reportedly three

provide an assessment of the necessary repairs to the iraqi oil infrastructure19 this contract was solesource contract to repair and operate oil wells in iraq according to the army corps of engineers kbr was selected for this contract because kbr was judged to be the only contractor that could begin implementing the contingency plan on such extremely short notice dod has asserted that kbr had

system was developed categories of eligible and ineligible contracts are provided on the cpa website with details about specific suppliers listed in tables arranged by country press reports in

the offp by the hussein government and when the offp was under authority including list of individuals companies and organizations that may have received kickbacks23 since nearly the beginning of the offp there have been allegations of program abuses and audits have been conducted at different points over the life of the program apparently us officials were particularly concerned about whether iraq was using the additional revenue to buy prohibited military and wmd technology24 in march 2004 secretarygeneral koffi annan suggested to the security council that an independent investigation

contract management under the cpa it appears that the number of iraqis roughly 60 dependent on food assistance provided by the public distribution system has not changed since the termination of the offp it is expected that the new iraqi interim government will take responsibility for continuing the process of closing out the program and for managing food distribution but specific details are not yet available27 what can explain the cost differential in halliburtonkbr oil fuel purchases from kuwait and turkey halliburtonkbr on behalf of the cpa has purchased oil fuels for consumption by the iraqi population gasoline has been purchased from kuwait and turkey and delivered into iraq by truck while roughly 75 of the gasoline has come from turkey both the commodity cost of the fuel and the cost of transport from kuwait are each more than twice as high as the corresponding charges associated with turkish supplies what can explain the cost differential in each element of this transaction in most cases fuels for iraq were purchased in two geographically separate markets supplies came from both turkish suppliers and international spot markets in the mediterranean oil trading area offshore purchases were imported into the mediterranean ports of iskenderum and mersin and shipped overland by turkish truckers to iraq in other cases fuels were purchased from kuwaiti supplier not directly in the oil business who also made transport arrangements between may and october 2003 halliburton imported about 179 million gallons from turkey and 61 million gallons from kuwait turkish supplies averaged 124 per gallon delivered those from kuwait averaged 264 including 121 for the fuel and the remainder transport and kbr fees28 this is the most recent price data available despite purchases continuing through the end of march 2004 information on the quantities of gasoline obtained for iraq were provided to the house government reform committee by the corps of engineers for the

new york times dec 10 2003 section p1 crs12 period of halliburton fuel procurement management the cheaper turkish purchases which comprised about 75 of total of 464 billion gallons acquired29 may well have comprised all the available supply in that trading area hence perhaps the need for the higher priced supplies from nearby kuwait however certain factors might have contributed to higher kuwaiti prices dealing with dangerous transportation over 60 vehicles have been destroyed or damaged at least 3 people killed and several more injured using shortterm supply contracts the 30day supply contract specified in the supply arrangement with kuwait may have been too short to lineup additional trucks which are apparently in short supply the nature of the existing kuwaiti supply contract according to platts oilgram news the kuwait petroleum corp refused to grant kbr permission to deal with any other supplier than the altanmia commercial marketing company to procure and deliver petroleum products from kuwait to iraq altanmias main shareholder is najeeb alhumaizi part of prominent kuwait family closely linked to the kuwaiti government altanmia refuses to provide cost

inspector general made preliminary finding that kbr had overcharged 61 million on january 23 2004 the wall street journal reported that two halliburton employees had admitted taking 6 million in kickbacks30 the company confirmed this the wall street journal went on to note specifically that the kickbacks did not involve the gasoline purchases under scrutiny although the employees involved worked in the same office in kuwait that handled the gasoline contract the defense contract audit agency dcaa has requested that the inspector general findings be forwarded to pentagon criminal
