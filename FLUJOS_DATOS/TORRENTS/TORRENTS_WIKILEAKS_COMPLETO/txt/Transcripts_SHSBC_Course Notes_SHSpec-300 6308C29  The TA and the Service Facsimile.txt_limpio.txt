6308c29 shspec300 the ta and the service facsimile if you cannot make keyedout clear with prepcheck in 25 hours or less the pc is operating on service facsimile this is startling but elementary prepcheck fits in with the itsa line very closely the 18 buttons are hot they give the key itsas of the case if they are not working you have service facsimile on your hands in doing prepcheck it is assumed that you are using timelimiter in order to keep the amount of restimulation under control if you dont control the itsa line the pc will restimulate more charge than you can get asised the time limiter you use can be by subject or location as well as by date pc answering prepcheck questions is giving you key itsas if prepcheck is done for this lifetime you should get keyedout clear per the book 1 definition of clear see dmsmh pp 817 77017 clearing in this way is destimulation by knocking out the points where restimulation took place making incidents inert an inert incident can be restimulated however degree of restimulation is not important to state of case neither is the condition of being restimulated but there is state of case with respect to restimulation all cases are restimulated to some degree but some are overrestimulated case that is overrestimulated will not discharge the restimulation by ordinary means because discharge has somehow been prevented this condition is important it is getting ahold of too much and not discharging it uncontrolled itsa line can cause overrestimulation an incident that is discharged has been relieved of charge so that it can longer be restimulated restimulation can be let off without the incident that was restimulated being discharged it can simply be destimulated so with bank you can either destimulate it by knocking out the keyins of the original charge or you can discharge it by running it discharge is flowing off of charge when an incident is discharged it is gone and it is longer capable of being restimulated let us assume that the reactive mind consists mainly of inert incidents if they would just stay quiet you would never have to clear anybody however the pcs attention can be directed at the incident by life auditing or the pc himself at which point the incident converts the pcs attention to restimulation over which he has control if the pcs attention goes to the incident so as to have understanding and confront you will see ta motion and the incident can be discharged or erased on the other hand if the pcs attention flicks over the incident giving keyin you can knock out the moment of keyin by having him look at it and it will destimulate again ie it will key out bank is inert until life or auditing causes the pcs attention to go onto portion of it the pcs attention is the actual source of charge an 18button prepcheck should key out anything that keyed in it can destimulate somebody to the state of clear so you dont have to make clear to make an ot you only have to make keyout clear the state of case of the pc is directly represented and analyzed by the tone arm and the free needle the eight levels of case compare with eight states of the tone arm and needle see pp 414415 for description of the eight levels of case case level 8 stage 4 needle 7 continuous rock slam 6 stuck needle at clear read dead thetan 5 low ta 4 high ta 3 ta moving in the high range 2 good ta through and past clear read 1 fn at clear read when lrh tried to go from destimulated clear to discharged clear he found that there was waystop short of ot the condition youve got to have to take anyone to ot is ta moving through clear read with good ta without that there is too much restimulation present for you to get the pc to discharge material from the backtrack or to get into gpms if you tried to do this anyway the pcs ta would tend to stick then to go high then to go low then eventually to stick at clear read if you then did prepcheck which would now be harder you could send him back to all those states of ta as you destimulated the case you wouldnt have to go all the way to fn to go to the backtrack now the subject isnt how you discharge the incident it is when the ta should be moving around preferably through 30 before you try to go backtrack so you can make clear by prepchecking few prepared subjects the case will feel wonderful sometimes for years until he starts wondering whether he still has any worries about what used to bother him then he starts restimulating himself and gets keyed in mere keyout clear cant be ot because when he tries to turn on the power it kicks in the inert incidents the only way to make clear completely stable would be to discharge everything in the bank from fning the meter goes blank because youve got nothing to measure thats ot overrestimulation is the cause of amnesia edgy and bad body feelings etc if you gave the pc three sessions in row without getting any ta he would feel rather bad because just the auditing would have restimulated charge and you would have an overrestimulated case when this happens memory gets bad facsimiles get harder to see incidents get jammed together the bank gets to be mess all this is due to overrestimulation if the pc now gets prepchecked and destimulated he can approach the track but this can be done with good ta only if the auditing is done gradiently with good cleanup of everything contacted discharging it as you go dont fail to pay attention to the ta and go backtrack hoping to get the incident responsible for the restimulation you will restimulate more than you discharge in the process of looking for the incident cheerful pc equals the itsa line in and the ta moving it almost doesnt matter what the ta is moving on case level relates to overrestimulation not to the amount of bank the pc has the auditing target is always the restimulated charge not the inert material in the bank see fig 18 the pc can always restimulate more once he has discharged what was available figure 20 destimulation graphics inserted clear means nothing in the restimulation chamber if too much gets restimulated by life auditing or the pc the auditor can destimulate it with prepchecks and arc break assessments see fig 20 p 487 above it is not possible to audit someone without doing one of three things 1 restimulating see fig 18 p 486 2 destimulating see fig 20 p 487 this is the same as keying something out or 3 discharging see fig 19 p 487 this is the same as erasing auditing is always doing at least one of these three things when case is already confused and is not confronting well naturally the amount of destimulation and discharge are minimal so restimulation takes over you will get ta motion when you dont destimulate or discharge anything you will restimulate more and you will get ta lack of ta is danger signal the auditor should find out why there are two possible actions 1 the auditor may do something that can discharge or destimulate the restimulated charge eg prepchecking or flattening what has been left unflat prepchecking or r2h would be safest 2 he can look for something that is preventing discharge eg by doing an arc break assessment to find the correct bpc if the ta is not restored immediately only one thing is wrong the case is sitting in service facsimile and will only worsen until the service facsimile is cleared if small amount of auditing doesnt restore the case to clear state the pc has service facsimile if he is sitting in one it must be run or he will not improve prepchecks turn on mass in the presence of service facsimile because the pc has intention of getting rid of it the pc wont let go of the service fac and the service fac wont surrender to the prepcheck this also includes hidden standards now that we know that the anatomy of service fac is rightnesswrongness computation we can do something about it we knew of their existence before as can be seen in advanced procedures and axioms pp 711 the 18button prepcheck should key out the pc if it doesnt the pc has service fac prepcheck is just series of types of decisions that thetan makes about things if it turns on mass it must be in conflict with rightness and wrongness so in the pcs eyes the auditor is trying to make the pc wrong with the prepcheck and the pc moves the facsimile forward as defense increasing mass the only reason for high ta is overrestimulation the two things that prevent its cure are 1 the cases overrestimulated condition 2 service facsimile that the case isnt about to give up to some degree most cases fall into the service fac category but most dont have the service fac directly in the road of auditing only service facs that lie across the road of auditing interfere with clearing if the service fac has to do with the pcs spiritual condition with his case itself then you have to handle it so that he can get case gain the more pc is trying to be right by having wrong case the less progress the auditor will make with this case pc says if i didnt have bank theyd give one so having bank is right dont let the pc itsa beyond the answer to the auditing question it is far better for the pc to feel that his comm has been cut than for him to pull in restimulation by being permitted to overrun an answer an 18button prepcheck on an assessed this lifetime subject or subjects should give you keyout clear but service fac wont surrender to prepcheck
