on its performance and operations but promised spectacular returns despite the critical tone and pertinent advice contained in the nel commission re port and the negative publicity it generated none of th regulators did inspections at an early enough stage to stop the fraudulent operation in its tracks the fsb press release explained trading in unlis ted securities is not regulated activity under the st ock exchanges control act 1985 and currently does not fall within the fsbs ambit fsb financial markets senior manager norman muller was quoted in the infamous press release as saying that once the securities services bill ssb became law the fsb would have the powers to prohibit person from car rying on the business of trading in unlisted securities r to impose conditions for the carrying on of such busin ess my column8 highlighted the predicament at the time we know pscgg has been marketing shares without v alid prospectus for more than two years after the validity of the origi nal and only prospectus ended as far back as 15 june 2000 but the prominen t advertising campaign should have made the registrar aware that the marketing of new shares has continued actively after that date you could perhaps argue that pscgg is not company in the normal sense and is actually meant to be unit trust sche in this case why is the financial services board fsb not the regulato r but whether it is company or unit trust scheme pscgg simply refuse s to disclose its investment portfolio whichever of the two pscgg ma be it is violating either the companies act or the unit trusts act but there could be third possibility that is tha t its activities as result of the nondisclosure of its investment portfolio nd the selling of investments without valid prospectus it could pe rhaps be seen as deposittaking institution in this case the reser ve banks bank supervision division would be the regulator but it is very possible that pscgg is craftily slipping through all three legisl ative nets the companies act the unit trust control act and the ba nks act and making fool of all three regulators shortly afterwards at the end of seminar on mone laundering at the then rand afrikaans

subsequent letter to the fsb attorney eckaar d roux did not indicate which one of the two entities he was representing ill return to the relevance of the t wo entities later roux nevertheless illustrated three different sc enarios he was actually seeking advice and comment as to whether the three scenarios fell under the now repe aled unit trust control act or the newly enacted collect ive investment schemes control act18 one of the scenarios entailed investors buying trus t shares at r100 per share and making loan to the trust of r99900 investments were thus made in multiples of r1 000 the trust would then buy the entire shareho lding in private company which owned the immovable property19 this option was in fact the structure which had bee n followed by sharemax for its first 14 syndications20 boyd later recorded in court papers my office ar rived at the conclusion that all the scenarios mentioned in rouxs letter will fall under the ambit of the unit trust control act and the

boyd does not reveal in his affidavit whether the f sb did any inspection on sharemax during the nine months following rouxs letter had the fsb or any othe r regulator done thorough inspection it would certa inly have revealed that sharemax had been using the unla wful trust structure repeatedly since 1999 and had conti nued to do so after rouxs letter had been delivered in fact after boyds directive in 2002 and until the scheme was stopped six further syndications raised r272m from the public using the same unlawful structure22 during that nine month period october 2002 to june 2003 rapports geld magazine repeatedly published articles and advertisements about property syndicat ion23 the fact that sharemax was raising money from the p ublic was as result of publicity in

section 50 of the aforementioned act requires col lective investment scheme in property to list on licensed exchange sharemax then informed boyd that they wou ld not be able to conform as the size of its business would not support such listing according to boyd this caused sharemax to investigate alternatives to its busines s structure as it stood at the time28 nevertheless sharemax steamed ahead and undertook more syndications using the trust structure notab ly the bluff in durban during that time my meeting with sharemax took plac e29 and two columns were published in sake30 highlighting the fact that sharemax was in all probability also in b reach of section 30 of the companies act by using the trust structure it was unlawful to use trust to raise funds from the public31 the huge margins

legi slation and then they couldnt stop the fidentia disaster in good time louw said to ill return to fidentia late r we agreed that much simpler and principled ruleo flaw type approach would have been much more appropriate and effective my oneline interpretation of judge nels report is exactly that what south africa actually needs is value driven approach as opposed to rule based approach i highlighted pertinent example in chapter 7 compa ny law has over many decades successfully cultivated t he value of the doctrine of disclosure it is embodied in the south african companies act and in many others internationally if you discard established values like this then youre more or less compelled to compensate by creating bureaucratic monster and following str ict rulebased approach nevertheless im not saying the fais legislation i s useless there are some very useful parts such as the focus on training and on disclosures as required by section 19 of the act one of the key features of the fais legislation is the list of socalled fit and proper requirements for financi services providers39 the principled nature of the section in the regulations dealing with honesty and integri ty resembles value orientated approach the remainder of the regulations appear to be very detailed but the prescriptive nature of certain par ts of it is likely to turn into an administrative nightmare for the fsb and financial services providers and it is unlikel to root out the real scamsters sharemax is case in point since november 2003 th ey have nestled in with the registrar of

november 2003 determination of fit and proper requirements for financial services providers 2003 18 opening sentence is pertinent an applicant must b person who is honest and has integrity 79 the first question is whether boyd can vouch to wil lie bothas integrity in the light of his very first ex periences with him in 2002 and 2003 certainly this is someth ing that anderson and his colleagues should have taken into account the second issue is the oude molen history80 here the issue is whether anderson and his colleagues afford ed themselves sufficient opportunity to consider all t he facts i have serious doubts based on the history outlined above in determining whether an applicant is honest and has integrity the registrar may refer to any informati on in his possession or that has been brought to his attentio n81 he may do so but did he choose to do so once again im doubtful whether the fsb did in fact consider all relevant information prior to granting the licences it may very well make sense to replace the word may in the regulat ions with must the regulations list various circumstances that dis qualify person from being judged fit and proper its p retty long list but generally one can say that if during period of five years preceding the license application person has been found guilty in criminal court civil court by professional or financial services industry body or has been denied membership of professional body the fsb may disqualify such person 82 acting fraudulently dishonestly unprofessionally dishonourably in breach of fiduciary duty neglige ntly or incompetently may place persons fit and proper status in jeopardy 83 once again its doubtful that the fsb or for that matter the consumer affairs committee has gone deeply eno ugh into the affairs of oude molen it is equally unlik ely that they have vigorously followed through on their investigations for possible civil and criminal acti on 79 ibid p 6 80 see chapter 4 81 government gazette 25682 op cit p 6 82 ibid p 6 83 ibid 19 the period of five years stipulated above may ve ry well have played role in judging whether and how to re spond to the oude molen shenanigans it is uncertain when it was considered that the oude molen scenario had fin ally ended the fact is it was still playing itself out at the time the fsp licenses of sharemax and pic were granted willie bothas egg dance about his involvement84 in oude molen and dw promotion is significant in the context of sharemaxs fsp application it is also noteworthy that dw promotion was liquida ted on 20 august 2005 about three weeks before sharemaxs fsp license was granted and only days after prof woker signed her report 85 another disqualifying factor is if person has bee n found guilty by any regulatory or supervisory body86 here boyds first experiences with sharemax investments cc are relevant to what extent was it followed up or was it simply that sharemax was given an indemnity strangely it would appear that what went wrong ear lyon didnt carry much weight when the fsp license was granted further disqualifying factor is if authorization to carry on business has been refused or the business has been suspended87 once again the early history of sharemax investments cc with the fsb is relevant then the final fit and proper straw an applicant must in the application be candid and accurate and must of own accord disclose all facts or information at the disposal of or which may be accessible to the applicant and which may b relevant for purposes of decision by the registrar that the ap plicant complies or does not comply with subparagraph 1 meaning that an applicant must be person who is honest and has integrity i cannot venture an opinion here in relation to sha remax or pic because i didnt see the applications all i know from my experiences is that sharemax and pic are 84 see chapter 4 85 transvaal provincial division of the high court ex parte application for the liquidation of dw promotion

documentation may very well become public documents one day are their ducks in row and did the fsb take all reasonable steps to sure just that decision to grant an fsp license is minor matt er in determination linked to the leaderguard debacle f ais ombud charles pillai emphasized in making decision the registrar is expected to apply his mind carefully and thoroughly to all information presented to him in the application form the registrar is also not confined to the informati on contained in the application formsection 8 of the fais act deals with authorization of fsps this section goes to the heart of licensing and licensing requirements for fsps this section is crucial to t he proper application of the fais act and is central to the achievement of t he purposes of the fais act namely to regulate the rendering of financial services to clients everything should begin with license it must be accepted that licensing and the administration of licenses is the first ste p towards effective regulation and control equally one must then accep t that application for licenses by would be fsps must be treated carefull and seriously and the criteria set out in section 8 must be strictly appl ied failure in this will immediately undermine the very purpose of the fais act90 whatever the situation sharemax got its fsp licens sooner rather than later it did what masterbond h ad done in 1984 with its registration as participati on bond scheme91 it used it as commercial tool to raise vast amounts of money from the public and as tool to g ain unmerited credibility it didnt

have one common aim to serve and prote ct the public over the years billions of rands have been investe d by unsuspecting and uninformed members of the public in socalled pyram id schemes and shady

simple question of whether full financ ial statements have been submitted to the registrar sharemax pic and other schemes are longer aimed only at white afrikaners in pretoria black south africans are so large investors and are at the mercy of crooked marketing personnel who are often as sly as the craftiest fox if the registrar of companies do esnt do his job that causes chain of events that prevents the media fr om doing its job properly98 since then so i have been informed manuel has instructed the tax authorities to collect their tax but not to disturb the property syndication scene because h doesnt want thousands of senior citizens on his stoep during the weeks after the questions in parliament i continued to publish damning articles and columns bout sharemax with the benefit of hindsight it can now be said that these articles and columns indirectly question ed the wisdom of granting sharemax its fsp license one of the first syndications done after the granti ng of the fsp

the honourable court that my office has not scru tinized the applicants business in the past nor is it doin g so on an ongoing basis 102 he continued i must add that it is my impression that the applicant is overemphasizing its authorization under section 8 of the fais act to persuade this honourab court and possibly also potential investors that th fsb has approved the applicants productthe fais acts focus doesnt concern the financial product itself botha further stated that sharemax enjoyed sound relationship with the fsb103 again anderson repudiated him saying that the fsb did not have any relationsh ip with sharemax other than in terms of the fais act the f sb did not support sharemaxs property syndication bus iness as such104 botha pushed his luck bit further by stating that the fsb was satisfied with the format of investment105 anderson replied it may be that the fsb is satisfied as to the juristic entity or the structure of the applicants business but if botha refers to the property syndication ind ustry in general i cannot concur with his statement 106 anderson recorded that sharemax had submitted an application for an fsp license and based on the information disclosed

there is in all probability ample reason to reconsi der the issuing of the fsp license are the antennas of th fsbs inspectorate sufficiently finely tuned did the fsb silently put their faith on the
