pursuing range of wmd programs albeit not entirely successfully the bush administration noted in 2003 that we have long been cerned about libyas longstanding efforts to pursue nuclear chemical and biologi cal weapons and ba llistic missiles6 libya continues to deny any bw program but its chemi cal weapons capability including use of cw against chad in the 1980s and facilities at rabta and

be required to help libya destroy the rest of its chemical stockpile senator lugar has stated that the ndf doe s not have the size scope or experience to do dismantlement operations to employ nuc lear scientists or undertake longer term nonproliferation efforts one possibility is to use cooperative th reat reduction ctr funds for these activities which became theore tically possible with the expansion of the application of ctr funds since fy200427 but which was impossible in practical sense before july 2006 because of libyas status as state sponsor of terrorism ctr funds may also contain more restrictions than ndf funds particular ly in contractual requirements congress may wi sh to consider whether to provide additional assistance to libyan disarmament and if so how
