significant differences between the iraq situation and other postwar experiences observations and lessons l earned from such experiences might be relevant this report will discuss six security and governance issues raised by previous experiences with particular refe rence to us postworld war ii occupation experiences and also peacekeeping experien ces in the balkans and afghanistan it may be updated as new issues arise for wh ich assessments of previous experiences might be useful previous experience suggests three key decisions on security in postwar iraq which policymakers must take these are 1 what security tasks must be performed 2 who should perform them and 3 how large should an occupation military force be and how long should it rema in many tasks must be performed in order to guarantee the security of c itizens and property in the postconflict environment several of wh ich require constabulary fo rces ie those possessing both military and policing skills in previous major us occupations us soldiers initially performed most policing tasks turning them over to indigenous police as the situation allowed in the 1990s peacek eepers increasingly assumed policing functions as the need to guarantee security for property and citizens in the aftermath of conflict became apparent many analysts have argued that policing functions are not appropriate for us forces as they can erode warfighting and many also believe that appropriately trained civilian police are often preferable the lack of such personnel however has been problem in current peacekeeping operations the size of an occupation force and the leng th of time that it should remain in place during an occupation governme nt depends on many factors including in particular the tasks it undertakes and the coopera tion it receives from iraqis policymakers must also decide what type of assistance to provide iraq in creating new government and supporting in stitutions to fill the power vacuum left by the fall of the hussein government th ree issues are 1 who should form post war government for iraq 2 what are the possibilities of and means to achieving democracy in iraq and 3 how long is peacebuilding presence necessary while the us government has taken charge of the formation of new iraqi government with the intent of encouraging the creati on of democratic institutions and practices some analysts believe that the possibilities for creating viable and democratic iraqi government would be enhanced if the unit ed nations were to assume that role some senior us officials had contemplated an occupati on of some two years which some experience suggests may be inadequate to create stable institutions studies of past peacekeeping experiences point to the sp ecial need for considerable attention to building capacities to assure the rule of law conducting elections at an appropriate time and possibly providing for interim powersharing arrangements some have also

often used as broad generic term to describe the many activities that the united nations and other international and national organizations or coalitions undertake to promote maintain enforce or enhance th possibilities for peace and it is generally used as such in crs products as defined in the 2000 brahimi report the term peacekeeping refers to one subset of peace operations ie complex model of many elements military and civilian working together to build peace in the dangerous aftermath of civil wars another subset peacebuilding is defined in the same report as activities undertaken on the far side of conflict to reassemble the foundations of peace and provide the tools for building on those foundations someth ing that is more than just the absence of war these activities include but are not limite d to reintegrating former combatants into civilian society strengthening the rule of law for example through training and restructuring of local police and judicial and penal reform improving respect for human rights through the monitoring education and investigation of past and existing abuses providing technical assistance for democratic development including electoral assistance and support for the free media and promoting conflict resolution and reconciliation techniques united nations secretary gene ral report of the panel on united nations

us policymakers are faced with decisions for which experiences from past us occupations and international peacekeeping more specifically peacebuilding may provide some guidance1 the iraq case as all cases is in many ways unique and the conditions that will prevail in postconflict iraq are as yet unclear still there ma be similarities in the requirements for and problems inherent in 1 ensuring stability and 2 building new government in postwar iraq2 for the transition to new iraqi governme nt analysts have looked at variety of experiences to inform policies and implementing organizations and to anticipate possible outcomes some analysts have examined united states occupation experiences in particular the successful democratization experiences after world war ii in japan and germany as examples of what the united states can accomplish when repressive government has been feated and the united states has the power to fill the political vacuum other analys ts believe that comparisons

operations from the 1 990s to the present are more relevant most peacekeeping operations have been conducted as part of the settlement of civil war unlike in iraq but many of them have grappled with the problems of resolving deep rooted sectar ian differences the existence of such ethnic tribal and religious differences in iraq among arabs of the sunni and shiite muslim sects muslims of kurdish ethnic origin and christians lead some analysts to believe that policymakers will have much to learn in formulating security and governance policies for posthussein iraq from experiences in bosnia and kosovo where ethnic tensions trigge red civil war after the breakup of yugoslavia in 1991 many also look to afghanistan where long standing ethnic tensi ons have continued to produce armed conflict even after u s military action in 2001 installed new multiethnic interim government some analysts also believe that lessons from efforts to promote democracy often unde rtaken as peacebuilding component of peacekeeping operation may help planne rs enhance the possibilities for stable and representative if not mocratic iraqi government this paper will discuss six salient issues raised by past occupation and peacekeeping operations for current decisionmaking in iraq with particular reference to the post world war ii us occupation experiences and to peacekeeping operations in the balkans and afghanistan three security issues that need to be addressed are 1 what security tasks must be performed 2 who should perform them and 3 how large should an occupation military fo rce be and how long should it remain three governance issues that also must be decided are 1 who should form post war government for iraq 2 how long is peacekeeping presence necessary and 3 what are the possibilities of and means to achieving democracy in iraq experience from previous peacekeeping ope rations suggests that policymakers may wish to address these issues quick ly 2002 top level united nations review of its peacekeeping operations concluded that the first six to 12 weeks after ceasefire or peace accord took effect were often the most critical ones for establishing both stable peace and the cr edibility of new ope ration opportunities lost during that period are hard to regain3 security issues one of the most important and contenti ous issues of any postconflict operation is who will undertake what security tasks the importance of immediately ensuring adequate security is constant theme of postconflict literature there is considerable acknowledgment that failu re to provide enoug h properly equipped troops and police with an appropriate use of force mandate can complicate post conflict operations enor mously and usually prolong them most importantly failure to guarantee stability is often viewed as serious impediment the establishment of legitimate and effective government4 according to one analyst the securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31871crs3 4 continued bipartisan

michael w doyle war making peace making and the united nations in turbulent peace opcit pp 535536 dilemma remains major problem both in the short term during the transition from war to building shared political institutions and later as the new government tries to cope with its very substantial problems5 in iraq some citizens have already expressed disillusionment with the united states faulting the us military for failing to assign personnel immediately to prevent the looting and killings of iraqis by iraqis that accompanied the coalition takeovers of baghdad and some other major cities6 in the weeks before the coalition action in iraq many analysts pointed to need to place high priority on providing security in postconflict iraq one thi nk tank report on iraq stated that security needs in the postwar peri od cannot be underestimated7 another stated that us and coalition forces would need to pi vot quickly from combat to peacekeeping operations in order to prev ent postconflict iraq from scending into anarchy8 lack of adequate security has been c ited as key problem in many peacekeeping operations most recently many analys ts have faulted the ad hoc coalition peacekeeping force in afghanistan where vice president was assassinated in july 2002 there many analysts argue the legitimacy of the interim government of hamid karzai has been substantially er oded as the relatively small peacekeeping force of 7000 troops from fluctuating gr oup of about 20 nations deployed only in and around kabul has been unable to protect the afghani population against bandits and warlords earlier the lack of adequate military force complicated by the lack of mandate to use force except in selfdefense also has been cited as an important factor in the failure of the 19921995 peacekeeping operation in bosnia9 where serbian forces slaughtered muslims who had sought refuge in established safe havens the lack of security in partic ular lack of constabularyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31871crs4 10 for instance according to one analyst in some cases notably bosnia east timor kosovo and sierra leone maintaining proactive and flexible military and police presence is critical to the creation of durable peace bosnia has shown for example that sustaining the peace process can require peacekeeping troops to engage in what might be termed non military activities for example arresting indi cted war criminals and combating organized crime syndicates that had their roots in the war economy similarly in countries where negotiated settlements

for an occupation about 100 of which would be carried out at least initially by the coalition military forces see conrad c crane and w andrew terrill reconstructing iraq insights challenges and

militarys organizational and materiél advantages were detailed by one analyst soldiersarrive in organized groups with vehicles communications and their own security they can cover an area like blanket

peacekeep ing operations in bosnia and kosovo10 what security tasks must be performed in postconflict situations military forces including us forces have performed many different kinds of security tasks11 most of which would apply to iraq at least 12 broad tasks each of which has many differe nt components have been cited as necessary to ensure security in post conflict settings about five of these are considered largely military tasks including to 1 protect humanitarian relief workers 2 disarm and demobilize unwan ted or unneeded military personnel 3 mine national territory 4 protect borders against intruders and 5 contain the ambitions for power of armed local regi onal religious or ethnic leaders known in some cases as warlords who would seek to disrupt the establishment of the new regime the remaining seven tasks are viewed as mainly requiring police skills although military might influence organizational structure materiél and skills are often required to carry them out in the immediate aftermath of conflict when violence is still high12 of these the three that most often require combination of military and police attributes are to 1 block reprisal killings and recrimination actions the latterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31871crs5 13 one analyst noted that the shortrun soci and economic dislocations resulting from economic liberalization and structural adjust ment programs introduced by international organizations in postconflict societies led to sharp increases in criminal violence in salvador he stated society experienced greater violence during postwar years than war years due to the high levels of criminal activity roland paris wilsons ghost the faulty assumptions of postconflict peacebuilding in turbulent peace opcit pp 770771 14 michael dziedzic in remarks before the united nations association of the national capital area april 8 2003of which may require crowd control 2 c ontrol arms and confiscate illegal weapons and 3 arrest and try war criminals four other tasks which usually fall to the police although military intelligence and trainers may assist in their performance are 1 dismantle criminal networks sometimes involving local police and government officials 2 undertake poli ce and security force reform 3 promote concepts of human rights and 4 protect civ ilians and property from common crime13 especially in early postconflict situations protecting civilians and property from common crime may require mix of military and policing skills analysts cite most of these tasks as necessary for maintaining security in post conflict iraq the exception thus far is that one has reported the existence within the iraq security forces and in husseins baath political party of the type of organized criminal network that exists in bosnia there some political leaders and alleged war criminals are believed to belong to th network which engages in counterband smuggling also at times local police have refused requests to act against criminals because some analysts believe the police are accomplices this linkage between political and criminal groups did not develop or at least surface however until after bosnias nationalist leaders had attained power only now over seven years after nato forces initiated peacekeeping operations in bosnia are the intelligence and legal systems in place to begin to crack this network14 who should perform them one crucial issue for us policymakers will be who is to perform these tasks particularly if us armed forces do not the bush administrations repeated assertions that the us milita ry will remain only as long as necessary preferably for limited period and the possibility that us forces might be needed in other theaters raises the question of whether the united states military might leave while military force is still required related questions are when and to what degree iraqi military and police and possibly us contracted or international police partner with us forces or take over the various security tasks within days after the fall of baghdad the united states called for iraqi police to register themselves for possible return to duty after vetting military forces in past occupations and peace operations these security tasks have been handled in different ways in germany and japan for instance us and allied military forces provided total security at the outset gradually handing policing tasks over to vetted indigenous police forces who took over both normal policing and constabulary roles over the past decade however there has been some controversy over the use of us forces in peacekeeping operations for any taskshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31871crs6 15 since the early 1990s the performance of many of these tasks by us tr oops has been highly controversial some military analysts argue that they are inappropriate for us soldiers because such tasks dull their warfighting edge see crs issue brief ib94040 peacekeeping issues of us

and public security washington dc national defens university press 1998 p 9 17 last opcit p 83except the protection of humanitarian relief workers and the containment of warlords15 in the early 1990s the united nations organized peacekeeping forces with troop and later police contributions from member states to undertake several of these tasks the uns inability to establish stable environment in several operations most particularly in the balkans in the ear ly 1990s led most analysts to conclude that the united nations as currently structured lacks the capacity to carry out the type of military activities that are necessary to keep the peace in hostile and potentially hostile environments since 1995 operations in such environm ents have been carried out by the military forces of nato as in bosnia and kosovo or coalitions of the willing ie sanctioned multilateral forces as in afghanistan some analysts have suggested that nato might take on security role in iraq given international tensions surrounding us military action in iraq particularly disagreements with nato members france and germany however other nations may prove unwilling even in the longterm to provide troops to supplement or replace us forces in the postwar period police forces the potential disadvantages of continuing use of military forces have led military planners to give special consideration to determining the point when conditions existed for constabul ary and police forces to begin to assume security tasks while military forces are viewed as necessary in the early post conflict periods they can so metimes prove counter productive if single soldier errs by using excessive force the entire mission can be placed in jeopardy because local consent may be squandered wrote one military officer16 according to another analyst an excessive security presence or the wrong type of presence can be provocative and dangerous after violence has been contained the visibility of armed security forces indicates problems and dysfunction17 over the past decade experiences in peacekeeping operations have been combed for lessons that might be learned regarding the appropriate timing and mix of forces to use to perform security tasks increasingly those analyzing and planning peacekeeping operations have argued for rang of different kinds of forces carrying out different roles in the words of one analyst military forces are effective at guaranteeing security against military oppos ition they are much less effective against riots and civilian disturbances lik the ones experienced in bosnia as the refugees tried to go homethey are impot ent in the face of bricks through windowshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31871crs7 18 last opcit p 84 19 in many operations the or other international civilian police missions were not granted authority to arrest or detain suspects this created problems especially where local police forces would not take action for in stance when the local police obstruct the process or violate agreements as the serb republic police did in banja luka in 1998 and subsequently in other places in bosnia th international police monitors may call upon the military force to shut down police station seize illegal weapons or take action to ensure public safety the international military forc is the backup that helps to force violence down to levels where effective civilian

calls in the night so we need spectrum of forces to bring violence under control18 in addition to the military forces and military police contributed by many countries to peacekeeping operations several other types of forces have been used to provide security two ty pes of international forces have been important 1 the constabulary forces of other countries in particular the carabineri of italy and the gendarmes of france and 2 the civpols ie police contributed through the civilian police mechanism that recruits active duty or retired policemen from member states to serve in an international police force international civpols monitor assist mentor and train local police on occasion th ey may mediate local disputes and ensure public order they may call on military forces when necessary often vetted local police forces have also been used to provide security under international oversight 19 and sometimes recons tructed military forces have also been used studies and experiences suggest the im portance of coor dinated overlapping sharing of powers among military paramilitary and international and domestic police forces with the first three phasing out as levels of violence diminish20 in particular the need to provide constabulary forces to handle crowds of civilians became more and more recognized in peacekeeping operations organized in platoons and companies along military lines such paramilitary forces deal with largescale civil disturbances and with armed and organized criminal elements to avoid embroiling heavily armed troops in crowd control the

democracies during the occupations of germany and japan but conditions there were substantially different than in iraq today despite concerns of policymakers during wartime planning for the occupations that the german and japanese cultures were inhe rently antidemocratic us occupation forces found the populations receptive to the creation of democr atic model and able to build on

thus may not be appropriate vehicles for democratization efforts as described by analysts of peace operations civil society is important in several ways to furtheri ng democratic processes63 one way support for such groups promotes democracy is that it enables populations to take ownership of the process building cooperation at gra ssroots level and providing checks on government another is that local civil society institutions can address key issues such as reconciliation justice and human ri ghtsthat go to the heart of what many consider to be the root causes of civil wars64 third is that such institutions can foster culture that promotes democratic governance whether international assist ance to support civil society in iraq would similarly contribute to democratization is unknown wh ile it is difficult to judge the effects of democratization aid in general judging the degree to which assistance to such groups can promote democracy is even more problematic one extensive study of such groups stated that it could not reach definitive answer regarding the effect of civil society assistance on overall political change but found that evidence fairly consistently indicated that such assistance alone is unlikely to be major factor in promoting democratization65 still despite noting numerous problems with civil society aid and suggesting reforms the author s recounted several be nefits of such aid including the establishment of the important idea that civil society has rightful role in governance66 appropriate conditions for and timing of elections carefully structured and

head of the in terim administration to head national government until elections are held in tw years and it endorsed karzais cabinet which contained leaders and representa tives from the various factions some analysts now argue that the afghan arrangements can provide model for the formation of government in iraq73 although the concept of such arrangemen ts may seem antide mocratic to many observers some analysts have seen power sharing arrangements as an essential element in settling or avoiding some civil wars in countries where there sharp division among ethnic or religious groups and one fundamental requirement for such effective peacekeeping according to some analysts is that such operations include all local stakeholders including those who have been the victims of war as well as those who have been the perp etrators of war and put them at the center of external s upport for re building74 in iraq too powersharing arrangementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31871crs24 74

strife or violence among cont ending factions such arra ngements may also help to retain capable people in government many analysts state that the continuation of iraqi governmental functions will depend on the retention of bureaucrats some of whom particularly at the upper levels are baath party members if not loyalists still as in the case of afghanistan where political violence continues to occur and some analysts believe threatens to unde rmine the new government powersharing arrangement alone may not guarantee ccessful transition according to one study that looked at the settlement of civil wars thirdparty security guarantees and enforcement are often necessary as well75 some analysts have also suggested that some form of powersharing formula be integrated into an electoral formula as one means of insuring stability in peacebuilding operations as argued by one analyst powersharing provisions for winners and losers in elections can be he lpful in some circumstances there need to be positions for both winners and losers in new government winnertakeall elections are seen as zerosum contests unless there is some form of compensation the loser will have strong incentives to take up arms and turn to renewed campaign of violence in pursuit of political objectives 76 nevertheless this analyst also notes tensions between powersharing arrangements and the achievement of other goals such as ensuring human rights and promoting justice77 in addition one analyst points out that in some situations ch arrangements may provide only weak incentives to moderate extremist positions thus making democracy vulnerable to such positions78httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31871crs25 79 sisk opcit p 799 80 sisk opcit p 795 should relative successes like salvador and south africa inspire our

norms even among analysts of peace operations who acknowledge the difficulties of establishing democracies some argue that the only solutions to differences are reached through the establishment of democratic practices arguing for international organizations to adopt norms and practices that promote democracy one analys t argued that sustained peace in deeply divided societies requires formula for the recognition and tolerance of ethnic differences strong legal protections fo r individual and group rights and political institutions that encourage bargaining compromise and inclusive coalitions he urged the continued development of in ternational media tion and monitoring practices and the establishment of new international norms on democracy such as an international right to

announced any comprehensive plans for peacebuilding activities in iraq althoug h it has recently contracted for one peacebuilding activity see the sections on police and on the rule of law above recent evaluations of peacebuilding missions suggest that time frame longer than two years may be necessary to put in place and consolidate the basic structures of democracy in an enduring framework much will depend however on iraqis ability to control sectarian differences hasten economic recovery nd growth and retain experienced people in government as well as the length of time it takes iraqis to agree on political structure in examining several peacekeepingpeacebuilding missions one analyst judged the one to two year transition periods in angola bosnia cambodia salvador and mozambique to be too s hort to record significant progress on even the reforms prescribed by the peace accords let alone those that are necessary to consolidate the peace but are not mandated by the accords81 she pointed out that time constraints such as restrictions on the length of mandates were often due to resource constraints and created difficulties in retaining high quality staff among other problems82

difficult to forecast precise outcomes and timeframes with certainty th study of past experiences can nonetheless provide valuable guidelines for initiating peacebuild ing activities an evaluating their progress
