reauthorization of the commodity futures trading commission and farm labor issues farm production support budget and spending pressure to reduce the fe deral budget deficit required congress to consider reductions in spending on usda programs the 109th congress has addressed usda spending levels on two fronts in budget reconciliation nd in the annual agriculture appropriations bill the defi cit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 enacted february 8 2006 contains ne t reductions in usda mandato ry spending of 27 billion over five years nearly half of this reduction was achieved through change in the timing of farm commodity payments and most of th balance consists of cuts to conservation rural development and research spending separately the full h ouse has passed and the senate appropriations committee has reported their resp ective versions of the fy2007 agriculture appropriations b ill hr 5384 which will provide annual funding for nearly all usda agencies and prog rams see

2005 and 2006 particularly hurricanes katrina and rita nd widespread drought have caused the 109th congress to consider emergenc disaster assistance for farm ers this year in response tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22013crs2 the 2005 hurricanes congress so far has pr ovided about 16 billion in agricultural assistance in two emergency supplemental act s pl 109148 and pl 109234 to date congress has not authorized any emergency crop or livestock payments for 2005 or 2006 production losses outside of the gulf states however the senatere ported version of the fy2006 agriculture appropriations bill hr 5384 contains 40 billion in various forms of farm assistance including payments for major crop and livestock losses caused by any 2005 disaster similar provisions for nonhurri cane states were contained in the senatepassed version of an fy2006 supplemental bill hr 4939 but were deleted in conference because of threatened administration veto of the measure see crs report rs21212 agricultural disaster assistance farm bill and commodity support programs farm income and price support programs are dictated primarily by title i of the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 which expires in 2007 the house and nate agriculture committee are conducting field hearings this year with more intens ive deliberations and markup expected in both committees in 2007 at issue is whether c ongress will extend the current farm support policy or if the pressures of tight federa l spending constraints concerns about the distribution of farm progra m benefits and the threat of potential world trade organization wto challenges to farm pr ice and income support spending will compel congress to consider significant changes to existing farm policy see crs report rl33037 previewing 2007 farm bill and crs report rs21999 farm commodity policy programs and issues for congress payment limits most crop payments are subject to annual perperson limits past legislative efforts to reduce the ma ximum amount of payments that producers can receive have been thwarted by strong opposition from southern cotton and rice growers in the 109th congress s 385 and hr 1590 would reduce payment limits to total

proposals dairy the milk income loss contract mil c program provides payments to dairy farmers when farm milk prices are below specified target level provision in the fy2006 budget reconciliation act pl 109171 extended milc program authority for two years through september 30 2007 but pr ohibits any milc payments beyond august 31 2007 consequently under current budget ru the program w ill have baseline budget spending allocated to it beyond its expiration date provision in the housereported version of the fy2007 agricu lture appropriations bill hr 5384 would have allowed payments in september 2007 and preserved th programs budget baseline for the next farm bill debate in 2007 because of its budget implications the provision was deleted on the house floor separately congress also completed action on measure pl 109215 s 2120 that requires the regula tion of certain rge dairy operation in the west that was previously exempt from paying federally mandated minimum farm milk prices

sufficient to comply with the original wto rulings and recommendations as result additional permanent modifications to us farm programs may still be needed to fully comply with the actionable subsidies portion of the wto ruling such changes ultimately would be decided by congress most likely in the c ontext of the 2007 farm bill see crs report rs22187 us agricultural policy response to wto cotton decision conservation programs spending for conserva tion programs which help producers protect and improve natural resour ces on some farmed land and retire other land from production have grow n rapidly since the 2002 farm bill reaching total of more than 52 billion in fy2005 this growth in spending reflects the expanded reach of conservation programs whic h now involve many more ndowners and types of rural lands budget pressures forced the 109th congress to weigh the be nefits of these programs against growing costs the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 reduced spending on several mandatory conservation programs by combined 934 million over five years another topic that continues to attract congressional interest is implementation of the conservation security program enacted in 2002 some stakeholders have questioned why usda has implemented the pr ogram in only few watersheds and why congress has limited funding even though the pr ogram was enacted as true entitlement the environmental conservation and agricu lture communities have started to identify conservation policy options that might be considered in the next farm bill the house and senate agriculture committees have started to examine selected conservation issues in recent hearings see crs report rl33556 soil and water conservation an overview energy although not as energyintensive as some industries agriculture is major consumer of energy directly as fuel or electricity and indirectly as fertilizers and chemicals in early september 2005 energy pri ces jumped to record levels in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita by rais ing the overall price structure of production agriculture sustained high energy prices coul d result in significantly lower farm and rural incomes in 2006 and are generating consider able concern about longerterm impacts on farm profitability agriculture also is vi ewed as potentially important producer of renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodi esel although farmbased energy production remains small relative to tota l us energy needs the energy bill pl10958 enacted in july 2005 includes renewable fuels standard rfs for biofuels that grows from 4 billion gallons in 2006 to 75 billion gallons in 2012 the rfs along with tax credit incentives is expected to encourage signifi cant increases in us ethanol production see crs report rl32677

agroterrorism is increasingly recognized as national security threat food defense hardening the critical infrastructure against possible attack has received increased attention since 2001 through increased appropriations labor atory and response capacities are being upgraded national response plans now incorporate agroterrorism yet some in congress want additional laws or oversight to increase

preparedness food safety approximately 76 million people get sick and 5000 die from foodrelated illnesses in the united states each year it is estimated congress frequently conducts oversight and periodi cally considers legislation on food safety and could do so again some members continue to be interested in the control of animal diseases that also threaten human health the regulation of bioengineered foods human antimicrobial resistance which some link partly to misuse of antibiotics in animal feed and the safety of fresh produce in the 109th congress for example s 729 and hr 1507
