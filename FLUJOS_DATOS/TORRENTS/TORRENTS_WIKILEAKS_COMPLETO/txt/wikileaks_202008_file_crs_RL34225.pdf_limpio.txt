crime groups flourish in burma trafficking contraband that includes drugs humans guns wildlife gems and timber transnational crime is highly profitable repor tedly generating roughly seve ral billion dollars each year the countrys extralegal economy both black market and illicit border trade is reportedly so large that an accurate assessment of the size and structure of the countrys economy is unavailable band trafficking also remains lowrisk enterprise as corruption among officials in burmas ruling military junta the state peace and development council spdc ppears to facilitate trafficking and effectively provide the criminal underg round immunity from law enforcement and judicial action1 synergistic links connect various forms of contraband trafficking smugglers use the same routes for many form s of trafficking following paths of least resistance where corruption and lax law enforcement prevail the continued presence of transnational crime in burma and the illicit trafficking routes across burmas borders share many features of socalled ungoverned spaces regions of the world where governments have difficulty establishing control or are complicit in the corruption of the rule of law2 among the commonalities that burmas border regions share with other ungoverned spaces is physical terrain that is difficult to cont rol burmas long borders through which much smuggled contraband pa sses stretch across vast trackless hills and mountains that are poorly patrolled in addition continuing ethnic tensions with some ethnic armed rebel groups hamper government c ontrol in some regions of the country which is another common feature of ungoverned spaces recent ceasefire agreements in other border regions ve not markedly improved the situation instead these ceasefires have provi ded groups known for their activity in transnational crime with near autonomy essentially placing these areas beyond the reach of burmese law congress has long been active in us policy

should the spdc begin to co mbat the drug trade more vigorously current ceasefire groups may choose to br eak their agreements with the spdc in order to protect their drug trade territori several

prohibit the importation of gems and hardwoods fro m burma among other restrictions64 after more than decade of applying sanctions against burma however many analysts have concluded that the sanctions

recent progress in reducing opium poppy cultivation most experts believe us policie s have not yielded substan tial leverage in combating transnational crime emanating from burma in light of the most recent displays of junta violence against politi cal demonstrators in september 2007 however there are indications of increasing political interest in reevaluating us policy toward burma among the considerations that policy makers have recently raised are 1 whether the united states s hould increase the amount of humanitarian aid sent to burma 2 what role asean and other multilateral vehicles for dialogue could play in increasing political pressure on the junta regime 3 what role the united states sees india as the worlds largest democracy and burmas neighbor playing in ensuring that burma
