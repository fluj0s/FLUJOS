of 1996 aedpa 28 usc 2254d federal courts are not to overturn state judgements on habeas corpus review merely because they would have decided the case differently they may overturn only stat decisions contrary to supreme court precedent or applied unreasonably4 generally within the broad zone in which reasonable judges may differ the state court decision stands as such the third circuit has upheld some d eath sentences and vacated others jury instructions in bronshtein v horn 5 judge alito writing for the threejudge panel vacated defendants death sentence but uphe ld the underlying conviction antuan bronshtein was convicted of robbing and killing alexander gutman jewelry store owner one of the principal issues wa s whether the state trial court had denied bronshtein due process of law by not telling the jury that sentence of life in prison would not have possibility of parole6 the court found that the prosecutions arguments and the testimony elicited at the penalty phase put the issue of the defendants future danger ousness at issue in simmons v south carolina 7 the us supreme court held that when defendants future danger ousness is at issue the jury must be accurately informed whether there is any possibility of parole under the alternative lifetime sentence because the trial court faile d to provide the jury with such an instruction the appella court affirmed the distri ct courts holding that the death sentence was unconstitutional8 in smith v horn 9 judge alito dissented from panel decision invalidating the capital murder conviction of clifford s mith smith and his friend roland alston robbed pennsylvania pharmacy in 1983 they subsequently shot one of the robbery victims richard sharp the state charged smith with firstdegree murder instead of showing that he was the shooter the prosecutor proceeded against smith on the theory that he and alston were accomplices making each liable for the acts of the other under pennsylvania law rega rdless of who pulled the triggerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33203crs3 10 for example the instructions said the following the commonwealth must prove all of the elements of the case beyond reasonable doubt but it does not have to prove beyond reasonable doubt which of the two smith or alston actually brought about the killing of richard sharp by showing who pulled the trigger nd placed the shot in his head if and i emphasize this you find that one was the accomplice of the other and that one of the two actually performed the killing you the jurors need not agree on the role or roles played by the respective parties that is by this defendant and his accomplice if you find that that was the position of both provided that each of you is satisfied that the crime was actually perpetrated by the defendant or by the accomplice of the defendant 11 ibid at 412 12 ibid at 411 13 ibid at 423 quoting trial courts inst ructionsemphasis added by judge alitothe accomplice liability theory did not require the state to prove that smith committed the killing however the state needed to prove that smith had the specific intent to kill the trial courts jury instructions failed to make this requirement clear suggesting instead that smith could be convicted of first degree murder as an accomplice even if he intended to aid ston only in the robbery and not in the killing10 the trial court used the term accompli ce without clarifying whether it meant accomplice in the robbery or accomplice in the murder or both by blurring this distinction the majority held that the instruction led the jury to believe that an accomplice for one purpose is an accomplice for all purposes contrary to state law11 the third circuit invalidated smiths fi rstdegree murder c onvicti on explaining that the instructions allowed smith to be convicted of murder even if the jury found that only alston intended the killing so long as smith was an accomplice to the robbery the court concluded that fair reading of jury instructions given in this case permitted the jury to convict smith of murder in the first degree without first finding beyond reasonable doubt that smith intended that sharp be killed12 the court concluded that the livery of these improper instructions amounted to violation of smiths right to fair trial pursuant to the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment judge alito dissented making two argu ments on the merits judge alito observed that the trial court before explaining the elements of the charged offenses instructed the jury that person is an accomplice if with the intent of promoting or facilitating the commission of crime he solicits commands courages or requests the other person or persons to commit that crime or crimes or aids agrees to aid or attempts to aid the other person in the planning or committing the crime 13 judge alito then declared that when trial judge in instructing jury provides definition of complicated legal term the judge is not generally required to repeathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33203crs4 14 ibid 15 ibid 16 see ibid at 42023 alito j dissentingrequesting briefing on whether smith failed to exhaust his state remedies and whether he procedurally defaulted his claim 17 ibid at 409 18 68 f3d 736 3d cir 1995 19 weighing and nonweighing states make the sentenceselection decision in different ways in weighing states the sentencer first determines that defendant is eligible for the death penalty by finding the existence of ce rtain statutory aggravating factors the sentencer then weighs the aggravating factors against any mitigating factors to decide whether the death penalty is appropriate in nonweighing states the sentencer may impose capital sentence only after finding one or more aggravating factors the sentencer then considers whether any mitigating circumstances warrant noncapital sentence an invalid aggravating factor invalidates any subsequent weighing in nonweighingstatutory scheme it does not in validate capital sentence as long as there is at least one valid aggravating factor stringer v black 503 us 222 23132 1992 20 462 us 862 1983holding that when sentencing jury relies on an unconstitutional statutory aggravating factor the reliance does not invalidate the death sentence because the underlying facts associated with the invalid factor remain admissible and available for the jury to consider 21 494 us 738 1990that definition every time the term is subsequently employed14 there would have been confusion he argued had the ju ry substituted the lengthy definition of accomplice each time the term appear ed in the jury instructions15 second judge alito argued that the c ourt should not have considered smiths claim at all because smiths lawyers did not object to the jury instructions at trial or in prior appeals16 this was viewed as an interesting argument inasmuch as the commonwealth never raised the issue at any time the majority rejected judge alitos argument explaining that where the state has never raised the issue at all in any court raising the issue sua sponte puts us in the untenable position of ferreting out possible defenses upon which the state has never sought to rely when we do so we come dangerously close to acting as advocates for the stat rather than impartial magistrates see united states v burke 504 us 229246 1992scalia j concurring in the judgment17 in flamer v delaware 18 judge alito again writing for the majority upheld defendants death sentence the third circ uit banc held that delawares death penalty statute prior to its 1991 ame ndment was nonweighing statute19 thus governed by the supreme court precedent in zant v stephens 20 as opposed to clemons v mississippi 21 the court held that the jury instructions and interrogatories used did not violate the eighth amendment in separate and unrelated trials william flamer and billie bailey were convicted of firstdegree murd er and sentenced to death the sentencing

factors informing its decision to recommend death was that the murders were outrageously or wantonly vile horrible or inhuman22 this factor listed in delaware statute among 18 other aggravating factors was s ubsequently invalidated by the delaware supreme court for being unconstitutionally vague23 the issue before the third circuit was whether the jurys reliance on the unconstitutional statutory aggravating factor rendered the death sentence invalid in each case to pass constitutional muster death penalty sentencing process must perform two functions first state must appl rational criteria to narrow the class of offenders eligible for the death penalty24 once defendant is determined to be deatheligible the sentenceselection process must allow for individualized consideration that accounts for all relevant mitigating evidence at issue for the third circuit was which of two legal frameworks governed the jurys consideration of aggravating f actors weighing or nonweighing in nonweighing sentencing scheme the jury is free to consider all aggravating and mitigating evidence in its totality although the jury must first find statutory aggravating factor as condition of death eligibility the statutory aggravators thereafter play role in guiding the jurys discretion in zant v stephens 25 the supreme court held that when sentencing jury relies on an unconstitutional statutory aggravating factor in this context the reliance does not invalidate the death sentence because the underlying facts asso ciated with the invalid factor remain admissible and available for the jury to consider under an alternative framework weighing the sentencing jury is specifically instructed to weigh statutory aggravatin g factors against all mitigating factors in deciding whether to impose death with th is approach statutory factors serve two functions first to narrow the class of d eatheligible offenders and second to focus the sentencing jurys discretion in making the ultimate decision in line of cases beginning with clemons v mississippi 26 the supreme court has held that the jurys reliance on an invalid statutory aggravator within weighing state cannot stand unless there is judicial reweighing of the evidence without consideration of the invalid circumstances or unless it is determined that the jurys consideration of those circumstances was harmless27httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33203crs6 28 277 f3d 261 3d cir 2001 29 476 us 79 1986 30 see batson at 98 n 21 hernandez v new york 500 us 352 36465 1991 31 hernandez v new york 500 us 352

during the penalty pha to consider all relevant evidence in aggravation the court concluded that the delaware scheme mirrored the capital sentencing scheme in zant and contrasted sharply with the sentencing scheme in clemons as such the court affirmed the lower courts decision to deny the petitions jury selection in riley v taylor 28 the principal issue involved application of the supreme courts decision in batson v kentucky29 regarding peremptory challenges to potential jurors during the jury selection process although lawyers historically have been able to challenge limited number of jurors fo r any reason they wish and without any explanation given the supreme court held in the batson case that jurors may not be challenged because of their race however the high court also held that the trial judges finding of fact on whether challenge is racially motivated or made for some other legitimate reason is entitled to great deference30 the court set out three step process for adjudicating claim that particular peremptory challenge was racially based once the opponent of peremptory challenge has made out prima facie case of racial discrimination step one the burden of production shifts to the proponent of the strike to come forward with raceneutral explanation step two if raceneutral explanation is tendered the trial court must then decide step three whether the opponent of th strike has proved purposeful racial discrimination31 majority of the third circuit banc sustained rileys claim effectively overruling the trial judges determination that the prosecutor had provided credible raceneutral reasons for the challenges in doing so the majority placed great reliance on statistics noting that there was little chance that the patterns of selection in the statistics were random32 in dissent judge alito contended the majoritys statistics were erroneous and misleading use of statistics33 he also noted the importance of deferring to the trial judge particularly where important evidence is of type not likely to show up in the record one issue for example was wh ether one of the jurors hesitated before answering question about the death penalty

strickland v washington 466 us 668 687 1984stating that judicial scrutiny of counsels performance must be highly deferentia l it is all too tempting for defendant to secondguess counsels assistance after conviction or adverse sentence and it is all too easy for court examining counsels defense after it has proved unsuccessful to conclude that particular act or omissi on of counsel was

murder case is determined by weighing the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating circumstances rompillas case gave the defense lawyers little to work with in the way of mitigation rompillas lawyers interviewed him and most of his immediate family to determine if any abuse excuse evidence existed the lawyers were told that nothing remarkable along those lines existed in rompillas childhood the lawyers directed their limited resources elsewhere they had rompilla evaluated by three different mental health professionals whom they believed to be the be st available and apparently made the best case they coul d the jury decided on the death penalty during the multiple reviews of the case later attorneys found leads to mitigation evidence in the records of rompillas prio r crimes the pennsylvania supreme court reviewed the performance of trial counsel and found that they d rendered effective assistance when the case reached the third circuit the governing law appeared to require double dose of deference the governing supreme court pr ecedent written by justice oconnor required reviewing courts to give trial coun sel broad latitude in plotting their strategy and to resist the temptation to engage in excessively critical hindsight when evaluating strategy that turned out to be unsuccessful36 applying these standards to the facts of the case judge alito writing for the majority wrote that the state supreme court had applied th correct standard and had done so in reasonable way the majority concluded that the state courts finding that the attorneys had made reasonable choices in allocating their limited investigative resources was not clearly wrong he suggested that although good or prudent lawyer might have examined school medical and court records rompillas lawyers had done all that was constitutionally compelled by interviewing him some of his family members and three mental health professionals37 judge alito distinguished the case at bar from

wiggins social histor the court concluded that it was quite reasonable to assume that the jury would have reached different sentence had they been apprised of such evidence39 the majority concluded that critical di fferences existed between the conduct of wigginss and rompillas trial attorneys first wigginss attorneys were presented with leads that any reasonably competent attorney would have realized were promising rompillas attorneys had co mparable leads second the defendants described their childhoods differently wiggins described his as disgusting whereas rompilla insisted that his

reversed in 54 decision with justice oconnor casting the swing vote th court held that even when capital defendants family members and the defendant himself have suggested that mitigating evidence is available the defendants counsel is still bound to make reasonable efforts to obtain and review ma terial that counsel knows the prosecution will probably rely on as evidence of aggravation at the
