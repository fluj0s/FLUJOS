scattere d throughout the scene the pushing of the sidewalls and concaving of the f loors indicate of multiplying blast pressure effect due to confinemen t of the rooms and of the building the explosive effects are very common to the effects of chlorate based explosive mixture of potassium chlorate mixed with sulfur and alluminum powder also known as the dirty white pow der other traces of

type of explosive mixtures were introduced by the so called jemaah islamiah t he asian terror group responsible in most cases of bombings in the south and in manila the ji is also responsible for bomb making and explosive demolitio n trainings to the local terrorist groups which is being held every quarter of the yea r like by the ji asg rsm khalid trinidad group milfmnlf lost command and milf so g official use only official use only technical intelligence bulletin 5 2005 date produced 05012006 14 of 15 possible motives of the bombings diversionary tactics of the jiasg due to the on going military operations against khadafy janjalani in central par t of mindanao b test mission of their new graduates on bomb making for 3rd quarter of the year c field test of their explosive mixtures d possible part of their main event planned bombing d uring the 4th quarter of the year 2005 comparative analysis of the post blast reconstruc tion of evidence recovered at the said twin bombings showed strong similarities t the signatures of the ieds use in the past bombing incidents the attempted bombing f koronadal public city market last july 10 2005 and the zamboanga bombing are re lated to each other and may be prelude to their main event to conduct bombing bet ween octoberdecember 2005 the possible layout of the circuitry and schematic diagram of the device use based on the evidence

blasting cap main charge9 volts battery official use only official use only technical intelligence bulletin 5 2005 date produced 05012006 15 of 15 conclusion detailed study regarding the chain of events with r espect to the past and recent bombing incidents tells that for every quart er of the year incidents of either bombings or attempted bombing will most likely to ccur this also coincides with the actual test run of the new graduates on bombmaking the said training was taught by the ji in three 3 separate locations near the main ca mp of the milf in maguindanao very alarming situation was also noted because the devices now being used by the different terrorist groups belong to the signature of dr azahari and dulmatin who are known ji leaders responsible for the bali nd marriot bombings now they are using cell phone activated device an itc board r 555 timer with scr or combination of either of the two 2 which are furt her integrated with pc board that serves as the switch enhancer to make the device fu nction these devices are also known to qaeda who is also responsible for the actual training of our muslim brothers during the afghan war such training is usually re echoed to the asg and the rajah solaiman movement rsm headed by ahmed santos in addition similar incident is perceived to ccur in the near future considering the discovery of six 6 empty boxes of alarm clock believed to be the same clock used on the twin bombings
