6204c19 shspec134 gross auditing errors if few sessions go by with ta action one should assume that something very gross is going on the oddity of scientology is that the textbook solution works unlike any other field or previous practice in practically every other subject the guy on the job is meeting up with situations that arent covered in the textbook rut in scientology it is when you depart from the textbook solution that you get in trouble this flies in the teeth of all ones past experience so you tend to approach the solution with little variation and deviation every pc is individual and all his originations are different from every other individuals but what the auditor does is always the same if the auditor departs from the textbook solutions he is asking for trouble auditing takes imagination to speak of unusual solutions just good ability to communicate the best of auditors goof at times the commonest mistake is not realizing that when the pc has said it it is blown and taking up all the pcs answers or origins for further discussion such auditors underestimate the power of 2wc the auditor should assume especially in ruds that it has blown until he tests it on the meter and finds differently he should acknowledge well what the pc says because that is part of the blow mechanism if the auditor goes on to take it up it keys the pc in again when you acknowledge it look pleased and relieved that it is all handled if it still reads give it only as much time and attention as is needed to slip it out of the way using same brushoff process if you are unlucky enough not to have the process work you must have been doing something else by giving flawless session the auditor can hold the ruds in anyone can make goofs but they shouldnt be frequent since we want the pc to be confident confidence is result of auditor consistency ruds on the environment will stay in if the auditor is consistent about the auditing environment the pcs confidence drops when you q and or act inconsistently the result is difficulty of keeping ruds in ie lack of consistency leads to lack of confidence leads to ruds going nut pc notices the care that is taken with him this aids in building his confidence he gets unconfident if each session is full of surprises and the auditor keeps changing things around if you keep having to use middle ruds it is probably something you did during the session even very nervous pc can gradually come to realize that the auditor wont permit anything to happen to him during the session he will permit the auditor to be responsible for the environment checking on those pcs who were getting ta disclosed the fact that while ta doesnt necessarily take place just because ruds are in if rudiments are out ta will not take place this means that ta is proportional to the degree ruds are in not to the state of the case that is monitored by what is being run on the case to be sure so the truth of it depends on the fact that the right process is being run
