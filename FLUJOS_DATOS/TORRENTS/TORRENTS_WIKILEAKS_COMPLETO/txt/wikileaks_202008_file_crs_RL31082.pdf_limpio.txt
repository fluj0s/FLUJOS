issues and options summary although child welfare services are primarily state responsibility the federal government helps pay for these activities providing states about 7 billion in fy2001 for child welfare services foster care and adoption assistanc although there is widespread frustration with the way these funds are provided from the federal government to the states there is currently consensus on method of reform most federal funds that are specifically targeted toward child welfare activities are authorized by title ivb or ive of the social security act or the freestanding child abuse prevention and treatment act capta these statutes authorize variety of funding streams some are discretionary others are entitlements some of the entitlements are openended in other words there is limit on federal spending others are capped all require states to comply with various programmatic and procedural rules in addition states serve child welfare clients through other nontargeted federal programs such as temporary assistance for needy families medicaid and the social services block grant most proposals to reform federal child welfare financing focus on the two largest funding streams which are for foster care and adoption assistance authorized under title ive controlling for inflation the federal share of state spending for these two activities has increased dramatically from 11 billion in fy1987 to 53 billion in fy2000 in 2000 dollars foster care is the larger of the two activities but adoption assistance is growing at faster pace both in terms of dollars spent and children served in fact the congressional budget office cbo projects that the number of children claimed by states as eligible for adoption assistance will surpass the number claimed as eligible for foster care beginning in fy2003 as federal spending for these activities has grown the financing structure has increasingly been seen by lawmakers administrators and caseworkers as often conflicting with the needs of children and families the system is criticized as complex burdensome and inflexible critics assert that the federal eligibility criteria for foster care and adoption assistance linked to the former aid to families with dependent children are outofdate and inappropria and the system does not recognize the growing role of relatives in caring for foster children on the other hand supporters of the system believe its openended entitlements provide safety net for states and children and that the complicated federal rules ensure minimum level of protection for children congress also has allowed states to conduct demonstrations through waivers which will help inform lawmakers in the future congress has tentatively discussed reform proposals for decade ranging from expansions of existing entitlements to consolidation into block grants elimination of the afdc requirement has been proposed repeatedly and interest also has developed recently in performancebased funding because the current system is complex all reform proposals raise complex issues also because the largest parts of the system are openended entitlements virtually all proposals have budgetary implications moreover federal enforcement of child welfare laws administratively and through the courts is related issue of ongoing interest to congress httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082contents

primarily state functions the federal government helps pay for these activities providing an estimated 7 billion in fy2001 for child welfare services foster care and adoptio n assistance increasingly in recent years the way in which these funds are provided to states has been seen as inflexible burdensome and counterproductive to the interests of children and families however while there is widespread frustration with the current system consensus yet exists on method of reform todays system of funding child welfare activities is complex the current system is actually patchwork of federal laws requirements and programs states receive federal funds through various funding streams that were established at different times generally in response to different concerns historically child welfare services evolved gradually in most states and much of the impetus for these services came from private nongovernmental organizations while federal funding for some child welfare services was available as early as 1935 federal funds for foster care only became available in the early 1960s and most of the growth in the federal role has occurred in the past 20 years each component of the federal financing system had its own purpose at the time it was enacted but comprehensive or cohesive policy rationale ties the entire system together nonetheless states have become dependent on this complicated assortment of federal funds as they attempt to design and operate programs that respond to the needs of children and families some federal child welfare funds are discretionary which means that the amount of money available to states is determined through the annual appropriations process others are entitlements which means that states are entitled by law to receive these funds some of the entitlement funds are capped so that states are entitled to share of fixed amount other entitlement funds are openended so that states are entitled to federal reimbursement for any legally eligible expenditure with limit on total federal spending several funding streams use formulas for allocating funds among states but the formulas differ most funding streams require nonfederal matching amount from the states but the match requirements differ and finally virtually all federal child welfare funds come with programmatic and procedural strings attached so that states must comply with numerous federal rules to be eligible to receive federal funds congress has tentatively discussed proposals to reform federal financing of child welfare for at least decade and the debate is continuing ideas have ranged from expansion of the existing openended entitlements to total consolidation of all funding streams into single block grant the notion of connecting funding with state performance as measured by various indicators also has been considered while nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs2 1 in addition to these grants readers should note that several other federal programs provide funding for child welfare services although they are not specifically designed as child welfare programs these include the social services block grant ssbg to states medicaid and the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant to states the precise amount of funds devoted to child welfare activities under these programs is not known but research conducted by the urban institute produced an estimate of 2 billion in fy1998 bess roseanna et the cost of protecting vulnerable children ii what has changed since 1996 urban institute op46 washington dc february 2001 2 this report focuses on programs that provide grants to states for ongoing activities additional amounts are provided under capta and title ivb of the social security act for research and demonstration grants which are awarded to public and private entities at the discretion of the secretary of hhs the adoption opportunities and abandoned infants assistance acts also authorize grants to public and private entities at the discretion of hhs and the department of justice administers several small programs to improve the investigation continuedcomprehensive reform proposal has been enacted congress has amended the federal child welfare laws in recent years to achieve other goals in some cases further complicating the overall financing structure this report is divided into several sections first it describes the existing federal funding streams for child welfare activities and second it presents data on trends in federal spending under the two largest funding streams ie foster care and adoption assistance the third section of the report discusses prevailing views of the system focusing on its perceived weaknesses and strengths next the report describes reform proposals that have been offered in recent years and identifies various policy issues raised by these proposals some concluding notes are offered at the end components of the current system the primary federal statutes that authorize grants to states for child welfare activities are titles ivb and ive of the social security act and the freestanding child abuse prevention and treatment act capta1 most of the focus of financing reform proposals is on foster care and adoption assistance under title ive which are openende d entitlements to states and represent the largest categories of federal expenditures nonetheless discussion of reform proposals requires an understanding of the full array of federal child welfare programs before states may receive funding for child welfare activities under the social security act or capta they must develop and submit state plans to the federal department of health and human services hhs that meet detailed series of requirements these requirements are outlined in the various statutes and collectively form the basis of federal child welfare policy although the state role is paramount in child welfare the federal government significantly influences state behavior by conditioning the receipt of federal funds on compliance with these requirements specific grants authorized under titles ivb ive and capta are briefly described below2 this information also is summarized in table a1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs3 2 continued and prosecution of child abuse and neglect under the victims of child abuse act 3 the law defines the following as eligible child welfare services public social services which are directed toward the accomplishment of the following purposes protecting and promoting the welfare of all children including handicapped homeless dependent or neglected children b preventing or remedying or assisting in the solution of problems which may result in the neglect abuse exploitation or delinquency of children c preventing the unnecessary separation of children from their families by identifying family problems assisting families in resolving their problems and preventing breakup of the family where the prevention of child removal is desirable and possible d restoring to their families children who have been removed by the provision of services to the child and the families placing children in suitable adoptive homes in cases where restoration to the biological family is not possible or appropriate and f assuring adequate care of children away from their homes in cases where the child cannot be returned home or cannot be placed for adoption 4 see crs report rl30894 child welfare reauthorization of the promoting safe and stable families program by karen spartitle ivb of the social security act child welfare services matching grants to states for child welfare services defined broadly3 are authorized under subpart 1 of title ivb the law permanently authorizes 325 million annually however the amount actually provided is left to the discretion of the annual appropriations process formula determines the share of appropriated funds that is allocated among each of the states and dc this formula is based on the states population under age 21 and per capita income as compared to all other states the federal share of state child welfare expenditures is set at 75 and 25 nonfederal match is required states have broad discretion in the use of these funds and federal eligibility criteria apply to the children or families served to receive funds states must develop plan jointly with hhs that satisfies various requirements many of which are intended to assure safety and permanency for children who enter the states foster care system fy2001 appropriation 292 million promoting safe and stable families4 subpart 2 of title ivb authorizes capped matching entitlement grants to states through fy2001 for four specific activities 1 communitybased family support services to support and strengthen vulnerable families before abuse or neglect occurs 2 intensive family preservation activities for families in crisis intended to avoid the need to place children in foster care 3 timelimited family reunification services intended to reunite foster children with their families and 4 adoption promotion and support services to encourage adoptions and support families after adoptions are made eligibility criteria for children or families are specified in federal law the law entitles states to their portion determine d by formula of an amount specified in the authorizing statute although this amount must be appropriated each year the allocation formula is based on each states share of children receiving food stamps and 25 nonfederal match is required as with the child welfare services program under subpart 1 states must develop plan jointly with hhs to receive funds under this authority fy2001 appropriation 305 million of annual appropriations for this program 10

entitlement funds appropriated for promoting safe and stable families see above 10 million is reserved each year for grants to the highest court in each state for court improvement activities ie an assessment of the state courts weaknesses in handling child welfare cases and efforts to address those weaknesses the statutory language governing the use of these funds is found in section 13712 of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 and requires that state courts submit an application to hhs to participate in the program funds are allocated according to state population under 21 and 25 nonfederal match is required fy2001 appropriation 10 million reserved from the appropriation for promoting safe and stable families title ive of the social security act foster care under title ive states are entitled to federal reimbursement for eligible expenditures that they incur on behalf of certain children in foster care eligible expenditures may be for maintenance payments to foster care providers on behalf of the children and for related administrative and child placement costs5 training and data collection costs those for whom federal reimbursement is available are children who would have been eligible for aid to families with dependent children afdc as afdc existed on july 16 1996 if they had been living in their biological home who were removed from their homes pursuant to judicial findings that continuation in the home would be contrary to their welfare and that reasonable efforts had been made to avoid their placement into foster care6 whose care and placement is the responsibility of the state child welfare agency and who are in licensed foster care settings federal reimbursement for eligible expenditures is made on an openended basis ie there is ceiling or cap on federal spending for foster care the federal share of eligible state expenditures is as followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs5 7 informally referred to as the medicaid matching rate the federal medical assistance percentage fmap is inversely related to state per capita income but may be less than 50 or more than 83 8 such efforts may not be required if the child is being adopted by foster parents with whom the child has established significant bond 9 special needs children are those who the state has determined cannot be placed for adoption without subsidy or medical assistance because of condition or factor such as the childs age racial or ethnic background membership in sibling group medical condition or physical mental or emotional disability within these federal parameters the states establish specific definitions 10 administrative costs also may include the cost of helping adoptive parents with the non recurring onetime costs of adoption up to maximum of 2000 these costs are eligible for 50 federal matching regardless of the income or welfare eligibility status of the child however the child must have special needs as defined by the statefor maintenance payments the medicaid matching rate7 is used to determine the federal share for specified training costs the federal share is 75 and for all other administrative costs including expenditures related to data collection the federal share is 50 title ive is permanently authorized to receive funds states must have plan approved by the secretary of hhs indicating that their programs comply with series of detailed requirements fy2001 estimated federal spending 5 billion adoption assistance states also are entitled to federal reimbursement under title ive for eligible expenditures related to adoption assistance for certain children with special needs paralleling the foster care component of title ive eligible expenditures may be for assistance payments to adoptive parents and for related administrative training and data collection costs those for whom federal reimbursement is available are adopted children who would have been eligible for afdc as it existed on july 16 1996 if they had been living with their biological families or who are eligible for supplemental security income ssi for whom reasonable efforts were made to place for adoption without adoption assistance or medical assistance8 and with special needs as defined by the state9 the financing structure is the same as for title ive foster care ie federal reimbursement is made on an openended entitlement basis and the federal matching rates are equal to the medicaid match for adoption assistance payments 75 for certain training expenditures and 50 for all other administrative costs10 fy2001 estimated federal spending 12 billion httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs6 11 see crs report rl30759 child welfare implementatio n of the adoption and safe families act by karen spar 12

spending although states receive federal funding for child welfare services from variety of funding streams as outlined above the bulk of federal child welfare funding is provided for foster care and adoption assistance under title ive of the social security act proposals to reform child welfare financing have focused on these two openended entitlements this section illustrates trends in federal spending and in the population of children claimed as eligible for foster care and adoption assistance under title ive from fy1987fy2000 based on data provided by hhs14 this section also highlights projected trends in foster care and adoption assistance under title iv as estimated by the congressional budget office cbo in general this section illustrates four main points nationall the federal share of total state expenditure claims for foster care and adoption assistance under title ive has increased dramatically over the past 14 years as has the average monthly number of children who states claim as eligible under both programs however it is important to remember that there is substantial variation by state while spending overall has increased national trends indicate that the states are spending an increasing percentage of foster care funds for administrative costs and training while smaller percentage of the funds are devoted to foster care maintenance payments the distribution of spending for adoption assistance under title ive has remained relatively constant with approximately threequarters of this funding devoted to adoption assistance payments over the past 14 years the larger states such as california and new york continue to play major role in explaining national trends in child welfare howeverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs8 15 this report uses gross domestic product gdp deflator calculated using data provided by the us department of commerce bureau of economic analysis to control for inflationthese states share of total federal funding for foster care and adoption assistance as well as their share of the total eligible population has decreased over time while both foster care and adoption assistance have experienced an increase in spending and in the number of eligible children adoption assistance under title ive is growing more rapidly and more consistently in fact cbo is projecting that nationally the number of children claimed as eligible for adoption assistance will surpass the number claimed as eligible for foster care beginning in fy2003 federal spending for foster care and adoption assistance figure 1 illustrates the federal share of total state claims for foster care and adoption assistance under title ive from fy1987fy2000 controlling for inflation for foster care expenditures include the federal

information systems sacwis adoption assistance expenditures include the federal share of total state claims for adoption assistance payments administrative costs and training controlling for inflation figure 1 illustrates that the federal share of total state claims under title ive foster care and adoption assistance combined has increased over the past 14 years from approximately 11 billion in fy1987 to 53 billion in fy2000 an increase of 38115 federal funding for foster care under title ive increased from 999 million in fy1987 to 4255 million in fy2000 for adoption assistance federal funding has increased more dramatically from 96 million in fy1987 to 1012 million in fy2000 an increase of 949 although both foster care and adoption assistance have seen an increase in federal and state expenditures the two categories have experienced different rates of growth over the years as figure 1 illustrates federal funding for foster care grew rapidly from fy1987fy1993 but since fy1993 the rate of growth in federal foster care expenditures has slowed down with expenditures decreasing in fy1996 and fy1998 compared to the prior year controlling for inflation at the same time federal expenditures for adoption assistance have increased more rapidly and more consistently over the past 14 years while the federal share of expenditures for foster care grew 159 from fy1987 fy1993 the federal share of expenditures for adoption assistance grew 221 and while federal foster care expenditures grew 65 from fy1993fy2000 federal expenditures for adoption assistance increased 227 over this period of timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs9 16 these numbers represent children who are claimed by states as meeting the title ive eligibility criteria therefore expenses associated with these children may be reimbursed by the federal government the total number of children in foster care regardless of title ive eligibility was 300000 in 1987 and 581000 in 1999 data for 2000 are not yet

remaining states that is excluding these six states illustrates different pattern among the remaining states foster care maintenance payments comprised lower percentage of the overall spending in fy1987 54 but an amount comparable to all the states 46 in fy2000 however administration was larger percentage of overall foster care spending in fy1987 in the remaining states 45 and therefore has only slightly increased over the past 14 years 46 in fy2000 at the same time training as percentage of overall spending for foster care quadrupled among the remaining states growing from 2 in fy1987 to 8 in fy2000 for adoption assistance under title ive training as percentage of overall spending among the remaining states increased from 1 in fy1987 to 5 in fy2000 and unlike the trends observed for all the states and for the six selected states adoption assistance payments in the remaining states increased from 71 in fy1987 to 73 in fy2000 while administrative costs as percentage of overall spending for adoption assistance decreased from 28 in fy1987 to 23 in fy2000 the six selected states continue to play role in explaining trends in child welfare spending however their participation in foster care as well as adoption assistance has changed over the past 14 years cumulatively these six states accounted for 58 of the title ive foster care population in fy1987 compared to 55 in fy2000 these six states also accounted for 68 of the federal share of total state claims for title ive foster care in fy1987 compared to 58 in fy2000 similar trends were observed for adoption assistance these states share of the total population eligible for adoption assistance fell from 60 in fy1987 to 54 in fy2000 while their share of the total federal funding for title ive adoption assistance also fell from 64 in fy1987 to 56 in fy2000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs16 as the role of these six selected states in influencing national trends in federal child welfare spending has decreased over time the role of other states has increased it is important to note that foster care and adoption assistance under title ive are openended entitlements and there is limit on total federal spending each state determines its own payment rates for both foster care and adoption assistance as well as its own priorities for expenditures on administration and training given the variation among states in payment rates as well as other expenditures the states with the largest share of the foster care population will not necessarily be the largest spenders or have the largest share of federal funds for example pennsylvania was one of the six largest states in terms of its share of the total population of children eligible for federal reimbursement under title ive in fy1987 however five states with smaller share of the total foster care population texas minnesota wisconsin maryland and new jersey had larger share of total federal funding for foster care under title ive in fy1987 projections for future child welfare spending as just shown child welfare spending levels have changed dramatically over the past 14 years figure 7 illustrates the trends in the federal share of total state claims for foster care and adoption assistance under title ive for fy1987fy2000 but also includes the projections for federal spending for these two activities for the next 10 years as estimated by the congressional budget office cbo figure 8 illustrates the trends in the average monthly number of children eligible for federally funded foster care and adoption assistance as well as the projections assumed by cbo for the next 10 years these figures illustrate two important points first cbo is projecting that the federal share of expenditures for foster care and adoption assistance are going to continue to grow controlling for inflation over the next 10 years and the programs will continue to grow at different rates with federal expenditures for adoption assistance growing at much faster rate than federal expenditures for foster care under title ive second although historically the average monthly number of children claimed as eligible under title ive for foster care has been larger than the number claimed as eligible for adoption assistance beginning in fy2003 cbo estimates that the population eligible for adoption assistance will surpass the foster care population under title ive and will continue to grow at much faster rate although not illustrated here cbo is also projecting that trends in the distribution of spending under foster care will continue to mirror current trends that is cbo expects that the largest share of federal expenditures for title ive foster care will be for administration 49 in fy2001 and 51 in fy2011 the share of overall spending for maintenance payments will continue to fall 46 in fy2001 and 43 in fy2011 and the share of funds devoted to training will remain small 5 in each of fy2001 and fy2011 cbo also expects that the distribution of spending under adoption assistance will continue in much the same pattern as currently illustrated in figure 4 adoption assistance payments will continue to comprise the majority of these expenditures 72 in fy2001 and 76 in fy2011 administration will decrease slightly as share of overall spending 23 in fy2001 and 20 in fy2011 and training will continue to comprise small share of

capta title ivb of the social security act and the foster care independence program with annual progress and status reports this consolidated child and family services plan is separate from the title iv state planprevailing views of the current system perceived weaknesses as federal spending for child welfare activities has grown the financing structure has increasingly been seen as interfering with the ability of states to meet the needs of children and families the system is often criticized as complex burdensome for administrators and social workers and inflexible most discussions of child welfare financing focus primarily on foster care and adoption assistance under title ive because they are the largest sources of funding and as the previous section showed have seen dramatic growth one feature of the current system the afdc eligibility requirement for foster care and adoption assistance is particular source of frustration for many policy makers and administrators who view it as outdated and inappropriate the current system also has specific provisions to address an increasingly important form of foster care care by relative caretakers or kinship foster care complexity the sheer complexity of the current system is frequently raised concern although virtually all funds under titles ivb ive and capta go to the state child welfare agency they are provided through different grants with different financing structures allocation provisions and matching rates foster care and adoption assistance under title ive are further subdivided into three components each maintenance or assistance payments training and administration which also have different matching rates in addition states must submit multiple plans and applications to receive all of the authorized grants although the requirements contained in these plans and applications are intended to work together to constitute comprehensive federal child welfare policy20 the financing structure of foster care and adoption assistance is generally considered the most burdensome by the states because these programs operate as openended entitlements states must document and hhs must determine the eligibility of every expenditure for reimbursement by the federal government to be eligible for federal reimbursement foster care maintenance payments must be made on behalf of eligible children in addition to the afdc eligibility requirement which is discussed in more detail below states must document that certain judicial findings were made with regard to the childs placement in foster care that the state is responsible for the childs placement and care and that the child has been placed in licensed home or facility likewise adoption assistance payments must be made on behalf of eligible children to be reimbursable by the federal government but the eligibility criteria governing children receiving adoption assistance differ from those governing foster children again children must be eligible for afdc as it existed inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs19 21 in january 2001 hhs issued policy announcement pa0101 which states that children who are voluntarily placed with or relinquished to private nonprofit agency but are not eligible for title ive foster care maintenance payments are not eligible for title ive subsidized adoption assistance this is change from previous policy 22 state expenditures for hhsapproved sacwis systems state automated child welfare information systems are not subject to costallocation rules 23 children may also qualify for federally subsidized adoption assistance if they are eligible for supplemental security income ssitheir state on july 16 1996 or be eligible for ssi but also must have special needs as determined by their state21 expenditures for training and administration under title ive must be cost allocated which generally means that only that ratio of expenditur equal to the states ratio of title iveeligible foster children ie eligible children as proportion of the states entire foster care caseload may be reimbursed by the federal governmen t22 costallocation is further complicated by an hhs departmental appeals board dab ruling in 1987 which found that states may be reimbursed for certain administrative expenditures on behalf of title ive candidates during the time before it is determined whether such children are actually eligible under the provisions of title ive the afdc connection as described earlier the afdc requirement in title ive limits eligibility for federal foster care and adoption subsidies to those children who would have been eligible for afdc as that program existed in their state on july 16 1996 if they had been living in their biological home23 the origin of this requirement can be traced back to the early 1960s when federal foster care subsidies first were authorized as component of the afdc program however the policy rationale for the afdc connection has become increasingly murky over the years and especial ly since 1996 when afdc was repealed and replaced by the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant hhs estimates that about 55 of all foster children are currently claimed by states as eligible under title ive little is known about the differences between foster children who are title iveeligible and those who are not however it is generally believed that they are removed from home and placed in foster care for the same basic reasons ie they have been abused or neglected in their biological home or otherwise need protection through placement in outofhome care under state responsibility and with judicial oversight thus it can be argued that the income and welfare eligibility status of their biological parents has nothing to do with their need for foster care and that afdc or any other meanstested eligibility criteria is not relevant for children receiving adoption assistance it can be argued that the afdc eligibility criterion is even less appropriate since it ties childs eligibility for federal subsidies to the income and welfare status of biological parents whose parental rights to that child have been terminated furthermore caseworkers often find it difficult or awkward to obtain information about income and assets from parents whose children have just been removed from their homes and in the case of abandoned children this information often cannot be obtained at allhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs20 24 the welfare reform law originally established june 1 1995 as the lookback date for afdc eligibility criteria for use in determining title ive eligibility this was subsequently changed to july 16 1996 to be consistent with the lookback date for medicaid however under medicaid these criteria may be adjusted for various reasons including changes in the consumer price index cpi and states may adjust the methodologies they use in counting income and assets which has enabled them to liberalize treatment of the july 16 1996 eligibility criteria these adjustments are not authorized for either foster care or adoption assistance 25 many states have changed their eligibility rules for welfare since enactment of tanf for example many states have raised resource eligibility limits from those that existed under afdc federal law limited afdc to families with countable resources below 1000 the value of one vehicle with an equity value of up to 1500 was excluded from afdc countable resources under tanf many states have raised the resource eligibility limits above 1000 and exclude more of the value of vehicles sometimes excluding the entire value of vehicle for tanf resource eligibility limits in effect as of july 1 2000 see rl30579 welfare reform financial eligibility rules and cash assistance amounts under tanf by craig abbey december 2000 p 1620 26 us congress house ways and means committee 2000 green book october 6 2000 p 664regardless of whether any meanstested eligibility criteria are appropriate for foster care or adoption assistance the specific use of afdc has been increasingly questioned in recent years as stated above afdc was repealed in 1996 and replaced by the tanf block grant however for purposes of title ive foster care and adoption assistance and also for medicaid the eligibility criteria used by states under afdc on july 16 1996 were frozen and retained24 when afdc existed social workers could determine relatively easily whether family was receiving benefits under that program this process is more difficult under current law since family now receiving welfare under criteria established for tanf might not necessarily have been eligible for afdc under the july 1996 criteria moreover there is adjustment permitted in the 1996 criteria thus there is concern that fewer children might be eligible for reimbursement under title ive over time as the value of the july 16 1996 eligibility criteria erodes25 because of the eligibility requirements that govern title ive expenditures administrators and caseworkers frequently report that the eligibility determination process is costly both in staff time and additional administrative expenditures however according to hhs only about 4 of reimbursement claims for administrative costs related to foster care in fy1999 were due to the eligibility determination process26 inflexibility one of the major criticisms of federal child welfare policy is its inflexibility regarding the use of funds by states specifically critics note that most federal funds are available to states only after children have been removed from their homes and comparatively small and limited amount of resources are available to help prevent and treat the conditions that cause children to be removed from home in the first place it has been argued that this financing structure actually encourages and rewards states for removing children from their homes and for placing and keeping them in foster care it is further argued that states have incentive to shorten thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs21 27 on the other hand state officials maintain that social workers and judges who oversee the cases of foster children do not consider the availabili ty of federal funds in determining the appropriate action on behalf of an individual child moreover state plan requirements and other provisions of federal law including the adoption incentive payments authorized in 1997 are intended to protect children from being placed or retained in foster care unnecessarily 28 on average states were planning to spend less than 20 for the two newest activities in fy1999 based on reports submitted to hhs primarily because they were phasing these new services in while trying to minimize disruption in ongoing family preservation and family support programs source analysis of states 1998 annual progress and services reports the family preservation and family support implementation study james bell associates arlington va march 23 2001length of time that children remain in foster care because they lose federal matching funds on behalf of those children when their case is closed and because they have only limited federal resources to use for activities to support preserve or reunite families or to develop and support adoptive placements27 the most flexible funds provided under current law are available through subpart 1 of title ivb child welfare services and adoption incentive payments although subpart 1 limits the amount of funds that may be used for workrelated child care foster care or adoption assistance it imposes eligibility or other requirements on the children or families that may be served nor does it mandate that any particular type of service be provided subpart 1 also contains very broad definition of child welfare services see footnote 3 likewise funds provided to states as adoption incentive payments under section 473a may be used for any child welfarerelated activity however as noted earlier funding for these programs is relatively small ie 292 million for child welfare services and 43 million for adoptio n incentives in fy2001 grants to states under subpart 2 of title ivb promoting safe and stable families also are not restricted by federal law as to income or any other characteristic of families that may be served however the law specifies and defines four types of child welfare services that must be supported with these funds ie communitybased family support family preservation timelimited family reunification and adoption promotion and support the law requires that more than 10 of each states allotment may be used for administrative purposes and that significant portions of the remainder must be used for each of the four specified child welfare activities hhs has instructed states that in general minimum of 20 of their allotments must be used for each of the four activities in fy2001 this program received 305 million from which funds are reserved for court improvement grants research technical assistance and grants to indian tribes thus states are technically required to spend minimum of 57 million for each of the four authorized activities 20 of the 286 million remaining after setasides28 although states have flexibility in the use of their capta grants these funds are generally intended to support the frontend of the child welfare system known as the child protective services cps system this is the child welfare component that focuses on prevention identification and investigation of child maltreatment reports thus some of the activities authorized under title i of capta include intakehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs22 29 however the 1999 amendments limit spending for room and board for 1820yearolds to maximum of 30 of state allotments assessment screening and investigation of abuse and neglect reports development of multidisciplinary teams to enhance investigations case management development of risk assessment tools training for individuals mandated to report child abuse or neglect and development of communitybased programs intended to prevent child abuse as amended in 1999 the revised independent living program has been characterized by some observers as block grant because it provides funds that are intended to achieve certain outcomes ie to improve the employment and education prospects and transition to independent living for older foster children but the law does not mandate or specify how these outcomes are to be achieved thus funds may be used flexibly within the overall goals and for the target population specified in law29 the target population is not defined by income but rather by age under 21 and likelihood of remaining in foster care until age 18 again this program is relatively small with fy2001 funding of 140 million grants to states for foster care and adoption assistance under title ive are the least flexible funds available from the federal government for child welfare activities as already described these funds are available only for certain categories of expenditures on behalf of certain categories of foster or adopted children subject to means test however they are the largest federal child welfare funding streams in terms of expenditures an estimated 62 billion in fy2001 and the only ones that operate with cap on federal spending most reform proposals focus on these two funding streams and in particular foster care relative caretakers according to hhs relatives were functioning as foster parents for 26 of foster children in 1999 however with some exceptions federal child welfare law does not recognize distinction between relative caretakers and other types of foster care providers under title ive two types of subsidies may be supported with federal funds 1 foster care maintenance payments for children who are placed in licensed foster homes or institutions and 2 adoption assistance payments for children with special needs neither subsidy is explicitly intended for relative caretakers although relative caretakers can and do receive both types if all necessary conditions are met in general relatives caring for children fall into one of several categories many children live with grandparents or other relatives through informal arrangements that do not involve the child welfare agency or the court in such cases the relatives may receive public assistance at all on behalf of the child or may potentially receive tanf benefit if the child is poor if the relatives themselves are lowincome they may be eligible to receive tanf benefit to cover their own needs although tanf work and time limit requirements may apply in such cases while all of these family arrangements are generically referred to as kinship care they would not necessarily be considered kinship foster carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs23 30 440 us 125 1979 31 the other two exceptions are when the state agency has documented in the childs case plan compelling reason to determine that termination of parental rights would not be in the childs best interests or if the state has not provided necessary services to the family 32 federal register january 25 2000 p 40204093some children live with grandparents or other relatives because they were placed there by the child welfare agency or the court the state may pay nothing to these relatives or they may pay tanf benefit or foster care subsidy depending on the circumstances foster care subsidies are almost always higher than tanf benefits however for the state to claim federal reimbursement under foster care for any expenses associated with the child the state has to have legal responsibility for the child and the caretaker must comply with state licensing requirements in that case under the 1979 supreme court miller v youakim30 decision the state must pay the same foster care subsidy to the relative caretaker as would be paid to nonrelative foster care provider in other words states may not discriminate in their payment rates to relative caretakers who are licensed in cases that otherwise meet title ive eligibility criteria however many relatives are not licensed as foster parents and therefore may receive less than their licensed counterparts or nothing at all children who are under state care but are living with relatives licensed or otherwise must be given the same protections as other foster children under the state plan requirements of titles ivb and ive in other words reasonable efforts must be made to reunite them with their parents if safe and appropriate case plans must be written and permanen cy plans must be established and they must have regular administrative and judicial reviews in addition the law requires states to initiate procedures to terminate parental rights for children who have been in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months states may make exceptions to this requirement for three specified reasons one of which is that the child is living with relative31 however these exceptions must be made on casebycase basis according to hhs regulations32 relatives who adopt their related children may be eligible to receive adoption assistance if the child meets all requirements including that they have special needs as defined by their state adoption requires termination of all parental rights tpr of the childs biological parents some kinship care proponents have argued that current financing rules do not recognize the unique situations of relative caretakers for example relatives caring for children may need the financial and social service support of the state child welfare agency but cannot meet licensing requirements for some reason or dont want the ongoing intrusion of social workers and judges continuously reviewing their case while adoption may be appropriate for some families it requires tpr which is legal adversarial process and may not always be in childs best interests intermediate arrangements such as legal guardianship might be the best option forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs24 33 states may use their own funds to provide subsidies to relative guardians in addition under federal waiver authority some states are experimenting with subsidized guardianship arrangements under title ive see discussion of waivers on page 26 of this reportsome children but federally assisted subsidy is available other than possibly welfare because the arrangement is not considered either foster care or adoption33 perceived strengths while many policymakers administrators and child advocates have expressed the concerns raised above many also defend the current financing system for several specific reasons because foster care is funded on an openended entitlement basis many believe that title ive is one of the last safety nets for states providing them with resources as needed to support abused and neglected children without any predetermined cap on federal spending in addition the current system requires states to guarantee certain protections for children in or at risk of being placed in foster care and these protections are further reinforced through the title ive reimbursement process and finally congress has recently allowed states to conduct child welfare demonstration projects that provide some flexibility under the current financing structure and that also will eventually produce evaluation findings to help inform legislative proposals in the future safety net for states for many state officials and child advocates crucial feature of the current federal financing system is the safety net provided to states in case of unanticipated increase s in their foster care caseloads if the number of children entering foster care in particular state goes up the amount of federal resources available to that state also goes up as long as the children and expenditures meet title ive eligibility criteria there is limit on the amount of federal funds that state is entitled to receive as partial reimbursement for the costs of serving eligible children for example between 1985 and 1990 the number of children in foster care rose sharply from 276000 to 400000 the cause of this increase was generally believed to be the introduction of crack cocaine in the midtolate 1980s although the crack epidemic was phenomenon largely beyond the control of state governments the impact of skyrocketing foster care population was felt acutely at the state level while states increased their own spending on foster care during this period additional federal support also was available because of the financing structure of title ive federal expenditures for foster care under title ive almost tripled between 1985 and 1990 from 546 million to 15 billion the crack epidemic and its devastating impact on children is the most recent and dramatic example of an unexpected change in the environment that can have staggering fiscal impacts on the child welfare system many observers fear such an event could occur again and therefore the existing safety net must be maintained for example some child advocates are concerned that downturn in the economy or elimination of welfare benefits because of time limits or other requirements of welfare reform could affect the size of the foster care population either by causing morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs25 34 at the same time observers note that the safety net operates for the most part only after crisis has occurred and children are removed from their original homes current law provides relatively small and capped amount of resources to states for their efforts to provide preventive and supportive services which might reduce the likelihood of childs placement in foster care or shorten the childs stay moreover the existing safety net does not extend to related agencies that interact with the child welfare system eg state courts law enforcement and service providers such as substance abuse or mental health agencieschildren to enter the system or by hindering efforts to restore families and return children home34 since enactment of the adoption and safe families act in 1997 states also must meet timetables intended to move children more quickly toward adoption and not allow them to linger indefinitely in foster care for children with special needs whose adoptions may require ongoing subsidies throughout their childhoods states also have safety net as result of the openended entitlement nature of adoption assistance under title ive as with foster care if the number of special needs children who are adopted in given state increases the amount of federal resources available to the state to support these children also increases if the children meet federal eligibility criteria as discussed earlier cbo estimates that nationally children eligible for federally subsidized adoption assistance will grow at rapid pace during the next 10 years outnumbering children federally eligible for foster care by fy2003 it can be argued that the current financing structure of the title ive adoption assistance program is consistent with recent federal initiatives to promote and support adoption mandatory child protections advocates of the current federal system point to series of interrelated provisions generally known as the laws mandatory child protections as one of its most important strengths these provisions are intended to avoid the placement of children in foster care unless necessary for their safety to ensure that efforts are made to reunify them with their families as soon as safely possible and to make sure their foster care placement is the least restrictive most familylike setting appropriat for them geographically close to their natural family the federal provisions also require that written case plan must be developed for every child in foster care that permanency plan must be established for every child that the childs case must be regularly reviewed through both an administrative and judicial process and that efforts be made to place the child in accordance with the permanenc plan as expeditiously as possible these provisions apply to all foster children regardless of whether they meet the eligibility criteria of title ive federal child protections are contained in the state plan requirements for titles ivb and ive as explained earlier for states to be eligible to receive funds under these authorities they must have state plans in effect that meet all of the requirements including the child protections contained in federal law these requirements are intended to be universal and to protect all children who come into contact with the state child welfare system in other words state plan requirements are not limited in their coverage to foster children who are eligible for federal subsidies however some of the child protection requirements are reinforced through the title ive financing mechanismhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs26 35 for informatio n about state waivers see the us congress house ways and means committee 2000 green book

system at httpwwwchildwelfarereviewcomfor example as condition of their plans states are required to make reasonable efforts to avoid the need to place children in foster care and to make reasonable efforts to return child home if it can be done safely this requirement applies to all children who enter the child welfare system unless court determines that an exception exists however if state claims federal reimbursement for expenditures made on behalf of particular foster child the state must document to hhs that there has been judicial determination to the effect that remaining in the natural home would have been contrary to the welfare of that child and that necessary reasonable efforts to avoid placement and to enable reunification have been made without documentation of these judicial findings federal reimbursement on behalf of that child cannot be made waivers while critics often attack the current system as being inflexible congress in recent years has allowed states the option of designing child welfare experiments under waivers from federal provisions subject to the approval of hhs initially in 1994 congress authorized hhs to grant waivers to 10 states and in 1997 expanded this authority to allow 10 additional waivers each year for 5 years through fy2002 the demonstration project must be costneutral to the federal government in terms of expenditures under titles ivb or ive and include an evaluation component these waivers are allowed for 5 years only and may not include waivers of the child protections required under titles ivb and ive states have used these waivers to test various initiatives such as subsidized guardianship capped allocations to local governments that can be used flexibly for various services and fixedprice performancebased payments to providers35 it is anticipated that evaluations of these waiver demonstrations will help inform future policy decisions made by congress accountability and judicial enforcement there is general unease about the extent to which federal law holds state child welfare agencies accountable for their performance although the law requires states to ensure certain protections for children as described above federal administrative enforcement of these protections was minimal for many years hhs has recently developed new system for monitoring state performance and enforcing federal child welfare law which was initially mandated by congress in october 1994 and subsequently went into effect in march 200036 the new system includes extensive onsite reviews comparison of state performance against national standards opportunity for corrective action and imposition of penalties the system has been enthusiastically received by many but its effectiveness has not yet been tested presuter and suterfix in the absence of aggressive enforcement by the federal government for much of the last 20 years child advocates have filed litigation against numerous state and local child welfare

of most relevance to the topic of this report some advocates of the current financing structure of title ive as an openended entitlement argue that this structure is essential for the laws provisions to be enforced through the courts however the extent to which even current federal child welfare law provides this access is matter in question while some of the lawsuits over the last 20 years have been narrow in scope many have been class actions alleging wide array of violations of federal and state law and seeking comprehensive child welfare reform many of these cases also have alleged constitutional violations according to marcia lowry who brought many of the child welfare cases over the past 20 years initially for the american civil liberties union and subsequently for childrens rights inc the specific state plan requirements of titles ivb and ive were critical in many of these cases lowry maintained that the federal law created specific protections and benefits that were enforceable in federal court37 the ability of child advocates to enforce the federal child protections through the courts was challenged in 1992 by the supreme court decision in suter v artist m38 in this case class action was filed against the illinois department of children and family services for several violations of federal law most notably failure to make reasonable efforts to prevent the need to remove children from their homes and to reunify children with their families according to attorneys representing the children these violations of the federal child welfare law occurred because the agency had not promptly assigned caseworkers after the children were placed in state custody the district and appeals courts held in favor of the children however the supreme court later reversed the appeals court decision and held that the federal law did not create right that was enforceable through federal court instead because the child protections including the reasonable efforts provision were contained as state plan requirements the law only required that the state have plan approved by the secretary of hhs it was the responsibility of hhs to enforce the implementation of that plan through withholding federal funds for noncompliance as authorized by congress the court also found that the term reasonable efforts was not defined in law because congress intended to grant the states wide discretion in their interpretation of this term thus the court ruled that the reasonable efforts requirement did not unambiguously confer an enforceable right upon the laws beneficiaries regardless of whether it was included in state plan congress responded to the suter decision by enacting legislation in 1994 which states that in any action brought to enforce provision of the social security act that provision is not considered unenforceable simply because it is state plan requirement39 this new language was intended to ensure that an individuals

portion of the suter decision the 1994 provision states that it is not intended to alter the courts decision that the laws reasonable efforts requirement does not confer private right of action post suter and suterfix the environment has changed since the suter decision and the enactment of the socalled suter fix in 1994 in that federal administrative mechanism now exists to enforce the child protections established in titles ivb and ive nonetheless the question remains to what extent are the child protections and other requirements of federal child welfare law currently enforceable through the courts and is there any relationship between the financing structure of federal child welfare programs and the extent to which these provisions can be enforced through federal court with regard to the first question there was not necessarily consensus among individuals who were involved in debating the suter fix legislation in 1994 and since that time court decisions have been mixed for example the fourth circuit court of appeals ruled in april 1997 that certain state plan requirements under title ive do not confer an enforceable right for the same reasons cited by the supreme court in the suter case and stated that enactment of the suter fix legislation does not alter our view white v chambliss40 in ef v scafildi the us district court for the southern district of mississippi had reached similar finding in april 1994 relying on the suter decision and subsequently declined to reconsider the case after the suter fix was enacted several months later41 likewise the us district court for new jersey ruled in january 2000 in charlie and nadine h v whitman that specific state plan requirements under titles ivb and ive do not confer an unambiguous right and therefore cannot be enforced in federal court42 the particular requirements in that case included preplacement preventive services program case plans and implementation and review of these plans placement of children in homes or facilities that comply with nationally recommended standards placement of children in the least restrictive most familylike setting proper care of foster children adherence to specified timetable for freeing children for adoption timely permanency planning and service delivery regular judicial and administrative reviews and dispositional hearings and development of an adequate child welfare information system similarly the court ruled that certain state plan provisions of capta dealing with the prompt investigation of maltreatment reports and the protection of children do not confer unambiguous rights enforceable through the federal courts therefore the childrens claims that these provisions hadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs29 43 for example the court found that the multiethnic placement act mepa as amended did confer enforceable rights which were explicitly provided in the statute section 475d3 of the social security act and allowed the claim that mepa had been violated to proceed 44 2000 us dist lexis 18771 45 press release childrens rights inc new york april 23 2001 46 ibid june 25 2001 47 speaking before the american bar association in 1999 marcia lowry said there has been narrowing of the law in some areas particularly concerning the enforcability of the federal statutes under which all child welfare systems operate and how much of these statutes can be enforced on behalf of the children for whose benefit presumably the statutes were passed likewise summary of the national child welfare advocates conference in 1999 published in youth law news states there are also new barriers to litigation such as limitations on private rights of action under federal statutes however lowry hailed the april 2001 ruling in bonnie l v jeb bush as providing greater clarity to unsettled federal law and creating much stronger basis for enforcing childrens rights in other failing child welfare systems 48 121 sct 1511 2001been violated were dismissed although other components of the case were allowed to continue43 on the other hand the us district court for tennessee issued an opposite ruling in october 2000 in brian v sundquist 44 in this case the court ruled that certain state plan requirements under titles ivb and ive do confer an unambiguous right that can be enforced through federal court specifically the requirements dealing with case plans and review systems placement in homes or facilities that comply with nationally recommended standards and an adequate child welfare information system in april 2001 magistrate judge of the us district court for the southern district of florida also ruled that federal child welfare law creates enforceable rights and recommended that bonnie l v jeb bush go forward to trial45 and most recently the us district court for the eastern district of wisconsin ruled in jeanine b v scott mccallum that title ive provisions established by the adoption and safe families act of 1997 intended to speed up the adoption process for children in foster care are federal rights that are enforceable in court46 unresolved questions these conflicting decisions leave unresolved questions about the extent to which litigation can be brought in federal court to enforce the statutory provisions of titles ivb and ive of the social security act in general advocates have expressed concerns about recent trends that illustrate the reluctance of courts to find that private right of action exists to enforce statutory requirements unless that private right is explicitly established in the statute itself47 most recently the supreme court ruled in alexander v sandoval civil rights case that private rights of action to enforce federal laws must be created by congress and cannot be created by the courts matter how desirable that might be as policy matter or how compatible with the statute48 at the same time it is important to note that many of the child welfare lawsuits of the past 20 years have alleged violations of the constitution and other statutes in addition to title ivb and ive of the social security act and these cases have moved forward on those groundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs30 49 42 usc 1983 establishes the right of an individual to bring action in court in cases when that individual is deprived of federal right privilege or immunitythe issue of the financing structure of federal child welfare programs and its relationship to judicial enforcement has generally not been explored in determining whether these programs create federally enforceable rights under 42 usc 198349 the courts have traditionally looked at several factors first the plaintiffs must demonstrate that they are the intended beneficiaries of the federal statute second the presumed right created by the statute must not be so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence third the statute must unambiguously impose binding or mandatory obligation on the state finally congress must not have precluded enforcement of the statute in court either by explicitly denying private right of action or by establishing another enforcement mechanism such as an administrative review system in suter the supreme court found that congress had provided another enforcement mechanism ie hhs was authorized to withhold funds if states failed to comply with their federally approved state plans and therefore private right of action did not exist in the suterfix law congress said this state plan structure did not necessarily on its own preclude private right of action to enforce the federal law in court recent decisions have generally rested on the other factors identified above and as already discussed the courts have issued conflicting decisions on whether certain of the state plan requirements under titles ivb and ive are sufficiently clear and unambiguous to create an enforceable right unless congress were to explicitly provide in the federal statute itself that the beneficiaries of these laws may enforce them in federal court this issue will likely remain unresolved policy options and proposals for at least the last decade proposals to change the way federal funds are provided to states for child welfare activities have surfaced in congress in response to the perceived weaknesses described earlier ideas have ranged from expansions of the existing foster care and adoption assistance entitlements to complete consolidation of all federal child welfare funding streams with many variations in between thus far none has been enacted for various reasons including lack of comprehensive information for use in analyzing proposals concerns about additional federal costs and fear of sacrificing some of the systems perceived strengths nonetheless the discussion has gained momentum in recent years and is continuing the following reviews some of the options that have been considered and discusses policy issues that are raised by these proposals severing the afdc connection delinking even before afdc was repealed and replaced with the tanf block grant in 1996 there was concern about the use of afdc as an eligibility criterion for federal foster care or adoption assistance for many of the reasons discussed earlier in 1991 representative downey introduced legislation hr 2571 102nd congress that would have eliminated the requirement that limits federal reimbursement to states onlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs31 to afdceligible children or ssieligible children in the case of adoption assistance the legislation would have allowed states to claim federal reimbursement for eligible foster care or adoption assistance expenditures on behalf of children without regard to their family income because of the potential expense of expanding federal foster care and adoption assistance to greater number of children the 1991 proposal also would have reduced federal matching rates to states foster care maintenance and adoption assistance payments to parents would have been matched at 40 federal rate rather than the current medicaid rate which varies by state but never goes below 50 administrative and child placement costs currently matched at 50 would have received 25 federal match and the federal match for training expenses would have been lowered from 75 to 50 the impact of this provision which ultimately was deleted during house ways and means subcommittee markup would have varied significantly by state because of two key factors state matching rates for foster care maintenance and adoption assistance payments vary because of the use of the medicaid matching rate therefore the effect of flat federal matching rate of 40 would be different in each state further the proportion of each states foster care and adoption assistance caseload that meets the afdc eligibility criterion varies by state therefore the effect of eliminating this requirement also would be different in each state at the time hr 2571 was debated little reliable information was available on the overall size of each states foster care population and the percentage of that population that was claimed as title iveeligible thus it was difficult to gauge the proposals impact on each state nonetheless it was clear that some states would be winners and others would be losers for example it was known that new york claimed very high proportion of its foster care caseload as title iveeligible so that elimination of the afdc requirement would have expanded the eligible population in that state only slightly while at the same time lowering the states federal matching rates for some other states the effect of decreased federal matching rates would have been outweighed by substantial increases in the population for whom federal payments could be claimed because of the limited information available and concerns about state losers this proposal was dropped and replaced with provision that would have authorized hhs to conduct demonstrations in up to five states to test the feasibility of eliminating income eligibility criteria from foster care and adoption assistance this provision was included among others in an omnibus urban aid and tax package hr 11 102nd congress that was pocketvetoed by thenpresident bush in 1992 for reasons unrelated to child welfare during the welfare reform debate the 104th congress considered but did not enact proposals to consolidate all federal child welfare funding streams into block grant which would have left decisions about income eligibility requirements to state discretion when congress repealed afdc and established tanf the structure of title ive was maintained but the law was amended to grandfather in the eligibility requirements of afdc as they existed prior to the new laws enactment for purposes of foster care adoption assistance and medicaid lawmakers decided not to connecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs32 50 asfa requires states to provide health coverage to children for whom they have adoption assistance agreements and encourage s states through incentives to provide coverage to children living in their borders who have adoption assistance agreements with other statesfoster care or adoption assistance eligibility to tanf because states have broad discretion under tanf to define their eligible populations thus states could potentially have defined greater number of foster children as eligible for tanf and thereby increased federal spending under title ive proposals to delink afdc from child welfare surfaced again in 1997 during the debate that resulted in passage of the adoption and safe families act asfa the late senator john chafee and others introduced legislation to eliminate the afdc and ssi requirement from adoption assistance under title ive s 511 and s 1195 105th congress unlike the downey proposal of 1991 these bills would not have touched the afdc requirement in foster care nor would they have changed federal matching rates although the congressional budget office cbo never released formal estimate concerns were raised about the proposals potential cost as discussed earlier elimination of the afdc or ssi requirement would expand the population eligible for federal adoption subsidies and without any change in the matching rates would result in additional federal costs in response to this concern the proposal was changed to become prospective only in other words income eligibility requirements would have continued to apply to children already receiving adoption assistance but would have been eliminated for children newly adopted after the provisions enactment while the provision would still have resulted in increased federal costs the amount of additional spending would have been less the 1997 proposals to delink adoption assistance grew from two concerns as stated earlier many believe that the income and welfare eligibility status of biological parents who have lost rights to their child should not be used to determine whether the federal government will help subsidize adoption assistance for that child in addition there was concern that children who are ineligible for federal adoption subsidies may not have access to the same assistance and services from their state thereby creating barrier to their adoption according to the north american council on adoptable children nacac almost all states have adoption assistance programs for special needs children who do not meet the income eligibility criteria of title ive these programs are primarily paid for by the states themselves and provide benefits that are usually but not always the same as those subsidized with federal funds prior to the adoption and safe families act one of the key differences was access to medicaid or other health insurance coverage however asfa contains provisions to address this issue50 during the 1997 debate it was unclear whether the delinking proposal would have helped to increase the actual number of special needs adoptions that occurred since children who are not eligible for title ive adoption assistance may nonetheless receive subsidies under statefunded program however the proposal clearly had fiscal implications for the federal and state governments the american public human services association aphsa estimated that onethird of children receiving adoption assistance were not eligible for title ive subsidies and were supported entirely with state funds these children would have become eligible under the originalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs33 51 in addition to proposals discussed in this section legislation is pending in the 107th congress s 550hr 2335 and similar bills have been proposed in earlier congresses to enable indian tribes to receive federal reimbursement directly under title ive for expenses associated with eligible children in their custody rather than through the states as under current law moreover legislation is pending in the 107th congress to create additional grant programs under title ivb for specific purposes eg substance abuse treatment for child welfare clients s 484hr 1909 improved quality standards and training for child welfare workers hr 1371 the administration also has proposed new independent living voucher program to help former foster youth with higher education expenses versions have been included in s 685 and hr 1990s 940proposal thus federal spending would have increased and states likely would have saved money to ensure that these state savings were used to benefit children s 1195 would have required that states use these funds for child welfare services allowable under title ivb or title ive although the adoption equality act was introduced in the 106th congress s 1067 rockefeller with similar provisions to the 1997 proposals the delinking issue recently has been subsumed in larger discussions of child welfare financing reform including proposals to promote flexible funding the central issue in the delinking debate remains its cost to the federal government the aphsa has recommended that income eligibility criteria be eliminated from foster care and adoption assistance but that customized matching rate be developed for each state taking into account the federal governments actual share of each states spending under current law this proposal would avoid additional federal costs and would not result in state windfalls at the same time this approach would produce different matching rates for each state which then would be locked in permanently regardless of any changes in the states circumstances under current law the medicaid matching rate varies by state per capita income and is recalculated each year legislation has been introduced in the 107th congress hr 1990s 940 that would eliminate income eligibility criteria from both foster care and adoption assistance and also would establish the medicaid matching rate as the federal matching rate for all services under title ive ie foster care adoption assistance training data collection administration this proposal also would significantly expand the range of services that could be reimbursed under title ive discussed below expanding the entitlement51 current law specifically defines state expenditures that may be reimbursed by the federal government under title ive which are limited to the costs of activities related to certain foster or adopted children as described earlier reimbursable activities are currently limited to foster care maintenance payments adoption assistance payments administration child placement services training for state agency personnel foster and adoptive parents and staff of residential foster care providers and data collection critics have objected that these allowable uses are too rigid and limited to activities that are conducted after children have been removedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs34 52 both the child welfare league of america and the american public human services association have posted their legislative proposals for the 107th congress which include expansions of the title ive entitlement on their web sites httpwwwcwlaorgadvocacy2001legagendahtm and httpwwwaphsaorgreauthorcwasp from home and provide resources for states to improve the quality of child welfare services and potentially reduce the need for foster care the previous section discussed the issue of expanding the population of eligible children on whose behalf federal payments could be made to states under title ive ie eliminating the afdc requirement for foster care or adoption assistance some recent proposals would expand the entitlement to allow federal reimbursement for additional categories of expenditures for example s 511 in the 106th congress would have allowed federal reimbursement to states for the costs of training additional categories of individuals including court and law enforcement personnel and personnel employed by substance abuse prevention and treatment agencies mental health providers domestic violence prevention and treatment agencies health agencies child care agencies schools and other child welfare family service and community service agencies legislation introduced in the 106th congress s 708 s 2271 hr 5369 would have expanded the training reimbur sement to include judges judicial personnel law enforcement personnel attorneys guardians ad litem and courtappointed special advocates version of this proposal was passed by the house as part of another bill hr 3073 but action occurred in the senate s 511 in the 106th congress also would have expanded reimbursement to states under title ive to include two new types of services ie expenditures for children who are placed with their parent in residential treatment program for substance abuse domestic violence homelessness and expenditures for reunification services for children and their parents for up to 1 year after the childs removal from home reunification services would have been defined to include counseling substance abuse treatment mental health services services to address domestic violence and transportation to and from such services in the 107th congress hr 1990s 940 would significantly expand the categories of services that are reimbursable by the federal government under title iv specifically this proposal would allow openended federal funding for preventiv protective and crisis services permanency services independent living services ongoing payments to relative guardians of former foster children living expenses of former foster youths under the age of 22 if they are in school or working and participating in an independent living program and training costs for wide array of professionals related to the child welfare system including judicial personnel and staff of substance abuse treatment and mental health providers the federal matching rate for all services including training data collection and administration would be the medicaid matching rate52 proposals to expand the entitlement to additional categories of spending raise obvious budgetary concerns congress cannot control spending under title ive as an uncapped entitlement except by tightly defining eligible expenditures anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs35 53 the maximum ever transferred was 74 million in fy1981 this amount dropped sharply the following year and was less than 1 million by fy1991expansion of those eligible expenditures results in increased federal spending moreover states must document and hhs must determine the eligibility of these expenditur before reimbursement can be made thus the administrative burden associated with this financing structure could be exacerbated if additional categories of expenditures were made eligible for reimbursement expanding the entitlement to include additiona l services also raises supplantation questions specifically how does the federal government ensure that states dont use these new federal resources to pay for services that they previously were providing with their own funds in other words would expansion of the federal entitlement necessarily result in increased services or could it merely result in fiscal relief for the states on the other hand advocates argue that openended matching funds for foster care in the absence of comparable source of funds for prevention and treatment creates financial incentives to remove children from home rather than provide potentially expensive services that might enable the child to remain safely at home they maintain that the safety net should be expanded to include training and other supportive services that might reduce the need and therefore the spending for foster care while such proposals might result in additional federal spending for child welfare and related services they might also be justified by improved outcomes for children and associated longterm savings to society supplantation concerns could potentially be addressed through maintenanceofeffort provisions which would require states to maintain their current level of spending for child welfare services and use new federal funds to increase the level of services provided for example hr 1990s 940 would require states to maintain spending of their own funds for the newly reimbursable categories of services at the fy2001 level transfers between titles ivb and ive when title ive was created in 1980 pl 96272 establishing permanency planning and other federal requirements aimed at reducing foster care caseloads complicated feature was included in the law that was intended to produce additional resources for preventive child welfare services incentives were designed to encourage states to reduce spending on foster care maintenance if they succeeded they could transfer their unused foster care funds from title ive into their child welfare services programs under title ivb specifically the 1980 law provided that if appropriations for title ivb increased to certain specified levels ceiling would be placed on each states foster care spending any amounts below that ceiling that the state did not actually use for foster care could be transferred into its child welfare services program it was assumed that resources available to states for preventive and supportive services would expand as spending for foster care declined thereby helping to reduce foster care caseloads even further in practice the title ivb appropriation only reached the necessary level in 1 year fy1981 states could voluntarily choose to operate under ceiling but few did53 thus the potential of this transfer provision was never realized because appropriations for the child welfare services program never increased as congress hadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs36 54 see crossroads child welfare at httpwwwaphsaorgreauthorcwasp 55 see crs report rl30818 block grants an overview by eugene p boyd and ben canadaenvisioned moreover by the middle 1980s foster care caseloads and therefore state foster care expenditures began to rise the provision became obsolete and was eventually repealed legislation introduced in the 106th congress hr 5292 would have established transfer of funds demonstration in up to five states for 3 years states would have been allowed to transfer unused foster care funds within baseline amount from title ive and use them flexibly for other child welfare services subject to agreement on the use of funds with hhs the house ways and means subcommittee on human resources held hearings but took further action on the bill major challenge presented by the proposal was the methodology to be used for determining each participating states baseline amount the legislation provided that hhs and the individual state would negotiate and agree upon the baseline which was intended to be the amount of federal funds under title ive the state would have been eligible to receive during the 3 years of the demonstration if the state were not participating in the demonstration the drafters intended the legislation to be costneutral however because the baseline had to be determined by projecting future expenditures costneutrality could not be assured the scope of the bills maintenanceofeffort provision also was raised as an issue during hearings specifically child advocates and state representatives disagreed about whether states should be required to maintain current levels of child welfare spending from all sources including other federal programs such as tanf and ssbg or only from targeted child welfare programs specifically title ivb and title ive of the social security act despite the complex technical and policy challenges raised by this proposal version of it will likely be considered again key advocate is the american public human services association aphsa which includes transferability proposal among its child welfare recommendations for the 107th congress54 particularly from state perspective the authority to transfer funds from one title to another is attractive because it potentially provides the state with flexible source of child welfare funds if the state can reduce its actual foster care spending below otherwise projected levels but it maintains the openended entitlement nature of title ive and therefore continues to provide safety net in case of unexpected increases in the foster care caseload consolidation block grants many proposals have been made in recent years to consolidate government programs and some have been enacted55 during the 104th congress landmark welfare reform legislation replaced the 61yearold program of aid to families with dependent children with the tanf block grant to states pl 104193 early versions of that legislation also would have consolidated child protection and child welfare programs into block grants although highly controversial in the mid1990shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs37 56 programs that would have been replaced included everything then authorized under titles ivb and ive of the social security act capta and number of related programs such as adoption opportunities abandoned infants assistance missing childrens assistance grants the victims of child abuse act and the family unification program under section 8 of the housing act some programs that would have been replaced by the block grant longer exist in the same form such as family support centers under the mckinney homeless assistance act and crisis nurseries under the temporary child care and crisis nurseries act 57 although none of the block grant proposal was enacted congress did mandate citizen review panels as condition of state funding in the 1996 reauthorization of capta pl 104395proposals to consolidate certain child welfare programs may resurface in the 107th congress as originally passed by the house in 1995 hr 4 104th congress would have consolidated 22 funding streams into single child protection block grant56 states would have been allowed to use these funds flexibly in accordance with several child welfare standards of which the primary standard was the protection of children other standards were prompt investigati on of child maltreatment reports permanency plan and dispositional hearing for all foster children within 3 months of factfinding hearing and reviews every 6 months for children in temporary foster care state programs would have been audited states would have been required to submit detailed statistical reports to hhs and each state would have been required to establish citizen review panels to oversee their programs57 states would have received single allotment of funds with their share based on the proportion of funds they had received under several of the previous programs including foster care as welfare reform evolved in the 104th congress the child welfare provisions became less sweeping for example the housesenate conference version of hr 4 which was vetoed by president clinton would have created two child welfare related block grants instead of one child protection block grant to replace some of the social security act programs and child and family services block grant to replace capta and related activities maintenance payments for foster children and adoption assistance subsidies were not included in either block grant and would have remained openended entitlements to states under the next house version of welfare reform hr 3734 104th congress administrative and training costs related to foster care and adoption assistance also were removed from the block grant as were independ ent living services for older foster children ultimately all child welfare block grant provisions were dropped from the final welfare reform bill that was signed into law proponents of child welfare block grants argued that consolidation of categorical programs and elimination of federal mandates could allow states to design more comprehensive service systems for children and families without the constraints of funding sources tied to specific services as considered in the 104th congress block grant proposals would have required states to maintain the key features of child protection system such as mandatory abuse and neglect reporting and investigation foster care and permanency planning for foster children but without the existing funding structure and mandates which were characterized as cumbersomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs38 58 however as shown earlier in this report adoption caseloads in contrast to foster care have not slowed their growth and in fact have climbed sharply in recent years pattern that is projected to continueaccountability would have been assured through audits and penalties data collection and reporting and citizen review panels that would have allowed the public to assess the adequacy of child protection systems opponents argued that by enacting block grants the federal government would be abdicating its leadership role in the area of child protection which is an issue of national concern while the legislation would have required states to certify that their programs contained certain features it was feared that the federal government would have had limited enforcement authority with designated funds for preventive and supportive services for families some child advocates were concerned that the ongoing demand to investigate abuse and neglect reports and remove children from unsafe homes would have left few resources available for less crisisdriven activities advocates also were concerned that the proposal might have limited the ability of abused and neglected children to seek protection in the federal courts moreover block grants were seen as first step toward reductions in federal spending for child welfare activities after zero growth in the total number of children in foster care in 1985 and 14 increase in 1986 the foster care population rose by 71 in 1987 and jumped up sharply during the next 2 years by 133 in 1988 and 138 in 1989 this sudden and dramatic increase was recent memory in the mid1990s when welfare reform and associated child welfare block grant proposals were being debated contributing at least in part to the unease about potential cap on federal spending however between 1990 and 1998 growth in foster care averaged 42 per year and in 1999 slowed to the 1986 level of 14 growth increased somewhat between 1999 and 2000 but was still relatively low at 23 some child advocates and state officials maintain that openended funding remains essential in case of another unexpected caseload rise however others argue that flexibility in the use of funds is more important goal especially since caseload growth has significantly slowed down58 legislation introduced in the 106th congress hr 5292 cited above would have allowed up to five states to conduct consolidation demonstrations for 3 years in which they would have been able to receive fixed payment that could be used flexibly for child

release office of senator grassley washington dc june 7 2000 60 child welfare outcomes 1998 annual report us department of health and human services childrens bureau october 2000 httpwwwacfdhhsgovprogramscbpublicationscwo98indexhtmldiscontent with the performance of the nations child welfare system and concerns about the extent to which states are held accountable for their performance have prompted policymakers to consider alternative financing systems that would more directly reward or penalize states for achieving positive or negative outcomes for children for example senator grassley along with senators dewine and landrieu expressed support in 2000 for legislation never formally introduced that would have established financial incentives for states to return children home or place them for adoption quickly59 specifically the grassley proposal would have increased the federal matching rate for states during childs first 18 months in care and expanded the range of services eligible for reimburs ement to include respite care for example federal matching would have dropped after 18 months however states would have been eligible for bonus for children placed for adoption within 3 years unless the adoption disrupted within 2 years in which case the bonus would have been recaptured in the adoption and safe families act of 1997 congress took small step toward performancebased funding by establishing adoption incentive payments which provide bonus payment to states for each adoption of foster child or child with special needs above baseline level adoptions have increased in the last several years and states collectively earned more in 1998 and 1999 than congress initially appropriated for these payments however the extent to which the incentive payments directly contributed to these additional adoptions is not known asfa made changes in the basic child welfare financing structure but two additional provisions reflect congressional interest in the use of outcome measures as way of holding states accountable for their performance first the 1997 law required hhs to develop set of outcome measures that could be used to assess state performance and to publish an annual report on each states performance with respect to these measures as published in the august 20 1999 federal register the outcome measures relate to the goals of 1 reducing the recurrence of abuse or neglect 2 reducing the occurrence of abuse or neglect while child is in foster care 3 increasing permanency for children in foster care 4 reducing time in foster care prior to reunification without increasing reentry into care 5 reducing time in foster care prior to adoption 6 increasing placement stability and 7 reducing placements of young children in group homes or institutions hhs published the first annual report on state performance based on data submitted by states for 1998 in october 200060 in addition some of these outcome measures are being used as component of the new hhs review system for monitoring state compliance with federal lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs40 the second asfa provision required hhs to develop and recommend to congress performancebased financing system for programs authorized by titles iv b and ive of the social security act this system was to be developed in consultation with state and local public child welfare officials and child welfare advocates and be based on state performance with respect to the outcome measures developed by hhs in response to the mandate described above the law required hhs to submit progress report by may 1998 and final report by february 1999 hhs submitted progress report but final report on this performancebased incentive financing system and identified several key issues including the need for carefully designed set of outcome measures that would not result in unintended consequences and data collection systems that could provide the information needed to evaluate state performance against these outcome measures in its first annual report on state performance mentioned above hhs noted that the outcome measures developed so far do not reflect the full range of states child welfare system because all of the necessary data are not collected likewise even for those outcome measures that have been developed not all states are yet able to submit the relevant data nonetheless hhs and the states have made dramatic progress in the last several years with regard to data collection in the areas of child abuse foster care and adoptio n assistance and the quality and comprehensiveness of the data that are collected is continually improving in its progress report hhs noted that several states are experimenting with various forms of performancebased funding either on their own or through federally approved waivers which will eventually produce evaluation results in addition there is growing body of literature on this subject with regard to various forms of human and social services in addition to child welfare nonetheless hhs noted that number of experts suggest caution in the use of performancebased financial incentives and stated that additional research and analysis is needed final notes as discussed in this report federal financing for child welfare activities is complex and considered problematic for various reasons some provisions are seen as outmoded inefficient burdensome and bureaucra tic and reportedly inhibit innovation and creative responses to the changing needs of vulnerable population in fact the federal financing system isnt comprehensive system at all but rather an assortment of laws requirements and funding streams that evolved over decades as congress attempted to respond to current challenges at the same time as also discussed in this report federal funds have provided safety net to states as they have struggled to protect and serve children who enter and remain in the child welfare system for reasons beyond the control of the children or of the states and federal requirements have ensured minimum level of protection for these children by establishing mandates that child welfare agencies must meet in order to receive federal funds while one defends the current system as perfect many would argue that federal law has resulted in important proceduralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs41 reforms and in less foster care shorter stays in foster care and more adoptions than would have occurred otherwise nonetheless frustration with the current system is widespread and attempts at reform incremental or comprehensive will continue to be debated raising many of the issues already addressed in this report in addition the following final notes may be useful in analyzing further attempts at financing reform while reform proposals have not generally been driven by motivation to reduce federal spending budget issues are central to the debate nonetheless most of the funding streams are entitlements and the largest are openended entitlements any changes in policy would likely create additional federal spending that must be paid for or less likely savings that lawmakers might want to use to finance other initiatives proposals that are intended to be costneutral in other words to change policy while maintaining the same level of federal spending that would have occurred otherwise face design challenges such proposals would either create winners and losers among states or would likely further complicate the system in an effort to hold each state harmless recent and projected future trends in child welfare spending and in the eligible population have important implications for financing reform proposals in particular these trends highlight the fundamental difference in purpose between foster care intended as shortterm and temporary protection for children who cannot live at home and adoption assistance which attempts to promote permanent adoptions for special needs children by providing ongoing assistance to adoptive parents states are responding to federal directives and incentives intended to increase adoptions from foster care and the adoption assistance population is projected to grow significantly in future years therefore proposals to change the way states receive federal foster care funds may have different goals and raise different issues than proposals to change the financing structure of adoption assistance because they are large and openended funding streams foster care and adoption assistance are typically the focus of financing reform discussions however states receive other child welfare funds from titles ivb and ive of the social security act and capta which impose additional requirements and have an impact on shaping policy at the state level moreover federal funds not specifically targeted toward child welfare also are used to serve child welfare clients for example tanf medicaid ssbg thus an awareness of all federal dollars that influence state behavior is important in understanding the implications of proposals that change the way some of these dollars are provided regardless of financing structure monitoring and enforcement of federal child welfare requirements will remain of concern under thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs42 current system states must submit plans indicating compliance with these requirements in order to participate in federal programs and some of these requirements are then reinforced through the expenditure reimbursement process even under block grant approach states still could be required to submit similar or even more stringent state plans however if congress chooses to continue playing major role in shaping as well as funding child welfare policy at the state level then federal administrative oversight will be necessary under any system to ensure actual compliance with paper requirements the effectiveness of hhs new monitoring system will be of great interest as will future court rulings on the ability of children and families to seek judicial enforcement of federal requirements finally financing reform proposals are inextricably linked with nonfinancial issues proposals to change the federal financing structure will inevitably raise intergovernmental issues eg federal state relations the role of the private sector as well as the traditional child welfare tension between child protection and family preservation thus policymakers are likely to bring their philosophical and ideological views about the overall goals and mission of the child welfare system to the debate over financing reformhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs43 appendix summary of funding streams table a1 current federal child welfare

security act states are eligible for federal reimbursement for eligible expenditures associated with providing services for eligible children states are required to submit claims for expenditures under title ive on quarterly basis and then receive reimbursement from the federal government based on the appropriate matching rate the analysis presented in this report is based on the claims data submitted by the states to the us department of health and human services hhs there are limitations to using these data as provided first states can claim federal reimbursement for title ive expenditures for 2 years61 therefore as states submit the quarterly data they are required to submit any prior quarter adjustments to claims they have previously made the data presented in this report represent the total expenditures claimed by state for fiscal year which includes all prior quarter adjustments claimed within that fiscal year these numbers may reflect current fiscal year quarter adjustments but they may also reflect prior fiscal year quarter adjustments while these adjustments are submitted to hhs it is not possible to identify the amounts or the directions of these adjustments using the data as provided by hhs second in addition to the prior quarter adjustments hhs disallows some of the expenditures claimed that is they determine that the expenditures are not eligible for federal reimbursement these disallowances affect the total state expenditures in given year as hhs may defer reimbursing the states for these expenditures pending decision about whether they are eligible for federal reimbursement under the law the data in this report for both foster care and adoption assistance under title ive reflect disallowances reported by hhs for fy1987fy1998 however the data for fy1999 and fy2000 do not include any disallowances it is possible that in subsequent year disallowances for some of the claims in fy1999 and fy2000 may occur as disallowances occur these claims will change in addition to the above limitations the most recent claims data for title ive foster care fy2000 and title ive adoption assistance fy2000 include separate category of expenditures made under child welfare waiver demonst rations as discussed in the text these demonstration projects must be costneutral to the federal government in terms of expenditures under title ive and therefore this additional category does not affect the federal share of total state claims for expenditures under title ive however parts of this report examine the distribution of spending by category for foster care and adoption assistance the demonstration category may include maintenance payments assistance payments for adoption assistance administration or training expenditures however it is not possible to determine the amount of expenditures under the demonstration projects devoted to each of these categories using the data as provided by hhs therefore for purposes of examining the distribution of spending in each of these categories the demonstration expenditures were excluded from the federal share of total state claims for foster care and adoption assistance while this may affect the distribution ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31082crs47 spending thus far expenditures for these demonstrations have been small component of overall foster care and adoption assistance spending for foster care expenditures under demonstrations were 3 136 million of the total state claims in fy2000 for adoption assistance the federal spending under demonstration projects was 001 89898 of total federal spending for adoption assistance in fy2000 finally because this report is based on the claims data submitted by the states they represent expenditures claimed by the states as well as the average monthly number of children claimed as eligible for federal reimbursement for foster care and adoption assistance states have primary responsibility for determining the amount of eligible expenditures as well as the number of children eligible for federal reimbursement to submit to hhs these data reflect the average monthly number of children claimed as eligible for title ive rather than the actual number of children eligible to the extent that states experience difficulty in determining title ive eligibility for some children these data would likely underestimate the
