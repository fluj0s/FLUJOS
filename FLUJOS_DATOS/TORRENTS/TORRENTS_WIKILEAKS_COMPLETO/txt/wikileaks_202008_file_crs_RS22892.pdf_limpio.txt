have stat ed that 123 agreement is needed to implement this plan for exam ple full scale technical cooperation on fast reactors and demonstration of advanced sp ent fuel processing and waste management technologies13 benefits to the united states from 123 agreement with russia could include development of advanced nuclear fuel cycle technologies and future generation of proliferationresistant reactors14 joint commercial partners hips influence over russian nonproliferation and nuc lear export policies15 common argument in favor of the agreement is that the united states could gain from russian work on reprocessingadvanced fuel cycle research since the united states does not operate fast neutron reactors or reprocess testing of fuels develope d under the gnep program could be done in russia including postirradia tion examination supporters argue that us partnership in developing these technologie s could help ensure that proliferation resistance remains priority critics point out that the agreement risks entrenching the bush administrations policy of accepting reprocessing as necessary part of the future of nuclear energy although future adminis tration and congress w ould always have the ability to guide the pace and dir ection of these developments 123 agreement could provide russia with access to us nuclear technologies and markets the right to receive usorigin nuclear materials into russia for storage or processing and an improved in ternational image for its nucl ear industry the agreement might also be construed as us approval

foreign spent fuel imports but due to public opposition russian offici als have stated that russia does not now plan to import nonrussianorigin spent fuel for storagecriticized the agreement on this basis that safety and environmental problems with the russian nuclear industry remain and therefore it would be premature to give approval others counter that only through such an agreement will western safety technology and standards be available to russia russia could also expand its reach into new nuclear power markets by adding us safety and automated control systems to its exported reactors or partnering with us multinationals supporters of the agreement argue that it could bolster the nonproliferation regime by promoting nuclear energy framework that addresses emerging nuclear energy states fuel needs while dissuading them from pursu ing indigenous enrichment and reprocessing technologies proposals include the devel opment of multilateral fuel assurances international fuel service centers and new generation of pro liferationresistant reactors russia has set up the joint venture international uranium enrichment center at angarsk which is to be under international safegu ards and is discussing options for hosting an international fuel bank at the site the united states may choose to join the angarsk consortium in order to have more input into its management but section 123 agreement with the united states is not necessa ry for russia to proceed with these efforts unless the united states transfers nuclear material or equipment additionally 123 agreement would allow fo r russian reprocessing of usorigin spent fuel from third countries although russi has not yet decided to do this or long term spent fuel storage of such material in russia16 the enrichment of usobligated reprocessed uranium and the reenrichment of us uranium tails or usorigin tails using russian enrichment facilities would also require 123 agreement17 there appears to be interest by russia in establishing an international spent fuel storage facility isfsf that could accept usorigin fuel for example from taiwan or south korea or as part of russian fuel leasing and return program for future nuclear power plants abroad18 the us may encourage isfsf in ru ssia as way to prevent countries from pursuing reprocessing technologies19 collaboration between the united states and russia on providing nuclear fuel cycl services to nonnuclear wea pon states could increase the confidence of these states in the services and therefore increase participation usrussian

on nonproliferation nuclear terrorism prevention and nuclear energy may have par ticular value for the bilateral relationship us ambassador burns remarked at the may signing ceremony that the 123 agreement marks washington and moscows transition from nuclear rivals to nuclear partners the timing of the agreements signing the day before putin stepped down as russian president is also viewed by some as culmination of bilateral cooperation between the bush and putin administrations21 although 123 agreement w ill not itself stipulate new programs or collaborative projects it may have symbolic value and remove longtime irritant in bilatera l relations supporters argue that rejecting the agreement could embolden antius sentiment and be counte rproductive to cooperation in other areas critics counter that its symbolic value is reason not to enact it at this time it would be an undeserved reward for russian gove rnment critics view as antidemocratic and repressive and whose foreig n policy often has been at odds with us interests russian policy toward iran during the clinton administration and th early bush administration the united states had policy not to conclude civ ilian nuclear cooperation agreement with russia while it was building nuclear power reactor for iran at bushehr after details about irans clandestine nuclear activities came to light during 20022006 russia began to step up cooperation with the united states and ot her countries negotiating with iran over its nuclear program additionally russia has insisted on iaea safeguards on any transfers to irans civilian nuclear react or at bushehr on condition that the resulting spent fuel will be returned to russia per february 2005 agreement moscow has also invited tehran to participate in its newly established international uranium enrichment center at angarsk as an alternative to an indigenous iranian richment capability an offer that iran has rejected the bush administration has suppor ted this approach and since 2002 longer objects to russias building the bushehr nuclear power plant in iran president bush most recently at the april 2008 summit in sochi has praised russian president putin for his leadership in offering solution to the ir anian nuclear negotiations washington has had less success convincing moscow to agree with its proposals for tougher sanctions on iran in the security council

the 2006 iran freedom support act pl 109293 gives th sense of congress that nuclear cooperation agreement should be entered into with country that is assisting the nuclear program of iran the iran counterprolif eration act of 2007 h r1400 passed by the house would prohibit any agreement for c ooperation between the united states and the government of any country that is assisting the nuclear program of iran or transferring advanced conventional weapons or missiles to iran similarly the senate is considering s 970 which specifically prohibits 123 agreement with russia until russia has suspended all nuclear assistance to iran nd all transfers of dvanced conventional weapons and missiles to iran or iran s completely verifiab ly and irreversibly dismantled all nuclear enrichmentrelated and reprocessingrela ted programs the security through terminati on of proliferation act of 2008 hr 6178 introduced on june 4 2008 includes similar provisions includi ng that nuclear cooperation agreement with country proliferating to iran north ko rea or syria may not enter into force these bills as well as letters sent to the president from members of congress after submittal of the 123 agreement to the congress show continued linkage betw een russias policies towards iran and support for b ilateral civilian nuclear accord some argue that maximum leverage has already been gained in coaxing russian behavior on iran in exchange for the signing of 123 agreement and that there will be opportunities in the future to exercise further leverage if necessary since each transaction under 123 agreement must be approved subsequently25 supporters may also see the 123 agreement as way to encourage russia to continue pressing iran on such issues as the bushehr reactors fuel provisions some argue that engaging russia on the scientific level would improve transparency and could pr ovide deterrent to russian technical cooperation with iran possibl consequences of congress disapproving the agreement could be russia pulling back from cooperation with the united states on iran policy and nonproliferation goals such as decreased transp arency at nuclear sites rejection of the agreement might affect the willingness of russia to enter into future bilateral agreements such as future heuleu blenddown agreement
