6810c09 class viii tape 13 ethics and case supervision well this is what number lecture thirteen ah and the date nine oct ad 18 i would like to put warning on the tape he said in sepulchral voice thats great word sepulchral you ever hear that word it means from sepulchre tomb on this cheerful note we begin this lecture that if you have something in affluence you apply the affluence formula if you have something in power you apply the power formula if you have something in emergency you apply the emergency formula and if you dont do this you fall on your heads it just happens to be in the general nature of things that you fall on your silly ead now i have seen division go into affluence be assigned affluence and then slack off and change everything and its fall is so free fall that it is practically rocket assist it goes down the conditions with velocity the like of which you never saw it is the most fantastic phenomena youve ever cared to see in your life there are two things you can do with regard to formulas and conditions two things one is to assign the wrong condition well hes been good to us so were gonna assign pete power and pete hell he couldnt make emergency if he had one of these firemans step ladders so we assign pete power now the law there and its an operating law is that he will drop one condition below the condition he is actually in let us say he is really in nonexistence but some manager some secretary some executive secretary wants to be good fellow or gets into propitiation or something see so they give oscarvitch condition of affluence cause they want to increase his pay or something you know they dont really know what the hell hes doing hes been sort of wandering around stumbling on his head hes really in nonexistence he doesnt even come to work but hes an awfully good fellow an awfully good fellow holds his liquor free and easy with his girlfriends something something hes really in nonexistence all you have to do is to assign him wrong upper condition and he promptly drops one below where he actually is hes in nonexistence really we assign him affluence he goes into liability he now is operating in liability in actual fact you will now find out he is operating in liability very remarkable let us take the affluence formula on just one point and apply it to nation one point economize the funny thing about affluence is is if you dont economize youve had it you get in sudden influx of this that and the other thing its usually lot of and the tendency is and the reason why people fall on their heads when they go into affluence is they suddenly spend it all and interrupt the operation by which they got it in or by which they made it see and at that moment whatever actual condition they are in will lower one condition so we apply economy to firm which at best in danger condition firm is really in danger condition so we start economizing thats part of the affluence formula the firm will at once go into nonexistence let us say government is in danger condition its in danger condition because the head of the government has to bypass all of his ministers to get anything done he has to bypass all of his ministers or is bypassing all of his ministers he isnt really applying the danger formula but hes certainly bypassing in all directions frantically trying to get something done and so he enjoins economy he says hes not going to change any of his ministries he says hes going to stand by his friends that hes bypassing like mad he says our program must go on to victory while its already falling on its stupid head you can expect that government not only to go into nonexistence but that country to pass into other hands not other political hands but other racial hands it works it is true now the reverse occurs the reverse occurs but its just under the same formula guy is actually in emergency and you put him in liability and hell go into danger condition if the formulas of the wrong condition are then enforced he might even drop one or two more down below where he is and he might actually arrive in liability do you follow because the longer the wrong condition is perpetuated the more it drops it certainly drops one but now if we dont let the condition upgrade if we dont do something about it if the condition is now perpetuated and so on he will drop another condition and another condition and another condition so the assignment of wrong conditions brings about lowering of condition there is way you can assign wrong condition and get an improvement of conditions so therefore you have to know something about the assignment of conditions now even my messenger proper assignment of conditions little bit earlier i had to go out and show messenger how to turn on very complicated switch board that she actually should have been checked out on some time ago and i went around i told her to do it she couldnt do it i went out and did it shed already been little bit slow and draggy for the last hour or so and i said what condition should you assign yourself and she thought it over very carefully and she said quite accurately danger condition i had had to bypass her to do the job now if my messengers know this and they are very young indeed this life of course the one thing they do find out about in the sea org is conditions they find that out very accurately but actually they often err in the direction of more severe condition than it warrants and youll actually pull it down one from the condition it is in so anyway if my messengers know it why you educated cats had certainly better grab the brass rang if youre assigned wrong condition you are grossly flagrantly illegally in error you will have accepted an illegal order and you could be commeved for it ill show you how bad it is somebody assigns you condition of liability you accept the condition of liability you become liability if youre not in liability somebody assigns you condition of liability you do not at once ask for an ethics hearing you at that moment could be commeved for accepting an illegal order let us say you were only in emergency and somebody assigns you liability and you do not now ask for an ethics hearing for correction of condition and prepare your brief and show exactly what youre doing exactly where you really are you now are liability because you have assisted in the destruction of the ethics system and you could be commeved for it because its an illegal order you go around tamely accepting conditions which are incorrectly assigned without then asking for an ethics hearing to correct the condition you then could be commeved yeah but how about the fellow who assigned the condition naturally its his fault hes cause his fault his fault his fault im afraid not maybe it seemed that thats the way it was he wasnt in possession of all the facts hes trying to get the job done something of that sort yes he could be called into it but once you start commeving people for assigning conditions the whole justice system blows up the responsibility is on the receiver of the condition now if you dont get that enforced in orgs and if you dont get that enforced amongst auditors ill give you an idea youre cs youre top dog on the totem pole in your area as class viii so somebody goofs the floof but good you assign him condition of emergency he just practically destroyed pc he didnt do your cs hes been going around saying to the other auditors nya nya nya and all those directions i get when i nya nya nya and you assign him condition of emergency and he actually is in doubt you assign him emergency because you want to be good fellow hes actually in doubt hell become an enemy its the wildest mechanism you ever saw in your life hell drop one hell drop one below the actual condition assigned now reversely this character makes small mistake on his administrative form as he hands it in he displaces couple of commas hes assigned condition of enemy he doesnt at that moment ask for an ethics hearing you commev him for accepting an illegal assignment of condition do you follow now you wont be the one probably who assigns him enemy somebody else assigns him enemy he doesnt protest youre the top dog on the totem pole you sea misapplication of ethics commev him for accepting wrong ethics condition and people are liable to get the word do you see he says my gods life is really tough already been assigned enemy and now im going to be commeved for accepting the order lets see let figure this out now oh if you accept condition why you get commeved i get lt yeah well brother if hes that stupid he is an enemy laughter but what you want to do in an ethics hearing an ethics hearing isnt just the guy appears and fluf you do an ethics hearing by the book an ethics hearing in this particular instance must be an actual assessment of what the guy actually is doing so as to establish the actual condition that he is in now you can have somebody chaplains very often mess up the lines in an effort to cheer up things and keep people from falling off the org board they sometimes ask for an upgrade of conditions which should be down graded somebody assigns this person condition of nonexistence and this person gets very upset this person has just goofed the floof across the boards hes guilty of moprey and doprey on the high seas he actually overworked about sixteen seniors and busted up lot of stuff in the bargain he was only assigned nonexistence its obviously wrong condition so he nya nya nya nya nya then somebody comes along and they say look he is nattering so the best thing to do is assign him emergency now he really goofs the floof now hell go around the bend correct assignment in this particular instance was liability now supposing the fellow did all this and then lied about it and made it impossible for anybody to find it out man his effort of getting the show on the road is so dim and so thin that he obviously is in doubt in the first place person who lies to you doubts your perspicuity perspicuitv is smart word for awareness he must think youre stupid some people are so stupid that they can lie about such thing that is so obvious and you have to safeguard yourself against false auditors report but let us say that the person looked like he submitted false report and you assigned him liability or something like this and he actually had not submitted false report and he knows this and he accepts the condition he can now be comm eved for having accepted condition for false report when none existed because he will now go around and natter and splatter and so forth so as it appears on the surface you assign the condition as it looks if the condition is wrong the condition should be protested to the degree of asking for an ethics hearing if the condition is wrong and ethics hearlng is asked for you should commev the guy because sometimes this mechanism occurs you say this was false auditing report therefore im assigning you liability or something out in an org it would be more germane and the guy accepts it and he goes around in apathy he didnt come in and tell you hey hey hey thats not false report thats correct report hes now doubly loused up your lines there are instances of fellows under duress and accused of murder who then just out of savageness and protest fully admit to the whole murder get themselves hanged just to make somebody good and wrong this mechanism exists now you in csing will have to assign some conditions sooner or later if you do not assign conditions the whirlwind will catch up with you you can sit there like good little fellow and do your job jolly jolly jolly and stay friends with everybody good arc good arc good arc and all of sudden find world of hate dumped on your head its the most remarkable phenomenon you ever heard of cause youre just perpetually assigning the wrong condition you think this auditors friend of yours who doesnt even bother to study his trs to point where he chops the living screaming god out of pc turns you in false auditing report sells everybody on the idea of how you stink as cs because he goes around and says he followed your cs exactly and look what happened you let something like that exist and every bit of good that you can do in the fieid will be destroyed its alrignt to be in full arc and little friends little brother to all the wild its ok until it gets in your road until it gets in your road you operate not on the formula of the greatest good for and him you better stop operating in this narrow restricted area and start operating in the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics and then youll win do you know that you can be looked upon with contempt if you fail to get ethics in in your area when everything is going wrong people begin to think something is wrong with you they begin to think theres youve got something to hide they wonder what people have got on you one time there was neglected area i hadnt paid any attention to it at all i knew if anything blew up in the area i had lot of things to do and i knew if anything blew up in this particular area i could handle it anyhow and i wasnt paying any attention to it i had hundred and fifty items on the plate at the moment and apparently somebody in that area got away with moider and they were getting away with murder and some other people noticed they were getting away with murder and i wasnt paying any attention to this area at all and all of sudden somebody wrote very circuitous covert note does so and so have something on you they thought this individual must be under some special protection they didnt notice that the individual was so far removed from my post as not to be noticed but thats the sort of thing thatll develop people begin to wonder they know very often more about the actions of people than you do they know that josey ann has just got through goofing the floof they have continued to watch josey anns pcs stumble out of the auditing room and fall on their faces and be carried off in stretchers to the local hospital and you all of sudden assign josey ann and condition of power on the basis of bunch of false auditing reports and not even the examiner dared go against josey ann because they figured josey ann had something on you weird weird situations can occur this is an aberrated planet and aberrated things happen so therefore the ethics presence of class viii and the ethics presence of case supervisor must be beyond reproach must be accurately carried forward and must be established now as you first establish an ethics presence you establish it hard after while you can be careless about it but you have to establish an ethics presence hard otherwise youre just gonna be wrapped around telegraph pole youre gonna be worked to death cases are gonna start falling on their heads you dont know whether youre going or coming you say whats going wrong whats going wrong well you must better look back to about seven or eight days ago when they carted that pc off to the local horse piddle and you didnt assign that auditor enemy auditor submitted you false report the auditor didnt like the person vividly and took that as an opportunity to cut the person to ribbons things like this happen its an aberrated planet and you didnt do anything about it well youre very unlucky if you also didnt find out about it see because whether you found out about it or not has nothing to do with whether or not you will accurately do it so when youre doing cs you mustnt talk to the auditor you mustnt talk to the pc youre actually at the mercy really of false auditing report and youre at the mercy of false examiner if you run into this situation too hard and too bad you establish your examination line on routing form you establish the regular routing the regular examination report but in an organization theyre usually routed directly through to the registrar so you get second registrar report why theyre not going to sign up so then youve got an auditors report an examiners report and registrars report if youre suspicious about it why put it on the back burner just as note over on the side of your desk but youre gonna ask the ethics officer in couple of weeks about this pc ethics records ok right now but in couple of weeks were gonna ask the ethics officer about this person see were not sure seems alright everybody reassures us that its ok but its just something were little doubtful of write his name on piece of paper see ethics officer and put time machine date on it now you could even in an org which is well run send it to time machine with two week date on it so itll fall off the time machine to be sent to the ethics officer in exactly two weeks please give report on josey ann bates sneaky thing to do isnt it josey ann bates up to that moment they have record in the org shes done nothing bad particularly that we can see but it just doesnt seem alright to us and people are reassuring us that this is alright and shes been audited in squirrely fashion and she came from some famous squirrel group were not trying to catch her were trying to catch out tech so we say i dont i dont it doesnt really seem reasonable to that all this is all ok because look shes been back in review here now three times we seem to each time fix it up but somehow or other it doesnt get fixed up and we are applying standard tech according to the auditors report but for some reason or other it doesnt respond in standard fashion now the reason for that is false auditing report now you want an auditor you want auditors in frame of mind that before they will write false report they would lie awake all night shaking with terror you dont want any false reports that you should make very clear do you see the goof might get liability but false auditing report christ knows what youre going to assign for that do you see then you can protect it then you can do your job now im merely talking to you from viewpoint of doing job of work every now and then we see some crime come through the lines now it seems to be very very bad thing to take an auditing report and turn it over to ethics but the funny part of it is is ive caught two or three supervisors and five or six auditors way back which has adequately explained to why there is certain zone or area why it is having hell of time now were putting in lot of management let us say in that zone or area we try to manage that area were trying to manage that area were trying to smooth it out were trying to straighten it out were trying to handle it and so forth well theres another zone and area and that is that its tech is out and somebody keeps its tech pushed out and its tech is very hard out it is very out indeed now let teach you something about tech in relationship to ethics although we say this when admin goes out tech goes out tech goes out ethics has gone out the truth of the matter is there is tech ahead of that ethics so its actually when tech goes out ethics goes it becomes necessary and if it isnt put in then tech goes further out and then admin goes out like screaming crazy so when you find an area or an auditor where admin is thoroughly out you know right up the line from that just one step back of it that tech is out theres something he doesnt know about tech or theres something techwise mucked up on his case or hes doing something weird with tech or he hasnt got the word in some fashion or another and then right ahead of that you know that he has out ethics and then you oddly enough trace it back little bit further and you will find that tech was out see its actually four point cycle not just three it is very true it is very true that when admin is out tech is out when tech is out ethics is out do you understand but it backs up one more tech had to be out in the first place so where tech goes badly out heres another maxim here and its an important rule when tech goes out ethics goes in heavily and hard now i havent said you must put ethics in heavily and hard or that you should or anything im just telling you its phenomenon this is phenomenon like when the sun comes up you can see the mountains see theres more significance to it than that when tech goes out ethics goes in hard so any area where you find ethics going in hard you know tech has already gone out and then if ethics doesnt go in hard why tech wont come in so it goes out further and with tech out then admin goes all to hell its just nothing but false reports and chicken scraps on old rolls of paper you can go into qual find that their filing is bad and all you would have to do their filing is bad they cant seem to find folder you glance at their baskets they seem to be full and unemptied and stuff which is coming in is in the out baskets and so forth all youd have to do is glance at that if you know your hco training and do you know that you could actually at that moment assign the qual sec condition of liability without making very much error you could assign her condition of liability for out tech you see admins visibly out well therefore tech is out so you look just little bit further than that and youll find out that they should have gotten in ethics and they didnt but ethics is out theyre in an out ethics situation already not just lightly and then for all that to have gone to pieces tech had to go out in the first place now when you see ethics going in hard you also know tech has been out and do you know that people will try to solve things with only ethics ethics in ethics in ethics in ethics in ethics in theyre sort of stuck on the time track see ethics in ethics in where the hells the tech now unless tech followed that by going in pointless stupid even you can sort of hold the line somehow with ethics ethics ethics ethics ethics ethics somehow hold the line but eventually it all starts falling to pieces because you havent moved through the cycle youve now go to get tech in sure put the ethics in put it in hard shoot some people hang some bodies to the local church we dont care what but get in the ethics see to hold the situation see cs people standing around you know yak yak yak you know well i audited out the i had lot of bank and ga ta dee dee and they dont do their jobs and they drift off in the nowwow and theres nobody on the sea that its all sort of tumblebumbled and stupid and so forth oh yeah get ethics in youre not going to get tech in unless you get some ethics in you can get it in hard suddenly and shockingly or you can get it in on gradient it doesnt much matter how you get it in but you get ethics in you start assigning some conditions and when things have gone this bad brother it is not condition of emergency it is not condition of emergency because when tech goes out in an area youre liable to have even government flaps in that area thats how thats how bad it is so an organization which has out tech is attracting the lightning right down on the back of scientology boy and you never really have government flaps or anything like this in areas where tech has stayed in because therere too many satisfied people theres too many friends see but when tech slips and it isnt working anymore then it doesnt seem worth while when morale is bad in an organization tech had to go out in the first place if tech is out if its invalidated if it isnt being done rlght if its nonstandardized if its shoved all over the place then you can be absolutely sure that morale will be going out because there is reason for anybody to be there scientology badly applied is nothing to protect and thats why you have to get tech in in hurry and the way you get tech in in hurry when its madly out is you put ethics in hard and follow it straight up with tech then you will find the cycle will go on through and admin follows in afterwards and then you have ethics tech and admin are all in now if you find ethics is having to stiffen up if youre getting more ethics than you would normally predict and if ethics is stiffening up beyond anything that anybody thought was necessary then you know very well that tech has slipped and slipped badly and that the reports that you are getting must be and it follows true it isnt just reasonability it must be that the technical reports you are getting are false reports now you can correct that up in numerous ways you can convene some kind of board of investigation or something and call back fifteen pcs and have them interrogated with regard to this sort of thing what were the results what happened in the sessions and that sort of thing and all of sudden something will come to light youve had tiger walking all over the place these are the situations which you meet these are the situations which you have to handle now lot of auditors trained on this course will find that they are going back to become the lonely only the smart thing to do is to remain lonely only for as brief time as possible an organization which does not invest its money in getting an adequate number of fully trained class vis is gonna fall on its head technically and then when class viiis find themselves in lonely only its alright to play god by all means its pleasant but shove somebody else along to become class viii because its very lonely business being god he is the most lonesome fellow you ever heard of now you try to hold the fort on your lonely only all by your little lonesome or with just maybe one other or two other viiis in the great swarming organization which is very busy and people tearing in and out of the place and people with their little antlike two cent opinions based on data that is so cheap as to not be comparable to any coin on the planet including milroy which i dont think would buy one corner of one cigarette paper their opinions arent worth shucks tech goes out and you stand there flat footed and let tech go out and let tell you youre gonna have more trouble than you can cope with with regiment of marines tech goes out all of sudden ethics starts going in when ethics starts going in hard it very often goes in incorrectly the next thing you know tech if not put in right at that time why surfeit of ethics tends to start carrying the organization down instead of bringing it back up so your steps and actions if the organization is in turmoil if the administration is bad if people are not doing what theyre supposed to be doing if its all sort of mucky and muckedup and you hear people around and theyre going nya nya nya nya nya nya and nya nya nya nya nya nya well just dont order everybody to be sec checked to hell with that but all that it is is that tech is out tech is out man how to get it in thats your problem how do you get it in the solution is put in ethics like ton of bricks and then follow right along behind it with good standard tech and put it in hard and what do you know the ethics come right off of it ethics will not lift itself out all ethics will do is hold the fort while youre getting tech in if you dont hold the fort at all you wont get any tech in i can tell you that by experience oh you can be charming you can be persuasive you can give them talks you can do everything you want to but you have to hold their hands while theyre auditing the pc and you aint gonna get there because the environment is inadequately filled with challenge man thrives on challenge one of the reasons why its dangerous to have an ao in california climate the only challenge in it is smog slur on california im very fond of california but the net result of this is im trying to teach you lesson which is just as standard as standard tech its how do you apply the technology which youve got to the area in which you gonna operate you gonna walk home everybodys gonna be very glad to see you gonna put you on pedestal youre great guy you know your stuff you graduated and so on youre class viii great theyre gonna agree with everything you say next thing youre gonna hear is invitations to squirrel well bessy ann yes what about her case you know we could have her in specially and you can audit her and weve never been able to crack her case you know weve done all the usual things you know youre gonna tell us now that its solved by the usual things weve tried all those weve done all those and cant we get in bessy ann we can get lot of money if you can audit her and weve advertised every place that youre going to audit specially for us ummm in fact we had one psychotic pc whose brother owns the steel mill see and weve got that all lined up for you well how do you extricate yourself from such traps and get the show on the road well you will assume unto yourself some ethics presence of some kind or another now the wrong way to assume it is to give them try to teach them class viii course in the next five minutes after arrival or to impress them with what you now know they know you know it anyhow you dont have to tell em what you have to do is an ethics presence so you have to point out to the people in your immediate vicinity if ethics is out in the area that ethics is out and that ethics has to be put in so that you can help put tech in and you do the maximum you can in order to do so now some ec that is very enthusiastic about making some bucks but not enthusiastic about running any standard tech which they may consider waste of time or something of this sort may louse it up little bit but thats job endangerment chit because you as class viii are being counted on to get tech in in your area so its job endangerment isnt it so therefore youre gonna have the terrible problem of the ec will figure that you are now above them the executive council figures you are now above them so therefore you ought to be stepped on put you in your place youre even liable to get in condition where you get whole long series of ethics conditions assigned to you because you put up small argument on the subject that you wouldnt process the brother of the steel mill the way you solve that the way you solve that is to insist that ethics goes in and goes in correctly because class viii has to know great deal about ethics you have to insist that ethics goes in and you say ethics is necessary to go in so that we can get tech in and then were going to go get tech in now right now i see that when pcs report for sessions the auditors are seldom there they wander in half an hour from now or dont appear at all or something well thatch an immediate and automatic condition of nonexistence with conditions enforced guy isnt there nonexistence somebodys going to start arguing with you about this well let call to your attention that all the sea org is interested in and all theyre interested in is getting tech in on the planet now it may sound like were trying to get ethics in but thats inevitable were trying to get tech in on the planet were trying to audit out the fourth dynamic engram and furnish an environment in which it can be done and that is the general overall objective of the sea org were trying to furnish an environment in which the forth dynamic engram may be audited out and naturally we have to make sure that is also gets audited otherwise there would be point in putting any ethics in there is point in slaughtering all the people in armenia under the heading that we were putting ethics in in armenia ethics all by itself is pointless all mans justice is pointless really pointless modern justice is laugh just look at the number of times somebody returns to the penitentiary guy gets two years for stealing car he comes out at the end of two years within four hours hes stolen car so he goes back in for three years he comes out at the end of three years he walks out and he steals car and then he goes in for ten years and at the end of that time why he walks out and he steals car i mean this is this is not an uncommon record as matter of fact its so bad that its as much as your lifes worth apparently to arrest bank robber his friends just simply get him out of jail at once by force its really really quite remarkable but all it is is pointless punishment in 1835 i think in philadelphia they adopted what is currently passing for justice punishment and penal system and they found out that although there were many systems of punishment involved they found this out by careful observation one that was used in philadelphia where the fellow was put in little cell with bars was the least workable and had the most returns and that is the one that has been used ever since the modern penitentiary system is found to be the least workable in the rehabilitation of the criminal now the cop should be charged with public safety the chief of police is obviously responsible for public safety ten percent of the people cause ninety percent of the accidents there is action ever taken to make sure that those ten percent dont drive or are fixed up as matter of fact every time you try to put in the program it gets fought its just as though people want to see people smashed yet its criminal action killing people on the highways thats manslaughter and yet nobody takes any real efforts they want to slow everybody down well if you slow all the cars down you put more cars on the road per hour and if all cars are slowed down then your traffic is so jammed that nobody can drive in it it isnt really speed that causes accidents some accidents are caused by speed but youll find out that somebody speeding normally had to speed around the dear old soul who was driving down the exact middle of the highway so as not to run off either side at fifteen miles an hour so public safety robbery burglary sudden death and so on is the business of the chief of police of an area or the superintendent thats his business he doesnt even know its his job its not phrased in his textbook his primary purpose is public safety he thinks your replying to the fact that little automobiles and bicycles ought to be patrolled more closely safety to him is automobile traffic or safety to him is something else so they arrest luke the glook and they send him across the river because the judge got his defense got psychiatrist or something to say he was insane they send him across there he gets checked out as being perfectly ok and released the following day its common practice in washington dc standard practice somebodys caught robbing bank or something like that he goes across the river to saint elizabeth and they release him the next day pleads insanity sometimes they spend two or three months around saint elizabeth but thats about all most remarkable proceeding you ever saw talk about reward of down stat if the guy can prove hes loony why hes not guilty well this kind of drives the chief of police around the bend but he doesnt he doesnt really object to this so they take this guy and they throw him into the court and very usual procedure and they give him couple of years or something like that and then he goes over and hes released on parole back on the public unrehabilitated in any way shape or form to do the same thing that he did before just eight months afterwards and then after he does it again why they pick him up if they find him and they put him in the court again and then they put him in the penitentiary system they know everybody knows didnt ever work and then hes back on the public again and so forth you get the idea this is the cycle by which all this occurs this is public safety that is justice for its own sake not to get anything done let us take putting in justice in provence in france ill let us say 1550 robbery murder sudden death is occurring in the provence somebody rides in on the place starts picking up all these marauders and bandits and that sort of thing hanging few of them pushing few of them into some other zone or area telling them to be good and it all quiets down now lets look just give you an odd example that was one of the ways this sort of thing was handled in medieval times lot but whats the purpose there was purpose then the purpose was so that the peasants and middle class and aristocracy of the provence could produce in peace and have the results of their production and possession of their land and live lives which werent suddenly being interrupted by spear or arrow there was point point see there was point you calmed it down sos people could get on with it and that was clearly thought in 1550 that was very clear think there wasnt any fumblebumble about it nobody had dim idea of it marauders operating in an area reduced the production and fixed it up so the citizens and people of that area could not lead normal lives and they couldnt get on with it and there was production and it all went to hell in balloon so it was necessary to put law and order in on the area so that it would calm down and things could get straightened up and people who had right to live decent lives could go on and live decent lives and there was question about it has nothing to do with modern justice you may think that think still occurs but it doesnt justice is put in for its own sake hasnt anything to do with public safety so they arrest all the criminals in the town and throw them in jail but in sort of sequence so at any given time there are so many criminals in the population and then they put them in jail for while and release them back in to the population to take the place of the criminals whove just been arrested and taken out of circulation any time some group starts rioting or causing civil disorder tearing shops apart or something like that why you give them more money give them more votes anybody who was trying to keep the peace in 1550 if he were to look at the year 1968 hed be kind of popeyed because for quite while anybody who tried to stop riot was arrested most remarkable situation you ever heard of all you had to do was try to stop riot if you were cop and you went out and tried to stop the riot why you got thrown in the clink by the federal government now im not advocating desperate law and order or anything of the sort but its all pointless why is there anybody there trying to do anything anyhow because the riots are just increasing and nobody goes in and picks up the people who were starting the riots so nobody gets to the basis of the civil engram which is bringing the riot of which the riot is simply symptom nobody really gets to the basis of it all they do is start rewarding down stats and chopping the police up and all kinds of weird wild things but there isnt any point in even doing anything about it nobody has any point in doing anything about it do you understand justice gets bad name only when it itself is pointless and in scientology justice is pointless ethics is pointless if it does not bring in standard tech completely pointless there isnt any reason for it why ever assign condition to hell with it let them go out and lie in the gutter if you werent going to follow it in with standard tech what the hell why assign any condition at all so what youve got to look at here is how do you get standard tech in well one you have to know it there has to be such thing and somebody has to know there is such thing and he has to be able to demonstrate that that thing is beneficial and is something that should be preserved that sounds terribly elementary but youd be surprised at the number of people that are walking around in some airyfairy cloud that dont know that and then he has to hold the fort long enough to get it in and rightly or wrongly the only test of which is i still seem to keep the show on the road century after century i always hit an ethics area that is an outethics area hard until i can get those elements straightened up which made it mess and thats gone on for very long time it hit an area in asia minor something like this like ton of bricks bongo until i could get it into production until i could get it situated calmed down divided up get an economy forwarded get things straightened out holding that ethics in hard boy holding justice in hard hold it in hard all somebody had to do was sneeze and that would be that see hold it in hard this is the way were going this is the edges there we get this is what were supposed to be doing this is squared up and then pretty soon theres enough production enough abundance enough this enough that you start easing it off easing it off easing it off you one have to know that you have to put it in hard to begin with and two you have to know when to ease it up and you ease it up to the degree that the technology that youre trying to import into the area is functioning simple you ease it up to the degree that the technology youre trying to put in is functioning it is an exact measurement for instance im trying to build up ill give you it goes along with other types of economy trying to build up port in asia minor see got nobody but few squads of troops dough nothing could build it right up to the stars just put in ethics justice hard into the area move it up say this is where were going get the agreement of people to go in that particular direction build it up holding that in hard not letting it be knocked over and every time youve got sheaf of wheat up not letting some bunch of bandits come in and grab it square it up square it up push it ahead but all the time there was technology moving in on the area true the technology of the arts and human arts but technology was moving in and the technology would build up people would learn what is was keep carrying it forward ethics and then as they started learning this and so forth ease off id know the job was done when troops were bored to death i like to see an ethics officer down to such point that he searches over the entire area pitifully turning over match in his hand which was dropped in the hall as the only crime he can discover anyplace along about that time why the conditions are upgraded that is to say you dont suddenly start upgrading everybody but the condition you are assigning is lighter that is the proper condition for that time so there is another rule it requires bit of judgement it is the worse off things are the harder condition is assigned for the same crime you dont always have uniform code of justice when youre going in there as case supervisor for the first time and somebody says pc felt wonderful floating needle all through the session so i didnt do it and when the pc got to the examiner with the needle stuck tight and the ta at four and half there is something very wrong here now if you start to involve yourself with what is wrong there at that stage of the game youre going to be so youre going to be rewarding down stat youre going to be training somebody who is really gonna goof the floof you dont bother to tell him you dont even bother to tell him whats wrong and you say false report youre in doubt bong ah ah you cant do that to oh not only cant do that to you if you insist on something else why we might really come to blows here over this thing the essence of the situation is that ethics is out all over the place because tech has been long out so the only excuse you have to use ethics at all is to get tech in so it becomes hell of crime the examiner talks to the person as hes examined its noncompliance with orders liability for the examiner just like that arguments about it and the examiners hes been on post for long time he knows his business and pcs come in well how you doing well i didnt think very much of that auditor anyhow id see well get on the cans nere i dont suppose youre very bad off because i hope youre ok you seem to be alive lets see now you had what at your state of the case well what do you know well he went in liability and he did it the next day and he went into doubt and he did it the next day and he went into enemy just like that all of sudden you are liable to have qualms you say now look if im insisting that conditions of this character are assigned with this violence the whole organization is going to fall to pieces people are going to say i came back suppressive ive everything is wrong and the whole staff will quit and this naturally its all going to fall apart and weve only got six staff now and let tell you by long experience thats the wrong line of think the only reason you have small staffs is because ethics is out tech has gone out ethics is out and the only way you can actually increase the numbers of staff you have is to put ethics in hard you say well christ people wont have anything to do with you if you do that boy that is civilian think to end it all do you know the one organization which never has any trouble recruiting is an army but theres hell of lot of manufacturers patting people on the head that cant get anybody to work for em thats interesting isnt it an individual feels safe in harshly disciplined environment you forget that guy wandering around out there someplace is being shot down in flames by people in his immediate vicinity who are making mistakes and goofing up loading their hats onto him and so on if you look at everything from your own viewpoint only you will not notice that guys who do not have your altitude who do not have your ability do not have your command of technology are really getting kicked in the stomach they are much more kicked in the stomach by the loafer the bum the natterer the guy who doesnt do his job than they will ever be kicked in the stomach by ethics and they dont dont feel safe in an environment where ethics is out it outrages them it outrages the principles and reasons theyre there and when ethics is out in an area bad staff stays and good staff leaves and when ethics goes into an environment hard you will find that good staff stays and bad staff leaves its just as inevitable as anything we just got through sending sea org officer to an organization to take over as something the organization had never had before you say we dont have any right to do this actually weve got right to do anything we please as long as it goes in the direction of trying to straighten something out because that organization threatens the whole economy of an area they over spent themselves and they messed it up and its going to really take some doing to put it back together again sea org officer walked in started shooting people down in flames and instantly they had three or four blows immediately the rest of the staff united very strongly the whole organization i think was put in nonexistence they started working all day and all night to catch up all their backlogs and now weve found out that the three or four people who blew were apparently getting rake offs from merchants in the vicinity and were putting it in their pockets in other words the organization had gone crooked financially well when the tough guy arrived the good guys stayed and the bad guys blew now let tell you had we sent member of the bideahee goodwill society all the good guy would have blown and the bad guys would have stayed because they could have kidded her see do you get this these are sound hard principles these are facts these have to do with homo sapiens these have to do with beings these have to do with planets people do not feel safe in outethics areas right now the people of the united states at this particular time and period do not feel safe because riots are liable to spring up at any time any place shop keeper cant call his soul his own because anybody apparently has right to walk in smash the windows and say im rioter and this is all because i dont have zilch therefore i can break your window and everything and some cop tries to arrest him the cop is immediately thrown in prison for interfering with civil rights what the hell do you think what the hell do you think is gonna happen to that economy we speak of technology as an economy what do you thinks gonna happen to it its gonna go broke thats whats gonna happen to it its moneys going to devaluate and be worth less and less its productions going to be less and less valuable security is going to be less and less and people will be less and less happy to be part of that country now one of the unstabilizing things in countries today is the definition of sovereign power you dont think that has very much to do with scientology it has great deal to do with it because the international law definition of sovereign power is as follows that government which can protect the lands and people from foreign aggression is by fact and definition the sovereign power of that area what did the atom bomb do there isnt government on earth can protect its lands or its people from foreign aggression all some slaphappy nut has to do in any part of the world today with i dont know how many countries have atom bombs flop an atom bomb at any country in the world and there is goes booms and therefore what does that mean that means that the goverrments of nations today cannot protect their government cannot protect their people cannot protect their land from foreian attack because there is defense against that weapon they know this theyre unstabilized theyre dispersed and they know they are fakes they know theyre fakes they know they cant protect the land and people so therefore theyre just sort of tax hungry bums theyre sort of marauders like locusts so they dont get in ethics because they think of their technology as something that is dwindling something that is going something thats losing while you are moving in as vital new thrust of life your technology is not solidly moved into the community your technology is not solidly moved into the nations of the world at this particular speaking funny part of it is i notice in ads and other places that theyre beginning to use scientology phraseology and scientology think more and more this is always flatter this always flatters it theyve sort of heard on it on the undercurrent they sort of think in those terms more and more simply preparing the way vital philosophy is always preceded by gradual change in the area it is being introduced into the area starts picking up its phraseology starts picking up its technology starts getting expressed in the arts long before the people have even heard of it but this is vital new wave its vital new wave justice for the old orders become pointless why should they get in justice why should they even arrest anybody and throw them in jail theyre just going to let him out again and if they do arrest the guy why it isnt going to improve production any because there is thats gone were looking at dying scene it doesnt realize how fast it is dying we belong to new world and as we move forward we have our own ways of handling things and the think that goes along with it is that as long as any area which we control we can keep tech precisely practiced in that area and not squirrelled in any way as long as we can keep that morale will stay up ethics will be relatively light prosperity will be considerable and everything will go along great but when that breaks down we have to put ethics in to the degree that we have to put it back together again but now as we approach new area where our technology is not in at all ethics of course has to go in very hard cause our tech is so out as to be in condition of nonexistence in that area and right now were really suffering from the fact that we havent taken full responsibility for all mental treatment all psycho somatic treatment on the entire planet were actually shrinking away from our responsibility to that degree and were paying for it its inevitable then that area in which you will not take responsibility that area in which you will not take responsibility is going to kick you in the teeth bud to be philosophic about it but therefore as you move in as you move forward youre moving into areas where tech is out books things like that wouid precede your actual contact and youll find out people have picked up these books theyve squirrelled theyve done this theyve crossadvised theyve messed it up the cycle has been very very rugged and ragged and so forth to the degree then that the ideas that lot of squirrels would have arisen and people mucked up and youll be running into guys who are running engrams backwards and upside down see and the areas getting muddied up all the time right ahead of you your areas muddied up so actually its followed with wave of ethics and you say well the public is really staying away from an organization it works the same way with the public it works with the staff if you want all the lousy public in the world let ethics go out all the good publicll stay away from you if you want good public to move in put ethics in the bad publicll stay away and the good publicll come in this is hard thing to learn but you can eventually get reality on it and it goes hand in glove with what youre trying to do i know very well that people to whom i am talking now and in the future will be facing time and time again being lonely only having rough time of it being argued with about this that and the other thing the type of arguments you get into are so nonsensical as to be unbelievable you know its well how do you explain how do you explain the fact there are more and more people there are more and more people on the planet where are all the spirits coming from ba explain that now explain that we got you there i guess anderson qc melbourne inquiry complete gibbering psychotic idiot up to the gills with r6 that was exactly i think what he said you think i was just gagging it up huh scientology must be wrong because we cannot explain where all the new bodies come from all the new spirits where would all the new spirits come from if everybody had spirit why where would all the new spirits come from huh actually what he didnt realize this silly ass he was disproving catholicism catholicism claims theres one spirit per body so he was asking some silly little kid question that is asked of his own religion catholicism and yet he was busy hanging scientology because it couldnt you get the irrationality of it the man occupies perfectly valid position hes looked on hes queens consulate actually hes just gibbering idiot you probably couldnt even catch him to get straight jacket on him birds like that the society in which you operate its awarding down stats its got false ideas things run backwards and upside down and somehow or other you have to maintain your own level of truth now you will not show the wear and tear to the degree that you put in ethics and to the degree that you fail to put in ethics youre going to show the wear and tear of it that i can assure you now you notice the class viii course is taught in aos and is taught by the sea org and the reason for that is it is an ultimate in stabilizing technology it is maybe not the last course that will ever be taught on the subject but it certainly is an ultimate to this degree it is standardization standardization standardization of approach standardization of application and standardization of result and they all can go together which is quite trick quite trick standardization of auditing and auditors there cant be any fire fights and arguments it also happens that it is the right way to do it it also happens there isnt any other right way to do it some famous philosopher said there are two ways to do everything and then didnt add the psychotic and the correct so i sympathize with anybody going to north canyon station which only has in it anyhow scientology population of fifteen because his tendencies will be because he is so weak to do things so weakly when there are not many of you youve got to be ten times as tough youve got to be ten times as strong and you would find out that your area and zone would move up and gather in strength and volume to the degree that you insisted on standard tech this is quite true these are lessons which are not based on my opinions but are lessons learned across the last eighteen years of trying to relay technology it is interesting that in those eighteen years in the practice and application of the technology itself it has been relatively simple all the way along the line what has made it complex is one there was language with which to communicate it and two people seemed to add to it faster than you could keep it stripped down now to give you some idea of how tech goes out in your area you yourself at this stage of the game undoubtedly have reality on it but maybe at some later time reality will exist on it you knew you had tr 1 you had tr 1 down sometime way in the past you had it that was the way it was somebody came along and he flunked you for it or somebody said that wasnt the way you did it somebody said that was the way you did it long time ago but that isnt the way we do it now something happened that knocked out your tr 1 so you had it once and now somebody cross questions it invalidates it it goes by the boards and you somehow or other got to reacquire it again somewhere up the line well youre reacquiring it fully at viii now one of the ways that is happens is in the research line two data are stated at different periods of research which seem to be in conflict the earlier data happens to be correct the second data is there because somebody remimeographed and misspelled the bulletin so somebody comes along and says the second datum is correct they interpret the material the material since time immemorial has needed interpretation just recently in trying to teach some materials i found this astonishing fact that i was trying to tell people it was the simple basics the very simple basics that made the auditor but the trouble with auditing is it was too simple and their grasp of the subject was difficult because they thought they were trying to grasp lot more than they were trying to grasp and it was trying to grasp this simple thing and grasp that simply and continuously and ill be of gun if the zone and area of trying to apply this didnt say dont pay any attention to basics what you want to study is the upper theory of the thing class viii auditor should be model of simplicity he should have grip on the simple things of life he should know what he knows he should know and see those things occur so that there is difficulty with his head or somebody elses but this sort of thing can happen this sort of thing can happen it would amuse you very much that few weeks ago i was doing case supervision on folder and i looked at the commands that were given and the reasonability and the reason for these commands and in reading the explanation of it all and the folder i got sufficiently confused that i sent for the original bulletin and got it in just to restabilize the situation it was really violent outness but it was an insidious outness do you follow it might possibly at one time or another have sounded reasonable and it might at some time or another have been worded that way so i sent out for the original bulletin to find out if it ever had been worded that way it never had been worded that way in other words even my data at this particular point could be so persuaded so persuaded that i wanted to look it up and its almost unbelievable that i would look anything up because the data which you use are so well known to that it strains my reality to have to tell them to you and every once in while ill forget perhaps to tell you something because i would never dream you didnt know it see i have to think its pretty difficult sometimes to undercut it all the way now lets see what dont they know what couldnt they possibly know very often i have to really dream up production trying to imagine what to get down to now it strikes i remember the first time this ever happened to it didnt happen to guy was watching tv demonstration and he came in and he was absolutely starryeyed and he says i just found something that you do that none of the rest of us do in auditing you acknowledge and it never i never would have dreamed of telling anybody they had to acknowledge it was just so far beyond my reality that anybody would have to be told dont you see so i have little bit of hard time scaling it its not that im trying to undercut it or talk down to anybody it requires real skill and real ability to be totally simple that is the test if you want to get commentary on this read professor snorgborgs or smorgasborg i think his name is dissertation on the implausibility of electronic theory the book is eight thousand six hundred and fifty five pages its in several sets and it wont surprise you that he died because he didnt know how to push his doorbell and get in out of the cold but boy it sure was complex so you want to refer people that have complex things you say well why dont you read professor smorgasbords dissertation on the basic theory and reinterpretation of scientology theory its very famous book and send them down to the library to look for it if theyve bothered you too much and keep insisting that it is in the library and it at least keeps them out of your hair possibly for some years but to be basically totally simple you have to be terribly terribly direct terribly direct now the net result of all of this is is with terrific simplicity you are trying to get forward very simple fantastically workable technology the routine by which you get it in is also very simple morale goes out and effectiveness and efficiency and administration goes out to the degree that the tech itself goes out to get the tech back in or to get it in in the first place you have to apply very straight direct ethics this is followed through by putting in tech you ease up the ethics to the degree that you get tech practiced in standard fashion do i make my point and that is actually what it is all about thank you very much
