united states more immediately however the doha results provide framework for the congressional debate on trade policy that is taking place in the context of congressional consideration of legislation authorizing presidential trade promotion or fasttrack authority for the united states the greatest success was the adoption of language on agricultural trade the ministerial declaration stated that the members committed to comprehensive negotiations aimed at substantial improvements in market access reductions of with view to phasing out all forms of export subsidies and substantial reductions

electronic commerce and calls on members to continue the practice of dutyfree treatment for electronic transmissions until the fifth ministerial however negotiations on the market access issues of transparency in government procurement and of trade facilitation which the united states wanted on the agenda were postponed until at least the fifth ministerial as were the other two socalled singapore issues of investment and competition policy major work on the topic of the environment also was postponed the united states was unsuccessful in keeping out language on antidumping the ministerial declaration states that members agree to negotiations aimed at clarifying and improving disciplines under the antidumping and subsidies agreements one controversial issue that is absent from the work program for the next round is labor rights and trade although the issue is mentioned in the preamble of the doha declaration the results of the doha ministerial have already touched off heated debate within the 107th congress that will likely continue as the congress considers legislation to provide for presidential trade promotion or fasttrack negotiating authority the doha agenda could play role in shaping that legislation members of congress will be weighing that agenda against variety of national regional and local economic interests and concerns

conference in the context of us objectives overview of the doha ministerial and results background trade ministers from member countries of the wto must meet at least every two years according to the agreement that established the wto these meetings called ministerial conferences are the highest level of decisionmaking in the wto since the wto was established 1995 there have been four ministerial conferences the most important decision facing the trade ministers in doha was whether they could reach agreement on launching new round of multilateral trade negotiations negotiations had already been underway on trade in agriculture and trade in services as required under the last comprehensive round of multilateral trade negotiations the uruguay round 19861994 some countries including the united states wanted to expand the agriculture and services talks to allow discussions on other areas and thus achieve greater trade liberalization through potential tradeoffshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs2 1this section uses background information provided by senior us trade officials and found at the us department of state international information programs web site at httpusinfostategovproductswashfileeconshtmltrade ministers ended the 1999 ministerial conference in seattle without agreeing to launch new round among the reasons were the inability of the united states and the european union eu to agree on agricultural rules discontent by developing countries with the proposed agenda working document that many believed had not been sufficiently prepared and an apparent lack of commitment by members to make the difficult decisions necessary for an agreement following the seattle ministerial it was agreed that wto officials would consult with member countries and discuss ways to bridge remaining differences many countries did not want to repeat the problems of the seattle ministerial wto members considered ways that developing countries concerns might be addressed us and eu trade officials developed closer relationship wto general council chairman stuart harbinson prepared wellreceived draft of ministerial declaration with proposed future work program in second document on implementation issues he addressed complaints by developing countries that they lacked the capacity to implement the uruguay round trade agreements and had not yet realized the expected benefits from those agreements the doha ministerial came at time when economic activity worldwide was slowing and business and consumer confidence was declining these developments doubt were exacerbated by the september 11 terrorist attacks on the united states and continuing terrorist threats to the united states and other countries us goals for the united states the core of the negotiations was market access especially in agricultural trade1 goals were elimination of agricultural export subsidies easing of tariffs and quotas and reductions in other forms of tradedistorting domestic support the united states also wanted expanded services negotiations and the reduction of industrial tariffs us negotiators sought more transparency or openness in government procurement practices they also wanted to improve customs procedures to reduce problems when goods enter another country trade facilitation in order to gain the concessions that they wanted however us trade officials knew that they would have to address other countries concerns for example the eu wanted round to include certain new issues such as investment and competition antitrust policy these issues were not major us goals but the united states recognized their importance to the eu us trade officials also recognized that implementation issues would be important to developing countries the us position on three other issues should also be mentioned major topic at the ministerial regarded the wto agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights trips the issue was the balance between the interests of pharmaceutical companies in developed countries and public health needs inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs3 2the ministerial declaration wtmin01dec1 the declaration on the trips agreement and public health wtmi n01dec2 and the implementation related issues and concerns wtmin01dec17 are available through the wto home page at httpwwwwtoorgdeveloping countries the united states claimed that the current language in trips was flexible enough to address health emergencies but other countries insisted on new language second the united states wanted to address certain environmental issues eg fisheries subsidies but strongly opposed some environmental issues that the eu supported eg the precautionary principle third in the face of almost universal opposition the united states said it would not negotiate on trade remedies especially rules on antidumping results of the ministerial trade ministers adopted three documents at the end of the ministerial conference the ministerial declaration includes preamble and work program for new round and for other future action the declaration on the trips agreement and public health presents political interpretation of the trips agreement document on implementationrelated issues and concerns includes numerous provisions of interest to developing countries2 for the united states the greatest success was the adoption of language on agricultural trade the ministerial declaration states that the members committed to comprehensive negotiations aimed at substantial improvements in market access reductions of with view to phasing out all forms of export subsidies and substantial reductions in tradedistor ting support the eu successfully pushed to have the phrase without prejudging the outcome of the negotiations inserted before the preceding phrase insisting that complete elimination of export subsidies therefore was not necessarily the required outcome the declaration includes other market access issues supported by the united states it reaffirms continuing negotiations on trade in services it also calls for the reduction or elimination of tariffs as well as nontariff barriers for industrial products it directs the general council to report to the fifth ministerial to be held yearend 2003 on the progress of the work program on electronic commerce and calls on members to continue dutyfree treatment for electronic transmissions until the fifth ministerial however negotiations on the market access issues of transparency in government procurement and of trade facilitation which the united states wanted on the agenda were postponed until at least the fifth ministerial as were the other two socalled singapore issues of investment and competition policy which the eu wanted india strongly opposed negotiations on the singapore issues as compromise the ministerial declaration states that further clarification will be undertaken on all four singapore issues and negotiations will take place after the fifth ministerial on the basis of decision to be taken by consensushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs4 major work on the topic of the environment also was postponed the eu had wanted this issue included and it did achieve some of its goals for example trade ministers agreed to negotiations on the relationship between wto rules and trade obligations in multilateral environmental agreements meas and regular information exchange between mea secretariats and relevant wto committees the united states realized some success by having fisheries subsidies included in future negotiations the precautionary principle which was supported by the eu and opposed by the united states was not included in the ministerial declaration under this principle governments could impose trade restrictions and take other measures for public health reasons even though scientific evidence was still incomplete major success for developing countries was the declaration on the trips agreement and public health in this declaration trade ministers affirm that the trips agreement can and should be interpreted and implemente d in manner supportive of wto members right to protect public health and in particular to promote access to medicines for all us officials expressed satisfaction that the trips agreement was not renegotiated but the declaration clearly suggests liberal interpretation of actions that developing countries may take this declaration was reached early in the doha ministerial and most reports say that this early concession to developing countries helped move along the other negotiations the us trade representative ustr was given considerable credit for the strategy the united states was unsuccessful in keeping out language on antidumping the ministerial declaration states that members agree to negotiations aimed at clarifying and improving disciplines under the antidumping and subsidies agreements us officials point out that the ministerial declaration also states that the basic concepts principles and effectiveness of these agreements and their instruments and objectives would be preserved this wording they contend would retain us trade remedy laws some congressional leaders however are highly critical of this concession by us trade negotiators in addition to the trips declaration developing countries realized numerous benefits in the other two documents the ministerial declaration includes for example sections on special and differential treatment technology transfer and capacity building the implementation document includes almost 50 actions to assist developing country members because of the attention to developing countries the actions begun at the ministerial are called the doha development agenda one issue that is absent from the future work program is labor rights the preamble of the doha ministerial declaration states only we reaffirm our declaration made at the singapore ministerial conferen ce regarding internationally recognized core labour standards we take note of work under way in the international labour organization ilo on the social dimension of globalization the singapore ministerial declaration included among other provisions that the ilo was the competent body to set labor standards developing countries were adamantly opposed to including labor standards in new round at the seattle ministerial conference two year earlier president clinton raised the issue of linking labor standards and trade sanctions causing some developing countries to threaten to walk out of the meeting labor organizations however continue to press for labor standards to be addressedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs5 prepared by charles hanrahan senior specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry divisionalthough the start of new round of negotiations is seen as the major accomplishment of the doha meeting another major accomplishment was the approval of china and taiwan as wto members because of the size of its economy and its economic growth china is expected to have considerable influence within the wto in the future on organization and management of the work program the ministerial declaration directs that negotiations be concluded not later than january 1 2005 it states that the fifth ministerial which must be held within two years will take stock of progress provide any necessary political guidance and take decisions as necessary it directs that trade negotiations committee tnc be established to supervise the negotiations under the authority of the wto general council the tnc must hold its first meeting not later than january 31 2002 with the exception of actions on the dispute settlement understanding which have deadline of may 2003 the outcome of the negotiations will be single undertaking which means there is likely to be single comprehensive agreement at the end of the negotiations agriculture as at the 1999 seattle ministerial conference agreeing on negotiating mandate for agriculture at doha proved difficult and was among the last issues to be resolved unlike seattle however wto members especially the united states and the european union seemed determined that disagreement on the scope of agriculture negotiations not preclude the launch of new comprehensive round of multilateral negotiations the resulting mandate folds agriculture negotiations into comprehensive trade round and permits the united states to pursue further agricultural trade liberalizatio n begun in the uruguay round agreement on agriculture the negotiating mandate for agriculture the doha ministerial declaratio n of november 14 2001 includes broad mandate for multilateral negotiations on agriculture although sectoral negotiations called for by the 1994 wto uruguay round agreement on agriculture uraa have been underway for some time the doha ministerial declaration incorporates the sectoral negotiations into comprehensive round of multilateral trade negotiations mtns and constitutes an agreed negotiating mandate for agriculture the mandate reflects the objectives advanced by the united states in the sectoral agriculture negotiations with respect to market access for agricultural products export subsidies and tradedistorting domestic support for agriculture the doha ministerial declaration states that building on the work carried out to date in the sectoral negotiations and without prejudging the outcome of the negotiations we commit ourselves to comprehensive negotiations aimed at substantial improvements in market access reductions of with view tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs6 3the 18 members of the cairns group are argentina australia bolivia brazil canada chile colombia costa rica fiji guatemala indonesia malaysia new zealand paraguay philippines south africa thailand and uruguayphasing out all forms of export subsidies and substantial reductions in trade distorting domestic support the declaration also provides that special and differential treatment for developing countries shall be an integral part of all elements of the negotiations the declaration takes note of nontrade concerns reflec ted in negotiating proposals of members and confirms that nontrade concerns will be taken into account in the negotiations the launch of the new round likely will give impetus to the sectoral negotiations which had not progressed beyond identifying and discussing negotiating issues and had deadline even with agreement on mandate for agriculture however there remain the difficult tasks of deciding on modalities eg formulas and timetables for achieving the desired reductions and of developing individual country schedules or lists of reduction commitments the agriculture negotiations will be complicated by strong differences among major wto participantsthe united states the european union japan korea the cairns group of agricultural exporting countries3 and the developing countriesabout what the outcomes of the negotiations should be the deadline for concluding the negotiations in the new round including those on agriculture is january 1 2005 the deadline for agreeing on modalities for commitments in agriculture is march 31 2003 schedules of concessions are to be submitted by wto members later than the fifth wto ministerial conference in late 2003 uraa agriculture sectoral negotiations sectoral negotiations on agriculture began in march 2000 part of the socalled builtin agenda of the wto these negotiations are aimed at continuing the process of substantial progressive reductions in support and protection of agriculture begun under the 1994 wto uraa which established new and strengthened multilateral rules for agricultural trade the first phase of the sectoral negotiations entailed the submission and examination of proposals from wto member countries the second phase begun in march 2001 has focused on indepth consideration of key issues raised in the proposals tariff quota administration tariffs tradedistorting domestic support amber box or prohibited support export subsidies export credits state trading enterprises export restrictions food security food safety and rural development with the launch of the new round and the establishment of deadlines for completing the negotiations attention will now turn to examining the modalities for making reduction commitments for tariffs export subsidies and domestic support because developing countries were critical to the launch of the new round particular attention seems likely to be paid to modalities for according developing countries special and differential treatment for their tariffs and domestic subsidies an objective shared by the united states httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs7 useu negotiating issues the ministerial declaratio n gives ample scope for wto member countries during the new round to pursue proposals made in the sectoral agriculture negotiations during the ministerial conference the united states maintained its support for the elimination of agricultural export subsidies substantial reductions in tariffs and increases in tariffrate quotas on agricultural imports disciplines on state trading enterprises and substantial reductions in trade distorting domestic support the us position was reinforced and strengthened by that of the cairns group and many developing countrie s who called for deep cuts in domestic support and the elimination of export subsidies the eu opposed the elimination of export subsidies and conditioned its support for further export subsidy reduction on including export credits and food aid on the negotiating agenda the eu agreed to accept the objective of phasing out agricultural export subsidies when the expression without prejudging the outcome of the negotiations was included in the mandate for negotiating reductions in tariffs export subsidies and domestic support the addition of that expression to the mandate according to the eu will prevent prenegotiation of the outcomes of the agricultural negotiations the eu can also claim that since the negotiating mandate encompasses all forms of export subsidies it can introduce proposals for reducing both government sponsored export credit programs and food aid used to circumvent export subsidy reduction commitments in the negotiations the broad negotiating objective with respect to export subsidies also will enable both the united states and the eu to introduce proposals to discipline the operations of export state trading enterprises stes stes are often thought to use their lack of transparency to price exports differently in different markets in addition the eu reportedly felt its success in putting investment competition policy and environment on the larger doha negotiating agenda was sufficient to enable it to support the negotiating mandate for agriculture some however consider the fact that the start of the negotiations on these issues has been delayed until 2003 failure for the eu other agricultural issues the eu japan and korea also have placed greater emphasis on the use of agricultural policies to address socalled nontrade concerns like protecting the environment and rural development developing countries have called for rapid dismantling of trade barriers of developed countries coupled with exemptions for their domestic subsidies deemed essential for economic development group of small island nations and former european colonies have argued for continued preferential treatment of their exports in response to these issues the ministerial declaration provides that nontrade concerns will be taken into account in the negotiations also modalities for providing special and differential treatment to developing countries will be established by the march 31 2001 deadline separately from the ministerial declaration the conference approved waivers that will enable developing countries that are former european colonies in africa the caribbean and the pacific to continue receiving preferential treatment for their exports httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs8 us agricultural interest groups most us agricultural interest groups rank further agricultural trade liberalization as high priority and are pleased to see sectoral negotiations folded into comprehensive multilateral trade round these groups believe that tradeoffs possible in comprehensive negotiation can result in improved market prospects for us agricultural exports the american farm bureau the largest general us farm organization cited the launch of the new round as critical step in improving the global economic outlook for us agriculture november 14 2001 others such as winter vegetable producers or wheat farmers in states that border canada who feel disadvantaged by previous trade agreements eg nafta are not enthusiastic about us participation in new round the doha negotiations and farm bill programs the agriculture negotiations could result in tariff reductions that would benefit many us agricultural commodity exports but also could result in us tariff changes that create greater competition for some us agricultural products the negotiations could also impact on us domestic support and export subsidies as well both the housepassed farm bill hr 2646 and the senate agriculture committee version of the farm bill s 1731 contain provisions that put the united states at some risk of exceeding its domestic support reduction commitments under the uraa provisions in both bills however authorize the secretary of agriculture to reduce commodity support if necessary to stay within uraa limits negotiations dealing with all forms of export subsidies could lead to changes in us agricultural export credit or food aid programs both authorized in farm bills some trading partners argue that us export credits operate to subsidize exports and that some us food aid circumvents us export subsidy reduction commitments under the uraa the united states maintains that export credit programs should be negotiated not in the wto but in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd where the issue has been dealt with traditionally its food aid programs the united states maintains are in conformity with wto requirements and developing countries needs both domestic support and export and food aid programs enjoy strong support among us farmers and in congress us negotiators would presumably not agree to changes in support and export programs without substantial reductions in other wto countries especially the european unions domestic and export subsidies committees and members of the 107th congres s will monitor the progress of the negotiations and consult with trade negotiators on us proposals ultimately congres s would take up legislation to implement the provisions of any trade agreements that would require changes in us farm laws httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs9 prepared by william h cooper specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division antidumping and other wto trade rules the united states and most of the major trading countries employ measures to remedy the adverse impact of unfair foreign trade practices on domestic producers these trade remedies are sanctioned by the wto as long as member countries adhere to wto rules measures against imports that are dumped antidumping and to lesser extent against subsidized imports countervailing duty have become widely used number of us trading partners including japan korea chile and brazil concerned about recent increase in us use of antidumping measures have demanded that review of wto rules on antidumping ad and countervailing duty cvd remedies be placed on the agenda for new round some us industries and members of congress strongly argued against ad and cvd being placed on the agenda however the doha ministerial declaration states that these issues will be part of new round the reactions from some members of congress and others suggest that it remains divisive issue and will likely be raised during the upcoming debate on trade promotion authority fasttrack legislation background the authority in us law for ad relief is found in sections 731739 of the tariff act of 1930 as amended the authority for cvd relief is found in sections 701709 of the tariff act of 1930 as amended ad and cvd actions are designed to level the playing field for adversely affected industries by eliminating the price advantages that foreign competitors obtained by selling products at an unfairly low prices or by benefitting from government subsidies in addition many trade specialists have argued that ad cvd and other trade remedies are means by which the united states has been able to respond to the concerns of the adversely affected sectors of the economy and achieve domestic political consensus on trade liberalization without these remedies they argue the congress would not have approved major agreements such as the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and the world trade organization wto that became the foundation for the postwar international trading system others have argued that ad and cvd measures reduce the efficiency of trade by increasing the costs of imports and that these measures are used to protect inefficient producers us industries petitioning for ad or cvd relief must go through multistage investigation conducted by the department of commerce doc and the us international trade commission itc the process begins when an industrya firm union or other representative group of the industry files relevant petitions with the office of import administration of the doc and with the itc the doc may also initiate an investigation successful completion of the process is contingent on four affirmative decisions the itc makes preliminary determination whether there is reasonable indication that imports in question are causing or threaten to cause material injury to the industry an affirmative decision allows the investigation to continue negative decision terminates the investigationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs10 4 language regarding negotiations over ad and cvd laws is also contained in pending legislation on trade promotion authority or fasttrack hr 3005 the bipartisan trade promotion authority act of 2001 reported out of the ways and means committee on october 16 2001 states in section 2 c in order to address and maintain united states competitiveness in the global economy the president shall 9 preserve the ability of the continuedboth the doc and the itc must take into account number of criteria in making their respective determinations in cvd cases the doc must consider evidence of direct subsidies or upstream subsidies subsidies provided to inputs the benefits of which are passed on to the final producer and if found what would be the net countervailable subsidy in ad cases the doc must first determine the normal value of the import based on the price in the exporting countrys home market on the price of the export of the product to third country market or on constructed price depending on the availability of data the doc must compare the normal value with the actual price of the import in question to determine whether dumping is taking place and if so what the dumping margin is under both ad and cvd procedures the itc must make two determinations 1 is the domestic industry being materially injured or facing threat of material injury 2 are the imports in question cause of the material injury us law establishes timeframes within which the respective agencies must make their determinations the united states and other wto members must adhere to the uruguay round antidumping agreement and the subsidies and countervailing measures agreement which establish procedures for implementing national antidumping and countervailing duty programs initiations of us ad investigations have increased over the last few years largely as result of the us steel industry seeking relief from surge in steel imports since 1998 in 1998 36 ad investigations were initiated an increase from 15 in 1997 in 1999 46 investigations were initiated and 45 were initiated in 2000 however some other countries india for example have increased their use of antidumping measures cvd relief has not been sought nearly as much congressional concerns the bush administration faced considerabl pressure from number of members of congress to hold the line and protect us trade remedy laws from changes on november 7 2001 the house passed 4104 concurring resolution hconres 262 stating that it is the sense of the congress that at the negotiations at doha the united states should preserve its ability to enforce its trade laws including antidumping and countervailing duty laws and should avoid agreements that would weaken the effectiveness of wto disciplines and national laws on antidumping and countervailing duties in addition the resolution stated that us negotiators should ensure that us exporter s are not subject to abusive use of trade laws including antidumping and countervailing duty laws in midmay 2001 senate finance committee chairman max baucus mt and 61 other senators sent president bush letter cautioning him against allowing us trade remedy laws to be weakened during new round of wto negotiations4 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs11 4continued united states to enforce rigorously its trade laws including the antidumping and countervailing duty laws and avoid agreements which lessen the effectiveness of domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade especially dumping and subsidies hr3019 the comprehensive trade negotiating authority act of 2001 introduced on october 4 2001 contains similar language 5 congressional record november 15 2001 p s11899 6 inside us trade november 23 2001not all members of congress held this position six republican senators including phil gramm tx argued in november 9 letter to ustr zoellick for flexibility on negotiating on ad and cvd doha and domestic reaction after much discussion the united states and the other wto members agreed to the following language in the doha declaration in the light of experience and of the increasing application of these instruments by members we agree to negotiations aimed at clarifying and improving disciplines under the agreements on implementation of article vi of the gatt 1994 the wto antidumping agreement and on subsidies and countervailing measures while preserving the basic concepts principles and effectiveness of these agreements and their instruments and objectives and taking into account the needs of develop ing and leastdeveloped participants in the initial phase of the negotiations participants will indicate the provisions including disciplines on trade distorting practices that they seek to clarify and improve in the subsequent phase antidumping issues are addressed not only in the main declaration but also in the separate decision issued at doha to address concerns of developing countries over implementation of agreements reached during the uruguay round that document states that when considering an ad case national investigation authorities will dismiss an ad case if during the past year an ad case regarding the same product resulted in negative determination the bush administration has received criticism from some members of congress and some areas of the private sector for allowing ad and cvd to be placed on the agenda of new round for example sen baucus stated that he was extremely troubled by the decision to reopen the agreements reached just few years ago on antidumping and antisubsidy measures both houses of congress have made it clear that they oppose negotiations to further weaken us trade laws5 similarly rep richard gephardt mo indicated that the inclusion of trade remedy laws on the doha agenda will make it more difficult for the administration to obtain trade promotion authority or fasttrack6 bush administration trade officials have argued that the doha ministerial declarations treatment of ad and cvd is beneficial to the united states they have emphasized that the negotiations will be twophase process with the first phase devoted to shaping the agenda and the second devoted to negotiations thus ustrhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs12 7 international trade reporter november 22 2001 prepared by susan fletcher specialist in environment policy resources science and industry divisionzoellick stated that negotiations on these measures will allow the united states not only to maintain its trade laws but also to focus on the ad and cvd practices of other countries especially the transparency and due process requirements that are part of wto rules in so doing administration officials have argued us negotiators fulfilled the wishes expressed in hconres 262 the private sector is also divided on this issue the us business community has widely supported the agreement to begin new round of negotiations on the other hand major labor groups have opposed it for example aflcio president john sweeney stated that the decision to include ad and cvd on the agenda will weaken us trade laws leaving american workers vulnerable to unfair trade practices7 environment and trade environmental issues and how they should be treated in the rules of the world trade organization wto have long been and remain controversial as evidenced by the wide variety of positions taken by wto members at the fourth ministerial meeting of the wto held november 914 2001 in doha qatar at the conclusion of the fourth ministerial meeting the declaration reflected compromise in which negotiations were agreed upon for one key environmental issue and further study in the wtos committee on trade and environment was outlined for three other priority issues the determination not to let this issue or others prevent agreement on initiating new round of negotiat ions overcame the wide gulf in positions on environmental concerns among wto members some wto members notably the europeans stated their belief that the wto should take proactiv stance with rules that endorse and promote environmental protection othersparticularly developing countrieswished to minimize the inclusion of environmental concerns arguing that environmental negotiations outside the wto are the appropriate forum for these issues prevalent concern among developing countries has been that environmental issues could and would provide pretext for protectionism the european union eu position at the doha meeting was that firm commitment to negotiations on environmental issues should be made at the conference and they characterized this issue as potential deal breaker if such commitment were not made environment in the doha ministerial declaration in the october 27 2001 draft declaration text prepared by the general council known as the harbinson draft in preparation for the fourth session of the ministerial conference in november environment was among the key issues and was treated in several places in the text the final doha declaration augmented the language of the harbinson draft in both the opening statement and in the workhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs13 program outlined in it the work program in particular reflects the compromise reached between the eu insistence on commitment to negotiations and the developing countries reluctance to go beyond delegating environmental issues to the wtos committee on trade and environment cte for more discussion the overall declaration states we strongly reaffirm our commitment to the objective of sustainable developmentwe are convinced that the aims of upholding and safeguarding an open and nondiscriminatory multilateral trading system and acting for the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development can and must be mutually supportiv we take note of the efforts by members to conduct national environmental assessments of trade policies on voluntary basis we recognize that under wto rules country should be prevented from taking measures for the protection of human animal or plant life or health or of the environment at the levels it considers appropriate subject to the requirement that they are not applied in manner which would constitute means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail or disguised restriction on international trade and are otherwise in accordance with the provisions of the wto agreements we welcome the wtos continued cooperation with unep united nations environment program and other inter governm ental environmental organizations we encourage efforts to promote cooperation between the wto and relevant international environmental and developmental organizations especially in the leadup to the world summit on sustainable development to be held in johannesburg south africa in september 2002 the doha declaration includes work programme covering number of issue areas the section on trade and environment states that negotiations will be undertaken on specified aspects of issues concerning the relationship of multilateral environmental agreements and trade rules and that other environmental issues will be dealt with in the committee on trade and environment regarding the commitment to negotiations the declaration states with view to enhancing the mutual supportiveness of trade and environment we agree to negotiations without prejudging their outcome on i the relationship between existing wto rules and specific trade obligations set out in the multilateral environmental agreements meas the negotiations shall be limited in scope to the applicability of such existing wto rules as among parties to the mea in question the negotiations shall not prejudice the wto rights of any member that is not party to the mea in question negotiations are also to include procedures for information exchange between mea and wto entities the criteria for granting observer status and the reduction or possible elimination of tariff and nontariff barriers to environmental goods and services this section also notes that fisheries subsidies will be part of the negotiations on subsides the work program instructs the cte in pursuing work on all items on its agenda within its current terms of reference to give particular attention to i the effect of environmental measures on market access especially in reference to developing countries in particular the leastdeveloped among them and those situations in which the elimination or reduction of trade restrictions and distortions would benefit trade the environment and development ii the relevant provisions ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs14 the agreement on traderela ted aspects of intellectual property rights and iii labelling requirements for environmental purposes the declaration concludes work on these issues should include identification of any need to clarify relevant wto rules the committee shall report to the fifth session of the ministerial conference and make recommendations where appropriate with respect to future action including the desirability of negotiations the work program adds further paragraph recognizing the importance to developing countries of technical assistance and capacity building in the field of trade and environment and encouraging sharing of experience among wto members wishing to perform environmental reviews at the national level report on these activities is to be prepared for the fifth ministerial session it thus appears that this declaration and work plan as approved by wto ministers establishes commitment to negotiations on one key issuethe relationship between trade rules and measwhile limiting the scope of negotiations to exclude one of the most difficult aspects of this issue which is how nonparties to the mea in question would relate to these relationships on other environmental issues the work program would repeat earlier ministerial instructions to the cte relegating work on most environmental issues to that committee and instructing it this time to focus particularly on the three listed priority issues this text attempts to walk fine line between insistence by europeans on commitment to negotiations and resistance by most developing countries to widerangin g environmental negotiations in the wto the issues highlighted by the agreement regarding trade and environment have already proven to be extremely difficult to resolve in the context of the cte finding ways to reconcile major international environmental treaties with wto rules has always appeared to be one of the most straightforward issues that should be resolved but has also proven to be difficult when specifics are discussed environmental groups and free trade advocates have long agreed that eliminating market distorting subsidies would mutually support the goals of both but it proves difficult on an ongoing basis to deal with specific subsidies and affected sectors labelling refers in this context primarily to ecolabeling in which relevant information about the contents of product or the processes used in its manufacture would be revealed on product labels this has been goal of environmental groups who argue that consumers should be allowed to make informed decisions about products they might consider preferable in terms of environmental impacts but it has been opposed by many in business who argue that achieving internationally consistent standards for such labeling would be difficult and that protectionism or trade barriers that could be engendered by labeling positions of wto members the european union eu and its member states took the strongest positions on environment during the runup to the november ministerial meeting they reportedly indicated that failure to get commitment at the fourth ministerial to negotiationsnot further discussion by the cte as outlined in the draft textwould be dealbreaker the eu identified three key issues to be negotiated in order tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs15 prepared by ian f fergusson analyst in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade divisionclarify wto rules that relate to them 1 ecolabeling that would include lifecycle analysis of traded products 2 use of the precautionary principle that would allow measures to be taken to protect the environment or health even if scientific evidence is incomplete and 3 clarifying the relationship of multilateral environmental agreementstreaties to wto rules the eu and its member states made the point that domestic political pressure to assure environmental progress in the wto is major factor in their position on these issues developing countries continued to resist such negotiations arguing these issues could encourage or allow disguised green protectionism some observers feel that the language of the draft text that calls for further study by the cte and possible recommendations from the committee for future negotiations is at the very edge of acceptability on the part of developing countries the united states took low profile approach to environmental issues at the ministerial meeting and its position was not often quoted in press reports nor was it elucidated in ustr materials however the bush administration has generally been lukewarm at best to including environmental issues in trade talks the compromise language of the final doha declaration reflects the positions of both the eu and developing countries and does reflect the fact environmental issues are likely to be an ongoing agenda item in trade discussions implementation and other developing country issues the doha ministerial confere nce attached unprecedented importance to developing country issues at the wto these issues often referred to as implementation issues refer to the technical administrative and financial challenges faced by developing countries in complying with their wto obligations and whether these difficulties should result in the review or amendment of certain wto obligations however implementation has also come to encompass overall dissatisfaction with aspects of the uruguay round agreements and with the perceived need of making the agreements more attuned to the needs of the developing world the implementation agenda has been raised by newly industrializing countries developing and least developed countries ldcs active in the wto these countries include the informal likeminded group of countries comprising egypt india pakistan malaysia cuba dominican republic indonesia sri lanka honduras and jamaica the uruguay round agreements expanded the scope of the multilateral trade agreements beyond the traditional binding of tariff rates to include agreements on trading rules domestic regulations and trade in services many newly industrializing countries and ldcs indicate that they lack the necessary infrastructure or resources to comply with these agreements this situation has given rise to attempts by these countries to seek relief from some of these requirements furthermore the sense ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs16 8 credit goes to ldcs for successful doha ministerial washington

to new resolve among them to demand action on their concerns as the price of new trade round many observers credit the success of the doha ministerial to the activity and pragmatism of developing countries often active in the wto for the first time although developing countries did not achieve all their negotiating objectives8 the doha ministerials decision on implementation9 outlines package of 46 actions for wto members to assist developing countries to comply with existing agreements these measures generally allow flexibility in developing country implementation of existing agreements phased in compliance times and assistance for these countries in developing the technical capability to carry out wto obligations implementation measures will be undertaken in conjunction with the wto agreements on agriculture antidumping customs valuation intellectual property investment rules of origin sanitary and phytosanitary measures subsidies and countervailing duties technical barriers to trade and textiles and clothing the ministerial declaration also reaffirmed the wtos commitment to special and differential sd treatment for developin g countries these provisions allow for exemptions or phased in implementation in compliance with wto rules developing countries would like to see these provisions now considered exhortatory or recommend ed become binding thus permitting the use of dispute settlement mechanisms to enforce them the ministerial decision on implementation only commits the committee on trade and development to study and to make recommendations concerning the implications of making sd provisions mandatory developing countries secured separate ministerial declaration clarifying the relationship between the trade related aspects of intellectual property trips and public health10 while reaffirming the commitment to the trips agreement the document calls for trips to be interpreted and implemented as to recognize members right to protect public health this issue was pressed by developing countries seeking to cope with hivaids and other public health crises us negotiators opposed attempts to weaken pharmaceu tical patent protection but expressed satisfacti on with the resulting declaration11 although pharmaceutical groups were leery of the declaration they subsequently maintained that the declaration is political document which does not change existing obligations under the trips agreement12 the declaration also adopted u s proposal to extend untilhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs17 13 declaration of the group of 77 and china on the fourth wto ministerial conference at doha qatar wto document wtl424 october 24 20012016 the time in which ldc can achieve compliance with pharmace utical related patent obligations under the uruguay round agreement textile trade is covered by the agreement on textiles and clothing atc which is designed to eliminate import quota restrictions on textiles and apparel by 2005 under the atc quotas on textiles and apparel are to be eliminated in 4 phases with two phases totaling reduction of 33 already implemented third phase of 18 scheduled to occur on january 1 2002 and the remaining 49 to occur by january 1 2005 developing countries have been disappointed in the progress of opening developed country markets to their textiles and sought at doha to have the phaseout of quotas accelerated developing countries claim that they have not received the benefits of liberalization because the quotas reductions thus far achieved have been made on low valueadded products at the conference however the united states and the european union fought off attempts to alter the atc to accommodate developing country demands on textiles however the ministers agree to begin negotiations to reduce high tariffs and tariff peaks that are characteristic of textiles the members also agree to exercise particular consideration before commencing antidumping investigations on textiles from developing countries for two years after quotas on those items have been removed the group of 77 g77 had called for moratorium on antidumping actions by developed countries on textiles previous to the ministerial13 the implementation declaration did direct the council for the trade in goods to examine proposals 1 for countries maintaining quota restrictions to use the most favorably methodology available that of the eu in implementing the quota phaseout on the least developed countries and 2 to advance the retroactive implementation of the last phase of quotas from january 2002 to january 2000 developing nations achieved mixed success on antidumping and subsidies measures the implementation declaration adopted draft declaration language which calls for national authorities to refrain from seeking new dumping investigations on products in which negative dumping determination had been reached in the past year it also seeks clarification on alternative constructive remedies to antidumping sanctions on developing countries in accordance with article 15 of the 1994 antidumping implementation agreement however attempts to substantially revise the antidumping agreement were rebuffed by the united states developing countries were united in their opposition to european union attempts to include discussions on labor and environment in the doha roundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs18 prepared by margaret mikyung lee legislative attorney american law divisionpatents and access to hivaids drugs background and us objectives one of the major objectives of the doha ministerial was the issuance of the declaration on the trips traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights agreement and public health there were several meetings earlier this year hosted by the world trade organization wto the world health organization and the united nations to address the problem of increasing access to essential drugs while maintaining adequate intellectual property protection these were motivated most immediately by the aids epidemic and the need for greater access to and dissemination of hivaids drugs particularly in third world countries which have been severely impacted by the epidemi c and do not have the highly developed domestic pharmaceutical industries necessary to develop such drugs the dependence on drugs develop ed and patented by pharmaceutical companies in developed countries had led to tension between the patent protection deemed necessary as financial incentive and reward for developing innovative drugs and the arguably restrictive access to such drugs engendered by the patent monopoly over such drugs and the attendant increased cost the trips agreement which had established minimum patent protection standards and implementation deadlines for developing and least developed countries was viewed by many developing countries as an obstacle to dealing effectively with the aids epidemic and other pandemics or similar public health crises consequently these countries sought the amendment of the trips agreement during the next round of negotiations to be launched by the final declarations and decisions at doha the us objective at doha was to defend the trips agreement from such encroachments by demonstrating to concerned countries that the agreement already had sufficient flexibility to accommodate public health initiatives to combat aids malaria tuberculosis and other pandemics and was part of the solution not part of the problem in dealing with public health crises by providing the framework and protection necessary to encourage pharmaceutical innovations in the treatment of pandemic diseases the flexibility of the trips agreemen t is reflected in provisions affecting parallel importation also referred to under the terms exhaustion of rights or gray market importation and compulsory licensing parallel importation into one country of drugs which are sold at cheaper price in another country without the authorization of the patent holder and compulsory licensing have been perceived as possible methods of resolving the problem of greater access to hivaids drugs however some developed countries had been concerned that these would undermine the patent rights of their pharmaceutical industries and thus undermine pharmaceutical developments and innovations although parallel importation is arguably violation of the exclusive importation right of the patent owner since it occurs without the consent of the owner article 6 of the trips bars such an issue from being the subject of dispute settlement proceeding articles 7 8 and 31 of the trips agreement are relevant to compulsory licensing article 7 states that the objective of intellectual property protections should be to contribute to the promotion ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs19 technological innovation and the dissemination of technology to the mutual advantage of producers and users of technological knowledge and in manner conducive to social and economic welfare and to balance of rights and obligations article 8 permits members to adopt measures necessary to protect public health and nutrition and to adopt measures to prevent the abuse of intellectual property rights by the rights holders article 31 permits compulsory licensing under certain conditions article 30 provides for limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by patent and article 31 sets out the requirements for still other use of the subject matter of patent without the authoriza tion of the right holder ie compulsory licensing normally compulsory licensing will be permitted only if the proposed licensee has made efforts to obtain authorization from the patent holder on reasonable commercial terms and conditions but such efforts have not been successful within reasonable period of time however this requirement may be waived in the case of national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency or in cases of public non commercial use while developing countries suffering from an aids epidemic view it as the type of emergency necessitating waiver pharmaceutical industry groups in developed countries had been concerned that developing countries may try to invoke these exceptions to justify issuing compulsory license without first making good faith effort to negotiate with pharmaceutical patent holder the united states further proposed 10year extension of the trips agreement implementation deadline for leastdeveloped countries with regard to pharmaceutical products only and also 5year moratorium on wto challenges to actions taken by subsaharan african developing countries in response to public health crises declaration on the trips agreement and public health the declaration had been the subject of considerable disagreement in the days leading up to the doha ministerial and was anticipated to be major obstacle one of the surprises of doha was the early consensus achieved on it the united states and switzerland leading other developed countries had objected to declaration which would explicitly endorse the use of parallel importation and compulsory licensing by creating public health exemption from trips standards they believed the trips agreement was already sufficiently flexible to accommodate access to drugs they also objected to declaration purporting to address public health generally rather than emphasizing access to drugs developing countries saw the need for greater emphasis on the importance of public health needs the draft declaration job01155 dated october 27 2001 reflecting this divergence in views proposed two alternative titles and versions of 4 covering the two competing views of the declaration one emphasizing public health the other access to medicines the final declarati on wtmin01dec2 november 20 2001 constituted political statement emphasizing that the trips agreement does not and should not prevent member countries from taking measures to protect public health but also affirming the flexible interpretation and implementation of the existing trips agreement in accommod ating public health measures and access to medicines it noted the need for the trips agreement to be part of broader national and international actions in addressing pandemics and the importance of patents as incentives in the development of new medicines and also acknowledged pricing concerns in further clarifications it affirmed the right of wto members to fully usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs20 prepared by james k jackson specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade divisionthe provisions permitting flexibility these make explicit the right to grant compulsory licenses and the freedom to determine the grounds for such licenses including the right to determine what constitutes national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency with the understanding that public health crises such as pandemic can constitute such emergencies each wto member is free to establish its own parallel importation regime without challenge subject to most favorednation and national treatment principles furthermore the declaration recognized that certain members have inadequate or nonexistent pharmaceutical manufacturing capacities which impede them from utilizing compulsory licensing effectively it urged the trips council to find an expeditious solution to this problem and to report recommendations to the wto general council by the end of 2002 leastdeveloped countries would not be obligated to implement or enforce provisions in the trips agreement concerning patent and trade secret protections with regard to pharmaceutical products until january 1 2016 and could seek further implementation extensions in accordance with existing trips agreement provisions the only major provision of the draft deleted in the final declaration was the us proposal for 5year moratorium on dispute settlement challenges with regard to any nondiscriminatory law regulation or measure of subsaharan african developing country that improves access to patent drugs for hivaids or other pandemics this apparently was deemed unnecessary since any actions consistent with the existing flexible trips regime should not be subject to challenge the only major new language in the final declaration was an affirmation of the existing trips agreement obligation of developed countries to promote technology transfer to leastdeveloped countries the united states achieved its primary objective of convincing developing countries and leastdeveloped countries that major amendment of or exception to the trips agreement was necessary given its existing flexibility and importance to the development of new drugs and the fact that patent protection was only one component of comprehensive public health effort to combat public health crises services issues in the wto services issues are part of the world trade organizations builtin agenda the services negotiations are mandated by the general agreement on trade in services gats which required that further negotiations on services begin in 2000 and that the negotiations promote the economic growth of all trading partners and the development of developing countries according to article xix of the gats the new round of negotiations initiated for the purpose of providing effective market access must aim at reducing or eliminating the adverse effects on services trade of restrictive measures this objective was reaffirmed in the doha ministerial declara tion which supports continuing negotiations aimed at further liberalizing trade in services nations now face series of deadlines they must submit their initial requests for issues they would

effect in january 1995 the agreement consists of 29 articles eight annexes eight ministerial decisions and an understanding article xix is considered by many to be one of the most important because it commits the wto members to successive rounds of negotiations with view to achieving progressiv ely higher level of liberalization such commitment was felt necessary because the agreement does not rely on set of rules similar to those applied for goods but relies instead on list of specific commitments supplied by each member country and details what that country is willing to undertake under the gats member countries agreed to abide by set of general obligations which were applied directly and automatically to all members and services sectors and number of specific commitments concerning market access and national treatment in certain designated sectors the scope of these sectoral commitments is laid down in individual country schedules and therefore varies widely between member s under the agreement the general obligations are comprised of two specific issues most favored nation treatment and transparency or openness regarding laws and regulations specific commitments relate to market access national treatment and the movement of natural persons other annexes concern four areas in which the members agreed to continue negotiations air transport financial services telecommunications and maritime transport services the agreement also distinguishes between four different types of services 1 crossborder trade in services which represents the most common type of services trade 2 consumption abroad primarily activities associated with tourism 3 commercial presence in which firm from one country establishes presence in another country in order to provide service and 4 the presence of natural persons such as medical doctors accountants or teachers from one country entering another country in order to supply service in principle the agreement applies to all services with two exceptions services supplied to governments and air traffic rights and services the agreement also provides that in certain circumstances member countries can introduce or

services areas and has offered twelve proposals for areas of study for further liberalization accounting services this proposal is designed to make it easier for accountants and accounting firms to serve clients in other countries by addressing citizenship and prior residency requirements for licensing and would strengthen the accountancy disciplines adopted by the wto in 1998 audiovisual and

suppliers tourism services this proposal requests the removal of limits on market access or national treatment or limits on foreign investment the purchase of real estate and the discriminatory treatment of parties in joint venture it also proposes that all members undertake additional commitments relating to travelers and international conferences to promote expansion of international tourism other positions other developed nations are also supporting efforts to liberalize trade in services in addition to the 12 proposals offered by the united states other members have offered proposals in such services areas as advertising architectural services business services computer construction and engineering services logistics postal and courier professional sporting and transport services over the course of the negotiations some of these areas likely will be dropped in nearly all of these areas developed countries have clear competitive economic advantage over developing countries although developing countries will obtain benefit from liberalized trade in services it is unclear at this stage of the negotiations which areas they will support for liberalizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs24 prepared by margaret mikyung lee legislative attorney american law divisionintellectual property issues at the doha ministerial the topics concerning the agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights trips which were addressed in the ministerial declaration declaration and the decision on implementationrelated issues and concerns decision include the negotiations on registration system for geographical indicatio ns for wines and spirits the extension to other products of the protections afforded the geographical indications for wines and spirits implementation and review of article 273b including the clarification of the relationship between the trips and the convention on biological diversity cbd the moratorium on nonviolation complaints under article 64 and technology transfers to developing countries provisions addressing the trips in the context of the aids epidemic and public health issues were addressed separately in the declaration on the trips agreement and public health and are discussed in separate section of this report geographical indications the trips provides for the protection of geographical indications concerning the origins of product where certain quality and reputation are associated with particular geographic origin eg champagne tequila or roquefort it establishes twotier system 1 general level of protection available to all types of goods and 2 higher level of protection for the geographical indications for wines and spirits trips mandates negotiations to establish voluntary multilateral system for notification and registration of geographical indications for wines and spirits multilateral registration system has not yet been established and there are different proposals for such system two major proposals one cosponsored by the united states the other sponsored by the european union exemplify two approaches the salient feature of the usbacked proposal is that it would impose new obligations on wto members registered term would not be automatically granted protection by all members each member would decide whether term was entitled to protection under its own laws in contrast under the european union proposal terms accepted for registration would be protected in all countries other than those which successfully opposed registration on certain grounds both proposals enjoy support under the declaration wto members agreed to negotiate the establishment of multilateral registration system by the next ministerial conference trips also authorizes negotiations to increase further the protections of individual geographical indications covered by the heightened secondtier protections under these latter negotiations some countries have proposed to extend the higherlevel protection of geographical indications to products other than wines and spirits such as indigenous and folkloric crafts certain agricultural products cheeses etc but the united states and other countries believe that such negotiations are only authorized to further increase protections for wines and spirits not to extend the scope of the products covered the declaration notes that this issue will be addressed in the council for trips as part of the implementationrelated issues and concerns to be negotiated under the work program established by the declarationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs25 implementation and review of article 273b article 273b permits members to exclude from patentability plants and animals other than microorganisms and also biological processes for producing plants and animals other than microbiological and nonbiological processes however it also requires members to provide for the protection of plant varieties by either patent or sui generis system or combination of both so members which opt to exclude plant varieties from patent protection must establish sui generis system of protection several subissues have arisen during the required review of article 273b including the patentability of microbiological organisms and processes the meaning of sui generis system of protection for plant varieties the recognition of traditional knowledge and the rights of communities where genetic material originates including benefit sharing when inventors in one country have rights to creations based on material obtained from another country and the relationship between the trips agreement and the cbd developing countries generally are concerned with the benefits which they perceive article 273b confers on developed countries via protections granted medicines microorganisms and crop seeds for plant varieties to the detriment of developing countries struggling with public health and food supply problems therefore they propose variously that the distinction between biological organisms and processes and microbiological organisms and processes should be clarified that there should be harmonization between the trips agreement and the cbd and that the option of sui generis protection for plant varieties should be clarified to permit the protection of traditional knowledge and of traditional farming practices such as saved seed and the prevention of anticompetitive rights and practices which may threaten food sovereignty the issues concerning the cbd and traditional knowledge have assumed high profile in recent years the cbd provides generally for the conservation of biological diversity the sustainable use of such genetic resources and the equitable sharing of the benefits resulting from such use and development this sharing was envisioned as twoway street with the provision of access to resources by countries rich in biological diversity which includes many developing countries on one hand and the transfer of relevant technologies by developed countries using genetic resources on the other hand because the cbd in its preamble also recognizes the contribution of the traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples in the research into and development of resources discussion of implementation often includes the development of some type of protection for traditional or indigenous knowledge and for expressions of folklore the united states has not yet ratified the cbd however it does not see conflict between the trips agreement and the cbd therefore it perceives need to amend either agreement to clarify the relationship between the two the ministerial conference focused on what the nature and scope of the review required for article 273b should be review of developed country practices has already occurred the united states has called for review of developing country practices since they were obligated to implement trips by the beginning of this year however some other wto member countries have sought the inclusion in the review of issues which the united states considers to be outside the proper scope of the review such as consideration of the relationship between trips and the cbd and the protection of traditional knowledge although the united states has expressedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs26 its views on the substance of these issues it has opposed inclusion of these issues in the review and has sought to refocus the review discussions however the declaration instructs the council for trips to examine these issues as part of the work program including the article 273b review and the implementation review under article 711 moratorium on nonviolation complaints under article 64 article 642 provides for the nonapplication to the trips until jan 1 2000 of subparagrap hs 1b and 1c of article xxiii of gatt 1994 which permit complaints concerning nullification and impairment of benefits under the gatt despite explicit violation of obligations under the gatt to be brought before the dispute settlement system under article 643 the council for trips is required to examine the scope and modalities for nonviolation complaints and submit recommendations to the ministerial conference for approval by consensus however the council has not yet completed this examination and has continued to discuss this issue accordingly there is difference of opinion among the wto members as to whether the moratorium must or should remain in effect until the scope and modalities for nonviolation nullification and impairment complaints have been established the united states has seen need for the development of scope and modalities for non violation nullification and impairment complaints and has opposed the continued discussion of this topic presumably the united states therefore has seen need to continue the moratorium on such complaints however the decision directs the council for trips to continue its examination and discussion of this issue and to make recommendations to the next session of the ministerial conference in the meantime the moratorium on such complaints will continue transfer of technology under articles 7 8 and 662 articles 7 states that the protection of intellectual property rights should help promote inter alia technology transfer in manner conducive to social and economic welfare and to balance of rights and obligations article 8 permits measures to prevent the abuse of intellectual property rights and practices which unreasonably restrain trade or adversely affect the international transfer of technology under article 662 developed countries are required to provide incentives to enterprises and institutions in their territories for the purpose of promoting and encouraging technology transfer to leastdeveloped country members in order to enable them to create sound and viable technological base many developing countries feel that the requirement of article 662 has not been implemented adequately by most developed countries and cite this as factor in their own problems with timely implementation of their obligations under the wto agreements including the trips agreement the united states has provided to the wto fairly comprehensive list of technology transfer and assistance programs in the implementation of trips therefore it appears to have made bona fide adequate efforts to comply with the obligations of article 662 the decision affirms that these obligations are mandatory and provides that the council for trips shall

implementation issues and making the system more transparent and accessible to the public decisions on reforms had been taken by wto members through 2001 and the future of the review remained unclear

revisions and draft text containing amendments to the dsu was circulated at the seattle ministerial consensus could be reached at that time the united states had earlier identified two main goals for the review enhancing prompt compliance with panel and ab reports and enhancing the transparency of the process among other things it called for possible shortening of compliance periods and creating fairer and more efficient procedures throughhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs28 measures for higher quality panels shorter deadlines overall and elaboration of conflict of interest rules the united states proposed that greater transparency be achieved by requiring that members submissions except for confidential business information be made public when submitted thereby resulting in shorter and more quickly produced panel reports requiring that panel and ab meetings be open to observers from all wto members and civil society except for confidential business matters and allowing amicus briefs to be submitted to the panel and ab in each dispute in general the united states has argued that greater openness is needed to ensure public support for the legitimacy of the dispute system the review period coincided with the implementation phase of the usec banana dispute which in turn gave rise to the problem of sequencing since viewed as significant gap in the dsu the problem revolves around lack of integration of article 215 which provides that disagreements over the existence or adequacy of compliance measures are to be decided by recourse to dsu procedures with the processes and deadlines of article 22 which permits the prevailing party to request authorization to retaliate within 30 days after the compliance period ends if the defending party has not complied with its obligations by that time the european union eu argued that full compliance proceeding including consultations was called for the united states argued that it would lose its right to request authorization to retaliate if it waited for compliance panel to complete its work an additional problem arose with the proposal of socalled carousel legislation in congress under which the ustr would be required periodically to rotate lists of items subject to authorized trade retaliation unless certain exceptions applied the eu argued that changing list would be unilateral action not authorized by the dsu as proposed in the seattle draft disagreements over compliance would mandate that an article 215 panel be established before retaliation request could be made and the dsb would supervise modifications to authorized retaliation the text was supported by the eu canada japan and various other members but was not formally endorsed by the united states in part because of inadequacies as to transparency as well as problems with the carousel language the united states did not object to the compliance panel requirement however arguing instead that other deadlines should be shortened so that the entire dispute time frame would remain intact disputing parties have since dealt with sequencing issues through ad hoc bilateral agreemen ts after the united states enacted carousel legislation in may 2000 the eu filed complaint in the wto the case is still in consultations and the issue essentially remains unresolved in october 2000 japan along with 10 other countries sponsored new compromise proposal largely based on the seattle text focusing mainly on sequencing and excluding provisions on carousel retaliation and increased transparency neither the united states nor the eu endorsed the proposal proponents have since called for timely multilateral action after the dsb in january 2001 adopted an appellate report effectively concluding that panel convened to arbitrate the level of trade retaliation proposed by prevailing party may not decide if the defending member is in compliance and that sequencing rules must instead be established by wto members as whole the united states has continued to argue for increased transparency and the shortening of time frames in tandem with clarifying the sequencing issue increased access remains controversial given reaction to recent ab decisions to accept amicushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs29 prepared by glenn j mcloughlin specialist in telecommunications and technology policy resources science and industry division 16 see also crs report rs2042 6 electronic commerce an introduction by glenn j continuedbriefs in various cases actions strongly criticized by the chairman of the wto general council and number of wto members including japan canada the eu and developing countries who have argued that the move gives greater rights in dispute proceeding to nongovernmental organizations than to wto members and that any decision to allow amicus briefs should be made by members as whole with regard to retaliation the eu has since proposed that countries be allowed to arbitrate the level of trade affected by disputed measure before request for authorization to retaliate is made arguing that this factual matter could be settled before resorting to the more contentious action of requesting retaliation developing countries have argued against the shortening of time frames on the basis that current deadlines are difficult for them to meet and have generally argued that greater resources be made available to them for dispute proceedings to this end an advisory center on wto law for developing countries opened in geneva in july 2001 dispute settlement review was noncontroversial issue at the doha ministerial and consensus existed to continue talks on outstanding problems the ministerial declaration states in 30 that the ministers agree to negotiations on improvements and clarifications of the dispute settlement understanding and that the negotiat ions should be based on the work done thus far as well as any additional proposals by members and aim to agree on improvements and clarifications not later than may 2003 at which time we will take steps to ensure that the results enter into force as soon as possible thereafter ministers also agreed in 47 that dispute settlement results would be adopted separately that is they would not be part of any single act containing other agreements negotiated during the new round ecommerce and the wto the major electronic commerce ecommerce issue facing wto members is how to best encourage its continued global growth as part of increased global trade internet use and ecommerce growth already have substantial global presence in august 2001 the industry research group nielsennetratings released report that estimated that the number of people with internet access at home rose to 459 million by mid2001 up by 30 million from the beginning of the calendar year while the western industrialized nations dominate internet development and use some contend that by the year 2003 more than half of the material posted on the internet will be in language other than english the united states and canada represent the largest percentage of users at 566 europe follows with 234 of approximately 200 million internet users outside of the united states 31 were in latin america 05 were in the middle east and 06 were in africa the asian pacific region has 158 of all internet users but its rate of growth is nearly twice as fast as the united states and canada by 2005 the uscanada share of internet use may decline to 3616httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs30 16continued mcloughlin the us government has advocated wide range of policy prescriptions to encourage ecommerce growth these have included calling on the wto to declare the internet to be taxfree environment for delivering both goods and services recommending that new tax policies be imposed on internet commerce stating that nations develop uniform commer cial code for electronic commerce requesting that intellectual property protectionpatents trademarks and copyrightsbe consistent and enforceable suggesting that nations adhere to international agreements to protect the security and privacy of internet commercial transactions maintaining that governments and businesses cooperate to more fully develop and expand the internet infrastructure and calling for businesses to selfregulate ecommerce content in november 2001 the 107th congress passed the internet tax freedom act which extends the domestic internet tax moratorium to november 1 2003 this bill awaits president bushs signature the eu approach to ecommerce has resulted in some areas where there is agreement with us policies and in some areas where there are still tensions while the eu as an entity represents sizable portion of global internet connection users are concentrated in countries like the united kingdom and germany in france italy and spain the rate of internet connection is reportedly less than five percent of the total population thus while eu policies can provide broad regional context for ecommerce within national boundaries internet use and the potential for commerce development can vary widely for example the united kingdom ireland and france have advocated common set of standards for ecommerce that they contend would provide baseline of government regulation for ecommerce use germany austria and the netherlands have advocated extending domestic commercial legislation to ecommerce critics contend that the germanaustrian netherlands approach would ensnare ecommerce in knot of differing national laws and regulations others state that ecommerce policy should not be set by eu officials the wto also has addressed ecommerce in the october 27 draft ministerial declaration for the fourth conference in doha qatar the chairman of the general council states that electronic commerce creates new challenges and opportunities for trade for members of all stages of development we instruct the general council to consider the most appropriate institutional changes for handling the work programme and to report on further progress to the fifth ministerial conference and that members will maintain their current practice of not imposing custom duties on electronic transmissions until the fifth session this language was adopted as article 34 under the ministerial declaration of november 14 2001 upcoming wto conferences may address any additional ecommerce issues raised by wto working groups on goods services intellectual property and economic development or address related ecommerce issues raised at previous ministerial conferences

trade divisionforeign investment issues in the wto ministers at the world trade organizations wto ministerial meeting in doha avoided discussing foreign investment issues directly but focused instead on clarifying the scope of future negotiations that will occur following the 2003 ministerial in the interim the wto working group on investment will attempt to clarify the nature and extent of the future round of negotiations one stated purpose of the negotiations is to develop multilateral framework of rules on investment to secure transparent stable and predictable conditions for foreign investment us negotiators indicated that they would drop their opposition to including investment issues as part of the overall negotiations as long as the talks meet certain conditions developed and developing countries view foreign investment as an important stimulant to economic growth and as an important force for globalization nevertheless foreign investment issues continue to defy consensus in international forums foreign investment often produces sharp differences between the developed and developing countries because it acts as channel through which different countries legal systems and social and economic values collide in addition public debates on foreign investment often focus on such perceived negative effects as environmental degradation the transfer of technology the protection of culture the potential loss of employment and the ability of national governments to regulate or to tax economic activity these and other concerns often stymie attempts to reach agreements on broad range of foreign investment issues in multilateral forum for instance similar concerns sparked intense public opposition to foreign investment in 1997 and 1998 during debates within the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd over proposed agreement on investment known as the multilateral agreement on investment or mai as result the doha declaration calls for work prior to the next ministerial to focus on group of core elements the scope and definition of foreign investment transparency or openness of laws and government regulations nondiscrimination possibilities for developing gatsgeneral agreement on trade in servicestype list of preestablis hment investor commitments development provisions exceptions and balance of payments safeguards consultation and the settlement of disputes between members and the process of negotiations including the way in which nations may choose to participate the declaration also stipulates that the special development trade and financial needs of developing and leastdeveloped countries be an integral part of any framework for discussion investment in the wto the wto has not directly tackled the broad issue of foreign investment rules instead it has dealt with narrow set of very specific issues which has left nations to formulate their own policies either through bilateral investment treaties or through such entities as the oecd the wtos work on foreign investment issues focuses on three main areas working group was established in 1996 to conduct analyticalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs32 work on the relationship between trade and investment the agreement on trade related investment measures trims prohibits traderelated investment measures and the gats which addresses foreign investment in services both of the agreements were negotiated during the uruguay round of multilateral trade talks the trims agreement however does not attempt to regulate the entry and treatment of foreign investment but applies only to those measure s that impose discriminatory treatment on imported and exported goods this agreement recognizes that certain national practices such as local content requirements can restrict and distort trade and supports the concept of national treatment as result the trims outlaws investment measures that restrict quantities and it discourages measures which limit companys imports or set targets for the company to export among the measures not covered by the agreement are export performance requirements and technology transfer requirements the wtos perspective on foreign investment broadened at the 1996 wto ministerial in singapore when wto ministers set up two working groups to investigate the relationship between trade and investment and the issue of competition policies the working groups were tasked initially only with analyzing the issues and were not authorized to negotiate new rules or commitments or to make judgements concerning the possibility of any future negotiations on foreign investment nevertheless the 1996 statement on foreign investment required that the trims agreement would be reviewed in 2001 in order to determine if the agreement should be supplemented with additional provisions on investment policy and competition policy the us position until mid2001 the united states had opposed including foreign investment issues as formal part of any new round of trade talks us negotiators argued that the wtos working group on trade and investment was the best place to hammer out the multitude of differences that separate the developed and developing countries as well as those issues that divide the developed countries these negotiators apparently believed that opening up new round of trade talks to include foreign investment rules would divert attention from what they believe should be the main goal of the talks increased market access through reductions of tariffs and nontariff barriers in agriculture services and industrial goods us negotiators apparently have agreed to accept broader discussions of investment issues as long as the talks are well defined with specific negotiating agenda other positions as whole developed countries represented by the oecd favor eliminating most of the national rules governing inward and outward direct investment exceptions to this policy include their desire to retain exemptions for industries or sectors that individual countries deem to be important to their national security or of special national importance developing countries however are at odds with the majority of the objectives set out by the developed countries these countries are unlikely to negotiate over the issue of reducing investment subsidies without ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs33 prepared by raymond j ahearn specialist in trade relations foreign affairs defense and trade division 17 similar agreement was reached to defer immediate negotiations on three other issues foreign direct investment trade facilitation and transparency in government procurementwillingness on the part of the developed countries to consider imposing additional regulations on their use of rules that govern the use of locational incentives especially at the subnational level and tax holidays for investors furthermore the developing countries want the developed countries to agree to negotiations governing the use of antidumping regulations and countervailing duties which most of the developed countries oppose the lack of progress in formulating multilateral rules on foreign investment spurred most nations including the developing countries to formulate bilateral investment treaties as result of this experience developing countries as broad group now question whether multilateral rules on investment are preferable to bilateral investment treaties the latter apparently offer the developing countries level of flexibility to pursue their own foreign investment and development policies that they doubt would prevail under any multilateral agreement conclusions as the largest foreign investor and the largest recipient of foreign investment in the world the united states potentially has the most to gain and to lose from any multilateral negotiations on foreign investment rules the bush administration apparently support s the concept of holding new multilateral round of talks on investment issues as long as those talks are well defined with clear objectives determined in advance us multinational firms likely will also press for broader consideration of foreign investment issues interaction between trade and competition policy ministerial declaration agreement was reached to continue studying this issue for an additional two years until the fifth ministerial to be held in late 2003 in the working group on the interaction between trade and competition policy17 members agreed that negotiations will take place after the fifth session of the ministerial conference on the basis of decision to be taken by explicit consensus at that session on modalities of negotiatio n during the next two years the study program will focus on the clarification of core principles such as transparency nondiscrimination and procedural fairness and provisions of hardcore cartels while the expectation of many countries is that negotiations will be added to the doha round talks after the fifth ministerial language included at the insistence of india makes clear that any wto member has the right to take position on the modalities of the negotiations that would prevent negotiations from proceeding the european union was the leading proponent of including competition policy in the negotiations that will start next year japan also supported this efforthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs34 developing countries led by india provided the strongest opposition many developing countries argued that they are still in the process of enacting national competition laws or have little experience in implementing such laws and therefore would be at great disadvantage in engaging in negotiations at this time the united states adopted the middle ground supporting more study as well as capacity building efforts to help countries develop modern competition policies background as government erected trade barriers at the border have been substantially eliminated or reduced over the past few decades countries have increasingly clashed over private business practices that allegedly serve as barriers to market access us japan trade disputes in the 1980s and 1990s over semiconductors auto parts and photographic paper were rooted in concerns that japans toleration of private business practices allowed producers to maintain exclusive and restrictive ties with retailers and distribut ors that denied us firms fair opportunities to increase market share more recently europe and the united states clashed over the decision by the european commission to block the proposed merger of general electric and honeywell many other disputes among wto members have revolved around the commercial activities of stateowned and recently privatized companies that act as cartels or monopolies what is known as competition policy in europe antitrust policy in the united states provides legal framework for the regulation of many private business practices it is estimated that about half the countries in the world have some form of competition laws or are contemplating creating them while few trade disputes involving competition policy matters have been taken to the world trade organization wto there is considerable controversy whether the wto is the appropriate venue for arbitrating these disputes some elements of competition policy such as monopolistic practices and exclusive supply agreements are already covered under wto rules through agreements such as the general agreement on trade in services the wto in 1996 established working group on trade and competition policy to examine this issue the formal charge of the working group was to study issues raised by members relating to the interaction between trade and competition policy including anticompetitive practices in order to identify any areas that may merit further consideration in the wto framework in october 1999 the working party issued report summing up its activities but declined to suggest whether to commence with new wto negotiations on competition policy continue with its ongoing educational work program or cease its activities the mandate of the working was formally extended by wto members on march 27 2000 the european union had pushed for the inclusion of competition policy on the agenda of the new round of multilateral trade negotiations that was expected to be launched at seattle in novemberdecember 1999 but was opposed by the united states and most other wto members the agreement at doha means that the mandate of the working group will extended at least through late 2003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs35 prepared by ian f fergusson analyst in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade divisiongoals of competition policy and trade liberalization the economic objectives of competition policy and trade liberalization tend to be similar both attempt to increase competition in contested markets by reducing barriers to market entry tension between the two however arises when competition policies increases barriers to market entry or vice versa competition policies seek to promote both greater efficiency and fairness in domestic markets efficiency is concerned with maximizing output and minimizing waste fairness by contrast has different meanings in different countries and institutional settings in the united states it often means equality of opportunity or easy entry into business endeavor in other countries such as japan it often means that favored activity or loyalty should be rewarded conflict between efficiency and fairness thus occurs within countries and among them the goal of trade liberalization is primarily to promote efficiency through greater specialization in production and trade by opening markets trade liberalization also leads to greater competition in markets while the goals of competition policy and trade liberalization are substantially similar the underlying laws and bureaucratic processes by which the two sets of policies are administered are substantially different and separate across countries whether and how these two sets of policies should be more formally linked at the multilateral level and under the aegis of the wto are issues that may be addressed by the working group as well market access for nonagricultural products the doha ministerial committed member states to conduct negotiations on market access issues including the reduction and harmonization of industrial tariffs tariff reduction traditionally has been driving force of trade negotiations assuming central role in negotiations under the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt subsequent rounds of trade talks have reduced or eliminated many tariffs between developed nations however high tariff rates continue to exist in the developing world and for certain import sensitive sectors in developed countries at the doha ministerial wto members adopted negotiating agenda that has the potential to continue this process while acknowledging differential reciprocity for developing nations the eight rounds of trade negotiations conducted under the auspices of the gatt since 1947 have significantly reduced the magnitude of tariffs for participating countries in process known as binding

tariffs can be bound as specific duty per item or as an ad valorem duty rate based on the value of the goods export the binding of tariffs provides for stability and predictability in the trading

developed countries for all countries the percentage of imports under bound rates increased from 68 to 87 the percentage of imports under bound rates increased from 94 to 99 in developed countries from 74 to 96 in transition economies and from 13 to 61 in developing countries average tradeweighted tariffs were reduced by 34 worldwide 40 in developing countries and 30 in transitional and developing economies the ministerial declaration commits member nations to negotiate the reduction or elimination of tariffs tariff peaks and tariff escalation tariff peaks refer to countrys adoption of the maximum allowable bound rate tariff escalation is the practice of increasing the rate of duty for items as they are processed the scope of the negotiations are to be comprehensive without restrictions on products or sectors covered the united states trade representative robert b zoellick welcomed the inclusion of market access negotiations in statements leading up to the ministerial emphasizing that the practical effect of successful negotiations would be to lower the tariff rates of other nations to us levels however he also expressed reservations about the explicit mention of tariff peaks and tariff escalation in ministeri draft declaration18 tariff peaks are levied by the united states for certain textile products footwear and watches and tariff escalation is characteristic of tariff schedules of the united states and other developed countries the language on tariff peaks and escalations key position of developing countries seeking greater access to us markets is in the declaration the ministerial declaration also reaffirms special and differential sd treatment for developing countries in tariff reduction in negotiations leading to the doha conference draft language allowing developing countries to fulfill their tariff reduction obligations with less than full reciprocity in reduction commitme nts disappeared in draft revision perhaps reflecting us opposition to such language us industry groups had voiced varied opposition to weakening the concept of reciprocity some feared that it would allow developing countries to retain tariffs indefinitely others favored allowing the language for least developed countries ldc but not those countries with growing industrial sectors such as brazil or india19 the reappearance of the language

initiatives that aim to eliminate tariffs in entire product sectors known as zerozero initiatives some industry groups believed that maintenance of differential reciprocity in tariff concessions for developing countries would doom zerozero efforts20 however such language appears in existing wto declarations and zerozero initiatives have been floated in past rounds an accelerated tariff liberalization atl was proposed for eight product sectors chemicals energy products environmental products fish forest products jewelry medical and scientific equipment and toys in preparation for the seattle ministerial conference in 1999 however the failure to launch new trade round at seattle prevented the implementation of that proposal the 1996 information technology agreement is an example of completed zerozero initiative in which 41 countries have eliminated tariffs on 180 products21 trade facilitation in the context of wto discussions and negotiations trade facilitation refers to efforts to simplify and harmonize governments procedures to process data and other information required for the movement of goods among their respective customs areas the united states had pressed for trade facilitation to be included on the agenda of new round of negotiations to strengthen rules on trade facilitation according to the doha declaration that will be the case although the negotiations will

complained that they face nontariff obstacles when they try to ship goods across customs borders in the course of doing international trade often these barriers are arduous and less visible or transparent than tariffs such barriers include how products are valued at the border for duty purposes import licensing requirements rules of origin requirements and the application of safety standard regulations although the intent of the authorities may not be to discriminate against foreign goods exporters and importers have argued that they effectively do so the problems arise because the regulations and procedures may not be sufficiently publicized or may not be implemented in timely or consistenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31206crs38 22 inside us trade november 23 2001 prepared by

harmony in customs procedures and regulations plus antiquated processing methods and technology among customs areas make foreign trade less efficient and therefore costlier the wto and its predecessor the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt established rules and codes on the application of customs border requirements the united states and some other countries have argued that the wto needs to go further in 1996 the declaration issued during the singapore ministerial called for the wtos council on trade in goods to undertake exploratory and analytical work drawing on the work of other relevant organizations on the simplification of trade procedures in order to assess the scope for wto rules in this area developed countries including the united states the eu and canada called for negotiations to establish new disciplines to harmonize simplify and modernize customs procedures number of developing countries on the other hand are wary of making new commitments arguing that they may not have the infrastructure to fulfill new commitments in the end the ministers agreed to negotiations on trade facilitation however they have delayed the start of the negotiations until the next wto ministerial scheduled to take place in 2003 at which time decision will be made on the modalities of the negotiations the doha declaration in the meantime instructs the wto council for trade in goods to review and clarify relevant wto rules on trade facilitation and to establish what the priorities of members especially developing and least developed countries will be for negotiations the decision to delay the start of the negotiations reportedly resulted from concerns of developing countries especially african members22 transparency in government procurement governments are the largest single group of buyers of nondefense goods and services they represent market of hundreds of billions of dollars to suppliers however many governments restrict access by foreign firms to procurement contracts and give preference to domestic suppliers the united states and some other governments had argued for negotiations on agreement on transparency in the application of government procurement procedures to be included in the next round according to the doha declaration that will be the case but the negotiations will not begin until 2003 andwhile the expectation of many

suppliers when making purchases of god and services for public use even the united states one of the most open economies limits some procurement to domestic suppliers under the buy american act some wto memberstates including the united states have signed the wto plurilateral code on governme nt procurement which requires nondiscriminatory treatment in many areas of government procurement but the code only applies to the 28 members that have signed it at the wto ministerial in singapore in 1996 wto members led by the united states agreed to study the possibility of developing an agreement to ensure that membergovernments procurement regulations and procedures are implemented openly for example by publishing relevant laws regulations deadlines and evaluation criteria in so doing the agreement would help provide fair treatment of foreign suppliers visÃ vis domestic suppliers when bidding on government contracts the wto working group on transparency in government procurement was formed as result of the ministerial to develop elements of possible agreement the group includes the major economic powers including united states and the european union as well as representative developing countries according to the doha declaration the members agreed to begin negotiations in 2003 building on the efforts of the wto working group the delay had been sought by developing countries also in deference to the developing countries the members agreed that the negotiations would not go beyond issues related to transparency of current government procurement procedures and would not seek to impose new rules on members furthermore members agreed to provide technical assistance to developing countries to allow them to improve transparency in government procurement
