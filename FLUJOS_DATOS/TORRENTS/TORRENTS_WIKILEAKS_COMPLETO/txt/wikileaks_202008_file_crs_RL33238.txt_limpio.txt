specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress the benefits of education summary in world of limited resources where policymakers must make tradeoffs among numerous government activities sound decisionmaking entails knowing not only the benefits to society that result from schooling but also their value compared to other public investments social returns to investment in education are believed to include an informed and engaged citizenry but how is this rather vague benefit to be conceptualized and assessed recent concern about globalizations impact on us competitiveness has brought to the fore another perceived social benefit of the educational system namely its provision of highly qualified workers who enable the nation to sustain its rate of economic growth the former is an example of non monetary public benefit and the latter of monetary public benefit neither of which individuals ordinarily consider when choosing how much schooling to undertake because they are not rewarded for the positive effects thought to spill over from themselves to others as result of their pursuing additional schooling individuals are likely to underinvest in education the existence of such spillover benefits ie human capital externalities is key justification for government support and promotion of education that may thereby move society toward an optimal level of educational investment but how can it be shown that education per causes human capital externalities rather than other factors some of which are not readily observable for example does the pay gap between college and high school graduates reflect differences between the two in productivity due to acquired knowledge or due to innate ability is voter turnout higher among the more educated because civics was part of their school curriculum or because their parents raised them to take seriously public affairs answers to these questions would indicate whether and to what extent education is worthwhile investment for both individuals and society voluminous literature on the private monetary return to education has developed over the last 40 years with advances in statistical techniques applied to estimation of the earnings premium caused by schooling as recently as the 1990s educations private pecuniary rate of return is estimated to range from about 6 to 11 which suggests that investing in formal education is comparatively sound financial decision for individuals schooling seems even more worthwhile to individuals in light of its nonmonetary returns eg own health although values are rarely developed for this type of benefit researchers much more recently have focused on determining whether formal education causes public benefits while the number of such empirical studies is increasing estimates of the size of human capital externalities remain scarce due to the daunting analytical task of precisely measuring the monetary and nonmonetary benefits that spill over from highly educated persons to other members of society the results produced thus far are inconsistent but they do offer evidence of the existence of

federal spending on elementary secondary k12 and postsecondary education exceeded 170 billion in fy20031 this figure excludes the sizeable tax revenue that the federal government foregoes to encourage individuals to pursue additional schooling principally postsecondary and to support educational institutions in fy2005 federal tax expenditures on education were estimated to be some 20 billion2 state spending on k12 and postsecondary education dwarfs both these sums in school year 20012002 states spent about 435 billion on k12 education in school year 20002001 public degreegranting institutions across the nation spent almost 137 billion3 in world of limited resources where policymakers must make tradeoffs among numerous government activities sound decisionmaking entails knowing not only the full range of benefits to society that result from schooling but also their value compared to other public investments social returns to educational investment have long been thought to include an informed and engaged citizenry but how is this rather vague benefit to be conceptualized and assessed concern about the ability of the united states to maintain its competitive position in an increasingly global marketplace has brought to the fore another perceived social benefit of the educational system its provision of welltrained workers who enable country to sustain its rate of economic income growth highquality workforce also might dampen the cost of publicly financed remedies to potential displacement from international competition eg the trade adjustment assistance

national public education financial survey and integrated postsecondary education data system finance survey crs2 the acquisition of education thus is perceived as increasingly important to the labor market success of individuals which is the main private return to schooling seemingly now more than ever the greater the knowledge people embody ie their human capital the better able they are to adapt to economic change eg technological innovations and thereby to maintain their comparatively high earnings with little interruption from unemployment during their working lives but how can it be demonstrated that education per causes public and private benefits rather than other factors some of which are not readily observable for example does the pay gap between college and high school graduates reflect differences between the two in productivity due to acquired knowledge or due to innate intelligence is civic participation higher among more educated persons because its importance is taught in school or because their parents raised them to take political and community affairs seriously answers to these questions would indicate whether and to what extent education is worthwhile investment for both individuals and society this report provides an overview of the public and private benefits of education because it approaches education as an investment the report does not address the consumption benefits of schooling4 it focuses on those benefits for which empirical research has examined the causal effects of education rather than studies that have established an association correlation between schooling and other outcomes it should be noted at the outset that the variable this literature usually employs to represent learning is formal education as opposed to employerprovided onthejob training or informal learning in the workplace for example rationales for government support and promotion of education paternalistictype reasons although not usually used by economists are often used in popular discussions for providing education egalitarian arguments are also often used to justify government intervention imperfections in lending and insurance markets ie borrowing constraints and uninsurable risk and imperfect competition in labour markets can also warrant government involvement and subsidizing education can efficiently counteract the distortions in human capital investment decisions caused by income taxation5 perhaps the most widely known economic justification for public involvement in education is that the total benefits from learning exceed those which accrue solely to the individual making the investment people are likely to invest in education at less than socially optimum levels because they are not rewarded for and therefore do not typically take into account the positive effects thought to spill over from 4 these include such social benefits as community members enjoyment of local high school and college athletic events and such individual benefits as participation in college alumni activities 5 philip trostel should education be publicly provided bulletin of economic research vol 54 4 2002 p 374 crs3 themselves to others as result of their schooling decisions the existence of spillover benefits from private educational investment ie human capital externalities suggests that government intervention in education can move society toward an optimal efficient result nascent debate has developed in the empirical literature about the size of human capital externalities to date the disagreement is confined to one presumed external benefit namely the contribution of human capital to economic growth this matter is addressed directly later in the report those empirical studies of the educationgrowth nexus that find individuals are by far the major beneficiaries of their schooling decisions nonetheless support the conclusion that public expenditures on education are not wasted that is the social rate of return is positive albeit perhaps small6 put another way formal education does enhance productivity rather than years of schooling merely signaling to potential employers persons inherent characteristics eg motivation even if educational attainment functions primarily as signal however spending still would not be socially wasteful to the extent that possession of degree permits employers to better screen workers for jobs ie people are more appropriately matched with jobs thereby enhancing productivity and economic growth7 for these among other reasons signaling appears to have lost favor among economists as useful tool for analyzing educational choices or for policy analysis8 the public benefits of education the public benefits of education can be of monetary nature such as raising national income and the earnings of lesseducated members of society they also can be of nonmonetary nature these nonpecuniary benefits are more vague and less amenable to quantification than monetary returns if measurement difficulties lead researchers to omit nonmonetary transfers from more educated individuals to others the consequences of education for society will be understated 6 robert topel the private and social values of education education and economic development proceedings of federal reserve bank of cleveland research conference nov 1819 2004 hereafter

education p 49 crs4 civic participation the development and stability of democratic societies is perhaps one of the most commonly asserted spillover effects of education schools in the united states teach students about the functions of government and make them aware of political community and other social issues schools also attempt to instill in their charges democratic values and behaviors eg support for free speech and tolerance of others adults who have accumulated more years of education are presumed able to more readily and intelligently assess competing claims in political campaign literature and evaluate complex ballot initiatives as consequence education is purported to enhance the quantity and quality of civic engagement yet there may be factors individual family and communityspecific that simultaneously influence educational attainment and civic behaviors if analyses do not take into account such characteristics for which there may not be readily observable variables in data sets correlation could be misinterpreted for causality and the public return to schooling could be overstated in the 1990s studies began utilizing methodologies thought to better distinguish the unique effects of education on civic participation and on other positive externalities9 the results of one such analysis confirm that additional secondary and postsecondary education has large statistically significant impact on voting behavior10 for example another year of high school attendance increases the likelihood of voting in presidential election by almost 7 percentage points college entrance increases the likelihood of registering to vote by some 22 percentage points education is estimated to significantly raise the quality of civic knowledge as well with quality measured by frequency of newspaper reading another study similarly finds that more schooling substantially and significantly boosts voter turnout high school graduation is estimated to raise the probability of voting by 2934 percentage points11 this suggests that had high school completion among those at least 25 years old not risen by 36 percentage points between 1964 and 9 small body of literature focuses on twins to take advantage of their shared characteristics eg genetic endowment and family environment some analysts believe that utilizing twins mitigates the upward bias in estimated returns to education found in studies of unrelated individuals that fail to take into account unobservable traits the instrumental variable iv technique produces consistent estimate in situations where an independent variable eg educational attainment is correlated with unobservable characteristics eg the importance that parents place on civic responsibilities that also affect the return to education eg civic participation expressed differently the iv method removes from the return to education that portion which is due to unmeasurable factors associated with both educational attainment and the return to education 10 thomas s dee are there civic returns to education journal of public economics vol 88 2004 11 kevin milligan enrico moretti and philip oreopoulos does education improve citizenship evidence from the united states and the united kingdom journal of public economics vol 88 2004 crs5 2000 voter turnout in the 2000 election would have been 1012 percentage points lower than it was all else being equal education also appears to enhance the quality of civic involvement high school graduates more often attend political and community meetings volunteer in their communities and follow media reports about public affairs compared to individuals with fewer years of education crime as schools attempt to instill the shared values and rules of society they may increase the emotional and mental costs to an individual of engaging in unethical or illegal activities teachers supervise youngsters during the school day as well thereby making them less available for other activities eg juvenile delinquency more years of schooling also generally raise students future wage rates which increases the reward of legitimate work and the opportunity cost of time spent incarcerated education is thought to reduce crime through these among other pathways according to one analysis additional schooling does appear to significantly curb criminal activity12 it finds that oneyear increase in schooling lowers the likelihood of imprisonment by 01 percentage points for white males and 04 percentage points for black males the effect of education on reducing the probability of incarceration seems strongest among those who complete high school in addition oneyear increase in schooling is estimated to lower by 30 the probability that males will be arrested for such violent crimes as murder and assault similarly the likelihood of committing such property crimes as motor vehicle theft and arson falls by 20 and 13 respectively the researchers further approximate the social savings to be gained from educations impact on criminal activities 1 increase in males high school graduation rate could yield savings to society totaling 14 billion per year or about 11702100 annually per additional male high school graduate13 the authors conclude that the social benefits per additional graduate which are reaped each year over their lives compare favorably with the direct cost per student of one year of secondary school 12 lance lochner and enrico moretti the effect of education on crime evidence from prison inmates arrests and selfreports the american economic review vol 94 1 2004 13 ibid note the social savings result from an estimated 94310 fewer violent murder rape robbery and assault and property burglary larcenytheft motor vehicle theft and arson crimes in year the savings are combination of victim costs ie productivity and wage losses medical costs and reduced quality of life and incarceration costs crs6 economic growth schools through their teaching and research functions are thought to promote economic growth and thereby raise living standards14 teachers transmit knowledge to each new generation of students which facilitates their subsequent understanding and adoption of better ways of doing things in the workplace eg more efficient production methods inventory management and managerial techniques and prepares them to create and innovate while employed in the private sector faculty members and their research assistants also develop new applications of knowledge eg scientific and technological advances that largely are implemented outside the education industry where they too may increase the rate at which the economy is able to expand in addition as they interact in workplaces and communities with highly educated individuals others are thought to formally or informally learn from them through these various channels nations or neighborhoods productivity or labor quality and hence perperson income or earnings is posited to rise beyond the individual increase in productivity15 many of the studies that investigate variations across countries in schooling and growth estimate that nations initial stock of human capital eg average years of schooling significantly increases the national income level ie per capita gross domestic product there is some evidence that productivity and economic growth is achieved by educations enabling countries to adopt imported technologies thereby allowing less developed nations to catchup with more developed nations research also suggests that postsecondary education in particular is important to continued growth in more developed nations perhaps because workers must possess some minimum quality level to utilize or develop technological advances these crosscountry studies do not find that increases in educational attainment cause perperson income to grow beyond private returns however this result runs counter to conventional wisdom which holds that the rate at which highly qualified persons are supplied to the labor market must increase for nations growth rate to 14 economic growth achieved through increases in efficiency ie output per hour worked or per worker raises national living standards if as theorized greater productivity results in higher individual earnings for more information see crs report rl32987 longterm growth of the us economy significance determinants and policy by craig k elwell 15 some growth accounting models only take into account the direct or private monetary return to human capital investment for example if individual productivity increases by 10 due to an additional year of education then average productivity across the nation will rise by 10 due to the average schooling increase these individual effects on economic growth are discussed later in this report in terms of the private return to schooling other models allow for the possibility of human capital externalities that is the average productivity increase across all workers in the prior example might exceed 10 these models and external effects are the subject of the above discussion crs7 continue rising over time many analysts question the accuracy of this counterintuitive finding primarily because of measurement error in international databases on education that worsens when change in schooling level over time is the variable of interest16 the macrogrowth literature also may confuse additional education leading to income growth with higher incomes leading to more schooling ie reverse causality the samples of nations utilized may include unrepresentative outliers that bias the results as well17 moreover in developing nations particularly most of the increase in highly educated labor has found employment in such industries as government retail trade and business personal and other services where good output measures are lacking in national income and product accounts18 studies that take this approach also generally omit such countryspecific institutional characteristics as regulatory structures and political systems for example these among other omitted factors eg the quality of nations educational system presumably cause public rates of return to vary by country and within country over time as the characteristics themselves change19 accordingly the very design of crosscountry studies makes them less useful to policymakers than analyses of their own or similar nations thus for example an analysis of member countries of the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd estimates that increases in persons with postsecondary education in particular have significant and positive effect on economic growth20 another study finds that the significant positive impact of human capital on oecd nations adoption of technology from abroad increases the higher the level of schooling in these developed countries21 research suggests however that in oecd nations education policies intended to promote increases in the rate of economic growth will have small effects compared to the countries current growth rates22 while education does appear to contribute to economic growth in developed nations it probably should not be viewed as panacea 16 alan b krueger and mikael lindahl education for growth why and for whom journal of

social capital in the oecd countries crs8 an alternative approach that focuses on geographic areas within the united states avoids the abovementioned shortcomings of crosscountry studies it similarly posits that in the presence of externalities greater stock of human capital ie higher average schooling in an area will cause area income from jobs ie average wages to rise above the earnings gains accorded more education persons ie the private return to education one analysis utilizes us states as the labor market area of interest it estimates modest imprecise effects of variations in state average schooling levels on state average wages after controlling for individual effects nonetheless the authors note that the social rate of return which they estimate ranges from 1 to 3 is still of sufficient size to justify significant public subsidies for education23 as the study is confined to white males aged 4049 secondary education and states other analyses that cover different demographic groups educational levels and geographic areas may yield more substantial social returns indeed another study finds that others do benefit to greater degree from employment in metropolitan areas with large shares of workers having postsecondary education specifically one percentage point increase in metropolitan areas share of workers with at least college degree raises the earnings of high school dropouts by 19 high school graduates by 16 persons with some college by 12 and the earnings of college graduates themselves by 04 beyond the private return to education24 these results imply that the attraction of college educated workers is worthwhile component of publicly funded economic development programs for urban areas an increase in the proportion of college educated persons at the national level is unlikely to yield such large social returns however because the estimates reflect holding constant the collegeeducated share of workers in all other metropolitan areas like the statebased study discussed above this analysis also finds that increases at the lower end of the educational distribution ie greater share of high school graduates in metro area are unlikely to generate large positive externalities perhaps then if human capital is expanded at higher levels of education the benefits of the spillover are in the form of technological progress and higher productivity if human capital is expanded at lower levels the benefits are in the form of reductions in crime and lower welfare participation25 23 daron acemoglu and joshua angrist how large are

individual to anyone else to be social benefits others categorize intrafamily transfers eg to children as private benefits this report takes the latter approach researchers also differ in their classification of benefits as monetary or nonmonetary some regard an individuals compensation earnings and benefits to be the sole financial return to education others include labor market advantages more often enjoyed by better paid persons eg less unemployment as monetary benefits this report adopts the latter convention own health better own health probably is the leading nonfinancial benefit of education to individuals26 studies find strong positive association between years of schooling and health status measured in various ways eg selfreported health mortality rates and physiological indicators of health three not mutually exclusive explanations typically are offered for this direct correlation more educated persons are less likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors perhaps because they are better informed about health matters their superior problemsolving skills may enable them to better utilize the health care system as well childhood illness may curtail years spent in school healthier students may more readily add to their human capital and have more years in which to reap the rewards of their additional schooling futureoriented persons ie those willing to defer rewards are more likely to invest in all types of human capital both education and health the first explanation suggests that more education causes better health in the next explanation causality runs in the opposite direction from better health to more education the final explanation implies there are one or more unobserved factors eg genetic endowment associated with schooling that actually determine health status if such variables are not accounted for educations role in the improvement of health may be overstated the degree to which each explanation is correct has important implications for policymakers if goal is having healthier population in order to minimize medicare and medicaid expenditures for example and causality largely runs from health to education then greater education spending would not be the most efficient means to the goals realization 26 other private nonpecuniary benefits include more efficient household management eg greater use of new technologies for the home among higher educated individuals and attainment of desired family size eg level of educational attainment is directly related to effective use of contraceptives crs10 although they do not eliminate the possibility of reverse causality or the role of unobserved factors several analyses show that more schooling does exert an independent and positive effect on health27 one study finds that education significantly improves the health outcomes of older workers ie 5161 year old women and men28 the effect of greater educational attainment on health outcomes appears stronger among older women than men health status is measured by self reported ratings of such abilities as climbing stairs walking and bathing another analysis utilizes as health indicators the likelihood of having worklimiting conditions and of requiring personal care it suggests that males who extend high school attendance by one year reduce their probability of incurring worklimiting disabilities by 26 percentage points29 an additional year of high school also lowers the likelihood of subsequently requiring personal care by statistically significant 067 percentage points more education extends the life expectancy of adults according to third study another year of high school lowers their mortality rate by 46 percentage points30 child wellbeing not only does schooling level improve an individuals own health but it also may improve child wellbeing through better health outcomes study of the causal relationship between parental education and childrens health estimates that more educated mothers give birth to healthier infants specifically increased college attendance among firsttime mothers significantly reduces the incidence of both low birth weight and premature delivery31 this in turn implies large savings both for families and society given the higher medical educational and other costs associated with lowbirthweight youngsters in addition greater parental education may enhance child wellbeing through improved educational outcomes an analysis finds that oneyear increase in parental schooling significantly dampens the likelihood of child repeating grade by 27 percentage points32 it also finds that moreeducated parents improve their childrens schooling outcomes by lowering the probability of dropping out of high 27 for review of the literature see michael

another study alternatively estimates that after controlling for intergenerational ability bias due to unobserved inherited endowments and to marital sorting ie more educated women tend to wed more educated men mothers schooling has negative but not quite statistically significant influence on child educational attainment while fathers schooling has positive and significant impact33 when individuals enter the labor market rather than continuing in school it is unlikely that they consider how their choices will affect the wellbeing of their potential children college education may for example improve parenting skills in the future or the kind of social network to which they can offer their children access some policymakers similarly may not take an intergenerational perspective when developing educational policy if there is public component to this private benefit and it is not recognized underinvestment in education over the longrun may result earnings in the nottoodistant past individuals who graduated from high school were considered wellequipped to succeed in the labor market that is obtain comparatively wellpaid jobs that they could remain in for most of their work lives the situation appears to have changed over the last few decades when the pace of economic change accelerated the wage gap between less and more educated workers widened as postsecondary education became seemingly necessary prerequisite to highpaid secure employment34 although people reportedly think it longer possible to obtain lifetime jobs individuals with postsecondary schooling are regarded as more likely to adjust to technological changes without experiencing unemployment and to better rebound from displacement related to international competition for example35 higher education thus appears to have become more important to employment if not job security and to earnings stability over the course of working life the labor market returns to education typically are manifested not only through greater probability of high earnings and low unemployment but also through more common employer provision of benefits eg health insurance and better working conditions but the most studied labor market benefit of education is earnings according to human capital theory individuals wages are based on their initial productivity eg ambition and innate ability investments in their productivity eg schooling and onthejob training and supplydemand conditions for persons with 33 jere r behrman and mark r rosenzweig does increasing womens schooling raise the schooling of the next generation american economic review vol 92 1 2002 note this study has been criticized for among other things its probably unrealistic assumption that twins differ in terms of education but not in terms in other characteristics or experiences that can affect the schooling level of their children 34 crs report 951081 education matters earnings by educational attainment over three decades by linda levine 35 for more information see crs report rl32292 offshoring aka offshore outsourcing and job insecurity among us workers by linda levine crs12 comparable skills and experience economists assume that people make the same sort of implicit benefitcost comparisons with regard to undertaking further productivity investments as other investments specifically people seemingly decide whether to accumulate more human capital by comparing anticipated lifetime benefits eg the stream of earnings from college graduation to retirement with costs eg earnings forgone while attending college and outofpocket expenses for tuition and books less student aid36 if this comparison yields an anticipated rate of return that exceeds the market interest rate on alternative investments then wealth maximizing individuals are hypothesized to continue their schooling empirical studies that utilize variety of statistical techniques estimate the causal effect of education on individual earnings that is the private monetary return to one more year of schooling ranges from about 6 to 1137 as this generally compares favorably with the return on other investment opportunities the pursuit of additional formal education seems an economically sound choice for the average person the profitability of education appears to vary by population subgroup eg income category and gender schooling level college major and type of postsecondary institution eg research universities versus liberal arts colleges38 there also is evidence that the average return to education changes over time in the united states it has risen in recent decades as the increased demand for college educated workers seemingly outpaced their increased supply and estimation of the rate of return is subject to limitations that can bias it downward or upward eg the cost of postsecondary school may be omitted as may unobserved determinants of schooling level neither the quality of education nor the differential probability of unemployment by education level typically are taken into account and schooling as well as earnings may be incorrectly reported nonetheless rate of return analysis remains an objective tool for comparing the costs and benefits of education and for 36 because of difficulties involved in measuring these costs empirical research often ignores some or all of them thus the estimated wage advantage conferred by education usually reflects the gross rather than net return 37 david card the causal effect of education on earnings in orley ashenfelter and david card eds handbook of labor economics vol 3a oxford uk elsevier ltd 1999 note the range reflects the difference in rates of return calculated by directly including educational attainment in ordinaryleastsquares ols regressions and by using instrumental variables iv to represent schooling it initially was thought that use of the iv technique would improve estimation of educations unique benefits by accounting for unobservable variables not picked up in ols analyses however the returns to education utilizing ivs have been greater and less precisely estimated than those derived from ols while this could be interpreted to mean that the upward ability bias in ols estimates of educations rate of return is more than offset by the downward measurement bias it also could mean that iv estimates capture heterogeneity within the student population with regard to the latter possibility the private return based on the iv technique might be higher because it reflects the aboveaverage earnings gains of children from lowincome families who are the individuals most likely to be affected by increases in the legal minimum age at which one can leave school and by the proximity of relatively more affordable community colleges changes in compulsory schooling laws and distance to community colleges are two commonly employed ivs 38 laura w perna the benefits of higher education sex racialethnic and socioeconomic group differences review of higher education vol 29 1 fall 2005 crs13 arriving at an estimate albeit not precise of the economic value of schooling both for individuals and society39 concluding remarks voluminous literature on the private marketbased return to education has developed over the last 40 years with advances in statistical techniques applied to estimation of the earnings premium from schooling as recently as the 1990s these studies of the causal relationship between schooling and earnings have produced rates of return to education that suggest undertaking further formal education is financially worthwhile endeavor for individuals schooling becomes even more beneficial in light of the nonmonetary returns it seemingly accords individuals although values are rarely developed for this kind of benefit40 knowledge of the size of the social return to education is important for policymakers in their deliberations over public investment in education visavis other government functions and in their deliberations over schooling expenditures by the public sector compared to spending by students and their families in contrast to their longstanding work on private marketbased rates of return researchers have much more recently focused on the degree to which formal education causes public monetary and nonmonetary benefits the number of such empirical studies is increasing but estimates of the social returns magnitude remain scarce results are inconsistent as well but they do provide evidence of the existence of human capital externalities that is government investment in education is justified although the progress made in estimating the private monetary return to schooling implies that researchers will be able to one day approximate the magnitude of its public return that day may be some time off given the daunting analytical task of precisely measuring the monetary and nonmonetary benefits that spill over from highly educated persons to other members of society 39 menon an evaluation of four decades of ror analysis in higher education policy marking p 379 40 two analysts utilize results from other empirical research on the private nonmonetary benefits of education to develop estimates of their value after making stringent assumptions they calculate that the improvement in an individuals own health from an additional year of schooling is worth onetime increase of some 9000 in net family assets while the value of gains in childrens cognitive development due to parents additional education varies widely it perhaps is equal to an average annual increase in family income of at least 500 and the increase in household efficiency related to another year of schooling is valued at about 300 per year on average barbara
