from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to mannpsuedu subject re out in latest j climate date thu aug 4 094954 2005 mike gabi was supposed to be there but wasnt either i think gabi isnt being objective as she might because of tom c i recall keith telling that her recent paper has been rejected not sure if outright or not gabi sees the issue from da perspective not whether any curve is nearer the truth but just what the envelope of the range might be there is an issue coming up in ipcc every curve needs error bars and having them is all that matters it seems irrelevant whether they are right or how they are used changing timescales make this simple use impractical we have new version of hadcrut just submitted so soon thell be hadcrut3v and crutem3v the land doesnt change much this has errors associated with each point but the paper doesnt yet discuss how to use them ill attach this paper only just been submitted to jgr not in this format though this format lays it out better thanks for reminding scott cheers phil at 0848 04082005 you wrote hi phil thanks for the heads up will be prepared for this then i thought that gabi hegerl was involved with this guy doesnt she know better it is disturbing that she hasnt set them straight on this by the way as you may or may not have heard its been discovered that there is major error in von storch et 04 that they now appear to be trying to hide they have some obscure article in an italian journal where they attempt to justify the error there are several comments that have been or are soon to be submitted to science about this as it turns out they introduces spurious step in their supposed implementation of the mbh98 procedure in which they detrended the series first gives completely wrong results caspar ammann and gene wahl and david ritson of stanford have both independently discovered this because they noticed that amplitude of the calibrated signal in vs04 scales with the signaltonoise ratiothis was the first clue that there was major problem there may be calls upon science for them to retract their paper the results are completely wrong aside from the problems w the gkss simulation you can expect to hear more about this soon ill remind scott about the proxies he and zhang are in the process of screening the proxy series for temperature signals etc once theyve done that should be more useful i expect well be able to get you some stuff by late august i did hear about the 3 papers coming out in science apparently donald kennedy is doing an editorial that will discuss this in the context of the whole barton business that should be interestingthere will be articles by both gavin and steve sherwood on realclimate in coordination with the publication of the papers in science express this should help turn the debate around talk to you later mike phil jones wrote mike hes been working with myles allen tim went to the first meeting of this dutch funded project near oxford last week tim said they were doing some odd things like correlating all the proxy series they had with cet yes cet even the few sh proxies they have the others who went to the meeting were zorita and moberg zorita was still showing the gkss run with moberg series even though its forcing is too large it doesnt have aerosols in the 20th century and has spin up problems for the first 200 years meeting wasnt that productive according to tim there was belief amongst those there that all trees you used have lost lowfreq but this isnt true as you know also it was good job keith wasnt there he didnt go as his father died the weekend before and hes not been in cru since as martin assumed that rcs was developed by esper who also wasnt there tim put them right on this one but rcs isnt applicable for normal tree sites nor useful for bristlecones tim said esper was wrong is his use of rcs but they wouldnt accept that as esper wasnt there to defend himself basically only tim knew anything about proxy data especially trees tim got the impression that they wanted to find that mbh is wrong given the previous comment as you werent there they are using double standards so in conclusion act carefully dont jump in but some carefully thought through comments should be productive suggest they read the revg article martin isnt associated with the contrarians but hes not in possession of the all the facts he isnt aware of caspers work nor your latest study which you sent the other day nor rutherford et there still seems to be belief in these lower responding proxies this is something we want to work on more here as the only way it seems to show that these lowerfreq proxies arent that great is to use higherfreq proxies when youre back or sometime can you remind scott to send your latest set of proxies ill have some time in the autumn to work on them as the ar4 should be in by aug 12 science should be publishing 3 papers on the msu issue by the end of aug or early sept this is mearswentz santer et and sherwood et latter shows that sondes are only truly reliable when flown at night daytime ones have all manner of problems with heating just like air temps on board ships hence the nmat series ill forward another email for interest cheers phil at 0340 04082005 you wrote hi phil thanks yes im in china now as you might imagine things have been very busy but calming down bit looks like barton may be backing down martin juckes has an invited talk in my session i invited him because he was working w stott et and so i assume he was legit and not associated with the contrarians but if hes associated w the dutch group he may actually be problem do you have additional information about him and what he has been up to thanks mike phil jones wrote mike good to hear it is out hope the changeover is going ok and life is getting back to normal if youre not gone to china yet youll meet someone called martin dukes hes giving talk at your session he knows about maths etc but not much about paleo might need some education but is probably ok not met him but tim has doing some worked funded by the dutch govt on the hockey stick cheers phil at 0405 03082005 you wrote dear colleagues fyi two papers attached first reprint rutherford et is now out in latest issue of journal of climate this paper aside from addressing other more scientificallyworthwhile issues also happens to discredit most of the mcintyre and mckitrick claims second preprint mann et is formally in press ie has gone off to the ams production staff in journal of climate this paper strongly challenges the conclusions of von storch et 2004 and raises some methodological issues w the approach used by moberg et 2005 feel free to pass along to others thanks mike michael mann associate professor director
