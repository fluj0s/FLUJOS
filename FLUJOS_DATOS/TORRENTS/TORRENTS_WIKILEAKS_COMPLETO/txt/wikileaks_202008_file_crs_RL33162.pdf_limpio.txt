membercountries grant each other preferen tial treatment in tr ade rtas may be categorized as bilateral multilateral or subregional with formal definitions these terms are sometimes used loosely to describe various groupings bilateral trade agreement is usually an agreement be tween two countries to reduce tariffs and quotas on items between themselves while this definition seemingly indicates an agreement between just two countries it is some times used to describe trade agreements involving more than two countries httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33162crs2 1 in addition to the trade arrangements described in this section in which member countries extend reciprocal preferential treatment there are trad arrangements under which one party agrees to extend nonreciprocal preferential trea tment to the imports of country or group of countries unilaterally such arrangements primarily involve developed countries extending nonreciprocal preferential treatment to the imports from developing countries 2 for the impact of free trade agreements see crs report rl31356 free trade agreements impact on us trade policy by william h cooper 3 world trade organization the changing landscape of re gional trade agreements by joann crawford and roberto v fi orentino discussion paper 8 2005 4 ibidthere are number of types of arrangements including free trade agreements customs unions common markets and economic unions1 free trade agreements ftas are the most common form of regional economic integration in which members of group remove tariffs and some nontariff barriers to trade among member countries2 at the same time each member retains its independent trade policy including its tariffs towards nonmem ber countries ftas are those in which member countries agree to eliminate tari ffs and nontariff barriers on trade in goods within the free trade area but each country maintains its own trade policies including tariffs on trade outside the region ftas acc ount for 84 of all rtas in force in the world and 96 of those that are pending the likely reason there are more ftas than customs unions is that they can be concluded more quick ly and require less policy coordination among members in an fta member countries maintain their own trade policy visavi s nonmember countries3 the uschile free trade agreement is an example of bilateral fta customs unions are agreements in which members conduct free trade among themselves and maintain common trad policy towards nonmembers these agreements require the establishment of common external tariff and harmonization of external trade policies such agreem ents imply greater loss of autonomy over the parties commercial policies and require longer and more complex negotiations and implementation periods geographical considerations play an important role in defining the objective of economic and sometimes political integration among the member countries4 the southern common market mercosur in south america is an example of customs union common markets are those in which memb er countries go beyond customs union by eliminating barriers to labor and capital flows across national borders within the market the european union is the most prominent example of common market in economic unions member countries rge their economies even further than common markets by establishing common currency and therefore unified monetary policy along with other common economic institutions the 12 members of the european union that have adopted the euro as common currency is the most significant example of group of countries that has gone from customs union to an economic unionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33162crs3 5 pruzin daniel challenges posed to devel oping nations by upswing in regional trade agreements international

under negotiation or consideration rta activities have intensified in all world regions particularly in the western hemisphere and asiapacific6 motivations for forming regional trade agreements while economic motivations may be major driving force countries form rtas for number of reasons political nd security factors also play role in forming rtas countries usually enter in to trade agreements to improve their countrys or regions bargaining position in global negotiations ttract foreign direct investment to increase economic growth achieve economies of scale and expand export markets countries also see rtas as building blocks for further trade liberalization under the world trade organi zation wto or for forming larger free trade areas such as the ftaa expanding market access is probably the primary motivation for entering into trade agreements rtas give the signatories trading preferences in each others markets while excluding other nations from the same privileges these preferential trade arrangements reduce tariffs and other trade barriers among trading partners providing partners with broader market access for their goods nd services trade liberalization allows countri to achieve economies of scale as they are able to expand their export market smaller count ries benefit from trade agreements b ecause producers in these countries can lower th eir unit costs by producing larger volumes for regional markets in addition to their own smaller domestic markets7 when more units of good or service can be produ ced on larger scale companies will have better chance to decrease cost of production attracting foreign direct investment f di is another reason for forming rtas especially for developing countries the wering of foreign i nvestment restrictions through trade agreements improve invest or confidence in country which helps attract fdi multinational fi rms invest in countries to gain access to markets but they also do it to lower production costs one of the motivating factors in mexicoshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33162crs4 8 crawford and fiorentino p 16 9 crawford and fiorentino p 10interest in forming nafta was to attract fdi it was also motivating factor for central american countries and the do minican republic in the caftadr the slow progress in multilateral negotiations may also contribute to the increasing interest in regiona l trade blocs some count ries may see smaller trade arrangements as building blocks for multilateral agreements for example the united states recently ratified caftadr and is moving forward on negotiations with panama and the andean countries as pa rt of its overall trade strategy for free trade in the americas some countries form rtas for political reasons governments may seek trade agreements as way to pr omote peace or increase regiona l security countries may want to demonstrate good governance by locking in political and economic reforms through trading partnerships larger countries may use rtas to forge new geopolitical alliances and strengthen diplomatic ties which could ensure or reward political support for example the united states formed rtas with israel and jordan as way of reaffirming us s upport of these countries and to strengthen relations with them some analysts believe that the choice of rta partners is increasingly based on political and security concerns and not so much on economic rationale8 the americas and regi onal trade agreements the formation of rtas throughout the world has intensified in the last few years with countries in the americas for ming notable share of the worlds total thirtynine of the 170 agreements in for ce around the world involve countries in the western hemisphere europe has the greates t concentration of rtas in the world with the

nation mfn principle in general the mfn principle requires that trade concessions granted to one wto member are to be applied to the trade of all other signatories rtas by definition run counter to the mfn principle because products of rta member countries are given preferential treatment over nonmember products11 however the wto allows member countries to form regional trade agreements under strict rules the wto position is that regional trade agreements can often support th wtos multilateral trading system by allowing groups of c ountries to negotiate rules and commitments that go beyond what was possible at the time under the wto the wto has committee on regional trade agreements that examines regional groups and assesses whether they are consistent with wto rules12 wto members are

in trade in goods between developing country members and allows developing countries to form preferential trading arrangem ents without the conditions under article xxiv15 for nonreciprocal

effects of trade integration supporters of trade integration in the americas view hemis pheric free trade as supporting us economic and politi cal interests in several ways they argue that the movement towards trade integration is bene ficial for us economic prosperity and will serve to strengthen democratic reg imes and support us values and security interests forming closer economic relations with countri in the region is seen by some as means to improve cooperation on ot her issues such as the environment and antidrug efforts us opponents to re gional integration in the americas are concerned that hemispheric free trade would lead to loss of jobs in the united states they argue that trade agreements would result in us companies shifting production to lowerwage countries with w eak labor and envir onmental standards economists are in general agreement that rtas can provide economic benefits but not that there are also associated costs in general they see rtas as beneficial for an economy to the extent that they provide trade creation over trade diversion when trade agreement lowers trade barriers on good production may shift from domestic producers to lower cost foreign producers and result in substituting an imported good for the domestic good this process is called trade creation trade creation provides economic bene fits as consumers have wider choice of goods and services available at lower costs trade creation also results in adjustment costs however usually in the form of domestic job losses as production shifts to another country httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33162crs9 16 beyond borders p 41 17 crawford and fiorentino 18 ibidthe drawback to rtas is that they may result in trade diversion because they are not fully inclusive of all regional trad ing partners trade diversion results when country forms an rta and then shifts th purchase of goods or services imports from country that is not an rta partner to country that is an rta partner for example if the united states was purchasing an item from asia prior to nafta and then began to purchase this item from mexico after nafta was enforced solely as result of the trade agreement even though the asian country was the lowercost producer then nafta would be associated with trade diversion mexico would now be the producer of that item not b ecause it produced the good more efficiently but because it was receiving preferential access to the us market the effects of trade creation versus trade diversion are complex and difficult to measure much depends on the market structure and costs in which an rta intervenes and the longterm dynamic effects of the rta report by the inter american development bank i adb states that most studi have found that trade creation greatly dominates trade diversion in most regional integration trade arrangements the study indicates that in the case of nafta all members stand to gain particularly mexico in the case of mercosur the study indicates that argentina brazil and uruguay have the potential of increasing their gdp16 while an increase in rtas throug hout the western hemisphere may have benefits they can also result in complex networks of preferential trade arrangements there are an increasing number of overlapping trade agreements each with its own tariff schedule and rules of origin regime some economists believe that these arrangements may pose challenges for veloping countries and put them in weaker position than under the multilateral framework17 developing countries may have difficulties in navi gating the maze of rules that accompany rtas and they may not be able to fully benefit from the new trade rules another disadvantage for developing countries is that rtas may result in decreasing reliance on nonreciprocal trade preferences such as th dutyfree treatment th at andean countries receive from the us atpdea according to the wto study on rtas the replacement of preferential trade arrangements with rtas could present developing countries with challenges as they trans ition from nonreciprocal trade preferences to mutual trade liberalization18 these disadvantages have the possibility of perpetuating poverty in the region us trade policy in latin america and the caribbean since the passage of nafta the ited states canada and mexico have pursued trade liberalization

issues and implications continuation of bilaterals and regional trade agreements in the absence of an ftaa it is highly possible that the number of bilateral rtas in the western hemisphere may continue to increase some analysts note that as the number of rtas increase there is possibility of consolidating existing agreements into larger trading arrangements in regions of the world as in the case of the eu which went through five consecutive enlargements bringing the membership of the union from six to 25 members62 another example of consolidation or expansion is the bilateral agreement between the united states and canada in the 1980s which helped to bring focus on the uruguay r ound of multilateral negotiations and the formation of nafta however some believe that this strategy is not the best course of action for the unite d states one of the reasons given is that the focus on bilaterals is distracting the united states from its leadership role in energizing the ftaa negotiations anothe r reason given is that the bilateral agreements are doing little to resolve problems such as the trade issues related to agriculture or strengthening the trade relationship between the united states and brazil63 completion of an ftaa all the countries of the western hemis phere with the exception of cuba have been active participants in the establis hment of an ftaa in august 2005 senior representatives from all ftaa countries met in mexico caribbean trade officials urged countries to hold an administra tive meeting prior to the november 2005 summit of the americas to

il argentina and ve nezuela were opposed to signing up for the talks mostly due to disagreements over agriculture and intellectual property rights some observers are pessimis tic about the nearterm po ssibility of restarting the talks but there are many analysts who believe that pursuing multilateral talks would be advantageous for the region some have expressed hope that progress on agriculture at the wto and that the n ovember 2005 summit of the americas could help move the negotiations forward ccording to study by the government accountability office gao there are thr ee factors that have been impeding progress in the ftaa negotiations 1 the united states and brazil have made little progress in resolving basic differen ces on key negotiation issues 2 member governments have shifted energy and engagement from the ftaa to bilateral and other multilateral trade agreements and 3 two mechanisms intended to facilitate progress new negotiating structure and th cochairmanship by the us and brazil have failed to do so65 the gao study found that officials from many nations and regional groups in the western hemisphere have indicated continued commitment to establishing mutually beneficial ftaa66 if the ftaa talks move forward and an agreement is signed it would provide considerable new trade nd investment opportunities for the 34 participating countries for the united states an ftaa w ould support the us interest in gaining deeper access to markets in south america the united states might also benefit in that an ftaa could reinforce economic and political reforms that have occurred in latin america and could help build support for other important us goals such as drug interdiction improving environm ental and labor c onditions supporting educational reforms and reinforcing democracy67 in terms of trade the us position has been that the ftaa would be significant if it achieves trade liberalization beyond that which has been accomplished under the wto especially in the areas of liberalization of trade in services and investment liberalization in government procurement enforcement of intellectual property rights and the inclusion of labor and environmental issues68 for countries in latin america and th caribbean the ftaa may help national income levels in the region but not ll economic sectors would benefit

evidence that the more open country is to trade the higher its growth performance among the reports recommendations is that countries in latin america need to liberalize trade and strengthen their financial systems to help sustain economic growth69 however latin american countri would have to take additional measures to benefit from trade liberalization and improve economic conditions one study on the effects of an ftaa on latin america reports that any significant effect on incomes and inequality would take very long time to show up it states that the longterm economic health of latin amer ica would require much improvement in education70 trade integration and us interests trade integration in the americas has gained momentum since the 1990s the possibility of forming an ftaa or trade agreements with andean countries and panama is of interest to policym akers because of the economic and pol itical implications for the united states as the effects of nafta on the us mexican and canadian economies become clearer policymakers are faced with the issue of whether trade agreements are beneficial to the united states and how the united states should proceed in its trade policy in the western hemisphere an underlying question is whether the ited states should continue to deepen trade integration in the americas and if so whether negotia ting bilateral trade agreements is the most appropriate trade policy as pointed out earlier some analysts do not believe that bilateral trade agreements are the best course of action because they take away the focus from energizing the ftaa negotiations and are slowing down the process ot hers believe that rtas have led to the consolidation of trade agreements into larger free trade areas in other parts of the world and that the same thing could occur in the western hemisphere over time another issue is whether the united stat should deepen integration with its nafta trading partners recent study by senior fellows at the institute for international economics on the achievements and challenges of nafta finds that while nafta has been successful in prom oting regional trade and investment it also has limitations the authors propose th at nafta be upgraded and that the united states canada and xico should convert their fr ee trade agreement into customs union and adopt common external ta riff they believe that
