auditors leonard gauci ottavia cova united nations nations unies office of internal oversight services unhcr audit service audit of unhcr information and communications techn ology management ar200616604 executive summary in june and july 2006 oios conducted an audit of u nhcrs information and communications technology management function at its headquarters in geneva unhcrs core ict functions fall under the responsibility of the division of in formation systems and telecommunications dist the core application system is msrp manag ement systems renewal project which is an enterprise resource planning system overall assessment the audit did not reveal major weaknesses nonethe less number of measures should be taken to strengthen the governance and administrati ve structure of the overall ict operations in oios opinion the implementation of the recomme ndations set out in the report would bring the management of ict more in line with best practi ces and would demonstrate managements commitment to ensuring proper control in this area oios was pleased to note that the director of dist has accepted the recommendations made and i s in the process of implementing them audit findings and recommendations an ict governance board was set up in may 2006 dea ling with ict initiatives in oios view its roles and responsibilities should be exte nded to include the oversight and coordination of all ict strategic and policy matters in unhcr there should be mechanism for monitoring and reporting to the board the actual co sts and results of each project against the approved budgets and plans there are still ict matters in unhcr that do not fa ll under the mandate of dist oios recommended that dist be assigned full responsibili ty for all ict products and services this would avoid duplication and inefficiency and make i t easier to implement consistent ict policies and methodologies unhcr should clarify its position with regard to th application of ictrelated instructions issued by the secretariat and take the initiati ve to establish framework for exchanging information and knowhow for instance dist could consider adopting methodology for the development of new systems already in use in the and apply this on consistent basis unhcr should develop and implement an information m anagement strategy this will define missioncritical information and identify any busin esses processes that need to be modified in order to take full advantage of the facilities affo rded to unhcr by its automated systems dist should carry out postimplementation review of msrp to evaluate the investment made and ensure that users take full advantage of t he facilities offered by the system lessons learned can be applied to ongoing and future proje cts the budgeting process for dist should be reviewed nd linked to funding dist is already using the international computing centres hosti ng services and should look at other areas where outsourcing may be advantageous as well as pportunities for synergy within the system there are service agreements between di st and the various user units in unhcr linking funding to service agreements should bring about more accountability and transparency in the use of funds for ict services and products dist does not have the autonomy to use training fun ds for its staff with ict functions including those in field locations and there are n established criteria for the allocation of such funds dist should be assigned budget for traini ng staff with ict functions to meet the obligations contracted in service agreements and s hould be allowed to apply the funds in line with set of criteria approved by the ict governan ce board with regard to user training in it skills the board has approved business case for training that leads to european computer driving licence certification and this should be im plemented without delay the working group entrusted with developing secur ity policy for unhcr should conduct risk analysis and all policies and procedures and d ocumentation should be compiled in controlled security manual this group should revie w the existing audit trails and security reports for improvement and implement policy for their review oios recommended the appointment of chief information security officer to be the first point of contact for all matters related to computer security in oios opin ion this is an opportune time to evaluate the effectiveness of the systems security features and those of the network infrastructure by conducting penetration tests unhcr does not have comprehensive business contin uity plan oios recommended that the high commissioner sets up task force to deal with all matters relating to business continuity planning including the categorization f missioncritical systems and data and to draw up project plan for its implementation dist was not aware of all the systems and databases that have been developed by endusers and run on standalone pcs this may result in dupl ication of systems and waste of effort while reports presented to management for decisionmaking may contain inaccurate data an electronic register that would record details of l the ict applications should be set up dist should periodically provide users with guidelines t hat will highlight the risks related to end user computing and provide guidance on safeguards and be st practices to mitigate these risks march 2007 table of contents chapter paragraphs i ii iii introduction audit objectives audit scope and methodology 1 3 4 5 6

technology management at its headqua rters in geneva the audit was conducted in accordance with the international stan dards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 unhcrs core ict functions fall under the responsib ility of the division of information systems and telecommunications dist the directo r of dist who is the chief information officer cio reports to the deputy high commission er in 2002 unhcr started to implement msrp management systems renewal project which is an enterprise resource planning system the implementation of the human resourcesglobal p ayroll modules in 2007 will complete the core aspects of this project 3 draft of this report was shared with the director of dist in november 2006 the comments which were received in january and march 2007 are reflected in this final report the director of dist has accepted most of the audit rec ommendations made and is in the process of implementing them ii audit objectives 4 the main objectives of the audit were to assess unhcrs ict governance and organizational st ructure determine requirements for the successful implement ation of unhcrs ict strategy assess unhcrs practices and plans for ict against the global ict strategy of the secretariat identify areas of ict that require the attention of unhcrs management to bring them in line with best practice iii audit scope and methodology 5 the audit addressed the general management of ict i n unhcr and focused on the relevant areas of information technology controls t hat fall under the responsibility of dist it did not examine the it controls over individual applica tion systems or the functionality aspects of such systems 6 the audit was conducted in accordance with isacas information systems audit and control association information systems auditing s tandards guidelines and procedures oios obtained an understanding of the computer environme nt at unhcr by using structured questionnaire tailored audit programmes covering the audit objectives were developed on the basis of the completed questionnaire during the au dit oios analysed applicable data and reviewed the available documents and other relevant records interviews were held with selected managers and staff 2 iv audit findings and recommendations governance ict governance 7 oios welcomes the establishment of the information and communications technology ict governance board 1 and sees this as an important step in strengthenin g unhcrs governance structure over ict in particular oios notes that while ultimate responsibility remains with the high commissioner board meetings are chaired by the deputy high commissioner who will be accountable for all decisi ons and will decide where consensus cannot be reached 2 this is critical aspect of governance which in oios experience with other organizations that when it was absent or not proper ly enforced has led to the failing of similar bodies 8 oios notes that the terms of reference of the board are focussed on the coordination of ict investments and projects during its first thr ee meetings the board mainly dealt with the review and assessment of proposed ict projects wh ile this is an important element of ict governance the ict governance board also has an im portant role to play in the formulation and implementation of ict policies dist would be expe cted to take the lead in the initiation of projects such as developing and implementing an inf ormation management strategy security policies and business continuity plans but these p rojects require an input from all user departments if this is lacking it is not likely that such policies will be effective the ict governance board is therefore the right forum for c oordinating these matters 9 business owners groups provide an important forum w here users can express their requirements with regard to their systems they so help to coordinate ict matters in particular with respect to security and system modifications for msrp there are two such groups one for the finance and supply chain modules and another fo r hrglobal payroll discussions with management indicate that the former is largely focu ssed on headquarters and field operations are not sufficiently involved with the implementation of msrp it is important that the business owners formally take over the ownership of an appli cation once this has been delivered and they are satisfied it meets their requirements there s hould be mechanism that clearly defines the ownership of all the systems and data and identifi the parties and their respective responsibilities to such systems and data these tails should be recorded on an electronic register as discussed under section f of this repor t 10 the department of international protection services and the division of operational support operate nonmsrp systems both the directors of di ps and dos are represented on the ict governance board this is welcome move towards i mproving governance over ict within the whole of unhcr there is still risk however tha t an ict project is initiated by one of these entit ies without dist being given the opportunity to review the technical specifications for compatibility with existing systems and application of appropriate met hodologies for project management and delivery dist indicated that this had led to incompatibility of systems in the past furthermore neither dips nor dos has business owners group and there is r oom for more synergy for example with dips and dos adopting the change control procedures operated by dist 1 adm0101 and iomfom 572006 of 28 june 2006 2 ibid 8 3 recommendation head2right the unhcrs ict governance board should extend its role and terms of reference from the app roval of business cases for ict initiatives to include the versight and coordination of all ict strategic and policy matter s throughout unhcr and b ensure that the ownership of systems and data is c learly defined and reflected in the electronic register r ec 01 11 dist agreed with the recommendation the electronic register will be included in dists strategic plan for the coming biennium dist stated that the scope and timing of project to implement would this be defined by june 2007 oios will close the recommendation once the role and terms of reference of the ict governance board are extended 12 oios noted that the discussions at the first three ict governance board meetings strongly indicated the need for prescreening to review busi ness cases to make sure that the scope of projects is properly defined the benefits are clea rly set out and all the cost elements have been captured oios recommended setting up task force for reviewing the business case for ict initiatives on projectbyproject basis to ensure the accuracy of the functional aspects prior to th business case being presented to the ict governance board oios was pleased to note that dist client managers work with units preparing business cases for projects to ensure robust submissions reach ict governance board 13 the ict boards terms of reference state that it is the responsibility of the business units to prepare the business case outlining how the project supports the organizations strategic objectives the costsbenefits the resource requir ements and the funding sources3 it is not yet clear what will happen after the business case for the project has been approved and whether there will be regular updates on the actual costs visà vis the approved budgeted amount it is important that the governance board is kept informe d if the final product does not meet the original objectives or if cost overruns are incurre d recommendation the unhcrs ict governance board should request tha t the chief information officer establishes mechanism f or monitoring and reporting to the board the actual costs and res ults of each project against the approved budgets and plans rec 02 14 dist agreed with the recommendation and stated that there is proposal to create project management officer in dist to monitor expen diture on projects technical issues and report on returnoninvestment this will be includ ed in dists strategic plan for the coming biennium oios will close the recommendation on confirmation that mechanism has been established to monitor and report to the board on t he actual costs and results of the approved projects 3 ibid 6 4 15 the current regulatory definition of the term s ecretariat 4 includes unhcr however unhcr has operated independently of the ict governance structures set at the secretariat level such as the information and comm unications technology board number of official documents 5 have been issued by the secretariat with the ai m of ensuring coherent and coordinated global management ict initiatives acros s departments and duty stations the unhcr electronic mail policy issued in june 2006 cl arifies how the secretarygenerals bulletin on the use of information and communication techno logy resources and data 6 applies to mail and related services and facilities other th an this unhcr has not followed the instructions set out in these documents and neither has there be an approach on the secretariats part requesting unhcr do so the lack of coordination n ict matters can lead to divergent policies while failure to take advantage of the investment lready made to develop strategies and policies could result in waste of resources 16 in oios view unhcr should clarify its position wi th regard to compliance with ict regulations and rules issued by the secretariat if unhcr remains outside the secretariats ict governance structure oios still sees plenty of opportunity for benefits to be gained through close cooperation between it and the secretariat for example the uns information technology services division itsd has specialized units for the undertaking of ict risk analysis that would form the basis for securit and business continuity plans earlier this year this division obtained iso 27000 certification cove ring the network systems at headquarters and is now providing training and guidance to ict ffices in duty stations to help them achieve certification on its part unhcr can provide advice based on its experience in implementing global erp system the two parties should also col laborate towards the establishment of common chart of accounts in compliance with interna tional public sector accounting standards recommendation head2right the unhcrs deputy high commissioner as chairperso n of the ict governance board should liaise with the chairma n of the secretariats information and communications techno logy board and clarify unhcrs position with regard to the app lication of ictrelated instructions issued by the secretariat and seek to establish framework through which both parties wi ll benefit through the exchange information and knowhow rec 03 17 dist agreed with the recommendation unhcr is clari fying its position visàvis ict related instructions issued by the secretariat as programme of the secretarygeneral unhcr the dhc cooperation with the secretariat takes pl ace through the high level committee on management hlcm ict network oios will close this recommendation on confirmation that unhcrs position with regard to the application of ictrelated instructions issued by the secretariat is clarified and framework at the di rector level is established for the exchange of information 4 stsgb200211 5 these include ga document a55780 information t echnology in the secretariat plan of action ga document a57620 information and communication t echnology strategy stsgb200317 information an d communications technology board stsgb200415 u of information and communication technology resources and data and stai200510 information and communication technology initiatives 6 stsgb200415 of 29 november 2004 5 b the role of the division of information systems and telecommunications 18 over the past four years unhcrs ict resources hav been focused on the implementation of msrp with the rolling out of th hrglobal payroll modules the role of dist will shift from that of developing project ma naging and implementing core systems to that of service provider the latter role will be aim ed at maintaining and running systems that will allow users easy access to data that is complete u ptodate and reliable dist also has the responsibility for ensuring that the investment mad in the new systems is exploited to the full the current structure and the ict roles and respons ibilities within dist will need to be redefined some posts will longer be required and there wil l be need to reallocate and retrain some staff 19 unless dist has full responsibility for all ict pro ducts and services within unhcr it will be difficult to coordinate ict matters includ ing the funding of ict resources this may lead to duplication inefficient provision of services t users failure to anticipate the needs of unhcr and possibly lack of accountability and transpare ncy on the other hand full responsibility for all ict products and services within unhcr will mak it easier for dist to adopt client oriented approach it will also give unhcr the opp ortunity to rationalize the budgeting and funding of ict resources recommendation head2right the unhcr division of information systems and telecommunications should be assigned full responsi bility for all ict products and services within unhcr rec 04 20 dist agreed with the recommendation this is being implemented through the office of the dhc the cio the ict gb and is reflected in curren t orb procedures appropriate doctrine continues to be disseminated to the organisation in the form of iomfoms policies and memoranda on important issues pertaining to this oios will close this recommendation on confirmation that full responsibility has been assi gned to dist b planning and organization information management strategy 21 unhcr does not have an information management im strategy the joint inspection unit in their 2002 report7 listed their observations concerning information m anagement within the united nations system organizations noting tha t square4 managing information resources effectively is not nly major organizational challenge but also provides an opportunity for enha ncing efficiency square4 the first step towards effective management of info rmation resources is to develop an organizationwide information management strateg square4 the information management strategy is distinct fro m an information technology strategy in the sense that information technology re tools for an effective information management process the informationman agement strategy should focus on identifying missioncritical information as well as systems required for effective 7 jiurep20029 managing information in the united nations system organizations management informatio n systems 6 information management square4 many organizations developed various im systems wit hout due regard to their integration into an organizationwide system design ed to facilitate improved management square4 in view of the fact that implementation of projects for im systems in particular erp systems is resourceintensive undertaking effec tive project management is critical to successful development and introduction of such systems square4 many system organizations have failed to meet th necessary and sufficient prior conditions required for costeffective implementati on of an erp system including streamlining existing work processes putting man agement structure in place and establishing an operational plan as well as identi fication of requirements and in depth review of functionality that erp applications provide 22 although ideally an im strategy should have been fo rmulated before embarking on the development of different information systems to cap italize on the efficiencies afforded by the new systems and infrastructure an im strategy would fine the role of ict in information management and clarify for example the linkages b etween msrp and other systems in addition the im strategy would be key reference for govern ance and oversight 23 on the other hand the absence of an im strategy co uld defeat the objective of consolidated and integrated data management systems there is risk that management and users will push for modifications to the system to accommodate existing processes this would result in inefficiencies and would invalidate the investment made in msrp 24 the responsibilities called for by this task are wi der in scope than those that fall within the duties of the cio and should be directed by the ic t governance board the board can appoint working group to prepare detailed work plan with timelines benchmarks and resources for developing and implementing an im strategy the str ategy would include definition of mission critical information and the identification of any business processes that need to be changed in order to take full advantage of the facilities affo rded by unhcr while oios is pleased to note that the ict governance board has already tasked th director of dos to constitute an extranet task force to help guide and integrate the developm ent of information management initiatives the ict governance board should ensure that unhcrs ict strategy is updated to reflect the conclusions deriving from the im strategy recommendation head2right the unhcrs ict governance board should establish working group to draw up detailed work plan with timelines benchmarks and resources required to develop and im plement an overall information management strategy the ict st rategy should be updated to support the objectives defined in the im strategy rec 05 25 dist agreed with the recommendation the dhc has as signed the director of external relations to prepare tors and chair task force th at will develop and implement an organisationwide information management strategy d ist will be an important member of this task force oios will close this recommendation once the inform ation management strategy has been established 7 b postimplementation review of msrp 26 unhcr has heavily invested in the implementation of msrp while labour costsavings will materialize over period of time the efficie ncies gained through the streamlining of processes should be immediately visible in number of areas for example the ability to track funds through unhcr and accurately report on expend iture and facilitate decisionmaking and to increase the speed and accuracy with which goods ca n be purchased and tracked from supplier to beneficiary 27 once the hrglobal payroll modules are implemented durin g 2007 dist should carry out postimplementation review pir to evaluate the investment made in msrp assess the benefits both to unhcr staff and the recipients of unhcrs services and compare the original claimed benefits and costs to actual ones also if the information is available such review can determine with some accuracy the real cost of the m srp project including the true cost of user time in terms of business disruption training lea rning curves and the rise in it support immediately following implementation the review wo uld also help to identify lessons learned which in turn can be applied to ongoing projects s uch as the treasury management system 28 apart from the accountability aspect it is importa nt that any problems are immediately addressed otherwise users may not take full advant age of the features offered by the system typical risk area is that of report generation whe re users may end up creating their own spreadsheets to calculate data with the inefficien cies and risks to the reliability of the data that this brings with it when the system provides the f acilities to extract the reports in question the best way to address these risks is to conduct use r satisfaction survey specific to msrp to assess the systems functional fit this would help to ssess users preparedness and their level of acceptance of the system ascertain the extent to w hich users are utilizing the functionalities provided by the various modules of the system and c onsequently the extent to which unhcr is gaining from the investment made recommendation head2right the unhcr division of information systems and telecommunications with the business owners should carry out postimplementation review of the msrp project to valuate the investment made and identify any aspects that need to be addressed to ensure that users take full advantage of the fac ilities afforded by the system preferably the deputy high commissioner as the chairperson of the ict governance board should ini tiate and sponsor the review the review should also determin what went well and what did not and any lessons learned shou ld be applied to ongoing and future ict initiatives rec 06 29 dist agreed with the recommendation the review wil l be included in dists strategic plan for the coming biennium the overall plan woul d be that the business owners execute the evaluation with input from dist with view to comp leting the review in 2008 oios will close this recommendation on the completion of the evalua tion 8 c financial management and human resources funding of ict resources and service agreement s 30 with the msrp project nearing completion the budge ting process for dist should be reviewed in the opinion of the cio there should be threetier costing structure namely operational costs to incorporate the costs necessar to keep things going as they are fixed costs such as contracted costs for hosting and other serv ices and the costs of investing in ict initiatives oios agrees with this structure in pr inciple investment in new systems is now covered by the procedures set by the ict governance board dist should continue to seek ways of optimizing the fixed ict costs through the outso urcing of certain services in particular within the common system oios notes that the intern ational computing centre icc is used for hosting services and unhcr has recently entered into contract for vsat additionally other areas such as the outsourcing of the provisi on of help desk services may be advantageous 31 it is also important that the budgeting and funding aspects are directly based on the ict strategy and on service agreements between dist and the user units at present there does not seem to be proper link between the budgeting and funding processes therefore with operational costs oios sees scope for conducting study to termine the criteria and the funding each unit should contribute towards the maintenance of existi ng systems criteria may include the number of workstations and users 32 the cio told oios that dist will be nominating nu mber of product managers to be responsible for seeing that the particular product or service will continue to support user requirements but as yet there are service delive ry or service level agreements between dist and unhcrs various user unitssections unless the standard of all services expected of dist are clearly defined and formalized in service cat alogue between dist and the individual user units with any additional services being defined i n bilateral agreement there is risk that the roles and responsibilities of both the providers an d users of ict services will not be properly understood this may lead to lack of accountabil ity and situations where users expect and demand certain services that dist is unable to deli ver or arrange to be outsourced in time on the other hand move towards activitybased budgeting and the linking of funding to service agreements should bring about more accountability nd transparency in the use of funds for ict services and products recommendations head2right the unhcr division of information systems and telecommunications should conduct study to determ ine the criteria and the amount of contribution each unit s hould make towards its operational costs rec 07 9 head2right the unhcr division of information systems and telecommunications should identify all those ict rvices that it is mandated to provide to each user unit and have thes services and respective responsibilities defined in service ca talogue copy of which should be made available on the intranet an services additional to those in the catalogue should address the resource implications and be defined in bilateral service agreement between dist and the user unit concerned rec 08 33 dist agreed with the recommendations stating that t hese principles will be included in dists strategic plan for the coming biennium oios will close these recommendations on confirmation that appropriate principles have been established for the provision of ict services to user units and subsequent funding of the services b training 34 dist does not have the autonomy to use training fun ds to ensure that staff in ict functions have the necessary skills ict training f unds should be used for specific and well targeted actions but at this stage there is est ablished criteria for the allocation of training fu nds examples of such criteria may include evidence of demand direct application of acquired knowledgeskills duration cost and willingness to cost share management could set up points system based on these criteria and utilize the trai ning funds accordingly this use of criteria would also show more transparency in the allocation of funds recommendation head2right the unhcr division of information systems and telecommunications should be assigned budget for training dist staff in ict functions to enable it to meet the ict strategy objectives and the obligations contracted in servic agreements dist should have full autonomy in the use of these training funds based on set of criteria approved by the ict gove rnance board rec 09 35 dist agreed with the recommendation dist elaborate d that training budget is being included in dists strategic plan for the coming bi ennium dist will work closely with budget and staff development section to devise criteria oios will close this recommendation on confirmation that budget for training staff in ic t functions has been made available to dist 36 in addition to technical staff system users should also be provided with basic level of training in the use of it systems this would help them better utilize the facilities afforded by the systems and appreciate the risks and measures that should be taken with regard to computer security it would make users more selfsufficient to certain degree and reduce the demand on dists resources these objectives can be achieved through unhcrwide training programme under which users of it systems will participate an d obtain the european computer driving licence ecdl certification 37 oios is pleased to note that in october 2006 the ic t governance board approved business case for improving the basic it skills of unhcr staff through training that leads to ecdl certification oios recommended that this iss ue be followed up and consistent plan for 10 funding and implementation be established dist indicated that it would be on the agenda of th governance board during spring 2007 d implementation and maintenance of systems methodologies for ict projects 38 dist does not consistently follow standard method ology for the development of new systems or projects these methodologies are impor tant to ensure that major ict initiatives are thoroughly planned adequately staffed and managed by suitably experienced project managers without proper methodology there is risk that t he project will not be substantively aligned with unhcrs goals and objectives there is also risk that staff member in field office who has implemented computerbased application will depar t without leaving sufficient documentation to enable continued maintenance of the system 39 dist stated that it is in the process of developing procedures to ensure that both unhcr and user needs are properly defined and incorporate d into the systems designs however there are procedures to ensure that appropriate securi ty and control features are incorporated in system design and that applications potentially vul nerable to fraudulent programme coding or data manipulation incorporate special security features and edit checks the quality of system design programming and documentation is not subject to qua lity assurance testing 40 the secretariat has adopted the prince ii method ology for all ict project highlevel evaluation this methodology addresses the secr etarygenerals four return indicators for ict projects namely service improvement throu gh quicker access to information andor higher quality services b process streamlining b eliminating duplication and having the potential for redeployment of resources c levera ging past investments by extending the life of current systems and d strong enabler in the cision making process once an ict project has received the approval of the project review committ ee itsd and dpkos communications and information technology service have been using rati onal rose as software development tool to ensure uniform architectural compliance recommendation head2right the unhcr division of information systems and telecommunications should adopt methodology for t he implementation of new systems and apply this on c onsistent basis this methodology should include procedures aimed at ensuring that appropriate security and control feat ures are incorporated within the system design as well as qu ality assurance testing rec 10 41 dist agreed with the recommendation and considered it implemented as processes are aligned and consistent with the ict gb processmeth odology established by unhcr oios appreciates the efforts made to create common met hodology and considers them good starting point for methodology implementation however oios considers that the current methodology documentation is still not fully complete and furth er work is required as outlined in the recommendation above 11 b change control 42 dist maintains four separate system environments ne for development two for testing and the live production environment after modi fications have been tested and approved the programme is transferred to the second test environ ment referred to as supporttest to await transfer to production programme that has been t ested and approved may remain in the supporttest environment for up to month before b eing transferred to the live environment while matters such as user training are finalized 43 oios pointed out that with several moves between th environments there is risk of unauthorized modifications being made to programm before its transfer to production dist however is convinced that their procedures with chnical and functional signoffs to different environments mitigates such risk it security and safety information systems risk analysis and security policy 44 the report of the board of auditors boa to the general assembly for the period ended 31 december 2005 8 includes section titled information and commun ication technology fraud prevention and management oios has taken n ote of the contents of this section and unhcrs responses and therefore will not repeat the boas recommendations here while the review undertaken by oios was at high level and d id not include detailed testing we would like to draw managements attention to other matters cerning it security oios believes that the implementation of the respective recommendations wi ll bring unhcr more in line with best practices and reduce the risk of fraud through unau thorized access to its systems and data 45 in response to the boas recommendations unhcr sta ted that dist has formed working group to develop an information security po licy in oios opinion the development of security policy should be preceded by an informatio n systems risk analysis to ensure all risk areas are addressed this is particularly important wher applications are linked through network since fraudster could gain access to an important system via minor one the analysis would also prevent an overstatement of controls that woul d reduce efficiency unnecessarily this risk analysis would be useful when developing business c ontinuity plans the secretariats itsd has conducted ict security risk assessments at all offices away from headquarters dist may wish to take advantage of the experience gained thr ough these reviews and request itsd to conduct similar one at unhcr 46 the security policy will need to be supported by tailed procedures and instructions covering all aspects of computer security within hcr these should be grouped in security manual given unhcrs operational and it environmen ts it will not be practical to maintain close supervision over all users and it is importan t that staff are made aware of good practices with regard to computer security so that they will exerc ise selfdiscipline copies of the manual and its distribution should be controlled so as not to comp romise security copy of the security policy and selected procedures should be made accessible t all staff over the intranet periodically dist should issue reminders to staff on the need to adhere to the security policy and procedures 8 aac961025 of 13 september 2006 12 recommendations head2right the unhcr division of information systems and telecommunications should undertake an information systems risk analysis and consider requesting the secret ariats information technology services division to perform an ict security risk assessment of its core application sy stems the results of the risk analysis would serve as the bas is for formulating comprehensive security policy and pro cedures rec 11 head2right the unhcr division of information systems and telecommunications should group all documentation r elated to computer security in security manual ownership and circulation of the manuals should be controlled t he security policy and those aspects of the manual that do not compromise the control over security should be made available over the intranet reminders to staff on the need to adhere to the sec urity policy and procedures should be issued at least once year r ec 12 47 dist agreed with the recommendations dist stated t hat unhcr would conduct risk analysisquality assurance exercise it is still t be determined whether it will be performed with inhouse resources or through itsd dist also in formed oios that the security manual is under preparation one of the first deliverables wa s the implementation of password security procedures iomfom862006 oios welcomes the work already done by dist and wi ll record the recommendations as implemented on confirmation that risk analysis has been conducted and the security manual is complete b security administration 48 the administration of security over unhcrs automat ed systems is currently fragmented and not sufficiently independent this function ca lls for coordination and should be detached from those of systems development and computer oper ations oios is pleased to note that in june 2006 the deputy high commissioner circulated an ele ctronic mail policy to all staff members9 in the event of breaches of the standards of accept able use the policy refers to the staff rules oios however would like to see specific reference to the responsibility for monitoring compliance with the policy and the steps to be take n in the event of noncompliance 49 person who is sufficiently independent of dayto day it operations

further separate execution from oversi ght recommendations head2right the unhcr division of information systems and telecommunications should assign person who is in dependent of systems development and maintenance as chief inf ormation security officer rec 13 head2right the unhcr division of information systems and telecommunications through the ict governance boar d and possibly in cooperation with inspector generals of fice should request each business unit to designate security liaison officer and an alternate who will be the first point of tact for all matters related to computer

submitted to orb in march 2007 as p art of the 2008 headquarters plan of dist implementation of the recommendation concerning the security liaison officers is contingent on the appointment of the information security officer oios takes note of the positive steps taken and will keep the recommendations open pending conf irmation that chief information security officer has been assigned and security focal points have been designated c audit trails and security reports 52 oios reviewed dist document titled application s ecurity strategy management systems renewal project dated 16 april 2003 the objective of this document is limited to the activities involved in the use and application of s ecurity software within the msrp system and does not cover other areas such as databases file serve rs or networks even within the msrp system the document does not make reference to security vi olation reports and audit trails it does not specify the persons who will be responsible for see ing that the policies and procedures within the strategy are applied 53 in the case of erp systems in particular the focus should be on having inbuilt security features to prevent any attempt at unauthorized acc ess to systems and data however it is still advisable to have robust system based on audit tr ails and security reports for detecting such attempts if this is absent there will be risk that successful unauthorized attempts at data acces s will remain undetected 54 it is unclear whether the current audit trails and security violation reports are adequate these reports should not merely serve as events logs but should provide enough detail to trace the origin f the violation to be feasible for control purposes these reports should be designed to record exceptions for example the report that would sho w unsuccessful login attempts and needs to be designed in way so that only instances of repeate d failed access attempts are reported for investigation 14 55 there is need for formal procedures covering the generation review and followup action on audit trails and security reports at present audit trails are normally reviewed on an exceptions basis reports relating to security violation are not printed and reviewed as standard practice and the analysis of the audit trail information and the security violation information is not taking place 56 dist should therefore implement clear policy cove ring online access to security reports the frequency of their generation and their distrib ution as well as responsibility for their review nd followup action these tasks would be assigned to the chief information security officer and the security liaison officers recommendation head2right the unhcr division of information systems and telecommunications working group that has been entr usted with developing security policy for unhcr should in c ooperation with business units and possibly with the inspector generals office review the existing audit trails and security repor ts for adequacy and make recommendations for improvement and b implement policy for the generation and review of security reports and followup action rec 15 57 dist agreed with the recommendation dist informed oios that work on information security policy has already commenced and completio n is anticipated by the end of 2007 oios takes note of the work done and will keep the recom mendation open pending the issuance of the security policy d penetration testing 58 an erp system such as msrp has inherent security ri sks due to the large number of users accessing the system the large volume of transacti ons per employee and the decrease in the paper trail there are also risks associated with the sh aring of information with third parties such as suppliers by the linking of systems within certai n modules eg accounts payable the system might allow user to modify static data temporaril and change it back shortly afterwards with audit trail 59 as result of the above erp systems while bringi ng about increased efficiencies through the streamlining of business processes and the sign ificant reduction or elimination of manual processes provide an increased opportunity for fra udsters especially for insiders management therefore needs to implement effective security mec hanisms to address the risk of fraud it will not be able however to obtain assurance regarding t he effectiveness of these mechanisms unless they are subject to rigid testing the best way to evaluate the effectiveness of the systems security features and identify any weaknesses would be by conducting penetration testing by an independent party 15 recommendation head2right the unhcr division of information systems and telecommunications should evaluate the effectivenes s of all systems security features and those of the network infrastructure by conducting penetration tests rec 16 60 dist agreed with the recommendation stating that im plementation is contingent on the appointment of an information security officer if this would not be feasible then dist shall seek external resources eg consultants oios takes note of dists response and will keep th recommendation open pending conformation that penet ration tests have been conducted disaster recovery and business continuity plan ning 61 unhcr does not have formal plan aimed at ensuring that in the event of major disaster affecting its computer facilities management would be able to mobilise alternate arrangements for processing data and continue to provide its core rvices efficiently while the facilities are properly restored while effective backup procedure s and power supply protection provide measure of insurance against system failures in th event of major disaster such as fire it is unlikely that the damage will be restricted to the computer equipment but will also affect other areas such plan would also detail the stages to be followed to ensure that unhcrs critical functions are properly recovered and become operati onal within acceptable timescales 62 business continuity planning is wide in scope and r equires input from all user units an effective business continuity plan will need to be preceded by risk assessment to define the missioncritical functions and data the systems pporting them and the impact that their unavailability will have on unhcr it also require s coordination with external parties such as the suppliers of hardware software and communications service and equipment in the case of unhcr this means close coordination with icc with which it has an agreement for hosting services covering msrp 63 the conduct of such an exercise is demanding on res ources and oios suggests that unhcr takes advantage of the work that has already been undertaken in this area by other entities within the system especially those lik undp and unicef who have also implemented erp systems the secretariats its d is working on plan for global business continuity while dpko has consolidated planning for business continuity utilizing its headquarters in new york the logistics base in brindisi and the united nations office in geneva as disaster recovery sites recommendation head2right the unhcr high commissioner should set up task fo rce to deal with business continuity matters throughout hcr this task force should hold workshops for senior managers to advise an d agree upon the categorization of missioncritical systems and data b seek the advice and collaboration of other entit ies that have already formulated business continuity plans r are at an advanced stage in the process and c draw up project plan for the implementation of business 16 continuity plan for unhcr rec 17 64 dist agreed with the recommendation stating that im plementation is contingent on the appointment of the information security officer if this would not be feasible then dist shall seek external resources eg consultants oios appreciates the efforts unhcr has done in pro ducing contingency plan for unhcr headquarters in case f pandemic avian flu and considers this good starting point for more comprehensive busi ness continuity plan f management and procurement of it assets monitoring enduser developed applications 65 dist appears to have full visibility of msrp and ot her application systems that are used centrally by multiple divisions and has control ov er which systems are allowed to run over the networks however from our discussions it emerged that dist is not aware of all the systems and databases that are developed by endusers and run n standalone pcs this applies to unitssections at headquarters and even more so to field offices 66 if unhcr is not aware of existing applications ther can be duplication of systems and waste of effort there is also risk that reports presented to management for decisionmaking will contain inaccurate data derived from enduser devel oped applications such as spreadsheets that have not been subject to quality assurance 67 details of all unhcrs ict enduser applications i ncluding reference to licence agreements should be recorded in an electronic reg ister this exercise will require substantial effort and designated person within each office s hould be responsible for updating the register with details of the ict applications located in tha t office application systems should be categorized by their significance or criticality nd there should be an indicator to show the status of an application ie whether it is in use bein g developed or approved but not yet underway dist should have monitoring role to ensure that t he register is being kept uptodate and should perform checks on the completeness and accuracy of the data complete and uptodate register of ict applications will provide basis for contro l and in the longerterm help unhcr save money through rationalization 68 dist should also provide users with guidelines on best practices to safeguard the integrity of data in reports that are generated fro m userdeveloped spreadsheets security of back up media and the installation and upgrading of vir usdetection software on laptops recommendations head2right the unhcr division of information systems and telecommunications should set up an electronic regi ster to record details of all the ict applications that belong to unhcr each office should appoint focal point with responsibi lity for updating the register while dist should monitor the currency of the register data and perform checks for its completene ss and accuracy rec 18 17 head2right the unhcr division of information systems and telecommunications should periodically provide user s with guidelines that will highlight the risks related to end user computing and provide guidance on safeguards and be st practices to mitigate these risks rec 19 69 dist agreed with the recommendations the electroni c register will be included in dists strategic plan for the coming biennium for the gui delines dist elaborated that these would be included in the information security guidelines oios takes note of dists response and will keep the recommendations open pending the developme nt and implementation of an electronic register and the dissemination of information secur ity guidelines highlighting the risks associated with developing ad hoc systems v acknowledgement 70 i wish to express my appreciation
