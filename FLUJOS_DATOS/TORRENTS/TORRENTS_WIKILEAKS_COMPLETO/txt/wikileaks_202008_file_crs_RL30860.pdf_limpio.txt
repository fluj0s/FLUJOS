pl 106113 summary on august 5 1997 the president signed into law the balanced budget act of 1997 bba97 pl 10533 this legislation sought to reduce the federal budget deficit to zero by 2002 significant amount of the spending reductions necessary to reach that target were achieved by slowing the rate of grow th in medicare payments to health care providers including hospitals physicians skilled nursing facilities and home health care agencies the congressional budget office cbo estimated that the legislation would achieve 1164 billion in medicare savings over 5 years fy1998fy2002 and 3938 billion over 10 years fy1998fy2007 in the 10 years prior to bba 97 medicare spending grew at an average annual rate of about 10 after implementation of bba 97 medicare spending slowed significantly and in fy1999 for the first time ever spending dropped below the prior years level by almost 1 in march 1999 cbo revised its budget projections and lowered medicare spending estimates by 80 billion over 5 years fy1998fy2002 and by 229 billion over 10 years fy1998fy2007 in july 1999 cbo revised and again reduced its medicare spending estimates many analysts opine that although the original estimates of the impact of the bba 97 may have been too low the improved economic conditions that cbo included in its revised estimates eg reduced inflation in health care costs and heightened federal efforts to reduce fraud and abuse also affected program spending nevertheless health care industry representatives argued that the payment system changes and the restrict ions on payment rate increases required by bba 97 threatened both their ability to provide services to beneficiaries during congressional hearings in 1999 witnesses from the medicare payment advisory commission the general accounting office and others testified that little evidence was available regarding how the medicare provisions of bba 97 would affect providers or beneficiary access to care but they urged watchful caution in the first session of the 106th congress the house and senate considered bills to mitigate the impac t of bba 97 on medicare providers the senate finance committee reported

act of 1999 pl 106113 introduction the medicare program is authorized in title xviii of the social security act part of that title includes coverage for inpatient hospital care and services care in skilled nursing facilities snfs hospice care and some home health care enrollment in part is automatic at age 65 for all workers who paid the hospital insurance payroll tax during their working years or whose spouse is covered part b provides for payments to physici ans and other health care practitioners services and items provided on an outpatient basis and some home health care part b is voluntary and requires participating beneficiaries to pay monthly premiums part c authorizes the medicare choice program under which beneficiaries may elect to participate in comprehensive managed care plans such as health maintenance organizations hmos although they must pay premiums at least equal to the part b premium in fy1999 the medicare program spent 211 billion to provide health insurance coverage for 39 million disabled individuals and elderly persons age 65 or over beneficiary premiums for part b coverage offset about 215 billion of program spending in comparison nearly 10 years earlier in fy1990 medicare spending totaled about 110 billion including 11 billion in beneficiary premiums and covered about 334 million beneficiaries during the 10 years preceding bba 97 annual rates of growth in medicare spending ranged from 5 to 155 total spending net of beneficiary part b premiums grew at an average annual rate of about 10 with some components of the program growing at much higher rates for example during this time period home health care spending grew at an average annual rate of 24 and payments to skilled nursing facilities grew at an average annual rate of 17 on august 5 1997 the president signed into law the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 in this legislation the administration and the congress agreed to reduce the federal budget deficit to zero by 2002 significant amount of the spending reductions necessary to reach that target were achieved by slowing the rate of growth in the medicare program the medicare savings which the congressional budget office cbo estimated originally at 1164 billion over 5 years fy1998fy2002 and 3938 billion over 10 years fy1998fy2007 were achieved by restricting the rate of increase in payments to hospitals physicians and other providers and by establishing new prospective payment systems for skilled nursing facilities home health agencies and hospital outpatient departments bba 97 also established the medicarechoice program which modified the way payments are made to health maintenance organizations hmos and it broadenedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30860crs2 private plan options availa ble to medicare beneficiaries the objective of these provisions was to expand participation in medicare by private managed care plans in the 2 years following enactment of bba 97 medicare spending slowed significantly in fy1998 the first year in which many of the bba 97 provisions were effective medicare spending grew by only 15 and in the following year for the first time in the programs history medicare spending dropped by almost 1 to an estimated 2093 billion for fy1999 in march 1999 cbo revised its budget projections and lowered medicare spending estimates by 80 billion over 5 years fy1998fy2002 and by 229 billion over 10 years fy1998fy2007 few months later in july 1999 cbo projected further reductions in estimated medicare spending one major cause can be identified for these large and unanticipated declines in medicare spending most analysts agree that they are attributable to variety of factors although the original estimates of the impact of some of the changes made by bba 97 may have been too low changes in cbos economic assumptions also affect the estimates for instance lower inflation rates would reduce provider payment rate updates in addition heightened antifraud and abuse initiatives reportedly have had substantial effects number of health care provider organizations say that the larger than estimated medicare spending reductions since bba 97 are evidence of overreaching in many of that legislations provisions they have expressed concern that beneficiaries particularly the sickest who need the most costly care will experience increasing diffic ulty in obtaining needed services because providers will be unwilling to serve them will drop out of medicare or will go out of business on june 10 1999 the senate finance committee conducted hearing on medicare spending under the bba 97 and on october 1 1999 the house ways and means health subcommittee held similar hearing witnesses from the medicare payment advisory commission medpac the general accounting office gao and others testified that little conclusive evidence was available at that time regarding how the bba 97 would affect providers and access to care in the future but generally urged watchful caution in the first session of the 106th congress both the house and senate considered bills to mitigate the impact of bba 97 on medicare providers on october 21 1999 the senate finance committee reported bipartisan bill the medicare and medicaid budget correction and refinement act of 1999 s 1788 and on november 5 1999 the house passed the medi care balanced budget

is made on daily rate or per diem basis during the 3year pps phasein period payments to snfs under the pps have two components federal per diem amount and facilityspecific per diem amount that is computed separately for each snf to reflect the facilitys own average daily costs under the prepps system in the first year of the pps snfs received per diem rates that were computed as 75 of the facilityspecific rate plus 25 of the federal per diem rate in each subsequent year the proportion paid under the facilityspecific rate and under the federal per diem rate shifts by 25 percentage points until starting mid2001 the federal rate is the full payment the snf pps described in bba 97 reflects the resource utilization group rug design hcfa developed and tested on demonstration project basis over several years snfs receive payment for each day beneficiary is resident of the snf the per diem payment is first computed as an overall average daily rate and that average payment is adjusted for case mix which accounts for the clinical characteristics of individual snf residents and the type and intensity of care each needs the payment is further adjusted to account for the geographic location of the facility and for local area wage rates the rug casemix adjustment scheme is hierarchical classification system reflecting the relative amount of resources required to provide snf residents care the original snf pps implemented in mid1998 included seven basic categories of care including in hierarchical order rehabilitation extensive services special care clinically complex care care for patients with impaired cognition care for patients with behavior problems and care for patients with reduced physical function these seven categories were further differentiated into 44 more specific patient groupings snfs categorize each newly admitted beneficiary into one of the rug catego ries using protocol prescribed by hcfa snf residents may be reclassified during their

previous year minus one percentage point like other ppss that compensate health care providers for care to medicare beneficiaries by the use of predetermined fixed amounts medicare pps payments to snfs are intended to pay the provider for the cost of care to medicare beneficiaries on average that is although the rug payment for all residents in the same category is fixed amount facilitys actualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30860crs5 costs may be above or below that amount for an individual the goal for the facility is to incur costs that on average over time do not exceed the pps average
