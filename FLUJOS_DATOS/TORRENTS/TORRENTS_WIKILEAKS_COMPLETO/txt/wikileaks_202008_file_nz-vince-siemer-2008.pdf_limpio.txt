prevents mr siemer from revealing information regarding other dubious accounting schemes that mr stiassny has been involved in in order to obtain the injunction mr stiassny submitted an affidavit to the auckland high court on 8 april 2005 wherein he swore that none of the allegations mr siemer had vectors financial troubles are small problem not simply for the investors but also the regional consumers who have seen the companys debt skyrocket over the last few years to current 3127 billion up 46 million from last year despite selling off nominal assets in order to maintain the dividend payment to shareholders this year retained earnings went into negative territory the monopoly utility also has 16 billion in goodwill that it has been unable to significantly write down due to its perilous financial position this overall financial scenario is now being used to pressure the regulators into letting vector charge power consumers more than the commerce commission has said they are entitled to do two years ago stiassny was proudly telling public meetings that he was responsible for half billion dollar unrealized capital gain on the acquisition of ngc by vector if true vector could sure stand to capitalize on this gain now however as with much that comes from stiassny this was part arrogant bluster and part accounting parlor tricks serving to pass as accepted fact nevertheless the real story is the substantial debt that the company took on board at the time of this purchase and which it now is struggling to discharge the company has recently looked hard at selling off assets to get its debt ratios down to reasonable levels and its precarious bbb with negative outlook credit rating up although the investors were generally unhappy the chairman and acting ceo were reasonably successful in diverting attention away from vectors recent management chaos three directors resigned masse within the last year and both the chief executive officer and chief financial officer abruptly resigned five months ago director karen sherry lawyer and political appointee with little business experience had been put in charge of risk assessment for vector in the midst of this drama vince siemer was one shareholder unlawfully prevented access to the meeting stiassny filed 125 million defamation claim against siemer two and half years ago but has done virtually nothing to advance the matter since in july of this year when siemer was on two week trip overseas stiassny was able to get high court order from justice judith potter that debarred siemer from defending his defamation claim this issue is now before the court of appeal for two months the court of appeal has failed to schedule hearing citing the large number of appeals siemer has filed as one reason for the delay potter was deeply involved with the electricity commission before her appointment as judge and has openly defended stiassny in court three of stiassnys former lawyers now sit as high court judges the judge that granted stiassny his injunction against siemer is former chambers partner of stiassnys current lawyer julian miles qc siemer who has bachelors degree in industrial relations and an mba from washington university in the united states and has run successful companies abroad wanted to ask the directors questions regarding the goodwill debt covenants and foreign currency risks in being denied entry into the meeting siemer drew parallel with attempts to silence critics of enron ten years ago he considers it is accident that one on the board other than chairman stiassny has comprehensive accounting or finance experience and has made written request of each director asking them whether they personally agree with the companys current financial statements siemer views the recent move to appoint hugh fletcher husband of the chief justice of the supreme court director of vector is little more than political pressure move hugh fletchers own business

disrupted the auckland energy consumers trust agm and required the unsuccessful intervention of security personnel those who did not realise stiassny was in the room had their attention directed to

limited until chairman stiassny led 249 selloff in the form of public share offering on the nzx exchange in august 2005 the need to pay down vectors ballooning 315 billion debt in part result of its contentious acquisition of ngc the year before was cited at the time as primary reason why the public equity float was necessary yet only 2 of the debt was ultimately paid down after the successful 25 share float mr stiassny has been publicly claiming he grew vector from 1 billion company to 5 billion company in 3 years at the auckland consumers trust agm much of the controversy was directed at vectors claim that assets had appreciated 179 in the last fiscal year and misconduct against this judge on separate matters including ruling on behalf of her brotherin law in case without disclosing her relationship to her brotherin law litigant the nz press is largely forbidden from publishing stories of judicial misconduct and where they do the suspect judges are granted name suppression tony stickley with the new zealand herald informed the editor of kiwisfirst that even when the herald is correct in its reporting the court awards hundred thousand dollars in costs against them that they cannot afford fundamental law violations by judges have become commonplace since new zealand abolished the privy council in england as an impartial appeal court in favour of the newly formed supreme court in 2004 at the time there was widespread concern among new zealands lawyers that such move would promulgate up the ladder the oldboys network favours that had made cesspool of established law in the lower courts key lawyers accurately pointed out the tremendous number of nz court cases that had been overturned as proof that the privy council was needed to instil discipline in judiciary that had become corrupted by special interests this concern was validated by new zealands closest ally when shortly after the supreme court was formed in 2005 australia refused to extradite two defrocked priests to stand trial in new zealand saying flatly this refusal was because they were unlikely to get fair trial here two months ago the privy council issued its last new zealand case ruling overturning the conviction of david bain for murder due to fundamental failures by the new zealand courts in following due process procedures when kiwis generally are respected the world over for their ingenuity and honestly this embarrassment is tremendous blow to national prestige since the abolishment of the privy council as an independent judiciary new zealand has lost considerable status among lawrespecting democracies economically many international businesses sensing the legal risks have shunned having operations in new zealand large number of new zealand companies have quietly moved their operations offshore most kiwis point to the new chief justice sian elias husband hugh fletcher being one of new zealands most connected businessmen as proof that an impartial supreme court is an impossibility in at least commercial cases even this damning indictment neglects the greatest threat to natural justice imposed by its formation for example it is doubtful that the two justices rejecting freedom of expression in this case would pass muster for appointments in any other country euphemistically called constructionists justice tipping and mcgrath have both worked to create their personal brand of english law in the south pacific only to take the country on wild ride in the process three years ago justice tipping unsuccessfully tried to create new tort the hosking case that would make it illegal to take photographs of people in public as court of appeal judge mcgrath gave vitriolic speeches about how lawyers needed immunity from negligence lawsuits by their clients fortunately his was an isolated voice but the telling part is that he was the member of that court to be appointed to the new supreme court in rejecting the appeal the supreme court said the trial judge legally used her discretion on the underlying issue of freedom of expression and the court of appeals refusal to consider this legal guarantee despite certain legal precedent that they must

qcs fatal fall from the 12 metre high takapuna head cliffs on 11 december 2005 when an auckland judge ruled the auckland coroner was prevented from releasing his findings until judicial review proceedings are conducted this action follows months of coverup where the last person to see the defendant alive lawyer christopher morris refused to grant the police an interview and the family hired prominent barrister harry waalkens qc to cover up the suicide and ensure the public inquest was conducted in secret 28206 years of cronyism have created siege mentality that pervades the auckland judiciary concerns are rampant as to what secrets fardell may have wanted to get off his chest before he fell to his death and what damage this may cause to the vested interests within the provincial and secretive court several lawyers contacted expressed grave concern that there was oversight or accountability of judges and this was yet another example where the court put the protection of one of their own before the public good and interest one called it ugly of how he was able to financially bilk other companies was coming back to haunt the once venerated insolvency practitioner due to two billboards being put up in auckland and website being launched that both detailed and proved his malfeasance with so much at stake stiassny had to act quickly he hired top lawyer julian miles qc chairman of shortland chambers where many of the current judges on the auckland court hail from to obtain an injunction shutting down the website and billboards paying mr miles 900 per hour not an exaggeration actually 90000hr was not enough though stiassny was required to state in sworn affidavit that the allegations on the website against him were untrue this in order to enable mr miles to work his magic with his fellow judges stiassnys already large nose grew little longer for time this strategy worked mr miles was able to get then high court justice ellen france to issue an injunction that decreed there was reasonable defence of truth to allegations against staissny despite the incontrovertible evidence of staissnys guilt ordering that the billboards and website must be shut down to protect mr stiassnys reputation for her role in covering up this corruption that affects every new zealander justice france was properly rewarded but to be fair to the judge she also honestly thought that would be the end of the matter and that her judicial transgressions were justified because she was preventing what could very well result in catastrophic blow to the financial markets certainly she rationalized mr stiassnys seemingly criminal malfeasance did not extend to public utility vector limited the monopoly electric utility of which stiassny was chairman and which also was at the time deeply involved in complex and expensive acquisition and public share float better she thought that private word be taken up with stiassny to ensure this was not the case hence stiassny had to lie again and like pinocchio his nose grew little longer doubt this is where judge frances inexperience on the bench one year and immaturity showed before her judicial appointment ellen france had never been anything other than political bureaucrat she was too trusting some would correctly say intimidated by the likes of mr stiassny and mr miles and she wanted to believe that operating outside the law in this case was justified but once having made her decision it was not case of misinterpretation of law or facts that regularly can be expected to resolve itself in the higher courts what ellen france did was clear breach of her judicial oath and her judicial colleagues knew full well that risk of her abuse of power being exposed posed huge dilemma for the court as whole she needed to be personally protected from what clearly was lapse in personal character the next stage in the legal challenge was quite different at the court of appeal the case fell into the lap of close personal associate of stiassny justice robert chambers chambers much more intellectual judge albeit corrupt saw immediately that justice frances decision was untenable he needed to rewrite history in order to protect both the judge and his mate and what chambers did was pure genius he refused to overturn frances decision and even refused to address the validity of the points of appeal choosing instead to say the matter was contractual dispute that singularly warranted dismissal of the appeal and maintaining of the injunction but chambers j had further problem the course he embarked on contrasted with the ellen france judgment and was not legal point crossappealed consequently justice chambers audaciously wrote that by ruling this way he was merely agreeing with what justice france thought despite the fact that justice frances judgment said the opposite on this point and this is when all hell broke loose in the court now both justice chambers and justice france had crossed the line what happened next is testament to the reality that judges with few exceptions are lawyers with past lawyers who are additionally not given to allowing the skeletons of their fellow judges being exposed when it could very well lead to their own skeletons being exposed this is particular risk and concern in the cloistered court setting where it is common knowledge among judges what the others

perhaps more importantly revealed incontrovertible evidence that mr stiassny lied under oath when he swore an affidavit that among other things said he never labelled paragon insolvent and had inadvertently invoiced paragon some 11000 in fees that should have been charged to paramount one problem as it turned out was that stiassny never did any work for company called paramount leaving the obvious inferences that his attempt at fee overcharging was deliberate and criminal and the attempted coverup was not working as planned another lie and stiassnys nose grew longer still on 4 april 2007 president will young of the new zealand court of appeal ruled that despite all this evidence despite the unchallenged evidence of 9 witnesses who attested to judicial impropriety that included conducting court proceedings exparte and the oppression of witness crossexamination and despite irrefutable evidence that the injunction was improperly obtained and issued he saw basis for the court to take action in doing so justice young may have protected stiassny and his fellow judges but it is too early to tell whether and to what extent his actions have harmed the courts reputation and new

controls metro water limited submission to the finance and corporate business committee auckland city council mr vern walsh chairperson respectfully submitted by vince siemer mba 5 december 2005 few things in life are as precious as safe reliable and affordable water supply next to air water is the most essential human need michael stiassny is the current chairman of metrowater my recent research into this mans business background has uncovered behaviour so alarming that i am compelled to bring this information to the finance and corporate business committees attention today mr stiassnys conduct as i have witnessed it is so egregious that i can state forthrightly in my informed and considered opinion michael stiassny is not fit to be chairman of any public company let alone company that provides such an essential human resource as water in support of my claim to the committee today that mr stiassny is not only unfit to remain as chairman of metrowater but that he may pose threat to the safe reliable and affordable supply of water to the public given his personally callous nature and reckless management style i will draw parallel to mr stiassnys stewardship of another monopoly vector energy stiassny has publicly represented that he has grown vector energy from one billion dollar company into five billion dollars within three years exhibit what he fails repeatedly to mention is that vector under his stewardship has amassed horrendous debt of 31 billion from 08 billion just few years ago reckless fiscal management anyone can build five billion dollar house of cards if they are able to borrow enough money and place an intangible value on the result stiassny is preaching how he built five billion dollar company but i submit to you that this is misleading and it minimally fails to acknowledge the tremendous debt that the consumer ratepayers not stiassny are ultimately responsible for this is particularly ominous in the case of vector for several reasons httpwwwstiassnyorg 7 of 13 18062008 72403 pmmichael peter stiassny true and disturbing story 1 interest rates have risen recently and are projected to go higher still meaning the debt that stiassny created is increasingly encumbering the company this increased cost must invariably be borne by the helpless consumers or taxpayers 2 in july standard and poors put vector on negative credit watch stating the potential negative outlook reflects the likely deterioration in financial metrics over the short to medium term exhibit b 3 this negative credit watch was despite the companys lowrisk electricity network business the scale and diversity of its operations and its robust service area 4 vector announced 30 decline in profit immediately after the public share offering the ipo date itself having been inexplicably moved up week vector blamed the profit decline on increased electricity transmission costs of 15 and increased electricity maintenance costs of 35 over last year and admitted this profit decline occurred despite higher selling prices being paid by the consumers exhibit c so what would you do if you were chairman of this teetering mess we know what stiassny did he threw party despite credit rating pressures huge debt becoming more expensive to manage due to rising interest rates and significantly declining profits stiassny elected to increase dividends to trust beneficiaries i submit to you today that this is not rational action for responsible manager but it may help explain how mr stiassnys official compensation has almost doubled in his short tenure at vector can the auckland city council afford to leave such man in control of valuable and necessary resource as water vector would be relatively fortunate if stiassnys poor fiscal management was its biggest problem at recent institute of directors presentation stiassny claimed to have made vector half billion dollar profit on the recent purchase of ngc alone this pegging of value was apparently determined by extrapolation of the sum value of the 249 initial public share offering at the peak of its sharetrading price after the recent float to be sure mr stiassnys shortterm capital gain claim had nothing to do with intrinsic value as determined by factors such as tangible asset value or even anticipated return on investment mr stiassnys half billion dollar shortterm capital gain claim was as bold as any enron accountant and equally alarming and stiassny is chartered accountant legal intimidation and bullying and it gets worse it is common knowledge that stiassny initiated defamation proceedings against one former trustee of the auckland energy consumer trust and took legal action against another to prevent that trustee from voting against his retention of the vector chairmanship consequently mr stiassny was reelected by only two of the five aect trustees given mr stiassnys propensity to use the legal bludgeon to beat his critics into submission it is quite possible that at least one of the two trustees who did vote for stiassny might have done so for reasons having nothing to do with his abilities please make mistake even if stiassny has not threatened you with legal action his legal bullying tactics are tainting metrowater and auckland city council directly at the institute of directors meeting noted above mr stiassny began his presentation by gloating he was in the process of bankrupting the water pressure group members protesting peacefully outside not only was there cause for this outburst it made many people in the room understandably uncomfortable this behaviour was duly reported to the energy minister in letter dated 25 october 2005 exhibit d while stiassny may be free to spend his own money in suing people who criticize him it will prove scandalous in my opinion if the auckland city council has authorized mr stiassny to use in effect water receipts metrowater funds to legally bankrupt people he disagrees with and without legitimate cause i have been fortunate to travel many places in the world it has always impressed in my travels httpwwwstiassnyorg 8 of 13 18062008 72403 pmmichael peter stiassny true and disturbing story that kiwis as group are the most resourceful and adaptable people on the planet and are particularly astute at cutting through all the propaganda in accurately assessing situation when it comes to hand and then taking the appropriate action it pains to see so many of these decent conscientious people bullied and taken advantage of by mr stiassny while the elected representatives with the power to cut off his legal warchest wring their hands change is needed exhibit institute of directors in new zealand inc breakfast with michael stiassny topic from one billion dollar to five billion dollar

standard poors said today it was putting auckland energy company vector and ngc holdings on creditwatch with negative implications following vectors announcement of full ngc takeover bid yesterday vector yesterday made 340 per shares scrip and cash offer for the remaining 328 of ngc it does not already own ahead of the float of quarter of its shares that will raise 593 million ngc shareholders will be offered 78c cash and the rest in new vector shares sp said if the ipo and acquisition proceeded under the terms and conditions expected then the ratings on vector and ngc were likely to be affirmed at bbbplus with negative outlook the potential negative outlook reflects the likely deterioration in financial metrics over the short to medium term sp said major part of the decision to affirm the rating will be an assumption that vector repays its equity bridge either from its ipo proceeds or other means before the end of october 2005 the international rating agency said sp said vectors rating reflected the companys lowrisk electricity network business the scale and diversity of its operations its robust service area and current regulatory pricepath certainty in addition vector is expected to benefit from the broadening of its business profile that results from assuming full control over ngcs gas businesses including its transmission and distribution business these strengths are offset vectors moderate financial profile uncertainty regarding the level of vectors final httpwwwstiassnyorg 9 of 13 18062008 72403 pmmichael peter stiassny true and disturbing story shareholding in ngc and consequently the extent of the integration that will ultimately occur and the associated integration risks ngcs rating reflected its strong market position in gas transmission and distribution its diversified revenue base and its moderate financial profile as well as vectors creditworthiness these strengths are mitigated by new zealands depleting longterm gas reserves and any implications arising from the current regulatory review of gas transportation sp said vector expects to be listed on the exchange in the spring with capitalisation of up to 238 billion ngc shares jumped 22c to 3782 yesterday and rose another 3c to 375 today well above the implied takeover price last year valuers grant samuel said the underlying value of ngc shares was in the 250 to 276 range exhibit c httpwwwstiassnyorg 10 of 13 18062008 72403 pmmichael peter stiassny true and disturbing story exhibit d 25 october 2005 the honourable mr david parker minister of energy parliament building wellington dear mr parker on 19 october 2005 michael stiassny gave presentation at an institute of directors meeting at the northern club in auckland titled how to turn one billion dollar business into five billion dollar business in three years the evolution of vector as an energy consumer and ratepayer i was extremely troubled by several aspects of mr stiassnys presentation these were 1 chairman stiassny claimed to have increased the value of vector half billion dollars solely through his orchestration of the recent ngc buyout by vector 2 under his tutelage vector shareholders have enjoyed increased dividends 3 while accepting regulation of monopoly enterprises is here to stay stiassny suggested the shareholders and particularly those in attendance could appeal as voters to their politicians for less intrusive regulations regulations that tend to stymie growth the intrepid manner in which mr stiassny bragged to the directors in attendance of adding halfbillion dollars to the value of vector through the ngc purchase alone was as frightening as it was unsound minimally mr stiassny confused the investor honeymoon after the recent float combined with the market hype that accompanied this launch with intrinsic value in point of fact vector has recently struggled with 30 annual profit decline over the last year and ngc had been independently valued at substantially less than stiassnys claim yet neither garnered mention by him additionally standard and poors in july put vector on negative ratings watch saying the potential negative outlook is result of an expected decline in financial metrics over the short to medium term perhaps most alarming is the fact that all these dour developments have occurred within vector despite buoyant economy increased selling prices and infrastructure changes at vector that mr stiassny raised dividends and brags about this move at time of substantially declining profits is reminiscent of nero fiddling as rome burned whether any argument can be made for increasing dividends at time of drastically declining profits it is not difficult to deduce the motivation for such payout in these circumstances vector blamed the recent poor financial performance on substantially increased transmission and maintenance costs under stiassnys stewardship not only does this speak poorly of mr stiassnys fiscal management or lack thereof but it has profound and farreaching implications to the consumers in particular and the economy in general this is because unlike other businesses and industries where the consumer has choice and can avoid an inefficient and poorly run business that does not provide value for the money vector provides an essential service in monopoly environment while the consumer and ratepayers are not compelled to foot the financial bill for inefficiencies and poor performance in typical businesses they simply choose another supplier of the good or service this cannot be said about vector in fact any poor management performance by mr stiassny must invariably be financially underwritten by the unsuspecting and captive consumer and ratepayer beneficiaries as monopoly enterprise this is particularly true if mr stiassny is able to increase prices to offset poor management of such vital industry in this scenario the economy at large is directly and negatively impacted through inordinate cost pressures on the productive sector and pressures upon inflation in general hence httpwwwstiassnyorg 11 of 13 18062008 72403 pmmichael peter stiassny true and disturbing story mr stiassnys mantra that regulation might be softened through the collective voice of the voters was most disturbing i was deeply troubled by mr stiassnys presentation and posed the question to him at the conclusion of his talk question made all the more relevant by my observation that such contrived and inaccurate financial outlooks are typical of businesses under mr stiassnys stewardship that i have examined to name two companies where your stewardship resulted in tangible benefit to shareholders in response mr stiassny claimed that vector was one such company evidenced he said by the increased share value after the ipo launch i responded that this was result of market hype as he himself had conceded and had nothing to do with fundamentals such as return on investment at this mr stiassny went silent and the moderator called an end to the questions and the presentation mr stiassny was unable or unwilling to name one other company as an interesting anecdote mr stiassny devoted the first five minutes of his presentation attempting to explain away the half dozen protesters carrying placards outside the meeting with messages such as stiassny the corporate thug and dump stiassny as people who were not paying their water bills not because they couldnt afford to but because they didnt want to he went on to say slyly that this is why we have people around called lawyers to deal with these people and that he was in the process of bankrupting these protesters his vitriolic rant at the protesters was not only an unwelcome concession to the effectiveness of their peaceful demonstration but made many people in the room quite uncomfortable few omens present themselves with such clarity in my honest informed and considered opinion mr stiassnys presentation to the institute of directors breakfast meeting on 19 october 2005 portends an ominous threat to the energy sector as well as the economy in general as such it would be prudent for you to obtain copy of mr stiassnys presentation so that you might judge this for yourself with all due respect like the canary in the coalmine we can illafford to ignore the warnings one final note do not expect the auckland energy consumer trustees to provide safeguard against mr stiassny tellingly mr stiassny was reelected chairman of vector despite the fact that only two of the five trustees voted for him mr stiassny had taken legal action against one of the trustees at the time of this vote and had previously engaged lawyers to threaten suit against another trustee for defamation after she spoke out against him in this environment it is also not difficult to see how two of the five might vote for him in the interests of full disclosure i will tell you that mr sitassny has also filed million dollar defamation lawsuit against my company and moreover it is my understanding today that mr stiassny has all of the existing trustees currently tied up by confidentiality agreement that provides him legal recourse against them if they speak out against him if this is indeed the case it is unreasonable to expect any of them to blow the whistle until after this ship is well and truly sunk sincerely vince siemer
