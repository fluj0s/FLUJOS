religion there in 610 in 2002 muslims constitute d approximately 19 of the worlds population as compared to 30 that were christian these percentages are projected by some to shift to 25 christian and 30 muslim by the year 20255 islam in southeast asia is relatively more moderate in character than in much of the middle east this moderation stems in part from the way islam evolved in southeast asia islam came to southeast asia with tr aders rather than through military conquest as it did in much of south asia and the ar ab middle east islam also was overlaid on animist hindu and buddhist traditions in indonesia which are said to give it more syncretic aspect islam spread throughout much of southeast asia by the end of the seventeenth century islam in asia is more politically diverse than in the middle east islam has been undergoing revival in asia rand analyst angel rabasa points to several factors that contribute to this islamic resurgence in asia these include both domestic and external factors internally the forces of globalization and the impact of western culture have played role especia lly the effect of rapid industrialization and resulting urbanization the asian financial crisis of 1997 resulte d in the overthrow of the authoritarian suharto regime and created political space for islamists in indonesia muslim separatist insurgents have continued their struggle in the philippines and thailand while the parti islam malaysia has worked through the political system to promote an islamist agenda while in opposition in malaysia external factors include the current situation in iraq and afghanistan the arab israeli conflict the 1979 islamic revolution in iran the export of saudibacked wahha bi islamic fundament alism the conflict between india and pakistan over kashmir and the afghan war against the soviets6 different schools of islamic tradition the majority of muslims are of the s unni tradition while 1015 are shiite this difference stems from disagreement over the succession to the prophet mohammad in south and southeast asia shiites are si gnificant portion of the population in only afghanistan and pakistan th puritanical sunni sect of wahhabism has played an important role in the resurgence of islam in asia it stems from 18th century movement founded by muhammad ibn abd alwahhab that preached literal interpretation of the quran and an orthodox practice of islam hist orically there has been close relationship between wahhabism and the saudi dynasty7 sufism is another more mystical variant of islam though its presence in asia is small except for parts of south asiahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21903crs3 8 this argument is drawn from gregorian pp 3950 9 jillian schwedlerislamic identity myth menace or mobilizer sais review

rienner continuedthe decline of islamic power in the wake of european colonial expansion provoked two key schools of thought within islam that continue to have relevance today the traditionalist school belie ved that the cause for the dec line of islam could be traced to moral laxity and departure fro m the true path of islam as result their response was to call for an islamic revival others known as reformers felt that the decline was due to chronic failure to modernize their societies and institutions the path of the reformers presents the question of whether it is possibl to modernize without westernizing at its core this is struggle over values how to protect societys cultural heritage and traditional practices in an age of globalizati on and how to develop creative coexistence between modernization and trad itionalism without westernization8 it is thought by some analysts that if the united states and the west seek to make common cause with moderate elements within the islamic world against violent extremists they would be well dvised to do so in way that is not perceived to be threat to the islamic world the united states through its association with globalization and globalizing culture is perceived as threat by many leaders of the islamic world who are seeking to preserve or rest ore traditional culture even as segments of the populations they lead are drawn to american culture the disconnect between muslim elites and their people in asia can also be seen in the d ecreasing popularity of united statess foreign policy even as regional leaders seek to maintain close ties some analysts believe that as long as the muslim world views the usled war against terror as war against islam there will be significant limits on the extent to which muslim states will be able to cooperate with the united states in the war against terror the problem is exacerbated by widespread muslim opposition to united stat policy on the arabisraeli conflict islamic revival political isla m extremists and terrorists the islamic revival is changing the face of political islam in asia the distinction to be drawn is between revivalists who see religious change as an end in itself and political islam or islamists who seek the islamic revival as means to the end of transforming the state9 further distinction is to be drawn between those who would work through the political process and those who would use violence to achieve their ends the islamic revival has complex relationship to the level of extremism in asia while islam in southeast asia has been mode rate in character it is undergoing process of revivalist change in some segments of society the resurgence is in part inspired by links to the middle east afghanistan and pa kistan some southeast asians returning from islamic religious schools in the middle east and pakistan have returned with new radical militant islamist and extremist form of islam that is more likely to be anti american or antiwestern in character10 there is also significant number of violent extremists of returned southeast asians nd larger number of south asians who had participated in the war against the soviet union

rogers beyond continuedsoutheast asians who have been radicalized through these experiences have gone on to spread extremist ideology pa rticularly by linking with local muslim extremist groups who tend to have more nationally or re gionally defined goals and who are largely opposed to local modera muslims from one perspective the most effective policies towards muslim asia will be those that contain extremism while working with rather than against the muslim majoritys aspira tions for social and economic improvement12 connections between islamic extremism and terrorist organizations in south asia appear to be more extensive than they are in southeast asia this stems in large part from closer interaction with the middle east strengthened recently by the presence of qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan it is also func tion of long term conflict in afghanistan and in kashmir the extremist taliban regime gave sanctuary to qaeda until it was crushed since that time remnant qaed forces have linked up with other sunni extremist groups in south asia including lashkaretaiba jais hemohammad sipahe sahaba pakistan and lashka rijhangvi pakistan has so experienced sunnishiite conflict an extensive arra of islamic schools known as madrassas including some that teach militant antiwestern and antihindu persp ective operate in pa kistan coalition of islamist political parties controls approximately 20 of the seats in pakistans legislature as well as the northwest frontier province they also lead coalition in baluchistan it has been reported that qaed fighters escaped to bangladesh after the fall of afghanistan to american and afghan northern alliance forces and that bangladesh veterans of the conflict in afghanistan ve played role in establishing radical madrassas in bangladesh in india while there exists significant intercommunal strife between hindus and muslims it is largely domestically focused with the exception of pakistani based groups operating in kashmir13 there are number of islamist groups in s outheast asia that have linkages either direct or indirect to terrori st organizations the moro islamic liberation front milf and abu sayyaf are examples of groups in the philippines where islamist ideology secessionism criminality and linkages to international terrorist networks are evident the terrorist jemaah islamiya ji organization wh ich seeks to establish an islamic khalifate across much of southeast asia and establish islamic law has ties to qaeda in indonesia the now reportedly disbanded shkar jihad incited intercommunal strife between muslims and christians in sulawezi and the moluccas that created struggle that can be exploited by terrorist groups such as ji lashkar jundullah is another group that has been involved in intercommunal viol ence in the moluccas and sulawezi the extremist kampulan mujahidin malaysia k mm is an example of an organization in southeast asia established by veterans of the fight against the soviets in afghanistan in thailand separatists ve mounted an insurrection in the muslim southern provinces14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21903crs5 14 continued the abu sayyaf foreign affairs january 2004

america the cold war and the roots of terror new york pantheon 2004 the relatively few muslims of northeast as ia are found in china for the most part china is home to an estimated 175 to 36 million muslims the largest most concentrated group is the uighurs of xinjiang province in western china the uighur minority has experienced unrest of an islamic character in recent years many uighurs seek autonomy within china demographic trends arising from hanchinese inmigration are projected to make the uighurs minority in their home province15 the scope of the islamic revival in asia and the extent to which increased religious fervor will translate into extremist positions or political power that will express itself in violent ways towards the west is debated some see this phenomenon manifesting itself more in terms of increased piety among i ndividuals within society without necessarily expressing itself politically16 karen armstrong author of islam short history believes that because fear feeds extremism the war against terror s hould include better appreciation of islam in the west17 it has been observed that us counterterrorism policy tends to conflate political islam and terrorism worldwide18 key distinction for some in this debate is the distinction between cultural or religious identity and political identity an islamic revival that finds its expression through cultural or religious means is not necessarily threat even as some in the islamic world would manipulate it to their antiamerican or antiwestern ends 19 an examination of recent developments with political islam in malaysia and indonesia illustrate this point radical islamist or extremist parties have not demonstrated broad appeal among indonesian or malaysian voters in recent elections even as some segments of these societies have experienced resurgence of islamic belief the islamist parti islam ma laysia experienced significant ectoral setbacks in the 2004 elections to the relatively more secular barisan national coalition of prime minister badawi who is himself regarded as respected islamic sc holar in indonesia islamist parties such as the prosperous justice party pks made small gains based not on their islamist agenda but on their anticorruption and good governan ce policies secular nd nationalist parties clearly are preferred by voters in indonesia and malaysia even as islam remains core value of the people there are also fundamenta lists in southeast asia that would introduce strict islamic law but would not advocate the use of violence to do so there is also distinction to be made between those who w ould focus primarily on subnational national and regional objectives such as secession for muslim province rather than focus on the international agenda advocated by qaeda httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21903crs6 20 abuza pp 1314 hefner p386 gregorian p 68 the jihadi groups draw their strength from common pool of selfrighteous anger at what they see as the humiliation of muslims at the hands of the west the passion that fuels isla mist terror is growing the main reason for this is the perception widespread in the muslim worl d that americas wars in afghanistan and iraq along with its support for israel are tantamount to war on islam alqaeda amorphous but alive the economist june 5 2004 sulawesi celebes source map resources adapted by crs kyancey 8204 alienation and humiliati on appear to be key concepts for understanding the islamic resurgence in asia and for understanding why individuals are drawn to terrorist groups in discussing madra ssas and pesantren in indonesia from which extremists have been recruited zachary abuza has taken the position that the radical fringe of islam will continue to grow as modernization leaves people more isolated and the political process leaves people more disenfranchised the isla mists and their supporte rs will continue to gain in power unless the more secular muslim community again provides successful model of tolerant and modernist islam that it has done fair ly successfully for forty years in this way some analysts believe frustration from diminished expectations driven by economic malaise the lack of effective po litical participation nd sense of humiliation are at the core of why many asian muslims have become radicaliz ed it is thought by some that us policies can help best by ssisting moderate elements in asia to respond to mainstream muslims hopes for economic improvement and politi cal participation education balanced developm ent participatory governance and civil peace that will give hope to alienate d individuals who might otherwis drift towards radicalism some observers feel that diminishing the ranks of alienated asian muslims will in turn restrict room for maneuver by extre mists and terrorists by limiting active or passive support from the societies within which they operate 20
