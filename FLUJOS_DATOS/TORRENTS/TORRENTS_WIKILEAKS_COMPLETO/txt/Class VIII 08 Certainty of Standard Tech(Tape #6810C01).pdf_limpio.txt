6810c01 class viii tape 8 certainty of standard tech and what number lecture is this eight now we know somebody missed one eighth lecture one october 1968 ad18 the substance of these lectures should not of course be delivered with total ferocity because up the line someplace the saint hill course will teach its teachings and academies will teach theirs and somebody will pay attention to the information which is contained on that and someday in the future the class viii course will contain auditors who can audit and that would be very nice i now find out that most of the data concerning listing is actually still extant on the saint sill tapes this was great mystery its merely that people hadnt studied them now in view of the fact that clay table demonstration has gone out very thoroughly over the past year or two we can expect well people did demonstration corny demonstration i heard about today the little blobs the auditor and little blob was the pc and the arc break was busted line between the auditor and the pc my contempt youre dealing with bank and the bank is in the pc what is the mechanism what is the mechanism in that bank that occurs the most deadly sins of auditing are of course auditing without any comprehension of the laws of listing these are that is deadly it can wrap pc around telegraph pole and i mean those laws of listing which were put out in bulletin in 1968 and any one of those not followed can wrap pc around telegraph pole it is very serious it is sufficiently serious that five pcs audited in row on an auditor who did not know the laws of listing and so on and who didnt know these facts had trouble each one of them with ethics almost immediately within some forty eight hours and it goes something like this out tech results in out ethics then out ethics has to be put in heavily in order to hold the line to get tech back in if tech were perfect ethics would be unnecessary so you see that an auditor who doesnt know his business opens the door to ethics and the degree that tech has gone out is direct measure of the amount of ethics which has to be put in direct this has been the subject of actual test now it may not occur to somebody that i am telling you facts i am not telling you my ideas because i say it is true is reason its true because im telling you what it is is because it is true and anybody who has an opinion that differs with rons anybody in the world can have an opinion that differs with mine but you see im not telling you opinions now when i give you the data of scientology and the unraveling of the problems of the mind i am not giving you my opinions i am giving you facts and they dont compare with your opinions your opinions havent got anything to do with it and my opinions dont have anything to do with it you understand out tech normally stems from some kook who gets an opinion and he thinks freedom of think has something to do with truth he can think all he pleases he can have all the opinions in the world but when he goes into an org and indulges in one of these god damned opinions that throws tech out shooting is too good for him an opinion of this character well if you get floating needle on engrams then you can never run any more engrams that opinion was bought once into saint hill big discussions on the subject would you please tell how you could ever run 3 if it was true so all you have to do is think it through know your business and think it through and you will be able to differentiate the opinion from the fact now if clay table demonstration can go out in the year 1968 it can go out in the year 1975 other things can go out but it is not possible to predict what will go out because there can be an infinity of wrongnesses around any rightness there is actually predicting under the sun moon or stars what any academy or saint hill student will suddenly assume because aberration is bunch of stuck lies so some teaching comes through the truth comes through it misses this guy to the degree that it restimulates some fixed idea now ill tell you how fixed an idea can go bad somebody has been taught for two or three thousand years that man is basically evil you tell him man is basically good he considers that belief or religious teaching and wa he seze your idea to put it lightly because hes crazy now you can prove that man is basically good for this reason overts read as overts not because hes been taught that it was bad to do it he doesnt get well unless he gets his overts off when we process person he becomes better more ethical his ability rises now look if he was basically evil he would get worse more stupid do you follow so all you have to do is think the think through on the face of it it proves itself there would be reason under the gods green earth to process him at all if he were evil because all you would do would be to run out all the things that taught him to be good and you would wind up with somebody who was stupid vicious couldnt do anything did nothing but loaf yes but processing demonstrates the complete reverse somebodys around feeling tired feeling tired and he cant work and all that well that cant be native state because when you process it he gets ambitious and works but you havent educated him or taught him to get ambitious at work you simply ran out his blunted purposes his betrayed intentions he had some good intention he was trying to do something and he got kicked in the teeth too often and then he gets tired so that auditing is in actual fact subtracting process and the final product of auditing demonstrates that mans basically good now in christian countries men are taught that man is basically evil so you say this to this character youre trying to teach man is basically good auditing is subtractive process and takes away the evil deeds and out of valences and into evil valences and so forth and the fellow gets better and he gets more moral and he gets more perceptive and he gets more able and he has more energy and so forth he knows youre its impossible if its subtractive process now lets watch this guy in an auditing session he punishes the pc he knows the only way you could make anybody better is to punish them and his pc becomes worse more tired less able the iq goes down now this is direct example of fixed idea getting in the road of truth and auditing so thats why i say an auditor has case student has case we are now above the level we can talk about it isnt true if it isnt true for you to an academy student because thats true thats the closest touch hes got to this reality but im not teaching an academy student right now and you have business receiving it at that level these are the facts this is the hot dope theyre not based on my opinions i might have entirely different opinions and often have had but i have enough self discipline not to pass them on to you theres lot of things i could believe in lots for instance there are things that i would like to be doing that are oh my god when i look at some of these politicos the worst valences ive ever been in contact with rise to the fore but i dont allow that to color the job i have job to do you have job to do im going to let you in on something i didnt even get r6ed im not from this planet now if i can take it on that itd be very good thing to clean up this planet you who were here can damn well share the responsibility and not say its all up to ron thats an interesting thought isnt it right away somebody comes along and tries to hang as responsible for all the aberrations of the human race because im trying to do something for it well you can expect such thing to be passed on to you but you find out in the long run if you do your job do it cleanly stick to the truth stick to facts do those things which exactly work and go on forward you come out right in the end its the only way you ever come out right when you compromise with your own reality when you deny your own basic goodness when you indulge in your own stuck ideas you dont come out right so somewhere up the track somebody listening to this tape he was trained by cracker jack academy supervisor his saint hill course was right on the groove they didnt flub clay table they did great job of it all the way across the lines this guy really knows his business he knows his business backwards and forwards hes moved through 7 he really knows how to do power and he comes to 8 and he hears this tape well the only thing i wish to advise him that if he doesnt keep doing his job and keep the data straight it can get as bad as it has gotten you see the road out is the only road there is the road in and down is total stop and stays stuck forever it isnt road its hole therefore i enjoin upon you the job of listening to the straight data teaching the straight data using the straight data and keeping the road out open and when these wild opinions come in sideways to knock them out and kick them aside with the contempt they deserve holding the line holding the road open is not an easy job every suppressive that comes along the line has to invalidate it he has to discredit it he goes into dramatization of discrediting because he himself is terrified what if some other being got stronger its all he can think of what is some other being got stronger he in his egocentric nonsense thinks that the other being would become more evil and therefore destroy him with more enthusiasm but why does he think that cause he knows damn well he deserves it and once more on this subject how does he know so well he deserves it so when i give you this data i am not giving you very broad area of opinion im giving you exactly what works i am giving it to you exactly as it works and these are the data which you have to know how to do its the data which are stressed on the class viii course you will not find any data outside that perimeter not even worth paying any attention to now somewhere up the line probably somebody will invent something else besides lsd that is now exported with such enthusiasm by psychiatrists to make them drum up business more than one way to drum up business the psychiatrist you know is just dramatizing mad man by definition there are psychiatrists in r6 and certain people go into valences and become this thing and do it and they attain their public presence by the fact that people know the symbol in r6 and so accept them without too much objection theyre out of valence in r6 now when you get pushed sideways this and that its because you think some new data has come out now i tell you exactly how exactly how case becomes unsolvable and exactly why an auditor squirrels and ive told you something about this before but this is exactly why and how standard tech is missed by about four or five miles missed and then because the case has been missed the auditor sits there looking or the case supervisor sits there looking for an unusual solution because the case now seems unusual all unusual cases are cases that have been mishandled under the heading of standard tech they have already been mishandled by departure from standard tech and then appear to be unsolvable and then appear to need some new solution and the auditor or the case supervisor seeing this odd phenomenon sitting there of apparently an unresolving case then dream up something new or think they have to go into some other area and practice yogi exercises or drill holes in his head or something of this sort do you see how that happens but i assure you of this and this is the stable data this datum right here standard tech has already been missed theres miss in standard tech all unusual cases come about through miss in standard tech the resolution of all such cases is to find out where standard tech became unstandard do you see so heres this case hes wideopen invitation to the auditor and the case supervisor to squirrel because he appears to be so unstandard buyuyuyu hes not solving we did everything were supposed to do and nothing hasnt happened so we have to do something else now lets dream up some new now the danger of this is these new ideas usually come from stuck and fixed ideas and they dont apply to the case they only apply to the guy who thought them up so much so that the late volney matheson developed drill and he found out the cases that were being audited unsuccessfully way back when when he was fooling around with this with meters and so on he found out what had been audited on the preclear and then put the auditor on the cans and found out that was what was wrong with the auditor you see these failed cases the auditor was trying to audit his case out of the pc hell thats the introduction of fixed ideas you go back over case like this standard flub and honest to pete it is sitting there so big and so wide that you wonder how in the name of god anybody could miss it they could just about as well miss ten thousand watt search light in the middle of dark night it is right there ill give you an example give you an example unsolvable case came up absolutely unsolvable my god you couldnt do anything with this case well the reason you couldnt do anything with him he had been two days overrun on arc straightwire past an fn and then this couldnt be rehabbed because he was in the middle of secondary but every effort to rehab the arc straightwire fn collided with the secondary which he had already skidded in to because its the next next step up and the pc through overrun and so forth he just slid into the next step up and all the time the auditor was trying to rehab the arc straightwire the guy was trying to run the secondary which made an interesting looking session auditor trying to do one thing the pc doing something else you know well you would have said by golly thats enough thats enough enough certainly to have thrown any case out the window right there yeah yeah yeah the case became unsolvable but going back through earlier green forms on the case an rs was found on missed withholds an rs was found on connected to suppressive group and neither one had been handled or touched by the auditor now how the hell could an auditor go right past the green form see great big rs turn on on missed withhold and never inquire what it was not only that but another auditor had come along later doing green form and had gotten blow down on missed withholds and had gotten blow down on connected to suppressive group and had never inquired what they were in addition to that in the sea check the guy had walked into the organization so damn high on lsd that his eyeballs were archimedes spirals going round and round and that was in the sec check so what happened he sat the case down pulled the missed withhold it was an over your dead body sort of of an action got what suppressive group it was the fellow knew and then rehabbed fantastic amount of overrun and weird release on drugs i dont know the length of the session i think the total session maybe took forty five minutes so here where standard tech had already been passed by we had an unsolvable case that was just sitting there anybody who really didnt know his business would have immediately accepted this invitation to do something wild weird and wonderful here was this fellow with his tone arm stuck way up in the roof unresolvable couldnt be audited nattering wouldnt go near qual hardly could be forced into an auditing chair reporting to the mo spent thirty six hours or so in hospital where the doctors could find nothing wrong with him these are all unusual solutions his unusual solution to his case was to stay away from qual quals unusual solution was to send him to the hospital people were asking for some brand new technique to come up and hit it and what was it it was case overrun on drugs with missed withhold and connected to suppressive group also which didnt have to be resolved to solve the case he was also wanted by his draft board and was running out on it as known present time problem which didnt come up in auditing so you see standard tech only had to be about three quarters in to resolve the case case resolved beautifully now when i see folder which is about foot thick with mislisted lists i know there is enough there to wrap it around telegraph pole when i see tremendous number of sessions which didnt fn and when i also havent got the case folder for the entirety of the auditing and the case has been overrun on lot of early processes i could feel very very sad about the whole thing because its almost an herculean job to untangle it the goofs have added on top of goofs have added on top of goofs now youre going to see this in case supervision in class viii you not only have to be whiz bang auditor you also have to be case supervisor and there are two distinct skills to audit you only know how to audit but to case supervise you have to know exactly what is wrong with the case in order to order what auditor another trick entirely separate tricks and if you think you have to know it to audit brother what you have to know to case supervise you have to know your data you have to know standard tech data main line because in one of these things you hand it over to only slightly experienced auditor who starts goofing it instead of repairing the list hes never heard of the laws of listing he attests that he has he can parrot something but he doesnt know why you do list and he doesnt know this and he doesnt know that and you ask him to repair list oh my god aaah he doesnt know enough about listing himself to repair mislisted list so you get back case folder where the case is more messed up you said the right thing you said straighten out this list and you gave it back you gave it to this auditor and this auditor he never heard of listing you thought he did but he somehow or another managed to sleep through it all and you get the folder back worse off he he didnt even repair the existing list he added nine page list to an already complete list and the case is worse off than before so you say well we will be hopeful about this and we direct what it is and we get the guy grooved in on exactly what hes supposed to do and we give it back to him or to another auditor and when we get the folder back hes decided that it was really not lists that was worrying this fellow but the fact that the man hates auditors so he has run from where could you hate an auditor do you see ant the case is now worse off and you as case supervisor get the thing back you will actually have to decide now that you are in fire fight of some kind or another and its over auditors dead body and so you have to have method of cutting their throats well the proper order is do an l1 with the prefix on lists and just clean up each read as it goes through in other words youre not going to let anybody look at list again youre going to pick up the arc breaks which are in restimulation on the subject of lists and let it go at that because thats all you can do so your case supervision is limited by the skill of the auditor whos doing the auditing for you you sometimes have to pull your shots you know for instance that this case needs to be to get the full four rundown or something like that theres something out with the full rundown and youve got an auditor there that you know damn well he cant do it well so therefore you have to figure out something he can do that will still straighten out the case and thats the only variability you get in case supervision your case supervisor orders may be beyond the ability of the auditor to execute that is usually demonstrated you never really pull your shots on case supervision you say exactly what hes supposed to be doing exactly its when you get into these wild fire fights or correcting correction so you give case supervision and then they goof it so you have to now correct the correction well you can only do that couple of times without all of sudden having such glorious mess on your hands that you had better take some more direct route obviously beyond the skill of the auditor to do even though its very standard action you say the case because he feels very sad is in an arc break of long duration thats standard statement sad case arc break long duration boom boom little data add up at once and you give it back to the auditor and the auditor gets in some kind of fire fight with the pc see and he puts in an rfactor well i had folder today the auditor managed to get into fire fight with the pc over an rfactor god i dont know how he did that that must have been masterpiece how could you get into fire fight the auditor must have said something very weird instead of saying were going to do an assessment on the case this isnt what it was but instead of saying im going to assess list on your case and so forth were going to find out what type of resistive case you are must have because he had protest on resistive case so he must have mentioned it course he was good auditor he wouldnt evaluate now some auditor you give an you give case supervision you say this girl is leading highly illegal sort of second dynamic existence so therefore were going to pull missed withholds you have gotten it on your intelligence lines that this is the case with this case dont you see or youve gotten it from something or other or the case natters in session all these various indicators or the case is just chewing up more husbands than she can get married to its sort of assembly line you know so you figure there must be some kind of an irregularity on the second dynamic so obviously because the case is mad at men or something like this youve got indicators indicators indicators see and you say case is living rather irregular second dynamic existence pull the missed withholds then this auditor he shows the case the we dont have any we dont have any control over this you see as case supervisor but we sure can find out what happened cause the session wont come off unless its totally false reported and the pc when they go to the examiner isnt going to do anything if the session didnt come off why its going to show up on the examiner line and if it doesnt show up on the examiner line i guarantee itll show up on the ethics line later you got two spots of control here shows up at the examiners or it shows up at the ethics itll also show in further sign ups see so these spots if you were really doing case supervisor job your admin would be to find out who is in ethics whos in ethics trouble what pcs have just gone through here that ethics orders have been issued on and another one would be from the registrar of who hasnt signed up for the next grade so youd want leaving interview now i can tell you the tech is out if over fifty percent of the pcs going through an hgc do not show up for leaving interview now you can jump on routing and you can jump on this and you can say how the hell did that get out the truth of the matter is pcs must be avoiding it so tech must be out now it would be very interesting then to take such people that didnt show up at the registrars office when they left the organization and to check them back against your folders and then you will find out that aloicious q zilch hgc auditor lies lies lies if the ta is at seven he writes two fn the lies are never slight and so you hang him and get on about your business case supervisors neck is always out the false auditing reports so therefore there are various checkpoints by which the false report shows up but the basis of this is and must be that the case supervisor has certainty on standard tech see he must know that standard tech applied standardly works if hes wondering does this work or something that doesnt work or should i go back to yogi i used to have such fun sitting in an ibis position he cant police it down like that now we had one today case supervision i gave little list to be audited little list one two three four items and this was what by understanding with the pc having trouble with any one of these items or with any one of these items charged and one of them blew down and fned it was just the list blew down and fned well i could tell this because the folder was i dont know eight or nine feet thick thats an exaggeration it was only about six inches thick but wow now we say well golly if the guy if the guy blew down and fned hes got something wild absolutely wild what terrible auditing he had all the way along the line well its obviously what was wrong with the case well its passed an fn and there isnt any thing you can do about it oh yeah oh as case supervisor that told that the person had withholds from that item so in the next session were going to pull the missed withholds because it was list of people who were trying to help him so i set up list of people who were trying to help this person and one of them blew down and he said oh they were absolutely terrible so i know then at once thats critical opinion so we pull the missed withhold elementary its not even very clever its very standard i want to find out where where is this character sitting this guy been audited over ptps missed withhold arc breaks what see well by ordering prep check on certain number of items after assessment i could tell from the answers where hes been sitting i was denied the information because on one of the items he blew down and went fn and that was the end of that of course you didnt prep check beyond that theres still missed withholds sitting there so now were going to get in suppress on missed withholds and pull the missed withholds and the casell sail missed withholds dont read in session but they must be there they must be there cause the folders too thick see what i mean case has critical opinions folder too thick blows down on people trying to help him must have missed withhold person isnt sad so it isnt an arc break his case rollycoasters so it isnt ptp change oh theres change there the only ones left is missed withholds now that would be combined with overts so when it comes back and the person doesnt have any missed withholds thats great im going to have overts and we will get around to this sooner or later and the case will longer go to review the case supervisor is in the business of ending off review cycles he is never in the business of starting them case supervisor who has too many people going to review after he has had them supervised in the hgc must be working with the damndest crew of bums as auditors anybody ever heard of or himself must be driven up the wall by inventiveness something must be very out but what you keep your paws on is standard tech dont let that slip see thats the thing which mustnt slip pcs slip auditors slip reporting of cases slips see various things slip but not standard tech that doesnt slip now unless you know that well subjectively and so on it will slip because you just have it on my say so so therefore the progress is that the auditor should be able to get horrendous wins with standard tech and boy when hes really got it in the groove sits down across from that ole pc and he says rattatatat and the meter says rattlybang fn rattatatat booms he just sits there an auditor who can audit this by the way gets so cocky and insufferable he cant be lived with he does and that is frailty because when you get hotter than pistol as an auditor you then automatically assume you can case supervise and thats another skill thats really calling your shots and when case supervision youre saying the number three ball in the right corner pocket and the auditor he doesnt even pick up cue he thinks its hit with base ball bat so youve entered this piece of randomity on your auditing lines and it tends to sort of begin to shake you little bit but if you know what can be done then you know what he ought to be doing and i assure you that standard tech correctly applied applied standardly gets one zero zero par cientum variations goof balled mucked up application and so forth are all that reduce it so its your business to get it applied your foe is the introduction of somebody who knows best the bird is sitting there auditing the pc and the pc comes up with wide open invitation to squirrel and the auditor the knuckle head departs from the cs and squirrels now youve got patch up of the session sighs because if this auditor squirreled once hes liable to squirrel twice so you have to start nailing it in with ethics presence and then the next thing you know you get the session folder back and hes not squirrel this time boy hes blown his cool from here to the north pole gone hes just in lot of pieces if you were to research into this you would find out that inadvertently youve put him to auditing his exgirlfriend or that she looks just like his mother something is goofed up here of some kind or another something has entered into it which has business in the line of any kind whatsoever when you get into one of these fire fights whereby youre trying to get case supervisor instructions actually done and the auditor is doing other things but every now and then you get an auditor who will be obliging and write down that he did what he didnt do and hes the only guy who can hang you you cant straighten that out as case supervisor youve got to go in through the lines youve got to go in to order restraining youve got to go into all kinds of side lines that you really have business in case supervisors neck is out mile on false auditing report so therefore he must be absolutely merciless when he receives one its the only thing that can wreck him if he can get the facts and if he can read the auditing report thats another thing its an actual fact if im auditing for blood as qual here can tell you when i cant read the auditing report it goes back with some asperity and velocity i wont have anything to do by the way this is very good rule dont have anything to do with an auditing report you cant read dont have anything to do with it if you get into it you will be over mastered sometimes by your curiosity to know what happened to zilch sort of like one man stanley continued story you know you want to know what happens to zilch so you try to make out this and he had new auditor today and this auditor writes script which is just continuous series of ees and this auditor writes script which is just continuous series of ees and you cant read it and the second you discover that to be the fact you take if you are really on the groove and youre really clever you really know your business you turn it around without trying to make it out and send it back for printing in different colored pen over every indecipherable word make him rewrite the whole thing and then you assign him projects in penmanship until he can write so that he can be read you never go it by halves because ill tell you why youre gonna eventually start winding up with headaches as case supervisor you got misunderstoods all over the place youre trying to find out what the hell did the pc say what what is that looks like ees is it leave have boo boo catterwamp and you sometimes read these out as they would actually look and you get butter wump mum hip and you keep doing this youre gonna wind up with an antipathy toward an auditing report an auditor actually part of his training should be to write rapidly legibly anybody can learn how to do it doesnt even take much practice few days ago i ordered an auditor to learn how to write and ill be of gun session came up next session that person did few days later came up the auditor was writing im sure the session wasnt slowed up only took him few days to learn how to write but case supervisor should never accept an indecipherable folder because he starts laying mysteries into his line hell start making mistakes and this is whats more i tell you he doesnt do his job fast see he does his job right now and so forth but that is to say he doesnt do his job on the basis that the pc has got to be audited cause hes leaving for spokane just out of pure cussedness dont do the folder what about that pc thats got to leave for spokane hes got to catch four oclock plane weve got to give him session hes got his reservations and so forth as case supervisor you should say bubber out bub let him catch the plane next saturday because i want him to go back to spokane right not rushed what frame of mind must this guy be in during the auditing session sitting on the edge of the chair watching his clock lets see its review awawaww in the first place standard sessions are very rapid and very very very rapid and theres percentage in pointing the guy wrong as ive told you before percentage in it whatsoever just make sure youre pointing it right dont think twice about you look at this and you wonder what the hell what whats this whats this i dont know this case isnt acting right and send it back to the auditor to get an assessment done send it back to the examiner to get the case looked at folder looks little bit funny to you looks little bit weird something little bit weird about it send it back to the examiner for another examination dont take chances with it because thats not where you save your time time is saved in the case supervision being correct and in the auditing being expert do you see and youll learn eventually so that your lines smooth out you do them very rapidly but when in doubt the only time you miss is when you get in rush or you talk you get in such rush you send for the auditor cuts your throat boy want to sell stock he thinks hes standing there looking condition of doubt in the teeth maybe hell tell you anything its facts and then of course youre just seeing the pc from his viewpoint and he perhaps is offended he has tried to help the pc and the pc wasnt helped in some fashion or another so hes offended so he blames you the fact that he forgot to start the session and plug in his meter he ignores so in the final analysis your grip on standard tech must be so standard that you expect standard results and settle for nothing less and you solve the problems that you run into in auditing on that basis now you could get into some situation where guy is in an upper ot this would be the toughest situation i would know of the guy is in an upper ot section classification as you walk on the scene as case supervisor and his ta is at 5 and he has apparently had all known remedies hes been run on what has been overrun he has been rehabbed on anything and everything you could think of and he his ta is up there and that something like that will be your first invitation to squirrel because heres heres the facts somewhere in that line of all this has been done is false report it hasnt i found one the other day case was way high what has been overrun has been run on the case bababa baba i went back i found the session of what has been overrun do you know what the auditor did the auditor listed list of what has been overrun indicated reading items on it although many of them read and then didnt rehab any of the things that were overrun the right way to do this list is its it is not list it is simply an auditing question for which you are writing down the answers in order to do something with them so he write down the first thing and it had fall alright now at that moment you take that item which he has just put down and you run it back to the time it was released and before it was overrun and you may not get an fn on that one you now give the next item the pc gives you the next item and theres read on that so you neglect it the pc gives you the next item you get long fall good you take that subject you run it back you rehab it good now you got the next subject hes talking about all kinds of things you know bookkeepings been overrun well you run it back to when it was released youll get some charge off of each one of these things as you try to rehab it and you get him down the line here another item another item six eight items later that have read each one of them rehabbed to time when they went release the tone arm has gradually come down and in most of cases where this is happening and there isnt also something else wildly wrong it then fns and the tone arm has been cured dont be surprised if it tends to go up because probably lot of his grades are overrun because they sat on ruds or lot of his grades never went release because he was so overrun when he got into scientology and so forth that auditors just sort of despaired of actually getting an fn and theyd give him fns of 39 or something and the truth of the matter is the guys grades are out and they never did go release but youve cured the earlier overruns you can bring him up to point now where he can do something about it now youd have to decide whether or not it was audited over out ruds or if it was because of basic track overrun that he never went release on his grades which which was the reason which was the reason well funny phenomena will occur you can put in the ruds an upper ot guy or something like this you can put in the ruds before the point put in the ruds before auditing put in his arc breaks ptps on the whole track and get him up to point now check again the release points they dont occur good hes not flat on arc straightwire engrams secondaries the lot all the way up the line he isnt flat on single god damn thing every one of them has to be run you say magnificent how the hell did he get this far well i dont know how far could bunch of auditors that didnt know what they were doing push guy how many false attests can you get an infinity of course but youll see this case and they will say everything has been done particularly if youre new on post somebody wants to shake you down put you in place see well heres this case heres this case zilch hahool everythings been done hat everythings been done the lot the whole yeah everything what has been overrun valence shifters confront weve rehabbed all grades rehabbed drugs rehabbed education hes had forty five remedy bs one hundred and seventy two s and ds weve done everything we can do hes weve rehabbed all the fns that ever occurred on green forms and sec checks weve done all of this and there he is and you say oh my gods you start looking through the auditing reports on the case which you have to study very carefully case supervisor always does he looks through these things and he looks through these things and they all seem to be ok it all seems to be done alright wow theres your whole tool bag heen emptied out on the ground every one of thems been used hm i would do something like this on resistive case has anything been suppressed prep check the following you dont care you can always prep check things prep check assessment lists prep check s and ds you dont care what youre gonna suppress you know prep check some things you cant even assess this list anymore theres eighteen assessments of resistive cases in it see and all of sudden something blows down now you can follow what blew down back as the false report chain got it you can take and prep check everything on the resistive cases list including resistive cases lists something is gonna bd somethings suppressed theres something still out handle it now something else comes into view and you find out that youve been handed bundle of lies everything hasnt been done id just compare it the same thing the guy the unresolvable case the completely and utterly unresolvable case who yet rsed and then blew down on missed withholds and connected to suppressive groups i mean what more do you want i mean how the hell you say can an auditor sit there and actually look at meter do this and notice it because he wrote it in his auditing report and never asked the guy single question what was the missed withhold well it compares to power which i inspected in one of your folders oh my god aaah 5a and it says almost direct quote places place pc says place is not the answer pc sitting quietly thinking blow down fn and then he took him to 1d drums fingers on table blew down on what the pc was listing without talking in other words the auditing was so god damn bad that the pc has ceased to talk to the auditor he was listing to himself well thats because the item just above it hadnt been given to the pc they were just listed to fn dadadadamm you get it never found the item never gave it to the pc or its wrong item the list needs to be checked but theres evidence the pc listing to himself he wasnt giving any items but he had blow down and smiled quietly i dont think he smiled quietly i think he smiled god damned sarcastically what was the item the pc thought of that caused the blow down obviously the auditor should give it to him left the pc with withhold of one item not only did he not give the pc his items on this but he left the pc with withhold of one of the items which is on 1c this is clown stuff but you look back over lineup like this you can find errors unfortunately this persons already been through the cc so that is not corrective list powers not corrective you can get into trouble because you you you can correct it if the person never went clear but you can get into trouble how do you get into trouble well when you try to straighten it out you inadvertently start running it you find out the list the power list or commands or something werent complete and you find that as the wrongness now youre gonna have to run power and you run power after clear you wrap the pc around telegraph pole one auditor in one thousand pcs would be able to do it and get away with it and thinking hed gotten away with something hed find out the pc never went clear in the first place but then your side data comes in oh well i i ran pc on power one time after he was clear and nothing happened i dont see why theres any proviso on that were only dealing with all data see of course you could probably rehabilitate rehab power on this pc or that pc maybe even when they were clear without any great consequence or even with bit of win see but its not one of these data you could do it with every pc so every time you did it youd take one hell of chance and then the pc that it couldnt be done on boys now you gonna untangle that see because you can only untangle it by rehabbing it which and power is an area where you can get into fire fight on your correction on person after hes been cleared because you of course are never dealing with his power youll find some body thetan on whom of course you could run power so youre busy involved in running body thetan power power on body thetan and then the individual himself of course misowns this and thinks power isnt flat it gets into mess with great rapidity so were talking in standard tech on the data you can do on every pc every time but again it follows the laws of processes on case supervision there are only so many things that you can do but you can only do them once now when theyve all been done you have to ask the question of were they done so this gets to be very fascinating because of course they havent all been done now youre only thing you have to solve is which one is false resort not to overweigh the or overrun the the object of the lesson but this is what it takes now youre probably struggling along with an infinity of data and you think that there is an infinity of data and itd only be an infinity of data if you had an infinity of fixed ideas the data are very few the overall technical data are probably under i dont know what they are just at guess two three four five hundred at the absolute outside im talking about data in the body of data theres things like the axioms and things like this you include these things in as far as processes are concerned why there probably arent fifty and in the numbers of ways to do them theres only one so what are you talking about infinity of data see theres infinity of data theres an infinity of goofiness in life that can go to infinity with the greatest of ease so whenever you see whenever you see somebody squirrelling you know hes already goofed and that is the law concerning it squirrel has already goofed now he cant goof so seriously that he cant ungoof his goof thats not possible unless he takes brick and hits the pc over the head and exteriorizes him forcibly and buries the body someplace and then cant find the pc but if you cant get your goof would mostly consist of being unable to get the pc to come back into session sometimes he has to be sort of dragged back but goof always precedes the squirrelling and that goes clear back to 1950 if somebody in 1950 had taken book one and theyd run engrams the way book one said just that and theyd done that why they would have found high percentage of resolution of cases just like that and they got high percentage of resolution of cases but engram running started to go out sideways and it went out sideways over great many years until short time ago it was reported that engram auditing by chains was very old hat and even looked on like squirrelling brother i sure dont know how youd ever resolve hung up 3 if you couldnt run engrams by chains couldnt its the only road left open see what i mean somebody can come along and take one of the basic central data he can take basic central datum and he can say oh its gone now i know we really dont do that anymore i just came from the flag ship and so forth and they they dont do that anymore move it off the line now standard tech doesnt work anymore and that is normally what happens they either take datum or body of data off the line by invalidation or they put some new data on the line by evaluation and that way the subject goes crooked and its longer straight subject so it doesnt work so people have to invent all kinds of damn things to make it work so you see then why i work hard to hold the line its very easily made unworkable all you have to do is throw away the text book now there are certain beliefs that certain subjects of one kind or another have certain degrees of workability thats perfectly true natureopathy chiropractic to name few antique things phrenology where they told fortunes by the bumps on the skull which i think is they changed its name after while to psychology they tell fortunes by the bumps on the brain there isnt actually any difference in these data even psychology preempted the word of soul study of thats what the word means when they start teaching psychology they started teaching it by saying they didnt know what it meant thats great place to start student isnt it psychology well we do not know what the word means because psyche means soul and we dont have anything to do with soul you think im kidding but that is how the last psychology text book read that came off the press just ahead of volume one 1950 i was down at the american book company and i saw this blue covered books were coming off the endless belt of the binder and they were coming off pocketa pocketa and we were waiting because there was big ceremony involved in it for dianetics the modern science of mental health to come up the first copy through the binder and it was following this blue book so i turned around to to the head of american book and i said what book is that and he picked up copy of it out of the bin it was the university of illinois i think it was psychology text book it was their basic college textbook and i said i must have this one and took it off the lines right ahead of dianetics the modern science of mental health and i said we will preserve this one in concrete so that the psychologist cannot in the future lie about how much he knew about dianetics and that is the way the book starts we dont know what psychology means it says along about line four or five or ten or something somewhere in the volume intelligence cannot change it is that way when the person is born it is the same when he dies you look at this damn thing you never saw such parade of lies in your life so i said well keep this one ive still got it in my library it shows the state of the mind just before ad 0 state of the mind what did they know about it pffft now the great discoveries that are made in universities professor humphgaw the great professor humphgaw has just understood that life has something to do with affinity give nobel prize the lion see see they read our textbook you see and they sometimes you can get textbook on philosophy or religion or something in the library and you can look through it page after page and youll find somebody has marked lines and they have looked through this book only to find things which agreed with their own fixed ideas and this book you go through lot of library shelves on these subjects and youll for sure find one and its marked you know some obvious thing you know men are males you know and youll see over here in the margin so true laughter so you could expect for number of years yet to come i suppose the great discoveries are brought about through somebody reads handbook for preclears or something of this sort and he reads some line in there all of sudden he realizes that that is the subject for complete research foundation and goes ahead and investigates us its pretty weird but theyd be much better off if they found out the line following it too that also was important so that you actually can get subtractions from subject you can get little isolated bits brought out of the subject you can take bits out of context and then build these things up so that somebodys rather pauperized understanding can reach into some situation and get men are males and then build the whole thing up around men are males and theres whole bunch of technology like this but it doesnt work theres workability because very few people have that fixed idea most people know it already so the whole subject is any subject which youre trying to hold the lines of is then wide open to variation if the person one doesnt have variability factor being entered in by some stable fixed idea that somebody has and the net result of it is workability now people who have had the subject work well on their cases and theyve seen pocketa ding thud crash and it worked just like that they dont have any question about this as the right way to do it because it has worked but then people who have been audited without those data and without those laws or rules being applied list over listed under listed items not given to em power run upside down forgot to run grades 2 and grades 3 and before they ran grade 4 this sort of thing they get into feeling of wobble wobble they havent experienced standard tech so they consider that it is nonstandard and its always more difficult to teach somebody who has been subjected to nonstandard tech than somebody who has received good straight forward standard tech up the lines but if you really want to teach somebody the subject and make him missionary on the whole idea is after he has been mucked up from to lizzard put him back together again with standard tech zoom thud hes been worrying about his case for the last three years you put him back together again with just straight standard tech and you put him back together again so fast he hardly knew what happened it went pffft pffft pffft never knew wow he isnt necessarily overwhelmed but he now has the idea that is can be done wrong too and i think in any group taking class viii course there will be certain number who have some idea and subjective reality that it can be done wrong there will also be some some small number of characters who have done it wrong and have received it wrong and dont quite know what theyre studying and so dont quite know what to hold on to because it havent seen the workability subjectively objectively see theyve gotten into some back eddy of sauirrelishness on the thing somehow or another and just left their case parked in right field and their understanding parked some place back of home base and theyre not quite sure what theyre looking at and they get confused now in this state groping for some orientation groping for something why theyll hold onto some data like fury which may be very minor datum you know like arc contains r they really know it contains r they got subjective reality on that you have to spread them out from that theyre fixed on that because lot of confusion is oriented by that and when you say theres more to it theres also and theres also c why youre spreading em out to point where the confusion starts to hit them little bit and so they go back to the thing well i really am certain that r is r you see how it happens so anyway holding the line holding the line trying to get it to go straight down right down the groove and so on is subjectable to many cross currents so that the subject with certain things subtracted from it ceases to work on certain people who then start looking for some other way to do it who then come in with some god damn fool opinion who didnt know in the first place and blow and the whole subject goes up in smoke deteriorates which is unfortunate men who know the laws of listing dont follow them then they get some loses on cases now the cases theyve audited dont think they think the laws of listing have been applied so they think the laws of listing are wrong so they invent some new idea of listing which is that all over listed lists must be over listed and that is what an auditor is up against now the auditor himself is subjected to certain amount of invalidation because he does what he thinks is necessary and what he is sure is the right thing to do and he finds out it doesnt straighten out the pc this particular instant didnt straighten out the pc so this makes him feel like hes had little bit of lose he sees the examiner reports the guy left the session apparently ok appeared at the examiner and there was something out well how did that happen so he feels bit invalidated he feels he should do something else beyond the cs beyond the case supervision he should do something else so the case supervisor sees this and then he is subjected to certain amount of invalidation from the auditor the auditor you know didnt do so well that time when he appeared at the examiner he wasnt alright somethings wrong well the one thing you can find to agree on in all this and this is the stable datum the one thing you can find to agree on all this is that something is departure from standard tech that gives you an orientation zone from which to orient your disagreements the auditor probably busy blaming the case supervisor the case supervisor busy blaming the auditor and the pc sitting back there with completely suppressed read on ptp its completely suppressed because present time problem doesnt communicate to him every time you ask for present time problem why he knows what problems are theyre solution to things and he hasnt got any solutions all hes got is worry the communication to the pc is out and it hasnt emerged or hes got an arc break of long duration hes there not on his own determinism forced to be there and he suffers through it all the idea of arc break is completely foreign to him because the word doesnt communicate or because hes been asked for arc breaks and then had them invalidated you can get an infinity of wrongnesses that happened with the guy but the resolution of the case will be arc breaks are out ptp is out or missed withholds are out or hes committing continuous present time overts some grade is out that was supposed to have been run but wasnt the list that was supposed to have been done was to wrong item its falsely listed or the general approach on trs completely out of the case supervisors sight and completely out of the auditors sight early on why it was just constant invalidation the auditing sessions he had several auditing sessions in which each one of them was just constant invalidation well thats not right actually what you mean is so and so see something weird has gone on nevertheless you can untangle it all its where youve had departures from these exact actions and some of those departures are important and some of them are unimportant now ill give you an example of what is unimportant i see in case summaries which auditors do theyre prone to list the administrative errors of the auditor they go through the folder and they list the administrative errors they raise hell the auditor didnt totally date the session he didnt give the year he just gave the month and day and he writes the ta down in the wrong column and you cant tell the difference in that and he doesnt give all of what the pc said and he gave reason why he ended off the session or something these are administrative administrative administrative and an auditor doing case summary case summary case supervisors error summary of course is thing it is going through every session you can get your hands on and finding every auditing blunder in that session and making list of these well making this list well youll find out an auditor whos green at this or case supervisor whos very green at this he will go into this on the basis of the administrative flubs do you see you know he didnt date it and he didnt write down there is summary report absolutely reprehensible there is summary report for this session and so forth and he just goes on and on and on page after page after page its the wildest listing you ever saw because not one of them would affect pc at alit the viewpoint from which case error summary lists are done is the viewpoint of what has an auditor done that would have messed up pc now it could also be done from what would mess up case supervisor so youre interested basically in what would have messed up the pc secondarily in what would mess up the case supervisor in trying to case supervise it thats why admin is tough and straight just so the people can tell whats happening that is basically what you want out of an error summary report what you want is what has been done that would have affected the pc adversely what departures from standard tech do you find we find ptp has always been handled by invent another problem aaaahhh therefore we know theres going to be charge on the subject of ptps so were going to have to get ptp corrected we can prep check it you always got prep checks theyre you can prep check anything overrun check for overrun on ptp check for this check for that see overrun prep check do something about it but youve got it there look at this god damn it for one and one half years this case they attempted to solve this case in review somewhere and they consistently ran invent another problem invent another problem invent another problem and the case has just been getting worse and worse what really hasnt changed his main basic characteristics see youve got your error summary that would have affected the case that was important and the session which goes wiggle biggie zibble zig zig wwwww voom you cant understand it so the case supervisors been done in so you say out admin shoot the auditor thats what your folder error summary should consist of what affects the case and what would affect its case supervision thats all thats important there isnt anything else thats important so it says ptp fn doesnt say the pc said anything it just blew this and that it happened two years ago the auditors already been hanged it isnt gonna affect the case one way or the other see so why remark it say the hell with it that way you get the important things the very very important things mislisted list lists fifty s and ds done in the same week see thats the stuff thats the stuff now you know you know what to order too many s and ds fly the needle on s and ds overrun of find you cant do that do an l1 thatll be your case supervision on s and ds do an l1 fly the needle on s and d rehab if this is impossible l1 with the opening line is on s and ds do something in this character which is very standard standard list you do it to this subject but on folder summary in looking back over it youll find these damned s and ds s and ds s and ds s and ds christ how many suppressives are there on the planet see theyre over listed under listed wrongly executed you know wow that must be an awful zone now but if we find out we cant do anything about it we better stop restimulating it and you get the other part of the coin you couldnt get anything done about it so dont do anything about it dont get into one of these perpetuals gonna take year and half to rehab this case see because the case is gonna get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse over repair do you have better grip on this yes if you think theres an infinity of data then you must have confronted an infinity of wrongnesses and having confronted it let it blow and hold on to the main line thank you very much
