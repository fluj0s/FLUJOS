from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to orson vandeplassche ovdplasschemailwesleyanedu subject re tree rings date thu may 27 105756 1999 cc kbriffauea dear orson very sorry for such slow reply the individual curves tornetrask taimyr and yamal have not been calibrated against their local temperature records yet and so only exist as standardised or normalised anomalies for the calibrated tornetrask record of briffa et 1992 the calibrated reconstruction made use of both treering width and treering density and so it will look different to the ringwidth only record shown in the pages newsletter recently for the earlier extension to this record only ringwidth will be available which is why the calibrated record cannot be simply extended with the new data instead new calibration needs to be made using ringwidth only this hasnt been done yet and while it might be simple linear regression sometimes ringwidths from one year and from the previous year are used together as predictors so i cannot guarantee that it will be simple rescaling of the uncalibrated curve nevertheless the uncalibrated curve is correlated with summer temperature so it certainly provides useful information the average of the three series was calibrated after they were averaged and was calibrated against the aprilseptember mean temperature over all land north of 20n this was purely for comparison with the other curves shown in our science piece for this curve this region is by means the optimum and the temperature anomalies would doubt differ in magnitude if regional temperature from northern eurasia had been used instead this offers one explanation of why the 650750 warming differs from briffa et 1992 the second is that only ringwidth has been used the third reason is that it is the average of 3 curves if the other two dont show the warming or not as strongly then of course the signal will be less pronounced in the average so you can still use the briffa et 1992 calibration it is certainly not wrong hope this helps with your choice of what to use we will send you reprint to your middletown address when they arrive i am now going to mail you hard copy black white of the tornetrask uncalibrated ringwidth record annual and 50yr smoothed from the pages article and also hard copy of the calibrated northern eurasia record from the science paper the northern eurasian record should preferably be referenced using both briffa osborn and briffa et best regards tim
