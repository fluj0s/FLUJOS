will be paid to military retirees in fy2008 in the past some have viewed this budget item as place where substantial budgetary savings could be made however past modifications intended to save money have had deleterious effect on military recruiting and retention with ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan neither the executive branch or congress have recently proposed altering the present system as shown in table 1 the number of military retirees and the cost of their retirement has increased annually over the past several years these figures differ somewhat from those in table

remain likely prospect for todays active duty and reserve personnel 2 department of defense valuation of the military retirement system september 30 2006 office of the actuary november 2007 p 12 3 department of defense fiscal year 2007 dod statistical report on the military retirement system office of the actuary may 2008 pp 85 and 101 4 survivors include the spouse children and others with an insurable interest who are entitled to death benefits from the dod military retirement fund crs3 as result they believe that now is not the time to make changes based on cost savings three systems different retired pay calculations there are three separate and distinct but related retirement systems within dod one for active duty members one for the reserve components and one for those who become disabled and are generally unable to complete normal 20year military career due to their physical disability each of these retirement systems includes provision for an annual costofliving allowance cola that will be discussed later active component retirement5 for active duty military personnel there are three methods of calculating retired pay the final basic pay systemhigh threeand redux the applicable retirement calculation is based on the date when the servicemember first entered active duty and their basic pay6 at the time of retirement7 and in the case of redux voluntary election regarding 30000 bonus the active and reserve component retirement systems vest after 20 years of service vesting for the disability retiree occurs at their disability retirement date and in some cases at the personal choice of the servicemember final basic pay system for persons who entered military service before september 8 1980 the retired pay computation base is final monthly basic pay being received at the time of retirement multiplied by 25 for each full year of service and prorated by 112th for each complete month less than full year8 the minimum amount of retired pay to which member entitled under this formula is therefore 50 of the retired pay computation base 20 years of service x 25 servicemember who retires at 25 years receives 625 of the computation base 25 years of service x 25 historically the maximum reached at the 30year mark has been 75 of the computation base 30 years of service x 25 5 also frequently referred to as regular nondisability retirement 6 basic pay is the principal element of regular military compensation rmc the other elements include the basic allowance for housing bah the basic allowance for subsistence bas and the federal tax advantage that results from bah and bas being nontaxable allowances basic pay is between 65 and 75 of rmc depending on individual circumstances thus 20year retiree may receive 50 of their basic pay upon retirement but only 33 of rmc rmc excludes all special pay and bonuses reimbursements educational assistance and any value associated with nonmonetary benefits such as health care commissaries and post exchanges 7 unlike some civilian retirement plans there is provision in any of the military retirement systems for lump sum withdrawal upon retirement 8 section 1405b pl 99348 july 1 1986 crs4 however the fy2007 national defense authorization act extended the previous pay table to 40 years allowed additional longevity raises9 and provided additional retirement credit for service beyond 30 years at the rate of 25 per year10 as result servicemember who retires with 40 years of service will qualify for 100 of their final basic pay in retirement servicemember with 41 years of service will retire with 1025 of their final basic pay 41 years of service x the 25 multiplier 1025 the final basicpay cohort that entered the military before september 8 1980 and will have 29 years of service in 2009 they are quickly aging out of the system and it is expected that all will be retired by 201611 high three for those who entered service on or after september 8 1980 the computation base is the average of the highest three years 36 months of basic pay rather than the final basic pay otherwise calculations are the same as under the final basic pay method redux reductions in retired pay for future retirees were enacted in the military retirement reform act of 198612 now referred to frequently as the redux military retirement system because it was thought that the preredux system was too generous the repeal of compulsory redux in late 1999 by the fy2000 national defense authorization act indicated that many in congress believed the preredux system was the appropriate way to compensate retirees congress began taking notice of potential recruiting and retention problems related to redux13 in 1997 well before the executive branch addressed the issue during the fall of 1998 the administration announced that it supported redux repeal the fy2000 national defense authorization act contained provisions for repealing compulsory redux it allows for postaugust 1 1986 entrants to retire under the preredux high three system or opt for redux plus an immediate 30000 cash payment personnel who first enter service on or after august 1 1986 are required to select one of these two options for calculating their retired pay within 180 days of reaching 15 years of service option 1 preredux they can opt to have their retired pay computed in accordance with the preredux formula described above as high three 9 section 601 pl 109364 october 17 2006 10 section 642 pl 109364 october 17 2006 11 department of defense valuation of the military retirement system september 30

purposes and legislative backgrounds april 2005 p 707 crs5 option 2 redux they can opt to have their retired pay computed in accordance with the redux formula and receive an immediate 30000 cash bonus called career status bonus which can actually be paid in several annual installments if the recipient so wishes for tax purposes those who select the career status bonus csb must remain on active duty until they complete 20 years of service or forfeit portion on the bonus the redux formula redux is different from the high three formula in two major ways under age 62 retirees first for retirees under age 62 the retired pay multiplier will be reduced by one percent for each year of creditable service less than 30 years under this new formula therefore 20year retiree will receive 40 of his or her retired pay computation base upon retirement 20 years of service x 25 minus 10 and 25year retiree will receive 575 of the computation base 20 years of service x 25 minus 5 30year retiree however will receive 75 of the retired pay computation base 20 years of service x 25 minus 0 the same as the high three retiree the redux formula therefore is skewed much more sharply in favor of the longerserving military careerist theoretically providing an incentive to remain on active duty longer before retiring retirees 62 and older second when retiree reaches age 62 his or her retired pay will be recomputed based on the old formula straight 25 of the retired pay computation base for each year of service thus beginning at 62 the 20year retiree receiving 40 of the computation base for retired pay according to the new formula will begin receiving 50 of his or her original computation base the 25year retirees annuity will jump from 575 of the original computation base to 625 and the 30year retirees annuity already at 75 of the original computation base under both the old and new formulas will not change note this change is an increase in monthly retired pay not lump sum at age 62 summary of these three retirement methods is portrayed in table 2 crs6 table 2 comparison of retirement methods final basic pay high three redux applies to servicemembers servicemembers servicemembers entering entering before entering from after july 31 1986 and september 8 1980 september 8 1980 accepting 15year career through july 31 1986 status bonus with and persons entering additional 5year

service and by retired pay system those retiring under the final pay system will soon begin to decrease significantly since the junior member of that cohort who is still on active duty will have 29 years of service in 2009 while the numbers for high three and redux should continue to increase these figures suggest that redux is the least popular retirement system crs7 table 3 retirees by

members16 must also complete 20 qualifying years of service to become eligible for retirement second the reserve retirement system also accrues at the rate of 25 per equivalent year of qualifying service explained below at retirement eligibility third the reserve retirement system uses either final basic pay or the high three to calculate retired pay redux is not an option for reservists the primary differences between the two systems is the point system used to calculate qualifying years equivalent years of service and the age at which the retirement annuity is paid for retirement purposes year of qualifying service is year in which reserve servicemember earns at least 50 retirement points points are awarded for variety of reserve activities one point for each day of active duty or annual training17 fifteen points year for membership in the selected reserve one point for each inactive duty training idt period18 14 includes active reserve and disability retirees 15 also referred to as nonregular retirement for additional information on reserve pay and benefits see crs report rl30802 reserve component personnel issues questions and answers by lawrence kapp march 14 2008 16 reserve component generally describes the six reserve components of the department of defense the army national guard the army reserve the navy reserve the marine corps reserve the air national guard and the air force reserve 17 annual training is twoweek period of active duty that usually results in 14 retirement points 18 day of active duty for training represents one unit training assembly uta the continued crs8 one point for each period of funeral honors duty one point for every three satisfactorily completed credit hours of certain military correspondence courses with multiple opportunities to earn points it is relatively easy for reserve component member to accrue the requisite 50 points per year and thus earn qualifying year for retirement the maximum number of points per year exclusive of active duty has varied over time but is currently capped at 130 points19 when active duty points are added to this total the reservist cannot earn more than 365 points year the number of points is critical in determining both the number of years of qualifying service and the number of equivalent years of service for retired pay calculation purposes reservist may retire after completing 20 years of qualifying service there is minimum age upon retirement the individual is normally transferred to the retired reserve and is entitled to number of military benefits to include commissary and exchange privileges access to morale welfare and recreation programs and facilities and limited space available travel on military aircraft reservists in the retired reserve and not yet retired pay eligible generally age 60 are referred to as gray area retirees since they are in the retired reserve but not yet eligible for retired pay or retiree medical benefits time spent in the retired reserve counts for longevity purposes and ultimately results in higher retired pay for example lieutenant colonel ltc who transitions to the retired reserve at age 45 will have their retired pay at age 60 calculated on the basic pay of lieutenant colonel with an additional 15 years of longevity the reservist will usually become eligible for retired pay at age 6020 and also then becomes eligible for military medical care the date the reservist became member of the armed forces determines whether their retired pay is calculated based on the final basic pay or high three system those entering before september 8 1980 will retire under the final basic pay system while those entering after september 8 1980 will retire under the high three system the actual calculation parallels the active duty system but requires separate calculation for each individual for example reserve component lieutenant colonel with 5000 points reverted to the retired reserve in 1993 after completing 20 18 continued normal drill weekend consists of 4 utas and therefore results in four retirement points year of weekend drills earns 48 utasretirement points 19 section 648 pl 110181 january 28 2008 20 section 648 of the fy2008 national defense authorization act reduced the age for receipt of retired pay by three months for each aggregate of 90 days of specified duty performed after january 28 2008 the date of enactment of the fy2008 ndaa this authority was not made retroactive to september 11 2001 the retired pay eligibility age cannot be reduced below 50 and eligibility for medical benefits remains at age 60 crs9 qualifying years of service in 2008 he turned 60 years of age and became eligible for retired pay to calculate his retired pay divide the total points by 360 to convert the points to years of equivalent service 5000 360 1389 then multiply the years of service by the 25 multiplier 1389 x 025 3472 using the final basic pay option the 2008 base pay for lieutenant colonel with 20 years of service is 737280 per month multiply earlier sum by the base pay 3472 x 737280 to determine that the monthly retirement annuity will be 2560 per month disability retirement servicemembers determined to be unfit for continued service and who have permanent and stable disqualifying physical condition may qualify for disability retirement commonly referred to as chapter 61 retirement eligibility is based on having dod disability rating of 30 or greater and at least 6 months or more on active duty and the disability was not noted at the time of entrance on active duty21 as result some disability retirees are retired before becoming eligible for longevity retirement while others have completed 20 or more years of service servicemember retired for disability may select one of two available options for calculating their monthly retired pay22 1 longevity formula retired pay is computed by multiplying the years of service times 25 and then times the pay base either final pay or high three as appropriate 2 disability formula retired pay is computed by multiplying the dod disability percentage by the pay base the maximum retired pay calculation under either formula cannot exceed 75 of basic pay23 retired pay computed under the disability formula is fully taxed unless the disability is the result of combatrelated injury retired pay under the longevity formula is taxable only to the extent that it exceeds what the individual would receive for combat related injury under the disability formula military retired pay and social security military personnel do not contribute portion of their salary to help pay for retirement benefits however they have paid taxes into the social security trust fund since january 1 1957 and are entitled to full social security benefits based on their military service military retired pay and social security are not offset against each other military retirees receive full social security benefits in addition to their military retired pay 21 10 usc 1201 b3b prior to the fy2008 ndaa section 1641 disability retirement required at least 8 years of service or disability that resulted from active duty or was incurred in the line of duty during war or national emergency 22 10 usc 1401 23 10 usc 1401 crs10 retired pay and the costofliving allowance military retired pay is protected against inflation by statute 10 usc 1401a the military retirement reform act of 1986 in conjunction with recent changes contained in the fy2000 national defense authorization act provide for colas as indicated below congress has not modified the cola formula24 since 1995 although virtually every year since 1982 some cola modifications always with the aim of reducing costs and hence the payments to retirees have been at least discussed the most recent military retirement cola was 23 first applied to the retired pay disbursed on january 1 2008 the next cola has been announced at 58 and will to be applied to the retired pay disbursed on january 1 2009 for discussion of proposed and actual cola changes from fy1983 to fy2005 see crs report 98 223 colas for preaugust 1 1986 entrants for military personnel who first entered military service before august 1 1986 each december cola equal to the percentage increase in the consumer price index cpi between the third quarters of successive years will be applied to military retired pay for the annuities paid beginning each january 1 for example assume that the cpi rises from 4000 in the period july through september 2008 to 4120 in the period july through september 2009 an increase of 120 points or 30 of 4000 the monthly retired pay that accrues beginning december 2009 that will actually be paid to retirees on january 1 2010 would be increased by 30 above that amount paid the previous month colas for personnel who entered service on or after august 1 1986 for those personnel who first entered military service on or after august 1 1986 their colas will be calculated in accordance with either of two methods as noted below nonredux recipients those personnel who opt to have their retired pay computed in accordance with the preredux high three formula will have their colas computed as described above for preaugust 1 1986 entrants redux30000 cash bonus recipients those personnel who opt to have their retired pay computed in accordance with the redux formula and receive the 30000 cash bonus will have their colas computed using different formula annual colas will be held one percentage point below the actual inflation rate 24 the actual index used to adjust cola is the cpiw the index for urban wage earners and clerical workers it represents the buying habits of approximately 32 of the noninstitutional population of the us department of defense military compensation background papers sixth edition april 2005 crs11 retirees covered by this cola formula would thus receive 20 increase rather than 30 in their military retired pay under the hypothetical example described in the preceding example for preaugust 1 1986 entrants when retiree reaches age 62 there will be onetime recomputation of his or her annuity to make up for the lost purchasing power caused by the holding of colas to the inflation rate minus one percentage point this recomputation of cola in combination with the recomputation of the retired pay multiplier restores the members retired pay to that of similarly retired member who did not take the bonusredux option after the recomputation at 62 however future colas will continue to be computed annually on the basis of the inflation rate minus one percentage point costs and benefits of the two retirement alternatives an analysis of the economic effects for hypothetical retirees indicates that in almost all cases opting for the preredux formula will pay the individual much more over time report of the center for naval analyses states that the more liberal retired pay computation formula and cola formula of preredux far outweighs the shortterm benefits of 30000 pretax cash bonus the report did say that it might be possible for an individual investor to beat these negative aspects of the bonus by wise investment decisions but that it would be difficult25 naturally study can know what an individuals financial situation is at first only fairly small percentage of personnel opted for the 30000 lump sum26 however the number appears to have been rising since the bonus option first became available in 2001 50 of eligible marine corps enlisted retirees 40 of warrant officers but only 13 of commissioned officers have taken it27 suggesting the attractiveness of the immediate cash payment to the lowerpaid members of the career force military retirement budgeting and costs accounting for military retirement in the federal budget all dod budgets through fy1984 reflected the costs of retired pay actually being paid out to personnel who had already retired congress simply appropriated the amount of money required to pay current retirees each year as part of each annual defense appropriations bill since fy1985 the accrual accounting concept has been used to budget for the costs of military retired pay under this system the dod budget for each fiscal year includes not the amount of retired pay actually paid to retirees but rather contribution to the military retirement fund sufficient to finance future retirement payouts to current uniformed personnel when they retire these annual accrual contributions accumulate in the military retirement

august 2 2004 p 25 crs12 interest earned on them the amount that the defense department must contribute each year to cover future retirement costs is determined by an independent presidentially appointed department of defense retirement board of actuaries which decides how much is needed to cover future retirement costs as percentage of military basic pay once military personnel retire payments to them are made not from the annual department of defense budget but from the accumulated amounts in the military retirement fund estimated future retirement costs are arrived at by making projections based on the past rates at which active duty military personnel stayed in the service until retirement and on assumptions regarding the overall us economy including interest rates inflation rates and military pay levels approximately 30 of military basic pay costs must be added to the dod personnel budget each fiscal year to cover the future retirement costs of those personnel who ultimately retire from the military dod budget authority and outlays in each fiscal year that pay for the estimated cost of future retirees are transferred in paper transaction to military retirement fund located in the income security function of the federal budget the military retirement fund also receives paper transfers from the general fund of the treasury to fund the initial unfunded liability of the military retirement system this is the total future cost of military retired pay that will result from military service performed prior to the implementation of accrual accounting in fy1985 money is disbursed from this military retirement fund to current retirees individual retirees receive their retired pay from the defense finance and accounting service dfas technically however because this money paid to individuals comes not from the dod budget but from the fund it is paid out of the income security function of the federal budget function actual payments to current retirees thus show up in the federal budget as outlays from the federal budget as whole not from dod under accrual accounting therefore total federal outlays for each fiscal year continue to reflect only costs of payments to military members who have already retired as was the case before accrual accounting began accrual accounting only changes the manner in which the federal government accounts for military retired pay it does not affect actual payments to individuals in any way unfunded liability current debates over both federal civilian and military retirement have included some discussion of the unfunded liability of both as noted above the military retirement systems unfunded liability consists of future retired pay costs incurred before the creation of the military retirement fund in fy1985 these obligations are being liquidated by the payment to the fund each year of an amount from the general fund of the treasury and will be fully paid based on current calculations by fy2033 the unfunded liability at the end of fy2003 was 6283 billion the estimated liability for fy2004 was 6483 billion for fy2005 6661 billion and for fy2006 6842 billion28 these figures are between 83 and 92 billion higher than the estimated unfunded liability for the same years at the end of fy2003 this 28 valuation of the military retirement system september 30 2006 department of defense office of the actuary november 2007 pp ii 9 15 25 available online at httpwwwdodmilactuary crs13 increase is due almost entirely to the enactment of concurrent receiptrelated retirement benefits since both combat related special compensation csrc and concurrent retirement and disability payments crdp are paid from the military retirement fund but fully funded by the treasury contribution some concerns have been voiced about the amount of unfunded liability however 1 the hundreds of billions of dollars of unfunded liability is cumulative amount to be paid to retirees over the next 50 years not all at once 2 by the time some persons first become eligible for retired pay under the preaccrual accounting system many others will have died and 3 unlike the private sector there is way for employees to claim immediate payment of their future benefits an analogy would be that most homeowners cannot afford to pay cash for house so they get mortgage if the mortgage had to be paid in full almost homeowners could afford to do so however spread out over 30 years the payments are affordable similarly the unfunded liability of federal retirement programs is deemed affordable when federal retirement outlays are spread over many decades military retirement cost trends because military retirement is an entitlement rather than discretionary program its costs to the total federal budget payments to current retirees and survivors have been rising modestly each year due to predictable slow rise in the number of retirees and survivors and cost of living increases the cost to dod estimated future retirement costs of current personnel declined after fy1989 the beginning of the postcold war drawdown as the size of the force and therefore the number of people who will retire from it in the future declined as the drawdown stabilized so did the dod budget costs of retirement table 4 indicates the costs of military retired pay in federal budget outlays payments to current retirees and department of defense accrual outlays money set aside to fund future retirees as noted above these figures differ slightly from the figures for the same fiscal years

military retirement system every four years the president is required by law29 to initiate comprehensive review of the military compensation system and to forward the review along with his recommendations to congress the most recent effort the 10th quadrennial review of military compensation qrmc30 was convened in august 2005 and submitted the final portion of its report in july 2008 one of the directed areas of assessment was the implications of changing expectations of present and potential members of the uniformed services relating to retirement31 number of previous studies have noted that the military retirement system should be more flexible equitable and efficient to accomplish this the qrmc suggested major revision of both the active and reserve retirement systems highlighted by 1 defined benefit plan similar to the current high three system but that would vest at 10 years of service and not be payable until age 60 for those who retired with less than 20 years of service or at age 57 for those with 20 or more years of service retirees could opt to receive the retirement annuity immediately upon retirement but the annuity would be reduced by 5 for each year under age 57 2combined with the above defined benefit plan would be defined contribution plan that would require the services to contribute up to 5 of annual base pay into retirement account for each servicemember the contribution would start at 2 for those with two years of service and increase incrementally until it reached 5 for those with five or more years of service this plan would also vest at 10 years of service but withdrawals could not begin until age 60 3 system of gate pays would be established at specified career points to retain selected personnel in specified skill areas 4 separation pay would be used to encourage personnel in over manned skills to separate prior to qualifying for normal 10 to 30 year retirement somewhat unique aspect of this retirement proposal is that it would apply equally to active and reserve component members apparently recognizing that the reserves have transitioned from strategic reserve to an operational force to test the feasibility of this retirement option the qrmc recommends five or more year demonstration project that would use volunteers who would ultimately have the option of remaining in the demonstration or reverting to the current retirement system 29 section 1008b title 37 30 the qrmc report on retirement can be viewed at httpwwwdefenselink milnewsqrmcreportpdf 31 presidential memorandum subject tenth quadrennial review of military compensation august 2 2005 crs15 while not stipulated it is assumed that personnel currently in the active and reserve components would be grandfathered and remain eligible to retire under the current system or until the new system is thoroughly tested and evaluated for implementation the qrmc did not address the disability retirement system in their review for other
