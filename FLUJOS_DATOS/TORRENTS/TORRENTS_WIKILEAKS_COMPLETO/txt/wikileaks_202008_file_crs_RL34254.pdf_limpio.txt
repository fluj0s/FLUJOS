reconstruction of iraq the restoration and maintenance of peace and security in that country and the development of political administrative and economic institutions in iraq 2 the broad language of this executive order has been the subject of degree of criticism as potentially reaching beyond insurgents in iraq to third parties such as us citizens who may unknowingly be providing support for the insurgency3 having declared national emergency the president invoked authority available under the international emergency economic powers act of 1977 ieepa4 and ordered the blocking of financial transactions and the institution of property controls with respect to any property or interests in property of persons determined to fall within three categories of individuals or entities threatening

exercising any right power or privilege with respect to or transactions involving any property in which any foreign country or national thereof has any interest by any person or with respect to any

and freeze enemy property and interests in property and to regulate financial transactions involving enemy countries their nationals and their allies during declared war17 it was first used in peacetime in 1933 in the midst of the great depression when president franklin d roosevelt proclaimed bank holiday and closed banks in the united states thereby interfering with both foreign and domestic financial transactions in response to what he deemed to be national banking emergency related to extensive speculative activity abroad in foreign exchange resulting in severe drains on the nations stocks of gold18 congress immediately ratified this action and amended twea19 extending the emergency powers granted under the original legislation to cover both wartime and any other period of national emergency declared by the president and provided the president with authority to regulate purely domestic transactions20 president roosevelt invoked twea again in peacetime in 1939 as hitler was advancing in europe to block assets of norway and denmark and their nationals eventually twea was used to block assets of the axis enemies of the united states 21 1940 amendment expanded presidential power under twea by specifically authorizing asset freezes and expanding authority beyond transactions with enemies or allies of enemies to cover financial transactions in which any foreign state or foreign national had an interest22 twea thus was used to block assets of friendly nations threatened by axis 15 50 usc app 1702a1 16 act of october 6 1917 ch 106 5 40 stat 411 as

authorizing the president to investigate any transactions in foreign exchange transfers of credit betw een or payments by banking institutions and export hoarding melting or earmarking of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency by any person within the united states upon enactment of this legislation president roosevelt issued an executive order authorizing the secretary of the treasury to permit banks to reopen and to regulate exports of gold exec order 6073 march 10 1933 21 after hitler invaded norway and denmark president roosevelt issued executive order 8389 on april 10 1940 prohibiting foreign exchange transactions involving the property of norway or denmark or any national thereof congress confirmed that executive order and its implementing regulations by joint

vest23 title to any property of foreign person or nation24 this amendment extended the power of seizure to all property of any foreign country or national so that innocent appearing device could become trojan horse ie it was designed to reach enemy interests which masqueraded under innocent fronts25 the supreme court upheld the seizing and vesting of property of nonenemy alien in wartime26 it also upheld the authority of the treasury department to vest assets of an enemy austrian entity making them unavailable to us creditors despite new york courts having appointed temporary receiver to collect the austrian concerns assets and ultimately distribute them to us creditors27 in the 1970s during the vietnam war congressional concern with ways to oversee presidential use of emergency power led to questioning of the broad invocation of twea in circumstances not directly related to war and not substantially originating abroad 28 one result was the enactment of the national emergencies act of 1976 nea and ieepa in 1977 nea sets forth various procedures to be followed by the president when declaring national emergency such as federal register publication29 and specification of the provisions of law under which the actions under the national emergency are to be taken30 it specifies procedures for terminating national 23 according to material that bethany kohl hipp defendi ng

1977 freezing or blocking is not taking assets rather it is short or longterm deprivation of the assets or the usage thereof freezing does not involve transfer of title for example during world war ii both german and dutch assets held in the united states were frozen german assets were subsequently vested in the united statestitle pa ssed from germany or nationals thereof to the united states the court held that the vesting of german property was not compensable taking because the fifth amendment does not apply to enemy property conversely dutch assets were never vested the blocking or

presidential reporting requirements and establishing congressional review procedures31 nea terminated existing national emergencies32 except for those invoking section 5b of twea therefore imposing notice and reporting requirements on the president when invoking section 5b this was changed with the enactment of ieepa33 ieepa was enacted primarily according to the senate report accompanying the legislation as direct response to expanding use of emergency power by presidents the purpose of the bill is to revise and delimit the presidents authority to regulate international economic transactions during wars or national emergencies the bill is response to two developments first extensive use by presidents of emergency authority under section 5b of the trading with the enemy act of 1917 to regulate both domestic and international economic transactions unrelated to declared state of emergency and second passage of nea which provides safeguards for the role of congress in declaring and terminating national emergencies but exempts section 5b of the trading with the enemy act from its coverage 34 by restricting the use of twea section 5b to wartime ieepa draws distinction between the power provided presidents in declaring peacetime national emergencies having their origin abroad and that available when war has been declared nonetheless because of the need to provide presidents with sufficient flexibility to respond to emergencies35 the breadth of authority provided in ieepa is considerable with respect to affording powers to the president to impose economic sanctions in peacetime emergencies originating abroad to use these powers the president must declare national emergency with respect to any unusual and extraordinary threat which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the united states to the national security foreign policy or economy of the united states 36 once such national emergency has been declared ieepa provides the president with broad power to impose controls over economic transactions involving transfers abroad and foreign property controls 1 under ieepa the president may under such regulations as he may

declarations of national emergencies must be renewed annually 50 usc 1622d other procedural requirements are succinctly summarized as follows ieepa requires the president to consult with congress whenever possible before declaring national emergency and while it remains in force once national emergency goes into effect the president must submit to congress detailed report explaining and justifying his actions and listing the countries against which such actions are to be taken and why the president is also required to provide congress periodic follow up reports every six months with

importation or exportation of any right power or privilege with respect to any property in which any foreign country or national thereof has any interest by any person subject to the jurisdiction of the unite d states according to the court congress decision to use repeatedly the word any in this section of the statute guides our interpretation of the presidents power to block duri ng the pendency of an investigation it is clear that congress intended to provide the president with sweeping power to regulate all relevant property upon his declaration of national emergency furthermore if congress had intended to only authorize the president to block foreign assets that were located within the united states it could have made that intention clear however repeated use by congress of the word any as well as its choice of the phrase any property subject to the jurisdiction of the united states without an indication that it meant only foreign property compels our conclusion that the

services from any such person81 it is expected that implementing regulations will be issued to elaborate on which transactions are prohibited specifically the regulations are likel to follow the general contours of the now discontinued libyan sanctions 82 and the current regulatory scheme applicable to global terrorism83 that means that they are likely to include broad bans on trade and financial transactions authorize certain activities pursuant to general license and permit other activities pursuant to specific license issued upon application to ofac on casebycase basis if the regulations follow the model of the global terrorism sanctions they are likely to specify the types of legal services that may be provided pursuant to general license but permit reimbursement only on

groups with sanctuary in syria and some of the indigenous iraqi insurgent groups91 the practice however since september 11 2001 has been that foreign terrorists have formed the preponderance of designees on ofacs lists but blocking orders seizures and penalties have been directed against us persons based on allegations that they have in their possession property or interests in property which is either legally or beneficially the property of designated or blocked person or that they have been conducting prohibited transactions in blocke d property or with blocked persons the piggybacking potential of the executive order has also raised questions 92 the issue is whether the executive orders application to anyone who provides support for designated entity might affect us persons inadvertently involved in some form of assistance such as arranging transportation for selling consumer goods to or providing routine legal assistance to an entity which becomes blocked under the executive order could such us persons find themselves designated under the authority of the executive order and thereby have all of their assets subject to blocking whether or not the assets have any nexus with the transaction with the blocked entity or with any foreign entity g18g155g142g140g142g141g142g151g157g156g561 with respect to those whose property is to be blocked on the grounds of providing material assistance to those who are designated as committing or posing significant risk of committing acts of violence the scope covered by the executive order has raised an array of questions such as 1 to what extent are peaceful demonstrations or demonstrations that include limited violence and public criticism of us policy in iraq potentially subject to the executive order 2 to what extent are lawyers representing persons and entities on the list subject to the order 3 to what extent are donors to various us charities operating internationally subject to the order these and other questions raised by the executive order itself are likely to be further clarified when regulations are issued by ofac such regulations moreover are likely to be similar to those issued in other situations an example of how ofac implements financial transaction and property controls imposed under executive orders invoking ieepa is illustrative the global terrorist sanctions program 93

bosnia and herzegovina105 the executive order includes an annex listing the names of blocked individuals and entities list which has been expanded and is now found at the beginning of ofacs list of specially designated nationals106 given the concern that executive order 13438 might place lawyers providing legal assistance to targets of the freeze orders at risk it might be helpful to note that on july 9 2003 ofac issued general license to permit us persons to provide professional legal services relating to the representation of persons whose property is blocked in matters pending before the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia 107 g3g157g157g152g155g151g142g162g556g5g149g146g142g151g157g561g11g150g153g149g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 the potential impact of ofac regulations on attorneyclient relationships has been the focus of some litigation and commentary in legal journals 108 the one federal case that has dealt with the issue is american airways charters inc v regan 109 it held that under the cuban sanctions ofac had authority to require license for payment of legal fees from blocked assets but not to condition the bare formation of an attorneyclient relationship on advance government approval110 the holding does not rest on constitutional grounds but rather on the courts analysis of whether preventing designated entity from obtaining counsel could be said to further the purposes for which the particular provision of twea on which ofac relied had been enacted by concluding that the basic intent of congress was to deny an enemy nation use of economic resources the court found that access to legal services without access to any blocked funds was not within the coverage contemplated by twea language in the opinion suggests that ofacs exercise of the power to prevent designated person from consulting an attorney might raise due process concerns as tantamount to denying the person the right to meaningful challenge of the designation despite the american airways ruling ofacs regulations continue to include bans on the provision of legal services some of the recent regulations differ both in purpose and scope from those at issue in american airways whether the differences will be sufficient for courts to find that ofacs reach extends to the formation of lawyerclient relationships with blocked persons is question that remains unanswered until proper case is presented ofacs global terrorism sanctions regulations promulgated after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks which might form the model for regulations to be issued under executive order 13438 differ from the 105 executive order 13219 as amended 1b and c 50 usc 1701 note 106 httpwwwtreasgovofficesenforcementofacsdnprgrmlsttxt 107

authority of ieepa rather than twea and focus on private individuals and entities rather than on particular foreign nation moreover they coincide with the changed congressional focus reflected in the post september 11 2001 ieepa amendments and the tendency of the courts to uphold ofacs authority in the face of constitutional challenges111 many of the ofac regulations prohibit the provision of services including legal services to designated persons or blocked entities and require specific license for all but limited list of legal services for which general license112 is provided in the regulations113 for reimbursement for any legal services application must be made to ofac for specific license114 ofacs global terrorism sanctions regulations illustrate this framework under 31 cfr

594506 five types of legal services are authorized provided that all receipts of payment of professional fees and reimbursement of incurred expenses must be specifically licensed117 other legal services must be specifically licensed118 the types of legal services which may be provided without specific license are 1 provision of legal advice and counseling on the requirements of and compliance with the laws of any jurisdiction within the united states provided that such advice and counseling are not provided to facilitate transactions in violation of this part 2 representation of

with respect to the imposition administration or enforcement of us sanctions against such persons and 5 provision of legal services in any other context in which prevailing us law requires access to legal counsel at public expense119 the descriptions of legal services permitted under the general license have been criticized as ambiguous and narrow120 for example the first one authorizes providing legal counsel to comply with us laws but not to facilitate prohibite d transactions without any elaboration on how to distinguish what is allowed from what may cross the line and subject the lawyer to liability121 this might mean that any prudent lawyer will decide not to provide any legal services regarding attempted transactions without securing specific license the fact that ofacs list is ever growing with names added frequently also means that lawyers providing legal services to clients involved in business transactions with designated persons or entities prior to their designation likely must apply for specific license to continue the legal services since the general licenses apply only to legal services provided to or on behalf of blocked persons not to individuals and entities involved in transactions with them 122 g17g8g3g5g561g3g141g150g146g151g146g156g157g155g138g157g146g159g142g561g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g142g156g561 ofac regulations specify procedures for

states and in terms of the international banking system ofac has characterized its antiterrorism economic sanctions programs as wideranging assault on international terrorism and its supporters and financiers and reported that these programs have resulted in the blocking as of december 31 2006 of 16 million in terrorist assets of which 7 million is that of alqaida 156 the total dollar amount of terrorist assets which have been blocked does not represent the total effect of the economic sanctions when ofac designates an organization or an indi vidual under its terrorists programs the impact may extend beyond assets frozen by the united states not only does the international banking community have to provide transparency in its transactions with us financial institutions to prevent them from unknowingly handling prohibited transactions but the designation of an international terrorist may inspire international cooperation ofac reports that banks and other private institutions around the world voluntarily consult ofacs terrorist lists and routinely report denying access to their institutions 157 152 in its final report to congress the judicial review commission on foreign asset
