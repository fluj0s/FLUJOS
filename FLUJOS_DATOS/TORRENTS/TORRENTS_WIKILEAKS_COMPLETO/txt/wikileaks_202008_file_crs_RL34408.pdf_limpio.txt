providing continuity and quality of care and services to injured servicemembers in january 2008 congress passed the nationa l defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 pl 110181 titles xvi and

recommendations of these bodies further congressional and administrative actions are anticipated as this report is limited to comparison of the final recommendations of the pccww and the vdbc it will not be updated charges to the commissions the commissions were given different ch arges the pccww was established by executive order 13426 in march 20074 and was to focus on the needs of specific populati on namely seriously injured serv icemembers returning from combat theaters in support of operations endurin g freedom and iraqi freedom oefoif the commission was asked to look broadly at services and benef its provided by all relevant cabinet depa rtments principally the depa rtments of defense dod and veterans affairs va as well as the private sector and at broad slate of services and benefits including health care disability traumatic injury education employment and other benefits the p ccww was to study individuals experiences as servicemembers and for those who were retired or separate d from military service their transition from military to civilian andor veteran status problems in providing services and benefits across that transition and subseque nt experiences in civilian life though the pccwws recommendations were to apply narrowly to seriously injured oefoif servicemembers it could prove difficult politically and administratively to implement the recommendations in this fashion doing so could run counter to existing policies such as compensating serviceconnected disabilities equally whether or not they are combat related and prioritizin g groups of veterans to receive va health care the vdbc was established in title xv of the national defense authorization act of 2004 pl 108136 to st udy benefits provided to ve terans and their survivors to compensate for serviceconnected disabilities and deaths the vdbc was to consider these benefits regardless of the time or manner in which disability or death occurred and whether it occurred during conflict or during p eace time while the vdbc examined certain transition issues for injured oefoif servicemembers who were retired or separated from military service this was not its principal focus the vdbc examined services and benefits for veterans across their lifespans making more comprehensive assessment of the full complement of veterans benefits than did the pccww but less comprehensiv assessment of dod services benefits authorities and policieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34408crs3 5 pccww main report p 28 table 6 vdbc full report pp 378395 and executive summary pp 1215

fitness of injured servicemembers for continued duty while va would evaluate for disability compensation but the commissions differed in their priorities for implementing this revised system reflecting their focus on different populations when comparing pccww and vdbc recommendations it must be borne in mind that unless otherwise stated pccww recommendations would apply at least initially only to injured oefoif servicem embers and veterans while vdbc recommendations would apply to all servicemembers or veterans including those from previous conflicts who are otherwise eligible for the
