oneclick ordering system on website on the eve of the holiday shopping season both congress by enacting the first inventor defense act of 1999 pl 106113 and the united states patent and trademark office through its business methods patent initiative have also addressed business method patent issues the opening of the patent system to inventions outside traditional industrial technologies has been the subject of an ongoing public debate proponents of business method patenting have urged that the patent system should keep pace with technologies of the information age including electronic commerce and data processing proponents have also observed the difficulty of distinguishing business methods from traditionally patentable processes in contrast detractors have noted the lack of empirical evidence that economic gains will result from business method patents and expressed concerns that business method patents will hinder competition commentators have also expressed concerns that many business method patents should not have been granted stating that such patents too often appropriate well known commercial activities rather than inventive advances over public domain knowledge observers differ on whether legislative response to the phenomenon of business method patenting is desirable possibilities include amendment of the first inventor protection act to provide more detailed definition of the term method of doing or conducting business in addition possible substantive reforms include imposing ban upon business method patents adoption of an industrial application requirement or moratorium upon their offensive use possible procedural reforms include provision for an obligatory reevaluation of business method patents prior to enforcement litigation

publications have issued articles and editorials explaining or contributing to debate over the patent law1 catalyst for this exchange of views appears to be the recent patenting of methods of doing business issues under discussion include the appropriate subject matter for patent protection the potential impact of business method patents upon internetbased electronic commerce and whether policy makers should respond with substantive or procedural patent law reform much of the present controversy appears to flow from the 1998 decision of the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit in state street bank trust co v signature financial group inc2 prior to state street bank many legal texts stated that business methods were not patentable and inventors did not routinely seek patents for business developments3 however the state street bank court decided that data processing system consisting of software for managing stock mutual fund could be the subject of patent in so doing the federal circuit ruled that patents could issue for innovative methods of doing business4 the state street bank opinion held consequences for the executive judiciary and legislature in the wake of state street bank the united states patent and trademark office pto has received numerous patent applications concerning business methods to date several hundred of these applications have issued as granted patents5 disputes over the validity and scope of business method patents have quickly made their way to the courts one noteworthy business method patent enforcement litigation

trademarks patent rights arise only through governmental intervention inventors must submit applications to the pto if they wish to obtain patent rights10 pto officials known as examiners then assess

fulfills certain substantive standards set by the patent statute13 among the more important requirements are that the invention must be useful novel and nonobvious the requirement of usefulness or utility is satisfied if the invention is operable and provides tangible benefit14 to be judged novel the invention must not be fully anticipate d by prior patent publication or other knowledge within the public domain15 nonobvious invention must not have been readily within the ordinary skills of competent artisan at the time the invention was made16 beyond utility novelty and nonobviousness there is fourth distinct requirement for an invention to be patented the invention must also be judged to comprise subject matter the patent law was designed to protect17 this final gatekeeper to patentability is variously known as the requireme nt of patent eligibility patentable subject matter or statutory subject matter18 this report principally focuses upon this requirement of patentable subject matter and in particular the propriety of the patenting of business methods section 101 of the current patent law the patent act of 1952 governs whether or not an invention comprises patentable subject matter section 101 allows patents to be granted for any process machine manufacture or composition of matter as result an invention is eligible for patenting if it is process which the patent act defines as process art or method19 alternatively the invention may be machine which has been interpreted to include any apparatus20 composition of matter including synthesized chemical compounds and composite articles21 or manufacture broadly oriented residual designation22 these definitions are not exclusive patentable invention may fall into multiple categories23 the definition of patentable subject matter under the 1952 act is nearly identical to that which appeared in predecessor federal patent statutes enacted as early ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30572crs5 24 diamond v diehr

techniques and protocols could be characterized as process within the meaning of the patent law further almost any tangible product artifact or thing could be seen as composition of matter under 10125 the only statutory exclusion from these broad categories of patentable subject matter concerns inventions useful solely to utilize special nuclear material or atomic energy in an atomic weapon26 despite this broad statutory language the courts had traditionally crafted several exceptions to patentability variously expressed as bars to patents on business methods27 as well as such things as mental steps algorithms and laws of nature these doctrines held that certain subject matter was unpatentable per se28 most of these rules were corollary to the wellestablished tenet that the patent law does not protect abstract ideas29 in order to receive patent protection inventors must claim discrete operable products and processes not broad categories of generalized intellectual concepts by protecting downstream technology rather than upstream knowledge the patent law is said to preserve the basic tools of scientific and technological work for all to employ30 in particular the business methods exception may be traced back at least as early as 1868 in ex parte abraham the patent commissioner sensed that it is contrary to the spirit of the law to grant patents for methods of bookkeeping31 nineteenth century courts also opined that method of transacting common business32 or mere contract33 were unpatentable perhaps the most thorough review of the proscription on business method patents was provided in the 1908 opinion of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in hotel security checking co v lorraine co34 the patent at issue in hotel security checki

1998 403designed to prevent fraud by waiters and cashiers the system employed certain forms that tracked sales and ensured that waiters submitted appropriate funds at the close of business the second circuit invalidated the patent on the basis of knowledge within the public domain finding that the patented invention would occur to anyone conversant with the business35 however the court further observed that system of transacting business disconnected from the means of carrying out the system is not within the most liberal interpretation of the term an art that could be patented36 most of the judicial and patent office decisions discussing the business method exception arose under predecessor versions of the 1952 patent act as noted above the 1952 act essentially maintained earlier definitions of patentable subject matter37 however although the legislative history pertaining to the 1952 act is relatively sparse it suggested that congress intended to liberalize statutory subject matter requirements in particular committee reports accompanying the legislation included the following statement person may have invented machine or manufacture which may include anything under the sun that is made by man 38 in its 1980 decision in diamond v chakrabarty 39 the supreme court relied in part upon this legislative history in order to approve the patentability of genetically engineered microorganism as the court confirmed in its later opinion in diamond v diehr it read this language to reveal legislative intent to open the patent system to anything artificial40 during the 1990s several federal circuit decisions followed this reasoning in order to ease and ultimately eliminate earlier restrictions upon the patenting of computer software41 mindful of these legislative and judicial developments commentators questioned the continued vitality of the business methods exception to patentable subject matter42 when the federal circuit first turned to the issue in 1998 in

here43 the state street bank case signature financial group held us patent 5193056 which was entitled data processing system for hub and spoke financial services configuration the patent described data processing system for implementing an investment structure known as hub and spoke system this system allowed individual mutual funds spokes to pool their assets in an investment portfolio hub organized as partnership according to the patent this investment regime provided the advantageous combination of economies of scale in administering investments coupled with the tax advantages of partnership44 maintaining proper accounting of this sophisticated financial structure proved difficult indeed due to the complexity of the calculations computer or equivalent device is virtual necessity to perform the task45 signatures patented system purported to allow administrators to monitor and record the financial information flow and make all calculations necessary for maintaining partner fund financial services configuration46 in addition it tracked all the relevant data determined on daily basis for the hub and each spoke so that aggregate year end income expenses and capital gain or loss can be determined for accounting and for tax purposes for the hub and as result for each publicly traded spoke47 following pto issuance of the patent signature entered into licensing negotiations with competitor state street bank that ultimatel proved unsuccessful state street bank then brought declaratory judgment action against signature seeking the invalidity of the patent the district court granted summary judgment in favor of state street bank under two alternative grounds48 first the court concluded that the invention was merely an abstract mathematical algorithm at bottom the invention is an accounting system for certain type of financial investment vehicle claimed as means for performing series of mathematical functions quite simply it involves further physical transformation or reduction than inputting numbers calculating numbers outputting numbers and storinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30572crs8 49 927 f supp at 515 50 927 f supp at 51516 51 927 f supp at 516

by an accountant armed with pencil paper calculator and filing system49 the district court then buttressed its holding by turning to the longestablished principle that business plans and systems are not patentable50 the court judged that patenting an accounting system necessary to carry on certain type of business is tantamount to patent on the business itself because such abstract ideas are not patentable either as methods of doing business or as mathematical algorithms the patent was held invalid51 on appeal the federal circuit reversed writing for threejudge panel the late judge giles s rich found the patent claimed not an abstract idea but programmed machine that produced useful concrete and tangible result52 this renders it statutory subject matter even if the useful result is expressed in numbers such as price profit percentage cost or loss53 according to the court the question of whether claim encompasses statutory subject matter should not focus on which of the four categories of subject matter claim is directed toprocess machine manufacture or composition of matterbut rather on the essential characteristics of the subject matter in particular its practical utility54 the federal circuit further explained that today we hold that the transformation of data representing discrete dollar amounts by machine through series of mathematical calculations into final share price constitutes practical application of mathematical algorithm formula or calculation because it produces useful concrete and tangible result final share price momentarily fixed for recording and reporting purposes and even accepted and relied upon by regulatory authorities and in subsequent trades55 the federal circuit then turned to the district courts business methods rejection opting to take the opportunity to lay this illconceived exception to rest56 judge rich analyzed hotel security checking and other cases denying patents upon methods of doing business he concluded that each of these decisions had actually been decided on other grounds such as that the patented invention would have been obvious over knowledge within the public domain the federal circuit also reasoned that the case law on business methods had largely been decided prior to the 1952 patent act the federal circuit closed by directing that methods of doing business were to be subject only to the same patentability analysis as any other sort of processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30572crs9 57 525 us 1093 1999 denying petition for certiorari 58 see stern supra note 4 59 172 f3d

developments judicial encounters with business method patents did not end in state street bank subsequent litigation has provided further details on the scope and enforceability of patents towards

circuit decision att corp v excel communications inc59 followed the reasoning of state street bank in upholding patent claiming data processing technique60 this litigation arose from atts efforts to enforce us patent 5333184 which was directed towards the composition of billing records used in telephone networks61 the att patent claimed method for telephone company to determine whether both the caller and the recipient of longdistance telephone subscribed to the companys network if so the telephone company could provide different billing treatment to such calls most likely discounting the fee in order to encourage both individuals to subscribe to its services the invention relied upon the fact that when customer makes longdistance telephone call the telephone network contemporaneously maintains billing records these records include such information as the originating and terminating telephone numbers as well as the length of the call also associated with the call is data indicating an individuals chosen primary interexchange carrier or pic pic is essentially the equivalent of longdistance telephone service provider the claimed invention called for the addition of discrete item of data termed the pic indicator to the billing record the value of the pic indicator was determined by analyzing the data identifying the primary interexchange carriers of

indicator remains at the value of zero the phone company may then readily apply its discounted rate to any call where the pic indicator is set to one without more extensive data processing at the time of billing in an opinion issued prior to the release of state street bank the united states district court for the district of delaware held that the claimed invention was not patentable subject matter62 judge robinson described the patent as claiming an invention whereby certain information that is already known within telecommunications system the pics of the originating and terminating subscribers is simply retrieved for an allegedly new use in billing63 with this sense of the claimed invention the court held that change in the datas format should not serve to convert nonpatentable subject matter into patentable subject matter64 following an appeal the federal circuit reversed writing for threejudge panel judge plager held that the patented invention comfortably fell within the scope of statutory subject matter65 judge plager followed the holding of state street bank in concluding that the test for patentable subject matter was whether an invention achieved useful concrete tangible result66 because atts claimed process produced number which had specific meaning it could be employed in discrete setting and was therefore patentable67 in closing the att v excel opinion the federal circuit was quick to note that it had only addressed the subject of patent eligibility according to judge plagerthe ultimate validity of these claims depends upon satisfying the other requirements for patentability 68 these words proved prophetic upon the return of the litigation to the delaware district court judge robinson concluded that the invention claimed in the att patent was already known within the public domain more particularly the court judged that the wellknown mci friends family program either wholly anticipated or made obvious the patented invention69 as result the district court held that the att patent was invalid under the legal requirements of novelty and nonobviousness70httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30572crs11 71 thomas supra note 25 at 1161 n170 72 see

1984reference to the consolidat ed appropriations act for fiscal year 2000 president clinton signed this bill into law on november 29 1999 subtitle c of the american inventors protection act known as the first inventor defense act of 1999 creates an infringement defense for an earlier inventor of method of doing or conducting business that was later patented by another the defendant must have reduced the infringing subject matter to practice at least one year before the effective filing date of the patent and made commercial use of that subject matter in the united states before the effective filing date the impetus for this provision lies in the rather complex relationship between the law of trade secrets and the patent system trade secrecy protects individuals from misappropriation of valuable information that is useful in commerce one reason an inventor might maintain the invention as trade secret rather than seek patent protection is that the subject matter of the invention may not be regarded as patentable such inventions as customer lists or data compilations have traditionally been regarded as amenable to trade secret protection but not to patenting84 inventors might also maintain trade secret protection due to ignorance of the patent system or because they believe they can keep their invention as secret longer than the period of exclusivity granted through the patent system85 it is important to note from the outset that the patent system has not favored trade secret holders wellestablished patent law provides that an inventor who makes secret commercial use of an invention for more than one year prior to filing patent application at the pto forfeits his own right to patent86 this policy is based principally upon the desire to maintain the integrity of the statutory proscribed patent term the patent law grants patents term of twenty years commencing from the date patent application is filed87 if the trade secret holder could make commercial use of an invention for many years before choosing to file patent application he could disrupt this regime by delaying the expiration date of his patent on the other hand settled patent law principles established that prior secret uses would not defeat the patents of later inventors88 if an earlier inventor made secret commercial use of an invention and another person independently invented the same technology later and obtained patent protection then the trade secret holder could face liability for patent infringement this policy was based upon the reasoning that once issued published patent instruments fully inform the public about the invention while trade secrets do not as between subsequent inventor who patented the invention and thus had disclosed the invention to the public and an earlier trade secret holder who had not the law favored the patent holderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30572crs14 89 thomas john r the postindustrial patent system fordham intellectual prope rty media entertainment law journal 10 1999 32 n156the state street bank decision focused attention upon the relationship between patents and trade secrets inventors of methods of doing business traditionally relied upon trade secret protection because such inventions had long been regarded as unpatentabl subject matter as result inventors of innovative business methods obtained legal advice not to file applications at the pto on their inventions this advice was sound under the patent law as it then stood state street bank overturned the historical bar denying patents on methods of doing business as consequence inventors in fields ranging from such sectors as finance insurance and services have sought proprietary interests in their inventions through the patent system the change in this background principle was perceived to have harmed individuals that invented business methods prior to the issuance of the state street bank opinion many of these inventors had maintained their innovative business methods as trade secrets for many years as result they were unable belatedly to obtain patent protection on their business methods as well because trade secrets did not constitute prior art against the patent applications of others subsequent inventor would be able to obtain patent protection under these circumstances trade secret holder could find himself an adjudicated infringer of patented business method that he actually invented first89 the first inventor defense act of 1999 reconciled these principles by providing an infringement defense for an earlier inventor of method of doing business that was later patented by another this infringement defense is subject to several qualifications first the defendant must have reduced the infringing subject matter to practice at least one year before the effective filing date of the application second the defendant must have commercially used the infringing subject matter prior to the effective filing date of the patent finally any reduction to practice or use must have been made in good faith without derivation from the patentee or persons in privity with the patentee although the first inventor defense act addresses transition problems between the regimes of trade secrets and patents it does not directly assess the propriety of patenting business methods in the first instance it may be implied that the first inventor defense act assumes an approving posture towards patented methods of doing business however as result subsequent courts would most likely consider congress to have condoned business methods patents when considering them in the future the debate over patenting methods of doing business there has been considerable debate over the desirability of extending the reach of the patent system to methods of doing business both proponents and detractors of business method patents have emerged before considering the views of various participants in the business

copyright laws fair use privilege93 although accused infringers theoretically may employ the defense of patent misuse most commentators agree that the federal circuit has minimized the application of the patent misuse doctrine94 the decision to subject particular areas of endeavor to the patent system is therefore of particular importance once an invention has been patented it is subject to robust set of proprietary rights perceived benefits of business method patents supporters of state street bank have urged that business methods are as subject to costly research and development efforts as the inventions traditionally amenable to patenting for example suppose diversified enterprise spends considerable resources on research in traditional manufacturing processes and spends the same amount on research on business methods it may be questioned why the reward of exclusive patent rights is available in one field of costly research and not in another95 observers have also argued that future technological process will occur as much in activities as business methods and information processing as in traditional manufacturing techniques this argument urges that the patent system should not be confined to technologies of the industrial revolution but should embrace the inventions of the information age as well96 to do otherwise would be arbitrary and unfair according to

system for drycleaning stores100 this patent allowed dry cleaning establishments to track the location of individual articles of clothing as they moved throughout the cleaning process the markman patent could easily be characterized as directed towards method of doing of business supporters say yet the patentability of this system was never questioned by any court or commentator commentators such as attorney carl oppendahl further note that such enterprises as merrill lynch and citibank obtained numerous patents on financial service products long before the federal circuit issued state street bank one of the merrill lynch patents us patent 4346442 was involved in litigation before the district court for the district of delaware101 this patent entitled securities brokeragecash management system claimed computerized method of managing certain financial services in 1983 the delaware federal district court expressly found that the asserted patent claims statutory subject matter because the claims allegedly teach method of operation on computer to effectuate business activity102 attorney walter hanchuk therefore explains that state street bank merely confirmed and focused attention upon trend that had occurred for many years103 as stated most succinctly by attorney thomas s hahn there is revolution here104 similarly some patent law experts argue that meaningful

simplifying the law concerning the patentability of computer software106 in recent years the rules determinin g whether software could be patented or not could be characterized as complex whether particular software program could be patented or not was often determined not by the substance of the invention but by the form in which the patent application was drafted more specifically skillful patent drafters would often claim softwarerelated inventions as hardwired computer so that the invention looked less like mathematical algorithm and more like machine this trend tended to place premium on artful claims drafting and made patents more difficult to read107 following state street bank proponents contend that less need should arise for elaborate claims drafting exercises in the area of software inventions any software is patent eligible if it achieves useful concrete and tangible result finally attorneys michael t platt francis x gindhart and laurence stein observe that in order to obtain patent protection inventors must fully disclose their inventions such that skilled artisan could practice the invention without undue experimentation108 platt gindhart and stein believe that information available in published patent applications serves as rich library of prior knowledge that serves as starting point for subsequent inventors patent system that denied protection to business methods would cause business method innovators to conceal their inventions as trade secrets other valuable business methods might simply go unknown for want of publicity according to platt gindhart and stein now that the patentability of business methods has been confirmed the commercial community should benefit from the public disclosure that accompanies patent issuance109 perceived negative consequences of business method patents detractors of the state street bank opinion have attempted to counter the argument of proponents of business method patents some

than foster economic progress112 according to shulman the existence of numerous proprietary interests in particular market segments may create barriers to entry that stifle competition113 attorney

concepts114 new york times magazine article was to similar effect deeming state street bank and its progeny ridiculous phenomenon that could kill ecommerce115 detractors also argue that effort alone is insufficient to justify the reward of patent protection for an innovative business methods they point to the supreme courts opinion in feist publications inc v rural telephone service co 116 which adopted this position with respect to the copyright laws there the court rejected sweat of the brow as basis for copyright protection by reasoning that effort alone was not enough to make particular subject matter copyrightable the feist court concluded that an ordinary white pages telephone directory was not subject to the copyright laws because it lacked even minimal degree of creative expression because telephone directory is not work of authorship within the meaning of the copyright laws it was not the kind of work the copyright laws were designed to protect117 applied to the

framers undoubtedly contemplated the industrial mechanical and manual arts of the late eighteenth century in contrast to the seven liberal arts and the four fine arts of classical learning122 patent law experts have also suggested that the framers were undoubtedly aware of the english experience leading to the statute of monopolies parliament enacted the statute of monopolies in 1624 in order to curb the grant of abusive monopolies by the crown in order to generate income the crown had awarded exclusive rights to private parties for such activities as manufacturing playing cards and importing

enact patent law because those who formulated the constitution were familiar with the long struggle over monopolies so prominent in english history where exclusive rights to engage even in ordinary business activities were granted so frequently by the crown professor robert p merges and other commentators have suggested that the state street bank court did not sufficiently respect the policy concerns animating the statute of monopolies124 citing more familiar historical events such as the boston tea party attorney richard h stern has also noted an american antipathy to exclusive rights in business methods125 appraisals of the state street bank decision have also questioned the federal circuits adoption of what appears to be very lenient standard of patentable subject matter126 according to state street bank whether particular invention is eligible for patenting depends upon the essential characteristics of the subject matter in particular its practical utility127 this holding appears to collapse the patentable subject matter into another patentability requirement known as utility128 perceived difficulty with this approach is that since the early nineteenth century the utility standard has been understood to present distinct additional hurdle to patentability129 one commentator concludes that state street bank reduce s the statutory categories of patentable

shouldnt be and it will cause lot of problems companies are trying to patent inventions as old as the wheel theyre just doing it with the internet132 attorney john altmiller has offered an explanation for this perception of poor patent quality because the patentability of business methods was unclear prior to the federal circuits state street bank decision the pto has not developed library of prior art materials that examiners may consult when considering whether to grant or deny business method patent application133 even if prior art library were available professor rochelle dreyfuss has also observed that many business methods are not routinely memorialized in written form they instead are maintained in the heads and practices of business persons134 while such practices should ordinarily be considered prior art under us law135 they are not readily located by pto examiners of course the pto has issued many patents that were later invalidated during litigation in part this possibility occurs because us patent law features very encompass ing definition of the prior art that bears upon each patent or patent application for example publication in an obscure foreign language may render us patent invalid even if the knowledge within that publication was never held within the united states136 knowledge publicly available within the united states may also have patentdefea ting effect even if it has never been memorialized in written form137 the pto simply lacks the resources to perform an exhaustive search of such references further because most patented inventions are probably never commercialized138 an exhaustive search in connection with every patent application may present needless costs when the patent holder later attempts to enforce the issued patent in court an

however professor dreyfuss has observed business method and data transformation patents concern information rather than industrial products as noted by economists carl shapiro and hal varian information products tend to exhibit lockin and network externalities139 lockin occurs when consumers face high costs in switching from one brand of technology to another140 network externalities result from situation of positive feedback where the value of connecting to network depends upon the number of other people connected to it applied to economic competition the typical result of network effects is monopolistic winnertakeall market telephony and computer operating systems present examples of markets with network externalities141 professor dreyfuss explains that business method patents need not be considered valid for very long in order to have substantial market impact due to lockin and network externalities142 suppose for example that an internetbased electronic retailer obtains patent on method of ordering merchandise conducting an auction or enlisting associate d retailers such patents may be invalid because they merely claim obvious electronic variants of wellknown commercial activities competitors of the patentee may face delays of several years as they seek to strike down such patents however143 indeed the high costs of patent litigation may discourage other retailers from challenging patent at all144 as result competitors of the patentee may be discouraged from engaging in the patented method consumers who wish to take advantage of the patented business features must transact with the patentee according to professor dreyfuss the market distortions caused by the issuance of an invalid business method patent may be significant once consumer has entered his name address and billing information into one companys site he may be reluctant to engage in the same tedious task with another internet retailer as result the consumer is locked into that retailer even if the patent is later invalidated145 network effects may also play role here internet retailers often analyze the information they receive from consumers in order to predict what other products individual consumers might enjoy the accuracy of these predictions depends in part upon the number of consumers thus the larger the network of consumers who patroniz particular web site the

observes that patents come into existence only after costly and timeconsuming examination procedure at the pto citing figures from the american bar association katz estimates the average fee for merely filing patent application for computer software or hardware is 7500 continued prosecution of that application at the pto may result in the doubling of this figure katz further notes that patent litigation is notoriously expensive he observes that the cost of trying and appealing patent infringement case may run well over one million dollars katz concludes that commercial entities require level of financial and legal wherewithal in order to pursue patent protection enforce their patents and defend themselves from charges of patent infringement katz believes that this situation will deleteriously impact smaller enterprises158 predicting that big businesses will not sit idly up and watch their market share become vulnerable to startups katz concludes most small businesses will find themselves at the mercy of large companies with software patents raising the defenses of invalidity and noninfringement are not options as proof of these theories lies beyond the means of company whose entire business is funded by five million dollars of venture capital sole proprietor has chance159 while considering katzs contentions it should be noted that the patent act does allow inventors to file socalled statutory invention registration with the pto 160 although statutory invention registratio n does not lead to an issued patent it is inexpensive and readily allows pto examiners to employ the registration against subsequent patent applicants statutory invention registration may reduce the need for socalled defensive patenting161 as well proceeding known as reexamination does

commerce patents state street bank appears to provide many other sorts of industry actors with the opportunity to appropriate business and other techniques through the patent system prior to state street bank legal financial insurance and service industries were generally faced with two options either protect an innovation as trade secret or allow the innovation to enter the public domain the sudden injection of the patent system into existing markets provides market entrants with third option in effect subjecting them to private regulatory environment private parties are now able to limit the conduct of their competitors through proprietary patent interests164 one apparent difficulty for small businesses is that the pto issues new patents each week165 often prior notice accompanies the issuance of patent166 as result many patent instruments are only available for public inspection after they have been granted legal effect in our fastmoving contemporary economy business method patents can issue long after many electronic merchants have adopted that commercial strategy on their web sites as result almost any business method patent has the potential to be socalled submarine patent rising unexpectedly from the pto and poised to torpedo established electronic industries submarine patents remain particular concern of the national commission on entrepreneurship which believes that some current intellectual property and patent procedures and regulatio ns impede entrepreneurs seeking to create and commercialize new technologies167 although firm conclusion about the impact of business method patents upon small business is possible at this time most commentators agree that businesses of all sizes should be more attentive to the patent system attorney mark plotkin advises commercial enterprises to employ due diligence when embarking upon new ventures not only should the patentability of the enterprises own business methods be assessed enterprises should

options the possibility of legislative response to state street bank has gained considerable currency in the popular press professor lawrence lessig considers the advent of business method patents to be such significant development that he has unequivocally stated there is more important issue about cyberspace for congress to address than this and now rather than later it is the issue of the year for 2000170 other observers suggest that legislative response is necessary according to attorney jonathon band the patent system has capacity for selfcorrection band believes that pto examiners will climb the learning curve of business methods patents over time just as they have with new technologies in the past171 this view suggests that business method patenting brings fundamental changes to us law but merely presents problems that are transitional in character if congress elects to address this issue number of legislative options are available one possibility is modification of the first inventor defense act of 1999 further legislative activity might introduce substantive changes in the law of patent eligibility per or instead create procedural reforms to create administr ative mechanisms for dealing with the perceived difficulties surrounding business method patents brief review of some of these options follows the first inventor defense act the first inventor defense act of 1999 title c of pl 106113 presents several opportunities for further clarification first the act provides only brief explanation of the patented subject matter to which it applies in contrast to its fulsome definition of commercially used the statute provides only that the term method means method of doing or conducting business this succinct delineation may contain some ambiguity as an example consider an accused infringer whose sole commercial practice is the manufacturing of particular chemical compoundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30572crs28 172 house committee on the judiciary

system yet should another patent that method the accused infringer may well argue that chemical manufacturing technique is also method of doing business given that the statutes legislative history makes clear that the first inventor defense act of 1999 was inspired by the federal circuit opinion in state street bank this argument may at first appear untenable the house report to accompany hr 1907 expressly states however that this legislation is not confined to the financial services industry172 further while the state street bank opinion undoubtedly triggered boom in filing patents on such inventions in such industries as finance and insurance review of patents issued prior to that opinion suggests that numerous previous patents had issued that could arguably be described as business methods173 two such issued patents one relating to managing dry cleaning establishment and the other relating to plan for saving for college tuition expenses were the subject of recent opinions from the united states supreme court174 with articulated definition of the term method of doing or conducting business in the statute clear record of congressional intent and shared meaning of this term prevalent within the patent community judicial interpretation of this term will be crucial175 the first inventor defense act also calls for considerati on of the manner in which the patent claim is drafted the statute provides that person may not assert the defense under this section unless the invention for which the defense is asserted is for method however the house report to accompany hr 1907 provides an invention is considered to be process or method if it is used in connectio n with the production of useful endproduct or service and is or could have been claimed in the form of business process or method in patent software related invention for example that was claimed by the patent draftsman as programmed machine when the same invention could have been protected

substantive legal effect whatsoever looking forward congress may wish to explore an expansion of the first inventor defense act of 1999 this statute could be amended to embrace more expansive group of patentable subject matter178 in this regard the first inventor defense could prove quite similar to those prevailing in other countries179 these statutes are commonly referred to as creating prior user rights unlike the more limited regime created by the first inventor defense act of 1999 prior user rights abroad are not limited to methods of doing or conducting business they instead apply to any sort of invention experience with the first inventor defense act of 1999 might suggest whether the united states should consider more fullfledged prior user rights regime or be maintained as limited cure of specific problem finally to whatever range of inventions it applies first inventor defense appears to augment the value of trade secrets at the expense of the patent regime in system where trade secret holders may face liability for patent infringement in the future inventors face significant incentives to file applications at the pto even if inventors never plan to enforce their patents against competitors the patents nonetheless possess defensive value should others come to the same invention later but where trade secret holders may employ first inventor defense the incentive to obtain patent protection is diminished prior trade secret status will block liability for patent infringement this system may reduce the number of filed patents and as consequence diminish the public trove of knowledge that appears only in issued patent instruments180 observers may wish to devote some attention to the impact of the first inventor defense act upon the willingness of inventors to seek patent protection possibilities for further legislative activity number of additional legislative possibilities suggest themselves for responding to business method patents some opponents of business method patents have called for ban on their issuance181 this change would likely require modifications to 101 of the patent act such ban could employ the same

would eliminate matters of business practice social observation and personal skill from the patent system less extreme proposals include the suggestion of economist joseph farrell that congress should declare moratorium on the offensive use of software and business method patents187 inventors would be allowed to apply for software and business method patents but at least initially would not be permitted to enforce them against infringers such grace period might allow the pto to augment its examination staff and improve its collection of prior art better enabling an assessment of the patentability of individual applications another possibility is the creation of specialized sui generis protection regime that is specially crafted for business methods boat hulls188 and semiconductor

reforms with respect to business method patents in an open letter issued on march 9 2000 bezos urged that the patent laws should recognize that business method and software patents are fundamentally different than other kinds of patents bezos suggested that business method patents have reduced duration of three to five years he also proposed that business method and software patents be subjected

proposals exceeds the scope of this report it should be noted that the united states has committed to maintaining certain minimal standards of patent protection particular source of obligations is the trips agreement the traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights agreement of the world trade organization192 some of the patent law reforms noted above might run counter to provisions of the trips agreement for example the trips agreement both requires the united states to preserve specified patent term and disallows the united states from granting compulsory patent licenses except in limited circumstances193 possible procedural changes include the provision of additional guarantees of patent validity at the pto prior to costly litigation of patented business methods in the courts for example prior to filing charge of infringement in the courts the business method patentee might be required to undergo an obligatory reevaluation proceeding to ensure that the patent is valid and enforceable another possibility is directive and additional funding for the pto to improve its handling of patent applications claiming methods of doing business an improved collection of prior art literature might allow the pto to better assess whether business methods claimed in patent applications are novel and nonobvious over the prior art194 conclusion the patenting of business methods has focused considerable public attention to traditionally obscure legal discipline commentators have been both intrigued and dismayed by patent law trends that subject inventions from business the social sciences and virtually any other human endeavor to private appropriation although opinions vary on the propriety of these patents there is broad concern about the adaptability of the patent system towards these unfamiliar disciplines whether business method patents will promote or stifle the efforts of entrepreneurs and small firms also remains to be seen as innovations in many sectors play significant role in the growth and international competitiveness of the us economy the post industrial patent system should remain matter for continued public concern and possible legislative oversight
