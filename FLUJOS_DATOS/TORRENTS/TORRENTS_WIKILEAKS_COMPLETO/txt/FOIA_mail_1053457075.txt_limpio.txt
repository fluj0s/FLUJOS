from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to michael mann mannvirginiaedu subject re fwd clivar conference 2004 date tue may 20 145755 2003 mike lennart has managed to confuse with his latest message at one point he mentioned that you and i would do joint overview paper now he suggests we choose 510 coauthors but also refers to other people in our section who he has apparently already informed need to consult with you ie us as required my emphasis as for my opinion of the theme or content of our section i suggest it be quantifying natural and anthropogenic influences on the course of global climate during recent millennia or some such this allows for the review redefinition of global climate history southern as well as northern and moisture as well as temperature importantly it also incorporates the issue of forcing historyies and work quantifying the influence of these histories using simple empirical techniques or using them in conjunction with models of different complexity to attribute causes of this change i am happy to go with the usual suspects in the overview paper but would be happy if we considered others who are also running controlled modeldata comparisons examples are von storch simon tett caspar ammann we need first to clarify whether we will present one large multiauthor presentationpaper or whether it is just and you and the others divided into other paperspresentationsposters should we copy this message to lennart or contact him directly with specific questions keith at 0949 pm 51803 0400 you wrote hi keith i hope all is well apparently were supposed to choose 510 additional coauthors i guess the obvious ones would be phil tim ray malcolm perhaps ed cook scott rutherfordany other suggestions as i understand it the coauthors would be invited to attend and present in the poster session i assume they are listed separately from you and i who will jointly present the oral overview as for the theme im assuming climate changes of the past couplefew millennia or something like that as we have 45 minutes total between the two of us i would suggest we each take about 20 minutes and then well have 5 minutes left for questions any suggestions thoughts would be greatly appreciated thanks mike xsender m214001regendkrzde date sun 18 may 2003 225358 0200 to kbriffaueaacuk mannvirginiaedu from prof dr lennart bengtsson bengtssondkrzde subject clivar conference 2004 cc bengtssondkrzde korneliamuellerdkrzde dear dr mann dear dr briffa the preparation of the clivar conference is progressing well and all invited speakers have now agreed see attached draft program as i have informed you previously journal of climate will have special issue devoted to the conference and i expect you would be willing to prepare paper to be ready at the time of the conference i have made arrangements with the chief editor to make flexible interpretation of the content of the papers so to agree with the objective of the conference and the draft program we would now like you to come up with suitable theme for your presentation at the conference as well list of names which you have selected as coauthors as we anticipate broad and forwardlooking contribution i believe some 510 people seems appropriate it was our intention that the first person listed should be the lead author but you can arrange this otherwise if you prefer to do so i have informed the other speakers in your section to consult with you as required for the conference i expect rather wide audience in addition to broad scientific community including representatives from different agencies such as the meteorological services as well as media representatives for the media we intend to provide special set of information in view of the societal importance of the clivar program and the considerable progress in extended range forecasts and climate change assessment and prediction i believe there will be an excellent opportunity to bring the scientific progress and associated applications of clivar to the participants of the conference it would be very helpful if you could to let know the status of your arrangements not later than june 15 if you see any particular difficulties please let know as soon as possible as you can see from the attached program each part of the conference will have poster sessions the poster sessions will be an important part of the conference and i anticipate that some of your coauthors will prepare such posters we also plan to have the poster contents on cd rom prior to the conference the practical planning of the conference as whole is proceeding well the arrangements in baltimore are quite excellent with the nearby baltimore inner harbor as particular attractive focal point there are all reasons that the conference will be success both scientifically and socially see further the clivar conference website 1httpwwwclivar2004org we are presently exploring the possibilities for financial support of selected participants however any support you may manage to obtain from national funds would be most helpful with my very best regards lennart bengtsson
