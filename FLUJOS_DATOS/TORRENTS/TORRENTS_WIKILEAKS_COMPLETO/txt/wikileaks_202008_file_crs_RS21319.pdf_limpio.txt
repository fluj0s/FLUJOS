increasingly threatened to intervene in the gorge claiming that chechen rebels and international terrorists based there were making forays into russia us interest in the gorge was spurred by evidence that terrorists there might have been linked to qaeda and the united states provided training and equipment to help geor gia reassert control over the area this report may be updated related pr oducts include crs issue brief ib95024 armenia azerbaijan and georgia and crs report 97727 georgia republic recent developments and us interests background in late 1999 soon after sending troops into chechnya president putin made the first of repeated demands that georgia permit russian troops to pursue rebels escaping into georgia and that it cooperate in joint policing of its border and the elimination or extradition of rebels frustrated by continued separatist fighting in its chechnya region russia in 2002 stepped up these demands arguing that georgias pankisi gorge area near chechnyas border provided major sanctuary and source of support for the rebels as fighting in chechnya intensified in late 1999 up to 6000 chechens fled south of the russiangeorgian border about 25 miles into georgias elevenmile long pankisi gorge area many of these refugees had ki nship and other ties to the gorges population of 7500 mainly ethnic chechens termed kists who had long resided in the area the georgian government helped the fleeing chechens to settle in the gorge it tended to tolerate the presence of former chechen rebe l fighters in the gorge as long as they remained inactive and lived there in peace some in georgia also may have consideredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21319crs2 1 the white house remarks by the president to the travel pool feb 27 2 002 see also statement by charge

announced in midaugust 2002 that police and security forces soon would be deployed to the gorge and that military exercises would commence near the gorge the depl oyments began on august 25 with the setting up of checkpoints sealing off the gorge some guarded by tanks and armored vehicles russian and georgian officials reported that many or most chechen rebels and terrorists left the gorge either after the announcement of the gtep or just after the announcement of georgias deployments w ith some moving across the bor der into chechnya and others scattering along georgias borde rs with other areas of russia according to some reports us military planners and fbi cia and personnel advised or participated in the operation putin sent letter to shev ardnadze on september 4 2002 demanding that georgian authorities neutralize terrorists in the pankisi gorge rather than simply let them leave the area the stat department condemned russian airstrikes into georgias pankisi gorge area bordering russias chec hnya region and stressed that russia should cooperate with georgias effo rts to combat the terrorists putin increasingly attempted to frame the issue of chechen rebels in the pankisi gorge as part of the unbacked effort d by the united states against international terrorism maintaining that russia had the righ t to counterattack or preempt terrorists in states harboring them on september 11 2002 putin asserted that while russia had eliminated qaeda and other international terrorists within chechnya they continued to threaten russia and the world from neig hboring georgia he called on his defense border and security agencies to prepare plans for an incursion georgianrussian tensions seemed to reach new heights the next day when putin addressed letters to president bush and other secur ity council unsc and osce members condemning georgias police action in the pa nkisi gorge as duplicitous in part because georgian leaders were conniving with the terrorists he warned that russia might exercise its right to selfdefense under th charter or the unscs antiterrorism resolution 1373 to counter the terrorist men ace the united states responded

of europe pace to which russi and georgia belong strongly denounced russias threats to intervene and formed factfinding mission to visit the gorge2 marking an significant easing of tensions between russia and georgia the two presidents met in moldova on octobe r 6 2002 and agreed on border cooperation including the designation of their security ministers as border emissaries and the establishment of an earlywarning joint communication system in followup meetings in midoctober and midnovember border officials of the two states signed accords reportedly setting up pa rallel border checkpoint s and providing for some reconnaissance and patrolling cooperation georgian officials in late oc tober reported that their forces had apprehended over dozen foreign terrori sts linked to qaeda and had handed them over to the united states though us sources would not verify such reports allegedly one prisoner was saif islam masry an qaeda fficer involved in several terrorist attacks on us pers onnel and facilities new revelations major shift in georgias vi ew of chechnya and the pankisi gorge occurred in early december 2002 when an armed group from russia crossed into georgia to commit crimes re portedly the group had earlier left the pankisi gorge following georgias crackdown shevardnandz asserted that the group constituted the spearhead of terrorists planning to carry out wideranging terrorist acts in tbilisi and announced nationwide anticr ime operation stating that i made big mistake when i failed to pay attention to the terrorist threat he also alluded to georgian press reports that prominent chechen rebel leaders had threatened the georgian government he stated that the anticrime operation would not be aimed against peaceful chechens residing in georgia responding to shevardnadzes announcement putin commended shevardnadze for decisive action in the struggle against terrorism3 international observers appeared in recent weeks to be also reassessing the threat posed by international terrorism in the pankisi gorge as more potent than previously supposed seemingly lending greater support to some of russias arguments at variance with some earlier

they controlled the gorge the camps contained sophisticated communications equipment and supplies training included hostagetaking shooting down airplanes and use of chemical weapons and explosives although the in ternational terrorists focused on funneling money and fighters into chechnya to fuel the chechen rebel fighting they were also node of support for worldwide terrorism4 such support may have included the development of toxins and bombs for use ag ainst us and other targets in the middle east western europe and russia5 among the most sensational new evidence was surveillance camera footage allegedly shot in march 2002 of qaeda presence in th gorge released by the georgian security ministry in midjanuary 2003 the ministry reported that among the international terrorists on camera was the jordanian abu hafs better known at amzhet who led the 80100 international mujahidin in the gorge other evidence showed more potent chechen rebel presence than previously ac knowledged by georgia including ruslan gelayev with band of 200250 rebels doka umarov also called khasanov with band of 130150 rebels hussein esambayev with band of 130140 rebels and rebel called batya with band of 100120 rebels6 many or most of th rebels and terrorists quietly left the gorge by mid2002 and were not apprehended the security ministry reported that its antiterrorist operation was virtually finish ed in the gorge by late 2002 the release of the camera footage and announ cement that operations were winding down prompted russias presidential spokesman to warn on january 16 2003 that terrorism may not have been eradicated in the gorge and that intern ational attenti on should remain focused on the area russian military official s also announced further efforts to fortify the georgiarussia border us amba ssador to russia alexander vershbow too responded on january 17 that much remained to be done to completely eliminate the threat in the area perhaps heeding ch warnings in march 2003 the government reportedly sent extra military and police forces into the gorge to prevent chechen rebels from reentering during the spring thaw ge orgian national security council secretary tedo japaridze in february 2003 was critical of assertions that many qaeda remained in the gorge which he said plays into the hands of those russians wanting to intervene the georgia train and equip program the georgia train and equip program gtep grew out of request for counterterrorism aid made by president shevardnadze during his us meeting with president bush in october 2001 us officials were

24 2002 stressed that stable and democratic georgia w ill have geostrategic importance for us international relations far into the future he suggested that russias threats against georgi reflected its real concerns about the presence of chechen rebels and terrorists in georgia visceral dislike by some in russia to shevardnadzes prowestern stance and perhaps displeasure that an oil pipeline being built across georgia will loosen its nearmonopoly control over caspian energy those who view the pankisi gorge through the lens of russian politics also have argued that president putin and the military were attempting to justify the failures of the russian campaign in chechnya by attributing them to georgian officials and international terrorists president putins letter of september 11 ppeared designed largely to convince the united states to encourage georgia to be more cooperative in ddressing crossborder incursions according to some observers however other commentators and russian media asserted that the letter represented an attempt to trade russias support of unsc resolution on iraq in exchange for us ac quiescence to russian incursion addressing this assertion undersecretary of state j ohn bolton rejected any us willingness to consider such an exchange of concessions some observers have raised concerns that as the united states focuses more on possible conflict with iraq russia might again consider crossborder forays into georgia in spring 2003 when chechen rebels may stephttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21319crs6 8 interfax sept 13 2002 washington post

foreign minister ivanov during his septem ber 2002 us visit stressed that ties were strengthened and secretary powell stated th at the united states was pleased with the relationship perhaps also i ndicative secretary powell on september 24 stated that the united states would not lecture to the russians on selfdefense but argued that brief military force by russia in the gorge would not resolve the problem he also partly blamed georgia for border viol ations stating that theres an obligation both on the georgian side as well as on the russian side to stop terrorism at the same time administration sources indicated that the united states was willing to step up trilateral talks with russia and georgia to help ease their tensions sena tor john mccain after visiting the gorge also endor sed holding tr ilateral talks10 the gtep assistance was widely viewed by us and georgian officials as bolstering georgias ability to defend itself without out side intervention from russia there were major concerns in both the united states and georgia that georgian crackdown on chechen rebels and terrorists in the gorge could trigger attacks by these forces on georgia itself russias escalation of rhetoric dur ing 2002 provided an impetus to the us gtep effort to put forces in pl ace that could prevent and counter such attacks some us officials also pointed to the establishment of the ncc as an effort by the united states to bolster stability in georgia during its upcoming political succession reports that members of qaeda and other terrorists were in pankisi or elsewhere in georgia created dilemmas for us policy that holds govern ments responsible for terrorists operating on their territories however georgias attainment of central government control over its territory will likely take some months or years and cannot extend to breakaway regions such as abkhazia and south ossetia that also might contain terrorists at the same time russia georgia and the united states continue to face the larger dilemma of distinguishing chechen separatists from terrorists with the united states calling for georgia to combat the latter and advocating that russia open peace talks with the former that lead to the settlement of the conflict
