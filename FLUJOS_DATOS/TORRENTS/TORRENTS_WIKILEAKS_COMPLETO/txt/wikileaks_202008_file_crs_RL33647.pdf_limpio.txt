proposal for civilian reserve with the february 2008 budget request on june 1 2006 crs gathered group of experts on the recruitment and deployment of civilians to peacekeeping operations now generally referred to by the broader term stabilization and reconstruction operations the purpose of the threehour workshop was to clarify issues that might be involved in the formation of civilian reserve force for such operations the bush administration is developing proposals for civilian reserve shortly before the workshop was held the senate passed the reconstruction and stabilization civilian management act of 2006 s 3322 to establish such civilian reserve the workshop began with presentation by state department official christopher j hoh who explained administration plans for civilian reserve as outlined by mr hoh these plans called for the creation of reserve of civilians from the private and public sector to deploy with or soon after permanent government employees and before contractors reservists would train together with us military and civilian government personnel before deployments and would be mobilized as federal employees they would be provided range of benefits and incentives the workshop included speakers from the and from two national agencies that recruit civilians for peacekeeping and related missions the german center for international peace operations known by its german acronym zif and canadas canadem as well as from the alexandria vabased institute for defense analysis the zif and canadem all have rosters of professionals in rule of law and civil administration to send on missions the rosters are not equivalent to the reserve force proposed by the bush administration or by senate bill s 3322 the reconstruction and stabilization civili an management act of 2006 but all candidates are prescreened and provided predeployment training the recruitment and other problems they have faced may be similar to those that the united states may encounter if it forms reserve participants pointed to several needs to attract and retain highly qualified people 1 proactive recruitment methods 2 indepth screening 3 fficient training and 4 retention incentives to meet the needs of requester organizations participants agreed on the need for 1 sizable rosters 2 sophisticated databases and 3 insulation from political pressures to enhance the prospects for mission success participants agreed that deployments should be set for at least year in order to provide continuity the workshop discussion raised several questions about the desirability of bush administration plans among the questions are whether recent plans and proposals on roster size and recommendations by private firm regarding the screening process and deployment length are adequate this report will not be updated

conflict settlements the bush administration seeks congressional support for the establishment of multi component civilian ready reserve for peacebuilding abroad the bush administration is expected to present concrete proposal for such reserve in february 2008 with its fy2009 budget request in his state of the union address on january 23 2007 president bush invited the 110th congress to work with the administration on the design and establishment of volunteer civilian reserve corps which would function much like our military reserve this corps would ease the burden on the armed forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad when america needs them he stated it would give people across america who do not wear the uniform chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time on june 1 2006 the congressional research service held workshop entitled civilian forces for stabilization and reconstruction us proposals and international experience in order to clarify the issues involved in forming such re serve the following report first issued in 2006 summarizes the main points of workshop proceedings and concludes with short discussion of

director for response strategy and resource management in the state department office of the coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization scrs the administration has ta sked the scrs to develop the concept of civilian reserve force that could rapidly deploy to conflicttorn areas to carry out statebuilding efforts this is often referred to as surge capability personnel in such force would include rule of law practitioners police judges lawyers prison administrators civil administrators and governance experts people with experience involving local and state government agencies and infrastructure experts eg civil engineers and planners mr hoh explained current state department plans for civilian reserve these plans envision the civilian reserve as group that would fill the gap between permanent us government employees who could be deploy ed immediately and contractor s who take much longer to deploy permanent government employees would be comprised of two groups an active force of employees dedicated solely to such operations and standby reserve of government employees who have volunteered to be detailed from their permanent jobs to such operations as needed civilian reservists would be deployable within 30 to 60 days mobilized as government employees paid at comparable level with government employees doing the same work and offered comparable incentives such as death and dismemberment insurance and diplomatic privileges according to the administration plans outlined by mr hoh they would be chosen for their expertise in the areas needed for transitional security rule of law essential public services 1 this issue is tracked in crs report rl32862 peacekeeping and conflict transitions background and congressional action on civilian capabilities by nina

capacity to work effectively from the very beginning of their assignment and to function in teams because they would be government employees they would be accountable under us government ethics laws and other regulations and could form part of the us government management structure eg supervising and managing permanent us government employees and contractors mr hoh did not provide an estimate of the number of reservists contemplated under current plans the numbers contemplated by studies prepared for scrs are discussed in the related issues for congress section below noting that the state department had just received lengthy report of well over 600 pages from bearingpoint inc 2 outlining detailed plans for civilian reserve mr hoh stated that the administration would consult with congress on specific plans for the reserve once intraexecutive branch consultations are completed he said that the administration would consult with congress on issues regarding specific functional specialty areas ie rule of law civil administration economic development the types of situations in which the reserve should be deployed and the period of time over which to build comprehensive reserve force g21g162g151g152g153g156g146g156g561g152g143g561g6g146g156g140g158g156g156g146g152g151g561g152g151g561g11g151g157g142g155g151g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561

reconstruction sr operations such as that contemplated by the bush administration or by senate bill passed shortly before the workshop was held the reconstruction and stab ilization civilian management act of 2006 s 3322 passed by the senate on may 26 2006 but never considered in the house would have provided for the continued development of an extensive expert civilian response capability for sr activities as core mission of the state department and usaid nevertheless these two organizations recruit civilians from their respective countries to serve in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations run by international organizations such as the united nations the european union eu and the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce like the united nations zif and canadem prescreen all candidates and they offer some level of training details on the united nations zif and canadem rosters can be found in the table 1 at the end of this report while these agencies are not equivalent to the civilian reserve proposals currently under study in the united states the recruitment and other problems they face may well have implications for the issues that the united states will confront in forming civilian reserve fourth speaker knowledgeable about roster systems was scott r feil retired us army colonel and an adjunct research staff member at the institute for defense analysis ida non profit institute supporting the department of defe nse he directed forthcoming study for scrs on civilian postconflict reserve forces which examined the roster systems of various international organizations and countries as well as in the united states 4 two other experts with experience in recruiting and screening civilian volunteers for postconflict missions were

an underlying premise of the development of civilian rosters and reserves in that the quality of people who are deployed in postconflict and other stability operations is crucial to their success mr feil stated that while he does not believe any study has yet been done measuring the effectiveness of personnel in postconflict missions he believes that such an evaluation would demonstrate that the more experienced wellqualified people are more successful at their tasks than those less qualified participants discussed their organizations experiences and methods for obtaining and retaining wellqualified people g20g142g140g155g158g146g157g150g142g151g157g561g15g142g157g145g152g141g156g561 as the purpose of creating civilian roster is to provide the best possible person for specific task in foreign operation and usually within short period of time speakers agreed that proactive recruitment is necessary according to participants it is not enough to establish an online application

may not be qualified mr behrendt estimated that zif gets some 50 to 80 applicants month for placement on the roster and rejects some 60 to 70 immediately as unsuited to the needs of the requesting organizations ms vincent of canadem said that targeted recruitment is essential to the development of roster of wellqualified experts an assessment in which others concurred mr behrendt described headhunting as an important task of zifs six recruiters one targeted recruitment thod cited by canadem and zif is to build networks in professional communities for ex ample canadem c ontacts professional associations in order to build networks in the future it may survey its expatriates in business and professional work for potential candidates zif uses networks of ea stern european professionals to work where the russian language is useful and is also looking to recruit among german arabic speakers another recruitment method is through wordofmouth contacts with wellqualified individuals the recruiters request these individuals to recommend others who would be wellsuited for such jobs zif representatives talk to corporate leaders in order to persuade them to grant leaves of absence for overseas deployments that would allow qualified individuals to participate in peacebuilding missions zif is also considering recruiting among its expatriate communities g20g152g139g158g156g157g561g20g152g156g157g142g155g561 roster size and depth is also an important determinant in an organization or nations ability to provide wellqualified people on short notice for specific missions sizable roster with some depth in each specialty was recommended by participants several participants noted that large roster was needed with several people who would be qualified for any one slot ms vincent stated that large database increases the chances of being able to deploy wellqualified person because in canade ms experience really good people are not readily available quickly ms rolland stated that it is very difficult to recruit wellqualified people with the requisite language skills whether roster is of adequate size to fulfill the needs of particular nation or organization will depend on the number of those sent abroad for example canadem s drawn the 400 people it currently has abroad from core roster of 4000 it considers these the most suited for missions although its total roster numbers 7600 this is ratio of 10 persons on the core roster to each person deployed zif has roster of 900 persons and has 200 persons deployed for ratio of 4½ to one the united nations which is making concerted effort to increase its roster has ratio at this time of less than one on the roster to one deployed while sizable rosters are necessary zif has decided to limit its roster to more than 1500 people that it believes is the maximum number of participants that it can manage with its six recruitment officers who also provide continuing points of contact for people deployed in the field and returnees the purpose of continuing contacts is to provide the support necessary to encourage personnel on the roster to participate in future deployments 5 canadem zif and undpko have online application sites where prospective candidates may apply to join their respective rosters with exceptions for those experienced in peacekeeping or related missions prospective zif candidates must take the zif basic training course where they are screened before being placed on the roster see section in this report on training

level positions was cutting off potential source of roster recruits because germanys domestic labor market is tight zif receives large number of applications from junior professionals however entry level positions in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations are quickly disappearing and the greatest demand is for mature midcareer professionals thus bringing people in at an entry level and having them develop expertise on the job is difficult because zif and the other organizations usually limit their rosters to those with overseas experience they may face shortage of qualified professionals when current members begin to retire g21g140g155g142g142g151g146g151g144g561 participants stressed the need to employ multiple yers of screening in order to ensure that only applicants who are well suited to the extraordinary demands and rigors of peacekeeping and related missions are placed on rosters such missions demand people who are not only experts in their fields but who also have the interpersonal skills necessary to develop rapidly productive working relationships with people from varied cultural backgrounds screening includes references checks and personal interviews and in the case of zif testing in hostile environment see below see the table 1 at the end of this report for details on canadem zif and screening processes screening is used to identify those who seek and are wellqualified for the professional challenge that such positions entail weeding out those merely looking for adventure or seeking to escape troubled personal lives even those recruited directly by an organization because of their expertise must be screened for their ability to withstand the physically demanding environments and psychologically taxing situations presented by such missions people who are not fit for such missions can pose unnecessary risks to themselves their colleagues and others not only is intensive screening cited as important in mitigating the risks involved in sending unsuitable people to missions but it is also necessary to ensure that personnel are able to fulfill their commitments one speaker noted that two deployed persons had returned from missions in sudan and the rural areas of sierra leone because they were unable to tolerate the situations the speakers from the united nations and canadem stated that their organizations are currently enhancing their screening efforts part of the improved screening system will enable potential applicants to make better decisions about whether they are suitable for position by providing greater online information about the circumstances and requirements of mission as part of the application information the united na tions is also beginning to use technical experts to screen applications before applicants are included in the roster canadem has also begun to establish system to assess the performance of those it deploys in order to evaluate them for future deployments mr behrendt of zif stated that he thought it im portant to personally know each person on the zif roster ms vincent of canadem said that she knew everyone on the canadem roster when it listed 2000 names but knowing everyone personally was impossible when the roster grew far beyond that g22g155g138g146g151g146g151g144g561 the united nations zif and canadem all offer some level of training to those going on missions the training is

mechanism in its recruitment process zif applicants are required to take tw oweek training program of which four days are spent at german army base that requires them to work with police and military personnel there they are put through stressful situations that simulate hostile environment for instance applicants must deal with passing through legal checkpoints and encountering illegal checkpoints they must demonstrate that they can adapt to the sound of weapons fire during their training zif observes whether they have the interpersonal skills and the capacity needed to deal with stress in difficult mission canadem views it as essential to provide training courses to those without any international experience those who ve served in previous missions however are given predeployment briefings tailored specifically to their new mission canadem is exploring the possibility of increasing the training it offers and is considering online training

extent to which participation in peacekeepingpeacebuilding roster should be treated as career path the united nations canadem and zif representatives all felt that their organizations are in competition for qualified personnel with organizations that offer career track in related areas with benefits and incentives such competitors include the united national development program undp and other international or nonprofit development agencies this is especially true in cases where participants must quit their jobs in order to deploy zif said that virtually all of those that it deploys must leave their jobs while in the case of canadem this is less true as the canadian government is disposed to granting leaves of absence for such experiences where leaves of absence are not available participants are likely to extend their commitments or seek another position after their first assignment ends making facto career of patchwork of overseas deployments because of this competition benefits such as health insurance and life insurance can be important recruitment assets while ms rolland judges the undpko to have attractive benefits in this respect canadem and zif are trying to secure higher benefits for those they send on missions followup work with those deployed and their families is necessary in order to encourage people to volunteer for future missions according to ms vincent the psychological stress of missions on the deployed person and of the deployed persons absence on the family makes reintegration work necessary to retain people for second tours others also observed on the other hand the speakers also cautioned against repeated redeployments to hostile situations noting that working in abnormal situations can extract psychological toll that is damaging for many people over the long run the zif representative cautioned that at times roster participants showing signs of psychological fatigue had to be dissuaded from seeking an immediate new postconflict posting after completing an assignment while zif seeks long term relationship with the people on its roster with people deploying to multiple assignments over period of many years it seeks to discourage applicants from viewing peacebuilding as career or even as source of employment for long periods of time such as ten continuous years

is critical even the best people are unlikely to be successful if their deployments are not long enough to build the relationships needed to perform job adequately in addition much time is lost with shorter tours of duty as successive experts duplicate work which was done by previous person contracts are for six months the length of the standard mission mandate but are renewable as the missions are generally extended mr hoh of scrs stated that results improved during his tour in bosnia as the lengths of time for which civilians were retained increased ms anderson of the aba commented during discussions that the aba asks for an initial commitment of one year and offers incentives for person to remain for another year where that is not possible the aba tries to arrange for an overlap in order to eliminate duplication of effort g18g152g149g146g157g146g140g138g149g561g11g151g156g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g561g138g151g141g561g5g152g151g157g146g151g158g146g157g162g561 canadem and zif were both established by and continue to be funded by their respective governments but both exist as autonomous nonpr ofit organizations such arrangements are desirable according to participants because they allow the organizations to protect themselves from possible political demands such as lobbying on behalf of the nominations or appointments of individuals for desirable posts it also makes them less bureaucratic and able to respond more rapidly according to the workshop discussion in addition canadem and zif enjoy continuity of managers and personnel which would not be possible if they were government agencies whose personnel were secured by political appointments or diplomatic rotations

the appropriate size screening and resourcing of potential civilian reserve and additional authorities needed these questions are especially relevant when compared with the recommendations made by the scrscommissioned bearingpoint study mentioned by mr hoh g20g152g156g157g142g155g561g21g146g163g142g561 the workshop discussion squares with two conclusions of the bearingpoint study first that decisions on roster size must evolve over time and second that the scrs planned roster of 3000 according to the study is fraction of what will ultimately be needed to fulfill the programs mission6 the entire roster would be deployed if reservists were sent to two large and one small operations according to bearingpoint estimates of the size of operations the ratio could be as high as five persons on the roster to one person deployed if reservists were deployed to one small operation or during year of small operations7 6 bearingpoint opcit p 436 as mentioned earlier the speaker from scrs did not mention proposed number for the civilian reserve roster s 3322 does t set definite size for the reserve roster 7 the bearingpoint study quantifies deployment sizes in deployment years about 600

about the same as the zif ratio and about half of the canadem ratio for its core roster might well be workable for small operation but problematic for larger and multiple operations the bearingpoint study states that scrs will need to closely track deployment refusal rates as one determinant of optimal roster size8 the ida study contemplates rule of law rese rve of 6000 people including police units and judicial teams and civilian response corps of 2500 in other specialities according to mr feil in developing its concept the ida study looked not only at international rosters including zif and canadem but also several domestic models that are used for variety of purposes one that mr feil pointed to as working well is the large online roster of the national wildfire coordinating group with some 75000 firefighters available for national emergencies mr feil spoke highly of another as possible model for us civilian reserveone built on the concept of directed overstrength in local agencies where us government provides funding for or reimburses positions in nonfederal agencies whose occupants could be called up when needed for deployments abroad 9

reaction to stress raises the question as to whether the zif model might be more appropriate than the less extensive bearing point model as noted earlier zif screens applicants extensively placing potential reservists on its roster only after they have successfully completed training exercise that places them in stressful situations the bearing point model recommends written exam for applicants as first screening step and an inperson evaluation relying on multiple screening methods the bearingpoint model calls for four to six training events while reservists are in service baseline training orientat ion annual training predeployment readiness leadership training and incountry training 10 one question is whether baseline training should be continued in small deployment year about 900 in medium deploy ment year and about 1200 in large deployment year bearingpoint opcit p 10 8 because us reservists unlike zif and canadem rosterees would be under legal obligation to appear barring sufficient cause us civilian reserve system might well have lower refusal rate still noting the canadem judgment that very good people cannot deploy rapidly re serve may not attract the quality of people that it wants if refusal criteria were too stringent 9 the example mentioned by mr feil as working well is the fairfax county urban search and rescue team part of the fairfax county virginia fire and rescue department according to its website the 200member team of career and volunteer personnel includes emergency managers and planners firefighters physicians and paramedics and specialists in structural engineering heavy rigging can ine and technical search and other areas team members are available for deployment on 14day missions in the united stat and abroad to provide planning and rescue services for victims of collapsed structures resulting from disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes or manmade catastrophes when team members are activated fairfax county is reimbursed for their services by federal agency either fema for domestic deployments or the usaid office of foreign disaster assistance ofda for international deployments usaidofda also provides the team annual funding to maintain readiness team members are required to attend training every month family support services team provides orientation and assistance to the families of team members see httpwwwvatf1org mr fe il stated that some object to this model as too complex for the larger reserve contemplated here and discussed possible alternative model in which members of federal reserve would be seconded to local jurisdictions until needed for deployments abroad 10 bearingpoint opcit p 7 bearingpoint lists undpko canadem and zif as among the organizations that were interviewed for

accepted into the reserve the workshop discussion indicates that the most extensive training recommended by bearingpoint may well be desirable

there seemed to be consensus that the longer deployments of year or more are better than shorter ones the bearingpoint study contemplat standard maximum deployment length of one year in the field for most us civilian reservists with provisions for renewals bearingpoint found that most participants in its focus groups would be willing to join civilian reserve that required commitment to deploy on one tour for maximum of twelve months over four year contractual period although some were also interested in the possibility of extending tours and of additional deployments the bearingpoint study states that the experience of comparative organizations indicates that six months to one year as standard tour length adequately satisfies the requirement for continuity of operations and th critical relationship building with local and partner organizations 11 bearingpoint did recommend shorter threetosixmonth standard deployment commitments for law enforcement personnel particularly constabulary police because performance can erode over time in high threat environments12 oneyear deployment length is consistent with current administration thinking which views the civilian reserve as an addon to the force of permanent employees that fill the gap before contractors can be mobilized nevertheless and despite the bearingpoint assessment that most potential reservists would be unwilling to sign on for longer than oneyear tour the workshop speakers stress that the need for continuity of personnel may argue for somewhat altered version of the model oneyear deployments may be adequate for most people in specialties where relationships are not crucial to success such as infrastructure engineers and other more technical experts longer deployments may be considered however for positions and specialties where longterm personal relationships and mentoring are important for successful outcome ms andersen of the aba indicated that in rule of law areas involving the courts and rule of law reform where relationships are crucial to success tours of one year or more are desirable she noted that about onehalf of those deployed on aba missions volunteer for second year longer deployments may especially be needed when civilian reservists serve as managers or supervisors as is contemplated by the proposal to activate them as federal employees further studies which test for the willingness of potential reservists in different specialties and at different levels of experience and pay to deploy for longer periods may be useful

united states outlined by mr hoh federalized reservists would be deployed to cover the time gap before contractors could be deployed because the us government similarly lacks control over contractors operating abroad on its behalf policymakers may wish to consider whether the only factor to consider in choosing civilian reservists over contractors is relative deployment times reservists might be considered in circumstances where hostilities persist over long period of time or where us interests are particularly sensitive alternately because deploying reservists for greater lengths of time would have implications for the size of the civilian reserve force policymakers may wish to consider greater controls over deployed contractors and greater oversight over contractor
