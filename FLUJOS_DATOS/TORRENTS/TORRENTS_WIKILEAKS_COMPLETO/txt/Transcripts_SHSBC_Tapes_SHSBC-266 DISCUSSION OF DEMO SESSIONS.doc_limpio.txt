discussion of demo sessions lecture given on 13 february 1963 lets take résumé now of these sessions we have just seen and the reason im at this particular angle is im looking at camera which is on the next floor above this is pretty good well now looking at our x unitlooking at our x unit as whole theyre going along all right theyre going along all right but their practical definitely needs buttoning up in meter reading meter reading is very very poor and you cant live with meter reading as bad as the meter reading tonight i dont mean to knock everybody in the head on it but thatthats prettypretty bad show as far as meter reading is concerned in actual facti know thats terribly condemning but in actual fact you must realizeyou must realize that just one just one missed read just cleaning one cleanknocks the pc off his stride and missing one read leaves the pc with missed withhold and its not good its not good its the direction of worsening pc so youve got to get along little better on this meter reading thats all youve got to brush it up and im asking you in practical to give lot of attention to that because i wont even start to add up the number of missed reads tonight because they were quite large all right now lets take these sessions up in detail the first session eleanors session now her presence was pretty good she seemed to be little bit nervous and possibly we could assign that to tv but in actual fact that presence can be smoother and more assured and more confident and id like to see it so that isnt good saint hill presence yet now theres piece of missing data here and thats how you use protest in any mid ruds you dont swing over to the protest button and say since the last session has anything been protested what you do is ask the pcand this is just random anywherewhen you maybe have cleaned clean or done somethingand then you get read and it doesnt seem to be going wellyou want to ask the pc if it doesnt seem to be going well has this question been protested that is the whole wording of it has this question been protested now that youll find is quite enough and the pcll say oh yes you know and youll say all right ill check the question again since the last time you were audited has anything been protested or anything been suggested or whatever it was you were on let us say you were clearing suggestsince the last session has anything been suggestedpc cant seem to grasp this and you do have bit of read and he doesnt seem to get across with it and youre questioning maybe your own meter readings youre not quite sure what it is and in extremisyou dont do this with every question you understand but the way you use that you say has this question been protested and the pc says haha yes yes you say all right ill check that again now since the last time you were audited has anything been suggested and it doesnt read so obviously it was the protest that was making it read you recognize that protest is the reaction invariable reactionwhen you have cleaned clean or messed up on your mid ruds youre asking him for one more than hes got well his answer is to protest and you get read then but the read is on protestthe read is not on the question and i heard storypossibly not truebut nevertheless i did hear it they were spending two hours and fortyfive minutes at end of session trying to clean up the question in this session have you protested the meter or something like thatsome such question and this went on for two hours and fortyfive minutes well the fellow was protesting the question because he didnt know that that was the name of the instrument that was on the table now thats classic but theres your answer theres your answer that protest is the thing that makes your mid rud buttons read when theyre not supposed to be reading and when you clean cleans and miss reads and all that sort of thing after while the pc gets into protest and you better clean it up for the question dont clean it up for the session or swing into your protest button and then you take your protest button in its natural sequence just as before since the last time i audited you has anything been protested thats that now supposing you cant clean that up and somehow or another we just cant seem to get that clean well we say has this question been protested and the pc says yes so you say since the last time i audited you has anything been protested read you say thats clean the test of it is is did it stop reading you should realize also that pc will suppress things like suppress and the rest of that but that is not as common in actual fact as protest natural action of the pc when youve done something bad with the meter is to protest now the tone 40 end of session and beginning of session heregot to be picked up you dont shout at the pc or you dont speak at the pcyou simply get it in positively it runs something like this is it all right with you if i begin this session now all right here it is start of session good monotone louder more positive and tone 40 and wrap it right around his head and then drop back to natural tone of voice now sometimes by shouting too loudly you put the pc in complete state of defense so you must realize that its tone 40 it isnt the shout and you end the session the same way is it all right with you if i end this session now all right here it is end of session not is it all right with you if i end this session now all right end of session nothing happens this technology by the wayof how you start and end sessionscomes out of many older things it period of auditing track an auditing time track is an artificial track and the pc is actually in slightly artificial state you actually put him in that state with your start of session and your end of session now maybe the pc in this first session improvedmaybe the pc didnt i dont know all in all that sounds eleanor like im giving you very bad time im not im not there is hope there is hope and im just asking you to bear down hard on your meter readingand pull uppull up your your tone 40 all right now lets go to the next session this was vickies session and i found her presence very good she will make good auditor she thought that she had been ruined completely as an auditor by the course short time ago and in actual fact shell find out that she has not been ruined now and that her presence can get even better than it is and its very good shell make very good auditor and the same remarks about tone 40 definitely apply to vickies session good heavens you dont start session with all right with you if i begin this session all right start of session itnothing happens you see youve got to come down on that that is special moment and you make special moment out of it vickie and you get your tone 40 up now your meter reading wasnt too bad but you did something very peculiar you know when pc is laughing and happy and cheerful and bubbling all over himselfthe day i get in end rudiments has not yet arrived because youre inreinteriorizing him back into the session very shortly theres going to be shift you know where goals and gains are picked up and run before havingness youll find out that works much better but here is aheres case in point that pc is perfectly happy you didnt have to get in any end rudimentsjust end the session now definitely the pc was improved that was registered on his tone arm his tone arm was at 25 and at session end his tone arm was very much closer to his clear read and the pc was improved theres lot of hope for this particular auditor and now the last session wallys session and i considered it bit informal i think that the auditor presence there was bit informal that presence can be greatly improved theres nothing wrong with the auditors address to the pc its just that the auditor ought to look little more precise you know they start in in an academy being stiff as boards and then they come out of itand they get less formal less frozen but you know you can go too far and it seemed to like that has gone just little bit far so be just little more formal in your auditing and itll be okay but you have good warmth and good presence with regard to the pc so dont take what im saying here too seriously its mostly your trs could be improved little bit meter reading was fairbut only fair and i want to point out something to you did you see that pc put his head down your pc put his head down duh he went did you see that you know why the pc did that and later on while you were getting in your beginning ruds the pc said he had suppressed something well when you left suppress it was reading like crazy he had read on suppress and he had read on invalidate and by the time you got across suppress and invalidateand asked him suggesthe was down like this boom thats because youd missed two things now that read on invalidate was so tiny as to be almost undiscoverable but it was there now the read on suppress was quite bold in other words when you see pc start in fairly bold and brash and then all of sudden go well thyathyathya and you get less and so on yes you must have goofed up your meter readingyou must have done something because theoretically he ought to get brighter not darker you see what i mean i was using that term slangly it wasisnt that he would get dark in the facebut he just sort of goes you know well soandso soandso soandso thats what happens when you do bad meter reading now once more the pcs end of session here was better handled than in the other sessions but nevertheless this tone 40 start of session and end of session was pretty lousypretty lousy however the pc was more relaxed and felt better at the session end which was good win and i think that was very fine now let give you something that youre missing completely there is very formal way that you run session and the first thing you want to know about this session is the pc under your control in any way well the way you do that is you place the pcs chair that is your action now if you want to go little bit furtheryou would start it in is it all right to audit in this room all right your chair soandso and now your can squeeze and now your rfactor and it goes in that particular sequence now actually i use it in this sequenceand i think youll find it outwork better from the practicality that the pc is sitting down you say all right your chairs all right or bring your chair forward or put your chair back or actually seat the pc in his chair but make sure that you adjust the pcs chair thats trick that puts the pc bit more under your control and then you ask the pc if its all right to audit in this room and he says yes or and so forth andyou neednt particularly clean this on the meter but very edgy pc i do clean it on the meter i know were not auditing yet but thats all right i take look at it is it all right if we audit in this room it goes bang like that whats the matter with this room oh well its soandso we clean that up so we havent got that falling over and then we get can squeezethats to make sure that the pc is connected to the meter thats why we get that particular one and it also gives us look into his havingness so we give him bang can squeeze and then we put in our rfactor and then we say is it all right with you if i begin this session now and you give him tone 40 start of session now you ask him has the session started for you and the pc says yes or and if the pc says you give him another start of session just like you did before and you ask the pc if the session started for him and the pc says actually it chops up the pc pretty badly to now say well well take it up in the rudiments and so forth that is apt to chop the pc if the session hasnt started for this pc in two starts itll normally be that something is wrong with the room you understand or the pc is trying to tell you something so by asking the pc if the room is all right youve gotten rid of that oneso your session is very likely to start and when you give the pc start of sessionit didnt start for himand you give him another start of session and it didnt start for himyou better ask the pc if hes thinking about something and give it to him again that is actually kinder way to go about it so much so that you can count on the fact that theres either something wrong with the room or the pc is withholding somethingor hes got something to tell youand hes holding his breath waiting for you to say start of session so he actually doesnt hear the start of session and he says well yes ive been sitting here waiting to tell you i think my goal is excelsior and you say heh all right good enough all right well i got that now now here it is start of session and off we go session start for you oh yes session started for do you see what i mean the two reasons sessions dont start is the room is lousy or the pcs trying to tell the auditor somethingis holding it back waiting until the session starts so he can say something you see unless you release those two valves there youre not going to get session started now heres another good point in all this is your session is ended or it isnt ended now ive been experimenting lately and i find out getting the goals and gains and what the pc has to tell you as you go there then end the body of the session and then get your can squeeze and then run your havingness and simply give the pc an end of session your pc is more exteriorized from the session than otherwise thatswill be coming out here very shortly in bulletin ive been experimenting with that and life and livingness and i find that life and livingness goals are of use to tell you if pc had ptr and that was the original reason they were used and we longer care about that were handling ptps with other processes all right so if you dont need those for ptp realize that they actually exteriorize the pc from that session in other words hes there to be audited you ask him what goals hed like to set for life or livingness he instantly thinks of all of his ptps and youve got more ptps to handle than you had before you find out that will be omitted in your next goals model session rundown now therefore the optimum way to start session is ask pc to sit down adjust his chair ask him if its all right to audit in the room whether you clear it on the meter or not i dont care most pcs will take it but some of them object to it and theres particular reason to carry on with it over an j objection then get your can squeeze put in your rfactor start your session get your goals and gains and look to see if that tone arm is where you left the pc in the last session because if it isnt youre going to have to get in your mid ruds since the last time i audited you if the tone arm is at the same place dont bother you understand the use of this and you just go into the body of session now get your goals and gains at the end of the session close the session get your can squeeze run bit of havingness and end your session and youll find out thatll save you an awful lot of session time now i wanted to look at this tonight to see how you were going and what you were doing and it seemed to that the worst faults here were simply the tone 40lack of use the precise procedure on starting the session and the meter reading and the meter reading was terrible really that meter reading is just too bad to be borne however youre making progress and we know that this is better auditing than you have been doingand this is better auditing than is done in the fieldbut its not good enough for saint hill graduate so improve your presence get your formality in and square it around you realize that an awful lot of your auditing gain depends on the pcs confidence in the auditor and the pcs confidence in the auditor is born by the auditor doing those things which gives the pc confidence not necessarily doing the same rote thing but doing things competently talking to the pc competently handling what happens competently and carrying it on through and remaining in control of the session now i think we ought to give the auditors hand here would you do that thank you thank you and now lets give the pcs hand thank you now there are many there are many pitfalls along the way in this universe there are many sad moments there are many times when your luck is out and youre absolutely downand youve been assigned to tv demonstration its all pretty horriblebut it feels awfully good when its all over because you realize that you have actually put up presence and put up mockup and nobody has shot you absolutely dead now dont think that ive been trying to shoot you down in flames im trying to help you be good auditor so thank you very much and carry on now with verybetter session presence better tone 40 better meter reading lets get those things improved and lets get some good gains and some good wins on these cases weve got terrific processesall they need is application so lets get it done and thank you very much and good night
