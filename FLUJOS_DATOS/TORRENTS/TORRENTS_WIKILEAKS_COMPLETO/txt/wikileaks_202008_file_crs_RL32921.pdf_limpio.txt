under the 1920 federal power act fpa the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has primary responsib ility for balancing multiple water uses and evaluating licensing and relicensing applications the fpa also creates role in the licensing process for federal agen cies that are responsible for managing fisheries or federal reserva tions eg national forests specifically 4e and 18 of the fpa give certain federal agencies the authority to attach conditions to ferc licenses for example federal agencies may require applicants to build passageways for fish fishways schedul periodic water releases fo r recreation release minimum flows for fish migration or control water release rates to reduce erosion once an authorized agency issues such conditions ferc must include them in the projects license while these conditions often ge nerate environmenta l or recreational benefits they may also require cons truction expenditures and may increase generation costs by reducing operational flexibility reflecting recommendations by ferc and the hydropower industry the house included provision to alter federal agenci licenseconditioning authority in the energy policy act of 2005 hr 6 this provision would allow stakeholders to pro pose alternative license conditions and would require federal agencies to consider and accept the applicants proposed alternative if it found that the alternative 1 provides for the adequate protection nd utilization of the federal reservation or would be less protective of the fish resource than the fishway initially prescribed and 2 costs less to implement andor would result in improved operation of the project for electricity production it also requires that the secretary of the relevant conditioning agency submit written statement showing it gave equal consideration to the effects of the original and altern ative conditions on energy flood control navigation air quality and water supply response to the pending provision s been mixed while the hydropower industry supports the legislation some nvironmental organizations oppose the bill and officials within some conditioning ag encies have expressed concerns opponents of the legislation contend that it could increase relicensing time weaken environmental protections give applicants undue standing in the conditioning process and weaken fercs new integrated licensing process proponents

in matter of minutes by storing water behind dams and cont rolling water releases so hydropower facilities can generate electricity during periods of high energy demand socalled peaking power while hydropower facilities ar important sources of clean peaking power the construction and management of dams are contentious because they affect other water uses and resources dams alter ri vers by blocking downstream flows and creating reservoirs these reservoirs ma provide some recr eational and habitat benefits but they reduce river recreation nd may block the passage of migratory fish

federal government regulates the construction and operation of facilitie s that block or pollute navi gable waters through the 1920 federal power act fpa 16 usc 792 congress created the federal power commission fpc later renamed the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to license all nonfederal hydropower facilities using this authority ferc granted 30 to 50year licenses to projects located in 45 states excluding delaware hawaii mississippi north dakota and s outh dakota which have ferclicensed nonfederal dams many of the licenses for these projects were issued during the 1950s and 1960s and are now expiring in the next 10 years 199 projects or about 20 of all licensed nonfederal hydropower facilities will need new licenses to continue operating3 to help ensure that ferc licenses protect migratory fish and federally reserved lands eg lands such as indian reservati ons and national forests that are set apart by the federal government for special purpose congress created role in the licensing process for certain federal agencies the fpa requires that ferc include certain agencyestablished operating conditions in its licenses for example 18 of the fpa 16 usc 811 stipulates that the secretary of the interi or or the secretary of commerce may develop licen conditions that direct the applicant to construct and maintain passageway called fishway through which fish can travel around barriers created by the dam furthermore 4e authorizes certain department secretaries to develop license conditions for facilities located in the federal reservations they manage 16 usc

preservation or enhancemen t of recreation fede ral lands and aquatic habitat for example the secretary coul d require the applicant to schedule periodic water releases for recreation whitewater releases to release minimum quantities of water for fish migration minimum flows to control the rate of water release to reduce habitat disruption ramping requirements and to limit reservoir fluctuations to reduce erosion and maintain habitat reservoir fluctuation limits the department of the interior reports that the bureau of indian affairs bureau of reclamation national park service and bureau of nd management issued 4e conditions for 6 of the projects relicensed between 1995 and 20004 fishway provisions fpa 18 under 18 of the fpa the secretary of the interior and the secretary of commerce may require applicants to construct and operate physical structure facility or levee called fishway that allows fish to pass around barriers created by the hydropower project5 fishways provide young migratory fish with passage around the dam on their way downstream without fishway migratory fish may traverse th more dangerous passage over the dam via spill or through the projects turbines adult fish may also use fishways such as fish ladders to get past the dam on their way upstream to spawn without fishways hydropower project may block upstream mig ration to preserve and enhance fish resources the fish and wildlife service f ws issued 18 conditions for 20 of the projects relicensed between 1995 and 2000 th department of commerce through the national marine fisherie s

the relicensing process federal resource agencies establish fpa 4e and 18 license conditions by working with fercs licensing processes fercs regulations allow three licensing processes 1 structured process known as the traditional licensing process tlp 2 collaborative process known as the alternative licensing process alp and 3 new licensing process ca lled the integrated licensing process ilp that is both structured and collaborative the ilp is the default process each of these processes has two phases preapplication phase d by the applicant and ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32921crs4 7 federal energy regulatory commission final rule docket rm0216000 order 2002 at httpwwwfercgovwhatsnewcommmeet072303h1pdf 8 in some cases ferc requests additional studies after the applicant has submitted the license applicationpostapplication analys is phase led by ferc7 as described below conditioning agencies participate in both licensing phases preapplication phase for ferc and other agencies to evaluate project and develop license conditions they need information on how the project affects various resources ferc and conditioning ag encies generally obtain this information from the applicant who conducts studies before submitting license application8 specifically fercs licensing process requires an applicant to consult with stakeholders including conditioning agenci before the applicant proposes study plan the preapplication proce ss can be delayed when the applicant disagrees with the conditioning agencies about the need for or content of particular studies agencies unlike ferc do not have the aut hority to require applicants to conduct studies however agencies authority to issue license conditions does provide applicants with an incentive to resolve study disagreements prior to the recent rule making conditioning agencies and applicants could use fercs stillexisting dispute resolution service drs the dr s mediates license disputes and can call on ferc staff to help clarify issues but has authority over the outcome now based on the recent ferc rule applicants and stakeholders may first try to resolve disputes through voluntary discussions if this voluntary process fails however conditioning agencies can file for study di spute resolution when this occurs ferc convenes panel to review the dispute and make recommendation to the director of fercs office of energy projects this process may help to reduce litigation and the initiation of studies late into the licensing process for more information on this process see crs report rl31903 relicensing of nonfe deral hydroelectric projects summary and discussion of procedural reform proposals by kyna powers postapplication phase once the applicant completes the studies and submits the license application ferc evalua tes the study results and develops the license fercs role is to develop li cense that balances hydropower recreation ecological cultural and other aspects influe nced by the project this license may include conditions proposed by various resource agencies currently agencies develop license conditions th at may or may not incorporate suggestions from other stakeholders after the agency submits its conditions ferc must include them in its license unless ferc finds that the cond itions are unrelated to the agencies fpa jurisdiction if the conditions are outsi the agencies jurisdiction ferc may refuse to include them in its license key issue prompting legislative proposal s is that under the current processes applicants and other stake holders have little opportunity to contest certain agency conditions however some administrative activities ar underway in septemberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32921crs5 9 procedures for review of mandatory c onditions and prescripti ons in ferc hydropower licenses 69 fed reg 174 sept 9 2004 10 federal energy regulatory commission report to congress on hydroelectric licensing policies procedures and regulations comprehensive review and recommendations pursuant to section 603 of the energy act of 2000 washington dc may 2001 available at httpwwwfercgovlegalfercregslanddocsortc_finalpdf hereafter referred to as the section 603 report 11 us general accounting office licensing hydropower project s better time and cost data needed to reach informed decisions about process reforms gao01499 washington dc may 2 2001 2004 the department of the interior released proposed rule to establish an administrative appeals process for license applicants but other stakeholders9 another issue is the delay in the licenseconditioning process when the agency has insufficient information to evaluate the project specifically some officials within conditioning agencies have voiced concern that applicants do not always provide sufficient information in their licen applications for agencies to develop conditions in some cases agencies requested information as part of the study phase but the applicants decided not to include the studies in their study plan if study is not conducted during the pre application phase cond itioning agency may ask ferc to require that the applicant conduct the study the agency may also conduct the study itself or may issue license conditions in the absence of full information however conducting studies of ten requires significant fi nancial resources and the imposition of conditions without the underlying studies may lead to litigation therefore major goal of the proposed ilp is to resolve study disputes early in the preapplication phase cost of mandatory conditions through the relicensing process fe rc often establishes license conditions designed to preserve and enhance resources affected by hydropower projects while these conditions often generate environmenta l recreational or other benefits they may also generate costs for the applican t in 2001 ferc calculated the median cost of licenses protection mitigation and enhancement measures including state agency conditions as 246 per kilowatt k w of capacity under the tlp and as 58 per kw under the alp10 however these figures were criticized by the general accounting office now government account ability office because they are based on sample of projects that submitted their costs to ferc and not on representative sample11 license conditions may result in two types of costs fixed capital costs such as construction of installations and variable costs that arise from changes in management for example license conditi ons may require applicants to purchase or construct installations including fishways boat ramps and fish screens variable costs such as changing facility opera tions may also decrease total hydropower producti on for example minimum flow requirements white water releases or fishway releases may reduce the facilitys total generation when the water is not released through turbines according to ferc conditions placed in the license forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32921crs6 12 section 603 report 13 not all dams have storage capacity some facilities known as runofriver projects have little storage thus they depend on daily water inflows to generate hydropower 14 section 603 report 15 ibid environmental protection reduce averag annual hydropower generation by 15912 while these conditions may decrease tota l electricity generation they may also reduce the facility operators leeway to store water behind the dam for release during periods of peak demand13 if hydropower is removed from the supply of peaking power additional generation by other higher cost producer s may be required at the same time ferc estimates that efficiency improvements eg new turbines made during relicensing increase hydropower generation capacity by an average of 40614 while license c onditions generate costs for applicants the absence of conditions could cause and may already ve caused harm to other stakeholders for example operating dams without fishwa ys or minimum water releases for fish could harm fish stocks and people that enjoy or depend on fish eg native americans commercial fishermen anglers and fish consumer s similarly operating dams without constraints on reservoir fluctuations and water release rates may increase streambank and reservoirbank erosion such erosion ge nerates costs for owners of shoreline or riverfront property including taxpayer s as owners of federal lands proposed changes to the licenseconditioning process number of issues emerged as the fi rst wave of hydropower projects were relicensed throughout the 1990s these i ssues have prompted congress to hold hearings and take other actions to ex amine the licensing process the 106th congress directed ferc to conduct comprehensive re view of the policies procedures and regulations guiding the licensing process and report to congress 603 of the energy act of 2000 pl106469 ferc responde d in may 2001 with recommendations on how to reduce the length and ex pense of obtaining new license15 in addition to administrative proposals the section 603 report proposed legislative changes to the relicensing process one class of proposals focused on agencies mandatory conditioning authority for example ferc suggested that congress grant it the authority to reject or modi fy resource agencies conditi ons and that congress require agencies to better support their license conditions while the hydropower industry tends to support these ferc recommendati ons environmental organizations and some officials within federal and state agencies oppose these suggestions and any other proposed reduction in resource agencies current licensecond itioning authority opponents of fercs gislative proposal contend that administrative reforms such as fercs rule establishing the ilp and development of agencies administrative review processes are adequate to improve the relicensing process legislative proposals incorporating some of these suggestions have been introduced in congress in recent years but none has been enacted for example hydroelectric titles passed both chambers during the 107th congress hr 4 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32921crs7 16 as noted above the conference agreement did not pass by the end of the 108th congresssecuring americas future energy act passed the house august 2 2001 and the energy policy act also hr 4 passed th senate april 25 2002 this legislation was the basis of relicensing legislation proposed in the 108th congress title iii of hr 4 107th congress was incorporated into h r 6 as passed by the senate during the 108th congress title iii of hr 6 also passed the house house hr 6 t hough with substantive differences the conference agreement16 contained similar language to the housepassed bill and is the basis of legislation proposed in the 109th congress hydroelectric relicensing legislation in the 109th congress section 231 of hr 6 as passed by the house in the 109th congress focuses on federal agencies license conditioning aut hority under 4e or 18 of the fpa it would provide license applicants but not other interest groups with the opportunity for trialtype hearing on facts related to agencypr oposed license conditions it would allow all entities to pr opose alternative conditions however the conditioning agency would be required to consider lternatives proposed by applicants but other entities and accept them if the alte rnative 1 provides for the adequate protection and utilization of th federal reservation or is less protective of the fish resource than the fishway initially prescribed and 2 costs less to implement andor will improve opera tion of the project for electricity production hr 6 as passed by the house would also require the conditioning agency to justify its decision to accept or reject the alternative after giving equal consideration to broad range of factor s these factors include energy supply distribution cost and use flood control na vigation water supply and air quality in addition to the preservation of other aspects of environmental quality this section of the proposed legislation differs from some earlier versions of the bill eg the senatepassed version from the 108th congress which woul d have required the agency to include such factors in its jus tification but not to c onsider them equally hr 6 would also establish system for reviewing the agencys decision when it rejects the applicants alternative specifically it states that ferc could refer the agencys decision to its dispute resolution service drs unlike its current mediation role the proposed legislation w ould require the drs to review the facts and issue nonbinding advisory the secr etary of the conditioning agency would then reconsider his or her decision and may or may not accept the advisory discussion response to the relicensing legislation in the 109th congress is mixed the hydroelectric industry supports the legisla tion but some environmental organizations and some officials within re levant government agencies have expressed concerns while the national hydropower associati on is more supportive of hr 6 thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32921crs8 17 see for example hydropower reform coalition oppose hydropower section in the energy bill more red tape and less environmental protection available at httpwww americanriversorgsitedocserver 05fulltextandcritiquedocdocid282 18 ibidprevious bills some environmental orga nizations view the natepassed version from the 108th congress as preferable according to ferc hr 6 as passed by the house in the 108th and 109th congresses would provi accountability by making agencies justify their conditions relativ to the proposed alternatives and the conditions effects on multiple resources the hydropower industry contends that this legislation would decrease the cost of license conditions on the other hand some environmental organizations and offi cials within conditioning agencies have expressed concerns that the legislation w ould further increase the length of the relicensing process diminish environmen tal protection reduce the effectiveness of fercs new ilp and give license applicants more authority in the license conditioning process than other stakeholders17 these issues are discussed below length of process if enacted hr 6 would add additional steps to the licensing process specifically it would require that federal agencies determine whether or not proposed alternative m eets the environmental and cost criteria described above and determine how the alternative and agencies conditions affect energy supply distribution cost and us flood control navigation water supply and air quality in addition to preserving other aspects of environmental quality hr 6 would also allow license applicants to initiate trialtype hearing on issues of material fact both of these provisi ons could add an undete rmined amount of time to the licensing process hr 6 would also establish 90day process for the drs and ferc to review the agencys conditions this provision was not included in the senatepassed hr 6 from the 108th congress from the perspective expressed by indus try and ferc hr 6 as passed by the house during the 108th and 109th congresses would improve the license conditions thus justifying additional pr ocess time furthermore s upporters of the legislation contend that additional procedure on the fr ont end could decrease delays at the end of the process however some envi ronmental organizations such as the hydropower reform coalition contend that the administrative hearings called for in hr 6 could add 23 years18 to licensing process inc luding the preapplication phase intended to take 555 years furthermore so opponents of the legislation contend that the administrative appeals processes under development and the new ilp will sufficiently improve the relicensing process environmental issues under the fpa congress granted ferc the authority to issue hydropower licenses but gave federal land and water management agencies the responsibility for protecting fe deral reservations and maintaining fish resources when issuing license conditi ons to fulfill their responsibilities under 4e and 18 of the fpa conditioning agencies are not required to analyze stakeholder recommendations under hr 6 the agency must consider the alternative conditions offered by the license applican t after such consideration the agency would be required to accept the alterna tive if it found that the proposal meetshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32921crs9 19 see the hydropower reform coalitions may 6 2003 press release regarding the energy bill available at h ttp wwwamerican riversorgsitedocserver 05ggsenatefloorhydroltr docdocid283specified environmental and cost criteria eg the propos ed alternative adequately protects the resource although federal cond itioning agencies could reject an alternative condition that did not meet the bills environmental and cost criteria environmental organizations are concerned that the bill would distract agencies from their focus on protecting fish and federal reservations by re quiring them to give equal consideration to the effects on energy supply distribution cost and us flood control navigation water supply and air quality in addition to perserving other aspects of environmental quality they further contend that the agencies do not have adequate resources to conduct these additional studies supporters of th bill contend that requiring agencies to balance the multiple effects of their c onditions would help ensure that license conditions are established in the public interest while the equal consideration clause may expand the agencies focus the effect of this language on the conditions designed to protect fish and federally reserved lands would depend on how the agencies in terpret their responsibility to make sure that the alternative is less protective of fish resources or that it provides adequate protection and utilization of the reservation environmental organizations are concerned that the language contained in hr 6 which states that the alternative will be less protective of the fish resource than the fishway initially prescribed could open the door for applicants to pr opose nonfishway alternatives to fishway conditions19 for example environmental orga nizations are concerned that the legislation would allow the applicant to propose maintaining fish populations by means such as stocking the river with tchery fish environmental organizations generally find this and other mechanisms to be less successful than fishways in maintaining naturallydiver migratory fish populations however industry representatives contend that such concerns regarding the effectiveness of alternative conditions are unwarranted they conte nd that the provisions preserve agencies authority to reject alternatives which are less protective of the fish resources than the agencies alternative therefore the applicants ability to substitute other mechanisms for fishways would depend on the agencys determination of the protectiveness of the alternative effectiveness of the integrated licensing process ilp in 2004 ferc created new licensing process called the integrated licensing process ilp this process was intended to improve the licensing process by increasing ferc participation in the early phases and creating study dispute resolution mechanism environmental organizations and some offi cials within conditioning agencies assert that hr 6 could weaken the ilp by reducing incentives for applicants to engage actively in early consultations with res ource agencies specifically opponents of the legislation contend that license applicants would be less willing to consult and negotiate with resource agencies if the agencies do not have the authority to issue final license conditions conversely ferc and the hydropower industry contend that this legislation would not reduce agencies conditioning authority and thushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32921crs10 20 us congress house energy and commerce

conditioning process u n d r c u r r n t l w t h recommendations of industry and nonindustry stakeholders are given similar weight in agencies conditioning process ke concern of environm entalists and other nonutility stakeholder groups is that hr 6 would increase the applicants input relative to other stakeholders hr 6 would entitle license applicants but not other stakeholders to trialty pe hearing through which they could counter disputed factual issues related to the agencys proposed conditions furthermore hr 6 would require that agencies consider the pplicants alternative conditions but not the conditions offered by oth er interested parties20 some nonindustry stakeholders would prefer to see this section expanded to require that agencies consider alternatives offered by any stakeholder however some officials within conditioning agencies are concerned that they may have insufficient resources to consider all industryproposed alternatives in addition to other stakeholderpr oposed alternatives dispute resolution process if the secretary does not accept an applicants alternative hr 6 allows ferc to refer the dispute to its dispute resolution service drs after consultation with the secretary and the commission the drs would issue nonbinding advisory and the secretary would make final determin ation supporters of this provi sion contend that the process would help hold agencies accountable for their decisions others however point out that the drs is facilitative entity that is not currently setup to make recommendations they suggest that the administrative review processes agencies are currently developing ma be adequate or that nother process should be used eg body similar to the dispute resolu tion panels established pursuant to the final rule still others c ontend that this process which results in nonbinding dispute resolution service advisory is unnecessary and lengthens the licensing process conclusion as hr 6 moves from the house to the senate differences between hr 6 109th congress and the senatepassed version 108th congress leave multiple topics for debate in particular the housepassed bill would establish trialtype hearings for license applicants but othe r stakeholders would require agencies to consider all water resource uses equally and would create mechanism for reviewing conditioning agencies decisions while thes provisions
