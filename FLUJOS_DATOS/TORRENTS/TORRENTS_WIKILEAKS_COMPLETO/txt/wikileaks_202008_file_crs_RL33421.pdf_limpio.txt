to make grants or combinations of loans and grants to those farmers who could not qualify to repay the full amount of loan but who needed the funds to make the dwellings sa nitary or to remove health hazards to the occupants or the community while the act was initially targeted toward farmers over time the act has been amended to enable usda to make housing loans and grants to rural residents in general currently the usda housing programs are administered by the rural housing service rhs the housing programs are generally referred to by the section number under which they are authorized in the housing act of 1949 as amended in the 1970s there was concern that owners of some rhsfinanced multifamily housing were prepaying their loans and converting the property to uses other than rental occupancy by low and moderateincome families keeping federally assisted housing available for use by low and moderate income occupants is referred to as housing preservation in prior years preservation related more to maintaining or improving the physical standards of the housing but since the late 1970s preservation has related more to simply keeping the property available for use by the target population for whom it was initially constructed funding housing preservation in both senses of the word continues to be concern for congress partly because housing projects for the elderly are more acceptable to communities than low income projects in general relatively large number of projects funded through the section 515 rural rental program are elderly projects occupants who were in their 60s upon initial occupancy may have aged 10 20 or 30 years such occupants may have need for different services and these have to be financed laws have changed regarding building accessibility requirements and repairs must be made to meet those requirements these also need to be financed when the majority of the section 514 and 515 projects were originally financed the owners were required to maintain reserve of 10 of the project costs for future repairs and replacements while 10 seemed adequate 30 years ago many owners now find that these reserves are not adequate to finance needed repairs and replacements this suggests need for change in law or regulation but in the meantime the projects may need additional loans to finance repairs in response to this need pl 10997 included 9 million for the cost of demonstration program for the preservation and revitalization of section 515 housing the administrations fy2007 budget proposal however would not fund this program in fy2007 and would transfer any balances to the multifamily housing rural voucher program language would provide that subject to authorization these funds could also be used for preservation and revitalization of section 515 multifamily rental housing properties as in prior years the fy2007 budget requests funding for the section 515 program it may be argued that there would be net loss of affordab rental housing in rural areas whenever owners 1 pl 81171 october 25 1949 42 usc 1471 et seq httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33421g23g21g6g3g561g20g158g155g138g149g561g10g152g158g156g146g151g144g561g18g155g152

program though the funding has been at significantly lower levels than in the past see table 2 bill hr 5039 that was introduced in the 109th congress would have amended the housing act of 1949 to direct usda to carry out revitalization program for section 515 projects owners would have been given financial incentives to continue using their property as low to moderateincome rental but prepayment of the loans would also have been permitted if certain requirements are met descriptions of the rural housing programs are presented below in the order of the sections under which they are
