health care expenses will be so paying for health insurance on regular basis helps smooth out their outofpocket spending while health coverage continues to be mostly private enterprise in this country government plays an increasingly significant role especially during the latter half of the 20 th century the government both initiated and responded to dynamics in medicine the economy and the workplace through legislation and public policies for example the internal revenue system clarified that employer contributions to employee health benefits are exempt from taxation which encouraged the growth of employmentbased health coverage given the frequent introduction of legislation aimed at modifying or building on the current health insurance system understanding the potential impact of such proposals requires working knowledge of how health insurance is designed provided purchased and regulated this report provides background information about these topics individuals and families without health coverage are more likely than those with coverage to forgo needed health care which often leads to worse health outcomes and the need for expensive medical treatment since uninsured persons are more likely to be poor than insured persons the uninsured are less able to afford the health care they need uninsurance can lead to health care access problems for communities such as overcrowding in emergency rooms taxpayers and the nation as whole are affected through increased taxes and health care prices to cover the uncompensated care expenses of uninsured persons americans obtain health insurance in different settings and through variety of methods people may get health coverage through the private sector or from publicly funded program consumers may purchase health insurance on their own as part of an employee group or through trade or professional association however approximately 47 million americans did not have health coverage for the entire year of 2006 health insurance benefits are delivered and financed under different systems the factors that distinguish one delivery system from another are many including how health care is financed how much access to providers and services is controlled and how much authority the enrollee has to design herhis health plan to illustrate managed care is characterized by predetermined restrictions on accessing services and providers whereas individual decisionmaking regarding use of health benefits is hallmark of consumer driven health care such as health savings accounts as economic conditions change specific delivery system may gain or lose the interest of affected parties this report will be updated periodically

coverage evolved from an uncommon benefit to routine one governments role in subsidizing and regulating that cove rage also changed although health coverage continues to be mostly private enterprise in this country public entities play an increasingly significant role governments involvement in health coverage expanded dramatically in the latter half of the 20th century longstanding rule issued by the internal revenue service irs stated that an employers contributions to employmentbased health insurance could not be included in an employees gross income for tax purposes internal revenue code section 106 this ruling helped spur the growth of employersponsored health benefits the irs also stated separately that employers could deduct such contributions as part of business expenses advances in medicine led to escalating consumer demand for newer better treatments at the same time the cost of some treatments increased which was especially problematic for certain groups of consumers who lacked health coverage this led to government efforts to assist health care consumers in paying for medical services through social insurance programs 1 more and more employees began to work for more than one employer over their lifetimes government was called on to address problem many workers faced keeping health coverage as workers moved from job to job given the frequent introduction of legislation aimed at modifying or building on the current health insurance system understanding the potential impact of such proposals requires working knowledge of how health insurance is designed

magnitude of financial loss in any type of insurance arrangement all parties seek to minimize their own risk in health insurance consumers and insurers approach the management of insurance risk differently from the consumers point of view person or family buys health insurance for protection against financial losses resulting from the future use of medical care from the insurers point of view it employs variety of methods to minimize the risk it takes on when providing health coverage to consumers to assure that it operates profitable business one method is to cover only those expenses arising from predefined set of services generally called covered services another method for limiting risk is to encourage healthie r people to obtain health coverage presumably because healthier people would not need as many medical services as sicker people leading to fewer claims that the insurer would have to cover while the methods employed by an insurer differ from those of consumer each has the same goal to minimize risk in an uncertain future it is this uncertainty of the future and risk of financial loss which form the context for insurance and the strategies to make financial loss more predictable and manageable which drive insurance arrangements

consumers are responsible for majority of expenses according to longitudinal study conducted by the federal agency for healthcare research and quality 5 of the population accounted for about half of all health expenditures in 2002 and 10 of the population accounted for nearly twothirds of expenditures in the same year2 given the unevenness of health care spending and the improbability of identifying all of the highest spenders before they use medical services insurers employ various strategies in order to minimize the risk they take on

insurance when people contribute to common pool risk pool an amount at least equal to the expected cost resulting from use of covered services by the group as whole in this way the actual costs of health services used by few people are spread over the entire group this is the reason why insuring larger groups is considered less riskythe more individuals participating in risk pool the less likely that the serious medical experiences of one or few persons will result in catastrophic financial loss for the entire pool an insurer calculates and charges rate ie premium in order to finance the health coverage it provides the premium reflects several factors including the expected cost of claims for health care use in year administrative expenses associated with running the plan and profit margin if the insurer accurately estimates future costs and sets appropriate premium levels then that risk pool has reached equilibrium where premiums paid by healthy persons in the risk pool help subsidize the higherthanaverage costs of lesshealthy persons in the pool 2 mark w stanton the high concentration of u s health care expenditures research in action issue 19 june 2006 at

the ways insurers attempt to make future costs more predictable is by spreading the risk of few highcost individuals across many people but the number of people in risk pool is not the only significant factor equally as important if not more so is the composition of the group consumers decision to obtain health coverage is based on variety of factors such as individual health status estimated need for future medical care and disposable income consumers with different health conditions as well as varying degrees of comfort towards risk taking will differ on whether they consider health insurance necessary this is circumstance that insurers will consider when estimating their expenses to cover future health care use with this in mind insurers generally will vary the premiums they charge and the health services they cover subject to state and federal statues in order to attract various segments of the population this flexibility in rate setting and benefit determination is particularly important in competitive insurance market where insurers try to provide the most attractive rates to increase their market share however some risk pools do attract disproporti onate share of unhealthy individuals in part this is because individuals generally know more about their own health conditions than anyone else including an insurer therefore health care consumers have an advantage over insurers in terms of knowing the kind and amount of health services they will use at least in the short to midterm this information asymmetry between what consumers know compared to what insurers know gives consumers an advantage when looking for health coverage that will meet their future demand for health care for example if consumer plans on obtaining orthodontic care in the near future that consumer will look for health plan with generous dental benefits information asymmetry is another source of uncertainty that insurers take into account when developing and pricing insurance products when disproportionate share of unhealthy people make up risk pool phenomenon known as adverse selection the cost for each person in the pool rises the higher costs may encourage the departure of healthier members from the group and discourage the entrance of other healthy people since healthier people may be able to find cheaper coverage elsewhere or decide that coverage is too costly and become uninsured in either situation it leaves an even less healthy group of people in the risk pool which again causes the cost to rise for the remaining participants if there is change in this dynamic the group may experience death spiral as it suffers substantial adverse selection leading to an increasingly expensive risk pool and possibly dissolution of the pool altogether therefore despite the consumers information advantage it does not guarantee access to affordable and adequate health coverage

health insurance can be provided to groups of peop that are drawn together by an employer or other organization such as trade union such groups are generally formed for some purpose other than obtaining insurance like employment when insurance is provided to group it is referred to as group coverage or group insurance in the group market the entity that purchases health insurance on behalf of group is referred to as the plan sponsor consumers who are not associated with group can obtain health coverage by purchasing it directly from an insurer in the individual or nongroup insurance

insurability an applicant usually must provide the insurer with an extensive medical history and often undergo physical exam this information is used by carriers to assess the potential medical claims for each person by comparing characteristics of the applicant to the loss experience of others with similar characteristics once such an evaluation has been conducted the carrier decides whether or not to provide health coverage and determines the terms for coverage this evaluation and determination process is referred to as medical underwriting medical underwriting is standard practice in the individual insurance market though carriers ability to reject applicants or vary the terms of coverage are restricted to some degree by federal and state requirements in the group health insurance market insurers forgo underwriting in the traditional sense ie reviewing each persons demographics and medical history instead an insurer looks at the characteristics of the collective group such as its claims history group demographics and geographic location the insurer then charges premium based on the analysis of the groups characteristics there are exceptions to this for very small groups for example when firm with only handful of em ployees applies for health coverage the insurer may choose to review the health conditions of each person in order to establish premium for the entire group or the insurer may charge larger premium due to the larger risk attributed to smaller groups if permitted under law 3

products is whether they are fully insured or selfinsured fully insured health plan is one in which the plan sponsor purchases health coverage from statelicensed insurer th carrier assumes the risk of providing health benefits to the sponsors enrolled members in contrast organizations who self insure or self fund do not purchase health coverage from statelicensed insurers selfinsured plans refer to health coverage that is provided directly by the organization seeking coverage for its members eg firm providing health benefits to its employees such organizations directly take on the risk for covering medical expenses and such benefit plans are not subject to state insurance regulations firms that self fund typically contract with thirdparty administrators tpas to handle administrative duties such as member services premium collection and utilization review tpas do not underwrite insurance risk

person or family under selfonly coverage the holder of the insurance policy is the only person insured selfonly coverage is also called individual coverage individual coverage in this sense should not be confused with health coverage from the individual insurance marketsee discussion above family coverage applies to the policyholder herhis spouse and children 4 selfonly and family policies may

expenses include costs associated with contracting with providers sales and marketing enrollment and billing customer service utilization review case management and other functions because of economies of scale administrative expenses in the group market are smaller portion of overall costs compared to those in the nongroup market5 g22g138g161g561g18g155g142g143g142g155g142g151g140g142g561 unlike most industrialized countries the united states does not guarantee health coverage to all of its citizens instead it relies on patchwork approach that combines private and public means for providing health insurance and health care one of the key pieces of this approach encouraged the growth of employmentbased health coverage via the tax code section 106 of the internal revenue code stat that employer contributions to employment based health insurance are not included in workers gross incomes for tax purposes this tax preference encourages workers to sign up for takeup health coverage within the work setting separate ruling by the internal revenue service clarified that such employer contributions are business expenses and therefore deductible from employers taxable income both parties benefit employers use health insurance coverage as means to recruit and retain workers while workers typically get access to more services at better rates see discussion below however workers generally receive reduced wages to compensate for richer benefits the tax exclusion of health benefits is one of the primary reasons why health insurance coverage is provided mainly through the workplace in the united states approximately two out of three nonelderly under 65 americans have employersponsored insurance moreover of nonelderly persons with private health coverage approximately nine out of 10 obtain it through the workplace 6 g10g142g138g149g157g145g561g11g151g156g158g155g138g151g140g142g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 health insurance regulation addresses wide variety of issues the benefits that must be offered the individuals to whom the insurance is made available and the responsibilities insurers have to plan enrollees to name few one of the most contentious issues regarding health insurance regulation is whether it is the responsibility of individual states or the federal government this distinction is important because federal and state laws governing health plans differ on issues such as patient compensation in courts consumer access to care and mandated coverage for certain benefits 5 given that insurers monitor administrative costs as part of managing their businesses such information is considered proprietary therefore there are reliable national estimates of the portion of insurers expenses attributable to administrative functions 6 paul fronstin sources of health insurance and characteristics of the uninsured analysis of the march 2006 current population survey ebri issue brief 2897 october 2006 at

clarified by the 1945 mccarranferguson act however overlapping federal requirements complicate the matter with respect to health insurance individual states have established standards and regulations overseeing the business of insurance including requirements related to the finances management and business practices of an insurer for example all states have laws that require statelicensed

these federal laws the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa pl 93406 and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa pl 104191 have significant impact on how health insurance is provided erisa outlines minimum federal standards for privatesector employersponsored benefits public employee benefits and plans sponsored by churches are exempt from erisa passed in response to abuses in the private pension system the act was developed with focus on pensions but the law applies to long list of welfare benefits including health insurance the act requires that funds be handled prudently and in the best interest of beneficiaries participants be informed of their rights and there be adequate disclosure of plans financial activities erisa preempts state laws that relate to employee benefit plans in other words the federal law overrides state laws affecting privatesector employee benefits this portion of erisa was designed to ensure that plans would be subject to the same benefit laws across all states partly in consideration of firms that operate in multiple states however state laws still apply for issues which involve the business of insurance the delineation of issues attributable to the phrases relate to and business of insurance is not clear and have led to longstanding debates and active litigation over the scope of erisa preemption 7 the core motivation behind the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa is to address the concern that insured persons have about losing their coverage if they switch jobs or change health plans portability of health coverage the acts health insurance provisions established federal requirements on private and public employersponsored health plans and insurers it ensures the availability and renewability of coverage for certain employees and other persons under specified circumstances hipaa limits the amount of time that coverage for preexisting medical conditions can be excluded and prohibits discrimination on the basis of health statusrelated factors the act also includes tax provisions designed to encourage the expansion of health coverage through several mechanisms such as authorizing taxadvantaged medical savings accounts and graduated increase of the portion of premiums selfemployed persons may deduct from their federal income tax calculations

coverage is not necessary to obtain health care it is useful mechanism for accessing services in an environment of increasingly expensive health care as health care costs continue to rise more people need greater assistance with covering medical expenses health insurance provides some measure of prot ection for consumers especially those who have limited means or greaterthanaverage need for medical care health insurance is considered important also because of the welldocumented farreaching consequences of uninsurance for instance uninsured persons are more likely to forgo needed health care than people with health coverage this includes forgoing services for preventable or chronic conditions which often leads to worse health outcomes 12 uninsured persons also are less likely to have usual source of care that is person or place identified as the source to which the patient usually goes for health services or medical advice not including emergency rooms having usual source is important because peop who establish ongoing relationships with health care providers or facilities are more likely to access preventive health services and have regular visits with physician compared with individuals without usual source13 therefore to the extent that health insurance coverage facilitates access to basic medical services people without coverage face substantial barriers in the pursuit of the health care they need for 200304 8 for more information about hipaa see crs report rl31634 the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa of 1996 overview and gu idance

identified usual source of care compared with around 49 of uninsured nonelderly adults who reported usual source14 the negative consequences of uninsurance extends beyond the persons directly involved the institute of medicine found that the insurance status of parents affects the amount of health care their children receive15 in locations with crowded emergency rooms rising uninsurance rates can exacerbate that problem since uninsured persons have fewer places from which they can get medical services compared to people with health coverage overcrowding in emergency departments in turn leads to longer waits for all patients seeking emergency care moreover many uninsured persons forgo preventive health care and end up developing more serious conditions requiring complex expensive medical services since health coverage is positively related to income uninsured persons are less likely to be able to afford this level of care in cases where patients are unable to cover the costs associated with receiving health services the facilities that provided those services must take it as financial loss ie uncompensated care these losses can be staggering for example one study estimated that health care providers would provide nearly 41 billion worth of uncompensated care to the uninsured in 2004 16 ultimately though the costs for caring for the uninsured are passed down to all taxpayers and consumers of health care in the form of higher taxes and higher prices for services and insurance17 taxpayers are affected because the federal government makes payments to hospitals which take into account the share of poor people treated the assumption is that facilities that treat larger proportion of poor people have greater problem with uninsurance and uncompensated care the federal government also provides grants to many health centers and other facilities that serve poor communities in addition states and localities fund local health programs public hospitals and clinicsfacilities that generally serve an uninsured or medically underserved population health care consumers are affected by uninsurance because in order for physician practices and hospitals to survive financially they have to makeup the losses they sustain hospitals and physicians may raise rates for certain services or discontinue unprofitable programs in order to recoup those losses thereby affecting consumers pocketbooks and access to services uninsurance then has negative health and financial consequences for uninsured persons their families communities and the nation as whole

years most americans did not have health coverage until the latter half of the 20th century19 the demand for more workers during world war ii and wage freeze imposed by the national war labor board generated great interest in employersponsored insurance esi as worker recruitment and retention tool20 buoyed by legislation and court rulings declaring the tax exemption of fringe benefits and support from unions for workbased coverage health insurance became pervasive employment benefit in employersponsored insurance risk pools may be comprised of active workers dependents and retirees insurers use number of strategies to increase the likelihood that each risk pool includes good proportion of healthy individuals thus avoiding adverse selection for instance insurers may restrict employees opportunities to takeup health coverage or switch health plans by designating specific time frame each year for such activities open enrollment period this strategy decreases the likelihood that people will game the system by taking up coverage only when they plan on using health services eg for pregnancy and birth and dropping coverage when they longer plan to access care insurers also may require the employer to enroll certain proportion of the firms eligible population assuming that the eligible population consists of good percentage of healthy people requiring certain proportion of all eligibles to enroll leads to an enrollee population which contains at least some healthy people employers 18 us census bureau income poverty and health insurance coverage in the united states

for example employers usually pay part or in very few instances all of the total premium this practice makes health coverage more attractive benefit even to those who do not plan to use medical services on regular basis g3g141g159g138g151g157g138g144g142g156g561 esi plans retain enrollees better than the indi vidual health insurance market as previously mentioned health benefits provided at the workplace are exempt from income and employment taxes encouraging the growth and continuity of employersponsored health insurance large risk pools with good proportion of healthy enrollees tend to be more stable than small pools or those with higher proportion of unhealthy enrollees given the strategies discussed above to discourage adverse selection insurers assume that esi poolsparticularly large diverse ones are relatively stable generally this translates into less volatile costs and better premiums overall in the group market compared to the nongroup market also large esi groups can use their size to negotiate for better benefits and lower costsharing in contrast to individual applicants in the nongroup market plan sponsors negotiate and interact with insurers on behalf of all of their insured members unlike in the individual mark et where each consumer must deal with the insurance carrier directly in order to apply for and purchase coverage in addition there are economies of scale for enrollees in the group market compared to the nongroup market for administrative functions such as sales billing and customer service for these reasons workers and their families benefit from receiving coverage through the workplace for plan sponsors the main advantage is to use health benefits for recruitment and retention of workers this is particularly appealing in growing economysuch as during most of the 1990swhen there may be high demand for workers g6g146g156g138g141g159g138g151g157g138g144g142g156g561 while there are many advantages to obtaining esi coverage there are challenges as well from the vantage point of the enrollee one of the biggest disadvantages is the general lack of portability because esi coverage is tied to the job and not the person any change in employment such as going from fulltime to parttime status or changing jobs may alter the health care providers or services to which the worker has access or disrupt health coverage altogether also in firms that offer health coverage there is trade off made between wages and benefits for workers who do not take up health insurance from those firms they end up accepting lower wages for set of benefits they do not use from the perspective of the sponsor an underlying challenge is the lack of enrollee awareness of the true costs of health care because the sponsor contributes to the cost of the premium enrollees do not bear the full cost of obtaining health coverage also enrollees generally do not have to cover the entire cost of the services they use since sponsors negotiate for lower rates and better costsharing arrangements from insurers consumers enrolled in managed care plans particularly are shielded from health cares true costs some observers contend that this lack of cost awareness gives little incentive to consumers to utilize medical services prudently which leads to greater use of services and greater overall health care expenditures in addition sponsors efforts to constrain their health care spendingby increasing the employee share of the premium or costsharingare made even more difficult to justify or implement finally from the perspective of the federal budget the tax exclusion of employersponsored health insurance represents lost source for treasury funds the joint

of large and small groups the underlying reason for this distinction is rooted in the inverse relationship between insurance risk and group size ie the risk associated with group grows as the size of the group shrinks this concept affects employers offers of health benefits for instance very large employer often is able to offer multiple health plan options to its members eg the federal employee health benefit program fehbp large business can leverage its size to get more comprehensive set of benefits in contrast small employers are less able to provide health coverage at all because of the greater risk associated with small groups even when small employers do offer coverage the benefits are often limited small employers also are much less likely to selffund health coverage since there is smaller pool for spreading risk and protecting against catastrophic loss furthermore such firms generally do not have the necessary administrative capacity to negotiate with multiple provider groups and handle all the daytoday operational functions it is conditions such as these which prompt legislators to develop proposals for expanding small group participation in health insurance for example by establishing association health plans and opening up fehbp to the small group market association health plans are just one example among the spectrum of entities which bring groups of people together for the purpose of buying health insurance these entities include trade and professional associations that offer health coverage to their members associationsponsored plans and small firms that band together to purchase coverage as group health insurance purchasing cooperatives the premise behind group purchasing arrangements is to decrease the administrative burden on and increase the negotiating capacity of participants who cannot afford to offer or purchase coverage on their own around onethird of small firms buy health coverage through some type of purchasing pool

2006 34 states had high risk pools with participation of nearly 193000 enrollees 29 while health benefits vary across states and plans they generally reflect coverage that is available in the private

multiple private and public sources of health insurance millions of americans are without health coverage in 2006 nearly 47 million people were without health insurance coverage for the entire year for the vast majority of the uninsured they lack coverage because they cannot access coverage eg their employer does not offer health insurance as an employment benefit or they cannot afford it uninsurance is characterized as problem of the under65 population given nearuniversal coverage of seniors through medicare the nonelderly uninsured population differs from the insured population on number of key demogr aphic factors one of the most striking characteristics of persons who lack coverage is that significant proportion are in lowincome families for instance among all uninsured persons under age 65 more than half were in poor or near poor families in 2006 31 moreover among nonelderly persons who are poor 34 lacked health coverage this proportion is almost triple the share of nonelderly individuals with moderatehigh incomes who had health insurance 12 defining characteristic of the nonelderly uninsur ed population is that 82 are persons with ties to the paid labor force or dependents of such persons even more surprising is that 57 of the nonelderly uninsured were workers with fulltime fullyear status or the dependents of those workers while such findings may be counterintuitive there are multiple reasons why employed persons and their families may lack health coverage for example worker may be offered health insurance by hisher employer but declines it because heshe thinks it is too expensive an employee may work for small firm which is less likely than large firm to offer health insurance as benefit lowwage employee even working full time is less likely to be offered health insurance at work and less likely to be able to afford it than higherwage workers in the same firm finally healthy worker may be willing to take on the risk of being uninsured and choose not to purchase insurance at all so despite the dominance of employersponsored health insurance the dynamics of work insurance risk and financial resources intersect to impede the coverage of all workers and their families the problem of the uninsured is an ongoing concern to many policymakers and legislators one of the topics of ongoing debate is the overall num ber of uninsured individuals and the direction of the uninsurance rate these issues have generated some controversy over dueling analyses which show slightly different and sometimes moderately different findings 32 but despite the forceful discussions regarding trends in uninsurance th yeartoyear changes in the uninsurance rate actually are small for example from 1987 to 2006 the change in the uninsurance rate from year to year has been less than 1 33 nonetheless tens of millions of americans were without coverage during that time period such circumstances beg the questions why does pervasive uninsurance persist even during the robust economy of the mid1990s and what are the implications for legislation and public policies to expand health coverage 31 the poverty level for family

g8g146g151g138g151g140g142g141g501g561 given the complexity of the health care system overall it is surprise that health benefits are delivered and financed through different arrangements those arrangements vary due to numerous factors such as how health care is financed how much access to providers and services are controlled and how much authority the enrollee has to design herhis health plan while delivery systems may share certain characteristics general distinctions can be made based on payment access and other critical variables

whom to seek health services if the services the enrollee receives are covered under hisher insurance the enrollee or the enrollees provider files claim with the insurer thus insurers make payments retrospectively ie after the health services have been rendered up to the maximum amounts specified for each covered service in this model of health care delivery the financing of health services and the obtaining of those services are kept separate this bifurcated arrangement was unquestioned for time but as medical costs began to rise sometimes faster than other sectors of the national economy many observers criticized this delivery model as contributing to increasing expenses because providers were compensated on feeforservice basis some argued that providers were not given incentives to provide efficient health care in fact some critics accused health care practitioners and institutions of providing an overabundance of health care in order to generate greater revenue by the early 1970s legislators analysts and others expressed considerable interest in alternative models such as managed care models with cost control as key feature g15g138g151g138g144g142g141g561g5g138g155g142g561 while managed care means different things to different people several key characteristics set it apart from traditional indemnity insurance one of the main differences is that the service delivery and financing functions are integrated under managed care managed care organizations mcos employ various techniques to control costs and manage health service use prospectively among those techniques are restricting enrollee access to certain providers innetwork providers requiring primarycarephysician approval for access to specialty care gatekeeping coordinating care for persons with certain conditions disease management or case management and requiring prior authorization for routine hospital inpatient care pre certification mcos may offer different types of health plans that vary in the degree to which cost and medical decisionmaking is controlled as consequence enrollee costsharing also varies generally the more tightly managed plan is the less the premium charged other distinguishing features of the managed care approach include an emphasis on preventive health care and implementation of quality assurance processes managed care was touted as the antidote to rapidly rising health care costs starting with the passage of federal legislation in the 1970s which supported the growth of managed care specifically in the form of health maintena nce organizations hmos the number of mcos httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32237g10g142g138g149g157g145g561g11g151g156g158g155g138g151g140g142g497g561g3g561g18g155g146g150g142g155g561 g561

led to decreases in premiums in order to gain market share with high medical inflation in the 1980s and early 1990s enrollees flocked to these lesscostly managed care plans by the mid1990s more insured workers were enrolled in hmos than any other health plan type and health insurance premiums had stabilized but in the latter half of the 1990s backlash of sorts against managed care grew34 some enrollees had grown weary of provider and service restrictions many mcos that had increased market share through artificiallylow premiums began to raise them in order to increase revenue35 consumers and others accused the managed care industry of caring more about controlling costs than providing health care some providers resented the role managed care played in medical decisionmaking many enrollees began to leave hmos the industry responded by developing insurance products that were lesstightly managed but more costly some traditional hmos widened their provider networks and eliminated the gatekeeping function while employers began to offer plan types that were less tightly managed such as preferred provider organizations ppos in fact by the end of the 1990s more people with work based health coverage were enrolled in ppos than in hmos 36 as the influence of managed care waned and health care costs began to rise at an increasing pace during the late 1990s the impact on consumers began to be felt for example in the employment setting employers absorbed the extra costs at first in order to recruit and retain workers during the booming economy of the mid to late 1990s 37 but as the economy soured employers began to pass these expenses along to enrollees in the form of greater costsharing38

belief by some observers that the age of managed care was over they began to search for alternatives consumer driven or consumerdirected health care have been offered as one such option consumer driven health care refers to broad spectrum of approaches that give incentives to consumers to control their use of health services andor ration their own health benefits in the workplace at one extreme employers may choose to provide an array of insurance products from which workers can choose while at the other end an employer could increase wages but not offer any health coverage allowing workers to decide how to spend that extra money to meet their 34 richard kronick waiting for godot wishes and worries in managed care journal of health politics policy and law vol 24 5 october 1999 pp

approach varies in the degree to which consumers are responsible for health care decisionmaking39 for example one health benefits option that is at the heart of discussions about consumer driven care is the health savings account hsa under this approach the consumer is responsible for management of the account hsas are investment accounts in which contributions earn interest tax free consumers their employers or both may make contributions to hsas consumers withdraw funds on taxfree basis to cover medi cal expenses not covered by health insurance unused contributions roll over to the next year hsas must be paired with highdeductible health plans if the hsa funds are exhausted and the deductible level has not been reached the consumer is responsible for covering that gap once the consumers spending reaches the deductible level then coverage from the highdeductible plan takes effect hsas received legislative boost when they were authorized in november 2003 by the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 pl 108173 40 while consumer driven health care can take on many forms the premise common to all of the approaches is that by making enrollees more responsible for their own health care it creates incentives for people to use services prudently the expectation is that greater costconsciousness on the part of consumers will result in lower overall health costs in essence the service and cost control functions administered by mcos and providers under managed care shifts to enrollees under the consumer driven health care scenario proponents of consumer directed plans assert the merit in having people take increased responsibility for their own health care use and expenses they predict that this approach will lead to betterinformed consumers more appropriate use of health services and lower overall spending on health care opponents express concern that this approach does not recognize the possible range of health conditions in an enrolled population they argue that these plans benefit the young and healthy who use relatively few services and therefore would not need to expend great deal of time and energy making these health care decisions however these plans impose greater burden on individuals with moderate to severe health conditions because of their greater thanaverage use of medical services
