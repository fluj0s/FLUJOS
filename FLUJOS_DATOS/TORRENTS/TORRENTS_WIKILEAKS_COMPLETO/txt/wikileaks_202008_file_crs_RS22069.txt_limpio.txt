what is suta dumping the term suta dumping refers to variety of tax planning strategies federal unemployment taxes federal tax of 62 on the first 7000 of used by employers to minimize state workers wages 434 per worker is levied on unemployment taxes the strategies employers the employer however receives exploit the variation in the effective federal tax credit of up to 54 378 of the unemployment tax rates among workers wages for state unemployment taxes employers may have state unemployment tax employers and the methods states rate that is less than 378 that may be credited

the federal absorbed other firms unemployment government receives up to 56 per covered taxes are levied on employers based on worker from employers combination of established rates and state unemployment taxes state tax the employers past history with the uc rates and base wages are determined by wildly system generally employers that have variable state law in 2004 the wage base ranged had greater number of unemployed from 7000 11 states to 27100 alaska three states alaska new jersey and workers in the past have lower rating pennsylvania also tax employees to finance the and would pay higher uc taxes uc fund most states augment the base funding formula through expanding the taxable wage base recently congress passed the increasing tax rates andor levying special fund suta dumping prevention act of 2004 fees in addition all states use an experience rating to adjust an employer contribution to better pl 108295 which is intended to end reflect the employers potential reliance on the or at least significantly curtail suta fund new firms those with past dumping suta dumping occurs when unemployment experience may be levied lower employers that pay relatively high uc tax rate less than the 54 but not less than 1 taxes dump workers into an affiliated than employers with more experience employer with lower uc taxes the legality of suta dumping schemes varies depending on state laws according to government accountability office gao survey over half of the state administrators felt that suta dumping resulted in lost state unemployment tax revenue administrators most often cited the employee leasing industry hospitality industry and construction industry as engaging in suta dumping practices3 1 the fua is an account from which advances are made to depleted state trust fund accounts to ensure that uc benefit obligations are met 2 the district of columbia puerto rico and the virgin islands are considered to be states 3 us congress house committee on ways and means subcommittee on oversight and continued crs3 the state unemployment tax rate of an employer is in most states based on the amount of uc paid to former employees generally in most states the more uc benefits paid to its former employees the higher the tax rate of the employer up to maximum established by state law4 the experience rating is intended to ensure an equitable distribution of uc program taxes among employers and encourage stable workforce the variation of experience rates creates the opportunities for strategic tax minimization behavior such as suta dumping currently four experience rating systems are used by states to establish an employers experience rating reserve ratio benefit ratio benefitwage ratio and payroll variation each system is intended to fairly distribute the burden based on an employers unemployment history the focus here will be on the reserve ratio rr and benefit ratio br systems because 30 and 17 states respectively use these systems5 how these tax rates are determined when employers merge or new employers acquire predecessor firms are the basis of most suta dumping cases reserve ratio 30 states dc pr and vi the most common formula is the reserve ratio each employers rate is calculated as the contributions less uc benefits httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22069 paid divided by payroll stated differently it is the employers historical net uc balance divided by total payroll most states require employers to use all past years when calculating the experience rating using all past years tends to minimize the volatility in the ratio resulting from business cycle fluctuations benefit ratio 17 states the second most common formula is the benefit ratio the employers tax rate under the br system is calculated as the uc benefits paid divided by total payroll in contrast to the rr system the br system uses the most recent experience typically the previous three years to establish the tax rate the emphasis on more recent experience makes the br system more sensitive to the business cycle the procyclical nature of the br system uc taxes increase when uc benefits paid increase may impede economic recovery employer experience rating transfers according to the us department of labor dol the transfer of case records necessitated by firm acquisition and mergers is automatic in most states6 acquiring firms simply incorporate the predecessors case 3 continued subcommittee on human resources testimony of robert j cramer managing director office of special investigations government accountability office

years of uc program experience federal law allows states to make new firms eligible for reduced rates after one year federal law also allows states to offer new employers reduced rate immediately however the rate must be at least 1 5 the district of columbia puerto rico and the virgin islands all use the reserveratio system delaware and oklahoma use the benefitwageratio and alaska uses the payroll variation system please refer to us department of labor comparison of state unemployment insurance laws 2005 chapter 2 page 9 for description of the other two systems 6 us department of labor comparison of state unemployment insurance laws 2003 chapter continued crs4 records when determining the appropriate experience tax rate variation among the states occurs in the treatment of transferred employees and how new employers are taxed this generates opportunities for strategic tax planning like suta dumping methods of suta dumping there are three basic methods for engaging in suta dumping vertical horizontal and acquired rate brief description of each method follows below create new business vertical method an employer with high level of uc use can minimize the impact of poor uc experience rating and accompanying higher uc taxes by setting up new company and gradually transferring some or all of its workforce and accompanying payroll to the new company with its lower new firm uc tax rate the dol office of the inspector general found this to be typical method for the employee leasing firms in one state it found it to cause major losses to the states utf7 transfer payroll to subsidiary horizontal method firms move httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22069 employees from one unit that has experienced sizable layoffs to different unit with relatively lower rate of layoffs reducing the unemploymenttax bill over time as employees continue to be transferred the first unit would be eliminated along with the high turnover rate that boosted unemployment taxes purchasing an existing business acquired rate method under this scheme new business purchases an existing small business with low uc tax rate however the acquisition is not for legitimate business reasons but rather is shell transaction designed to lower the firms uc tax rate this strategy exploits the existing businesss tax rate that is lower than the states new business tax rate the newly formed entity receives the predecessors lower rate the new business often does not engage in substantially the same business activity as the predecessor business what is currently in place to detect and minimize suta dumping presently states detect potential suta dumping schemes by manually reviewing employer tax records the dol developed an automated suta dumping detection system in pilot program where seven states8 were selected for testing according to dol9 the testing is complete and the detection system ready to be distributed to the states the automated detection system extracts information from tax files produces 6 continued 2 pp 2427 7 us department of labor office of inspector general unemployment insurance integrity fraud and vulnerabilities in the system 1p033150001pe mar 31 1999 p 7 at

administration on may 17 2005 crs5 prioritized list of employers estimates the potential loss of uc revenue and creates report for further investigation states received information on how to submit supplementary budget request for implementing the detection system and the requests are due in june 2005 states have variety of measures in place to minimize suta dumping according to the gao in 2003 21 state uc administrators reported that their programs have laws specifically addressing suta dumping twentynine state administrators indicated that they have laws addressing suta dumping but seven of them felt that those laws were inadequate approximately twofifths of the administrators indicated that their states are adequately addressing the problem or that they do not know of any suta dumping in their states10 the manner in which states treat new successor and predecessor firms may deter suta dumping in the gao survey uc administrators in 20 states reported that other state laws often those dealing with employer succession adequately address suta dumping practices these states cite their employer succession laws as protection against such practices because they require the transfer of experience ratings from one company httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22069 to successor company when ownership or management is substantially the same11 listed below are the administrative considerations that states indirectly use to address the forms of suta dumping new firms federal requirements do not allow an experience rating to be granted unless the state has at least oneyear record of the employers experience without such record there would be basis for rate determination however states are allowed to give new firms new firm experience rating that may be lower than the expected tax for the firm perhaps because it is in an industry that has high use of the uc system successor firms most states have statutes or regulations that determine the rate to be assigned the successor employer from the date of the transfer to the end of the rate year in which the transfer occurs the rate assignments vary with the length of time since the acquisition of the firm over half of the states require that an employer who has rate based on actual uc experience must continue to pay that rate for the remainder of the rate year if the predecessor firm had much higher unemployment tax rate this may encourage suta dumping other states assign new rate based on combination of the employers experience and the acquired firms experience predecessor firms addresses acquiredrate method all state laws specify the conditions under which the experience rating of predecessor employer may be transferred to an acquiring employer in some states the authorization for transfer of the rating is limited to total transfers ie the record may be transferred only if single successor employer acquires the predecessors organization and substantially all of its assets other states authorize partial as well as total transfers where the proportion of the predecessors record that pertains to the acquired portion of the business may be transferred to the successor some states condition the transfer of the experience rating on what happens to the business after it is acquired by the successor for example in 10 gao 2003 11 ibid crs6 some states there can be transfer if the enterprise acquired is not continued in three of these states12 the successor must employ substantially the same workers new requirements to limit suta dumping the suta dumping prevention act pl 108295 the suta dumping prevention act requires that states develop standards for employee transfers and impose penalties on firms and advisory groups that promote suta dumping techniques as tax avoidance tool and to impose meaningful penalties on those firms and people who either advise or implement suta dumping schemes pl 108295 permits states to use certain information in the national directory of new hires from the social security administration in the administration of federal and state uc laws13 pl 108295 also requires the us secretary of dol to submit to the congress not later than july 15 2007 report that 1 assesses the statute and appropriateness of state actions to meet its new requirements and 2 recommends any further congressional action that the secretary considers necessary to improve the effectiveness of the amendments14 in the unemployment insurance program letter no3004 dol provided draft legislative language for the states that dol felt would comply with the intent of pl 10829515 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22069 the changes in the state laws are expected to be complete by the end of fy2006 states generally have followed dol guidelines although there is variation according to dol16 the following states have enacted legislation arizona arkansas california georgia idaho indiana kansas kentucky michigan mississippi montana new mexico north dakota south carolina south dakota utah virginia washington and wyoming as of may 16 2005 seven additional state legislatures colorado florida hawaii maryland nevada oklahoma and oregon have passed suta dumping legislation but the legislation has not been signed by the respective governors 12 california district of columbia and wisconsin 13 the office of the inspector general of dol found the new hire detection system is more effective and efficient than the earlier crossmatch system in identifying uc overpayments that occur when uc claimants fail to report earnings while simultaneously working and claiming benefits most but not all states now use the new hire detection system the report also recommended that dol encourage state uc programs to access the ndnh and coordinate efforts with the department of health and human services and the state uc programs to accomplish full integration us department of labor office of inspector general office of audit unemployment insurance benefit payment control new hire detection is better method for establishing ui overpayments than the wageui benefit crossmatch 050400203315 sept 30 2004 see httpwwwoigdolgovpublicreportsoa2004050400203315pdf 14 see section 2b
