07122017 tags pgov prel zi subject the end is nigh classified by ambassador christopher w dell under section 14bd 1 c having said my piece repeatedly over the last three years i wont offer lengthy prescription for our zimbabwe policy my views can be stated very simply as stay the course and prepare for change our policy is working and its helping to drive change here what is required is simply the grit determination and focus to see this through then when the changes finally come we must be ready to move quickly to help consolidate the new dispensation the situation 2 c robert mugabe has survived for so long because he is more clever and more ruthless than any other politician in zimbabwe to give the devil his due he is brilliant tactitian and has long thrived on his ability to abruptly change the rules of the game radicalize the political dynamic and force everyone else to react to his agenda however he is fundamentally hampered by several factors his ego and belief in his own infallibility his obsessive focus on the past as justification for everything in the present and future his deep ignorance on economic issues coupled with the belief that his 18 doctorates give him the authority to suspend the laws of economics including supply and demand and his essentially shortterm tactical style 3 c while his tactical skills have kept him in power for 27 years over the last seven this has only been achieved by series of populist but destructive and ultimately selfdefeating moves in reaction to losing the 2000 referendum on the constitution vengeful mugabe unleashed his qgreen bombersq to commit land reform and in the process he destroyed zimbabweqs agricultural sector once the bedrock of the economy while thousands of white farmers saw their properties seized hundreds of thousands of black zimbabweans lost their livelihoods and were reduced to utter poverty in 2005 having been forced to steal victory by manipulating the results of an election he lost mugabe lashed out again punishing the urban populace by launching operation murambatsvina the result was wholesale destruction of the informal sector on which as much as 7080 percent of urban dwellers had depended and the uprooting of 700000 zimbabweans the current inflationary cycle really began with murambatsvina as rents and prices grew in response to decrease in supply 4 c and now faced with the hyperinflationary consequences of his ruinous fiscal policies and growing reliance on the printing press to keep his government running mugabe has launched operation slash prices this has once again given him very temporary boost in popularity especially among the police who have led the looting of retail outlets and now seem well positioned to take leading role in the black market economy at the cost of terrible damage to the country and people many small grocery and shop owners traders etc will be wiped out the shelves are increasingly bare hunger fear and tension are growing fuel has disappeared when the shelves are still empty this time next week the popular appeal of the price roll back will evaporate and the government simply doesnqt have the resources to replace the entire private commercial sector and keep zimbabweans fed it may attempt to do so by printing more money adding even more inflationary pressure on system already reeling from the gozqs quasifiscal lunacy combined with the price impact of pervasive shortages the increasingly worthless zim dollar is likely to collapse as unit of trade in the near future depriving the goz of its last economic tool other than sheer thuggery and theft of othersq assets 5 c with all this in view iqm convinced the end is not harare 00000638 002 of 004 far off for the mugabe regime of course my predecessors and many other observers have all said the same thing and yet mugabe is still with us i think this time could prove different however because for the first time the president is under intensifying pressure simultaneously on the economic political and international fronts in the past he could always play one of these off against the other using economic moves to counter political pressure or playing the old colonialraceimperialist themes to buy himself breathing room regionally and internationally but he is running out of options and in the swirling gases of the new zimbabwean constellation that is starting to form the economic political and international pressures are concentrating on mugabe himself our zanupf contacts are virtually unanimous in saying reform is desperately needed but wont happen while the old man is there and therefore he must go finding the courage to make that happen is another matter however but even that may be coming closer this is not some sudden awakening on the road to damascus but reflection of the pain even party insiders increasingly feel over the economic meltdown we also get regular albeit anecdotal reports of angry and increasingly open mutterings against mugabe even in zanupfs traditional rural bastions beginning in march the other sadc leaders finally recognized in the wake of the terrible beatings of march 11 and the international outcry that followed q another selfinflicted wound for mugabe that zimbabwe is problem they need to address thabo mbeki appears committed to successful mediation and is reportedly increasingly irritated with mugabeqs efforts to manipulate him or blow him off altogether if mugabe judges that he still commands all he surveys by virtue of being the elder statesman on the scene he may be committing yet another serious blunder finally one does well to recall that the only serious civil disturbances here in decade came in 1998 over bread shortages showing that even the famously passive shona people have their limits the terror and oppression of the intervening years have cowed people but itqs anyoneqs guess whether their fear or their anger will win out in the end what will the end look like 6 c this is the big unanswerable question one thing at least is certain mugabe will not wake up one morning changed man resolved to set right all he has wrought he will not go quietly nor without fight he will cling to power at all costs and the costs be damned he deserves to rule by virtue of the liberation struggle and land reform and the people of zimbabwe have let him down by failing to appreciate this thus he neednqt worry about their wellbeing the only scenario in which he might agree to go with modicum of good grace is one in which he concludes that the only way to end his days free man is by leaving state house i judge that he is still long way from this conclusion and will fight on for now 7 c the optimal outcome of course and the only one that doesnqt bring with it huge risk of violence and conflict is genuinely free and fair election under international supervision the mbeki mediation offers the best albeit very slim hope of getting there however as pretoria grows more and more worried about the chaos to its north and president mbekiqs patience with mugabeqs antics wears thin the prospects for serious south african engagement may be growing thus this effort deserves all the support and backing we can muster less attractive is the idea of south africanbrokered transitional arrangement or government of national unity mbeki has always favored stability and in his mind this means zanupfled gnu with perhaps few mdc additions this solution is more likely to prolong than resolve the crisis and we must guard against letting pretoria dictate an outcome which harare 00000638 003 of 004 perpetuates the status quo at the expense of real change and reform 8 c the other scenarios are all less attractive popular uprising would inevitably entail bloodbath even if it were ultimately successful mugabeqs sudden unexpected death would set off stampede for power among zanupf heavy weights palace coup whether initiated within zanupf or from the military in which mugabe is removed killed exiled or otherwise disposed of could well devolve into open conflict between the contending successors similarly some form of constitutional coup ie change at the top engineered within the framework of zanupfqs legitimate structures could well prove to be merely the opening bell in prolonged power struggle none of the players is likely to go quietly into the night without giving everything they have including calling on their supporters in the security services moreover experience elsewhere would suggest that whoever comes out on top initially will struggle and more than likely fail to halt the economic collapse thus there is good prospect of not one but series of rapidfire qtransitionsq until some new stable dispensation is reached 9 c the final and probably worst possibility is that mugabe concludes he can settle for ruling over rump zimbabwe maintaining control over harare and the mashona heartland the critical forces of the national reserve force and cio and few key assets q gold diamonds platinum and air zimbabwe to fund the good times under this scenario the rest of the country in one of the comradeqs favorite phrases could qgo hangq leaving it to the international community to stave off the worst humanitarian consequences what of the opposition 10 c zimbabweqs opposition is far from ideal and i leave convinced that had we had different partners we could have achieved more already but you have to play the hand youqre dealt with that in mind the current leadership has little executive experience and will require massive hand holding and assistance should they ever come to power 11 c morgan tsvangarai is brave committed man and by and large democrat he is also the only player on the scene right now with real star quality and the ability to rally the masses but tsvangarai is also flawed figure not readily open to advice indecisive and with questionable judgment in selecting those around him he is the indispensable element for opposition success but possibly an albatross around t heir necks once in power in short he is kind of lech walesa character zimbabwe needs him but should not rely on his executive abilities to lead the countrys recovery arthur mutambara is young and ambitious attracted to radical antiwestern rhetoric and smart as whip but in many respects heqs lightweight who has spent too much time reading us campaign messaging manuals and too little thinking about the real issues welshman ncube has proven to be deeply divisive and destructive player in the opposition ranks and the sooner he is pushed off the stage the better but he is useful to many including the regime and south africa so is probably cross to be borne for some time yet the prospects for healing the rift within the mdc seem dim which is totally unnecessary selfinflicted wound on their part this time with few exceptions q tendayi biti nelson chamisa q the talent is thin below the top ranks the great saving grace of the opposition is likely to be found in the diaspora most of zimbabweqs best professionals entrepreneurs businessmen and women etc have fled the country they are the oppositionqs natural allies and it is encouraging to see signs particularly in south africa and the uk that these people are talking harare 00000638 004 of 004 sharing ideas developing plans and thinking together about future recovery 12 c unfortunately among the mdcqs flaws is its inability to work more effectively with the rest of civil society the blame for this can be shared on both sides many civil society groups like the nca are singleissue focused and take the overall dynamic in unhelpful directions others like woza insist on going it alone as matter of principle but ultimately it falls to the mdc as the largest and the only true political party to show the way once again however these are natural allies and they have more reason to work together than fight against each other staying the course preparing for change 13 c if i am right and change is in the offing we need to step up our preparations the work done over the last year on transition planning has been extremely useful both for stimulating fresh look at our own assumptions and plans and for forging common approach among the traditional donor community but the process has lagged since the meetings in march in london and should be reenergized it is encouraging in this respect that usaid washington has engaged the mission here in discussing how we would use additional resources in response to genuinely reformminded government i hope this will continue and the good work done so far will survive the usual bloodletting of the budget process 14 c the official media has had field day recently whooping that dell leaves zimbabwe failed man thats not quite how it looks from here i believe that the firm us stance the willingness to speak out and stand up have contributed to the accelerating pace of change mugabe and his henchman are like bullies everywhere if they can intimidate you they will but therre not used to someone standing up to them and fighting back it catches them off guard and thats when they make mistakes the howls of protest over critical statements from washington or negative coverage on cnn are the clearest proof of how this hurts them ditto the squeals over qillegal sanctionsq in addition the regime has become so used to calling the shots and dictating the pace that the merest stumble panics them many local observers have noted that mugabe is panicked and desperate about hyperinflation at the moment and hence heqs making mistakes possibly fatal mistakes we need to keep the pressure on in order to keep mugabe off his game and on his back foot relying on his own shortcomings to do him in equally important is an active us leadership role in the international community the uk is hamstrung by its colonial past and domestic politics thus letting them set the pace alone merely limits our effectiveness the eu is divided between the hard north and its soft southern underbelly the africans are only now beginning to find their voice rock solid partners like australia donqt pack enough punch to step out front and the is nonplayer thus it falls to the us once again to take the lead to say and do the hard things and to set the agenda hundreds maybe thousands of ordinary zimbabweans of all kinds have told that our clear forthright stance has given them hope and the courage to hang on by this regimeqs standards acting in the interests of the people may indeed be considered failure but i believe that the opposite is true and that we can be justifiably proud that in zimbabwe we have helped advance the presidentqs freedom agenda the people of this country know it and recognize it and that is the true touchstone of our success here dell
