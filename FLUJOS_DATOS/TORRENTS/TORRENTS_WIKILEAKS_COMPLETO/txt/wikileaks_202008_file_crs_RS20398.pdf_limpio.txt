sequesters brief review robert keith specialist in american national government government and finance division summary during the period encompassing fy 19862002 the budgetary decisions of congress and the president were guided in part by specific goals in statute enforced by process known as sequestration the statutor goals initially took the form of deficit targets but later were changed to limits on discretionary spending first effective for fy1991 and payasyougo requirement for direct spending and revenue legislation first effective for fy1992 five sequester s were triggered during years in which congress and the president did not adhere to these statutory goals three under the deficit targets and two under the di scretionary spending limits sequester occurred however after fy1991 in many of the years since fy1991 congress and the president were able to avoid sequester by ensuring that it did not enact spending or revenue gislation in violation of the statutory goals at times congress and the president had to take advantage of flexibility in the procedures such as th ability to designate certain spending as emergency requirements in order to achie ve this outcome in other instances however congress and the president prevente d sequester that otherwise would have occurred by enacting into law provisions that intervened in the normal operation of the process this report will not be updated the balanced budget and emergency defi cit control act of 1985 set forth deficit targets leading to balanced budget and tablished the sequestra tion process as the means of enforcing them the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 amended the 1985 act to effectively replace the defici t targets with two new enforcement mechanismslimits on discretionary spending ie spending controlled through the annual appropriations process and payasyou go paygo requirement applicable to legislation affectin g direct spending ie spending controlled outside of the annual appropriations process and revenues procedures unde r the bea of 1990 were revised and extended affecting legisl ation enacted through fy2002 by several laws including the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 the budget enforcement act of 1997 and the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 among othershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20398crs2 1 for additional information on the sequestration process see crs report rl31137 sequestration procedures unde r the 1985 balanced budget act by robert keithsequestration involved automatic largely across theboard spending reductions to bring projected budget levels in line with the statutory goals1 any sequester under the discretionary spending limits the paygo requirement or both would have been triggered by report issued by the direct or of the office of management and budget omb within 15 days after the end of congressional session if the omb directors report indicated that spending cuts must be made then the president was required to issue sequestration order immediately directing that the necessary cuts be made in strict conformity with the omb directors report in the case of discretionary spending further sequester for fiscal year woul d have occurred during the following session through june 30 if the enactment of supplemental appropriations act caused breach of the limits the enactment of such measure on or after july 1 would not have caused sequester instead the applicable discretionary spending limits for the following fiscal year would have been reduced by the requisite amounts under sequestration tied to the deficit targ ets half of the re quired outlay savings were to be achieved by cuts in defense prog rams and the other half by cuts in domestic programs sequestration keyed to the discretionary spending limits applied to different categories of discretionary spending eg defenseinterna tionaldomestic or defensenondefense which varied ove r time sequestration under the paygo requirement applied first to lected programs that were covered under special rules such as 4 limit on medicare cuts any furt her paygo savings were to be achieved by uniform reductions in the re maining nonexempt programs except for programs covered by paygo sp ecial rules all re ductions made under sequester had to comply with the uniform reduction percentage applicable to each category the reduction percentage woul d have been applied uniformly to all appropriations and budget account s within the category and the reductions also would have had to be extended uniformly to all of the programs projects and activities within each account the uniform reduction percentage could have varied from one category to another during the period that sequestration was in effect beginning with fy1986 sequesters were trigge red five times see table 1 the first three sequesters occurred when deficit targets were in effect and the other two occurred in the first year that the discretionary spending limits and p aygo requirement were in effect the deficit targets were in effect from fy1986 1990 initial outlay savings associated with the three deficit target sequesters were substa ntial 117 billion for fy1986 200 billion for fy1988 and 161 billion for fy1990 the uniform reduction percentages ranged from 43 to 105 ex cept for fy1986 these savings subsequently were rescinded by budget agreement fy1988 or were reduced by later law to 455 billion for fy1990 notwithstanding the impleme ntation of sequester for each of these three fiscal years the deficit targets proved to be ineffective on the whole the actual deficit for each of these years exceeded the pplicable target by an average of about 60 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20398crs3 2 for discussion of actions taken to avoi d sequesters during

savings but the drafting error was corrected in later legi slation and the savings were canceled supplemental appropriations act for fy1991 inadvertently cau sed small breach leading to an across theboard cut in domestic spending of 13 nthousandths of one percent 13 for every one million dollars in an account that yielded 14 million in outlay savings sequesters under the discretionary spending limits occurred after fy1991 although congress and the president had to enact special legislation to avoid problems for fy200020022 paygo sequester ever occurred but congress and the president also had to enact special legislation to preven t paygo sequesters in recent years finally pl 107312 enacted on december 2 2002 effectively terminated the p aygo requirement for the outyears fy20032006
