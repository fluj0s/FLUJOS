coalesce in successor regime because of philosophical religious ethnic and agenda differences although the detainment of the clerics cannot be confirmed it is possible the two clerics were detained by coalition members who were unaware of their identity iraqi shia would likely view the reported detentions as an effort by the us to prevent the rise of prominent shia clerics in new iraqi government rumors that us forces are mistreating the clerics will further intensify the growing antiamerican sentiment among the iraqi peopleoutlook bottom line iraqi shia want national leadership positions in
