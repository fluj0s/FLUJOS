summary on july 1 2007 trade promotion authority tpa formerly known as fast track expired tpa is the authority congress grants to the president to enter into certain reciprocal trade agreements ftas and to have their implementing bills considered under expedited legislative procedures provided he observes certain statutory obligations in negotiating them tpa allows congress to exercise its constitutional authority over trade while giving the president added leverage to exercise his authority to negotiate trade agreements by effectively assuring us trade partners that final agreements are given swift and uname nded consideration tpa reflects years of debate coopera tion and compromise between congress and the executive branch in finding pragmatic accommodation to the exercise of each branchs respective authorities the core provisions of the fast track legislative procedures have remained unchanged since first enacted in 1974 although congress has expanded trade negotiation objectives oversight and presidential notification requirements while early versions of fast tracktpa received broad bipartisan support renewal efforts became increasingly co ntroversial as fears grew over real and perceived negative effects of trade and as the trade debate became more partisan in nature culminating in largely partylin vote on the 2002 renewal any debate on tpa renewal would likely center on the broa d effects of trade on the united states with an emphasis on numerous specific issues that may be given greater weight in the future labor environment nd public health provisions stricter enforcement of trade agreements enhanced trade adjustment assi stance programs and revisions to the role of congress in trade policy making bilateral agreements with panama peru colombia and south korea were signed in time to be considered under th 2002 tpa the house and senate passed implementing legislation for the peru fta which president bush signed into law on december 14 2007 the president sent imple menting legislation for the colombia fta to congress on april 8 2008 but the house passed rule suspending the application of parts of the expedited legislative procedures for this bill alone the protracted world trade organizati on wto doha round of multilateral negotiations are still incomplete and may yet result in the remaining key trade agreement that could compel congress to consider extending or renewing tpa some observers also suggest that tpa is important to suppor t future bilateral fta negotiations particularly given that many countries appear ready to continue pursuing ftas irrespective of us trade policy key members of the house and senate however have signaled that tpa renewal is not at the top of the legislative agenda and will require considerable deliberation before it can be passed congress has many options in dealing with tpa ta ke action extend mporarily revise and renew grant permanent authority or devise some hybrid solution how this

of the congressionalexecutive partnership for roughly the first 150 years of the ited states the congress exercised its authority over foreign trade by setting tari ff rates on all imported products the tariff was the main trade policy instrument and primary source of fede ral revenue early congressional trade debates pitted members from northern manufacturing regions who benefitted from protectionist tariffs against those from largely southern raw material exporting regions who lobbied fo r low tariffs during this period the presidents primary role in setting trade po licy was to use his foreign affairs authority to negotiate bring into force and implement with the advice and consent of the senate general bila teral treaties of friendship co mmerce and navigation these treaties provided mostfavorednation mfn treatment to the goods of the parties to those treaties with united states that is reductions in tariffs on imports from one trade partner would apply to imports from all other countries with which the united states had such trade agreements3 two legislative events occurred in the 1930s that radically changed the shape and conduct of us trade policy the fi rst was the smoothawley tariff act of 1930 pl 71361 which set prohibitively hi gh tariff rates in response to us producers seeking protection during the heig ht of the great depression the tariffs led to retaliatory tariffs from the major us trading partners severely restricting trade thus deepening and prolong ing the effects of the depression the damaging effects of smoothawle inspired the second major trade legislative event in the 1930s congress with the guidance and encouragement of secretary of state cordell hull himself former senator developed and enacted the reciprocal trade agreem ents act of 1934 rtaa pl 73316 the rtaa authorized the president to negotiate recipr ocal agreements that reduced tariffs within preapproved levels the ta riffs were applied on an mfn basis under the rtaa congress authorized the president to implement the new tariffs by proclamation without additional legislation the rt aa is important for several reasons for the first time congress expressly delegated to the president major trade negotiating authority in so doing it is argued congress aimed to lessen the protec tionist pressure on itself4 the smoothawley tariff was the last general tariff legislation passed by congress while still on the books the smoothawley tariffs are only applied to imports from those few countries namelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33743crs4 5 shapiro and brainard

congress in way surrendered its trade authority congress subjected the tariff negotiating authority to periodic review congress renewed presidential reciprocal trade authority eleven times until 1962 through trade agreement extension acts general tariff levels declined and their significance as trade barrier lessened5 in addition with the establishment of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt in 1948 the major forum for trade negotiations shifted from bilateral to multilateral negotiations and trade negotiations were eventually expanded beyond tariffs6 under the trade expansion act of 1962 congress granted the president authority for five years to negotiate the reduction or elimination of tariffs and expanded its role in the process by requiring the president to submit for congressional review copy of each concluded agreement and presidential statement explaining why the agreement was concluded it allowed the president to negotiate the gatt kennedy round 19631967 the last round in which tariff reduction was the primary focus of trade negotiations along with number of tariff reduction agreements which congress authorized the president to implement by proclamation the gatt countries r eached agreements in two areas related to nontari ff barriers ntbs that is laws and rules other than tariffs that are used to restrict imports the first was customs valuation agreement that would have required the united states to eliminate the american selling price method of pricing goods at th border the second was an antidumping agreement that would have required ch anges in us antidumping practices7 because us adherence to these agreements required changes in us law or regulations beyond tariff modifications many in congress concluded that the president had exceeded his authority in fact congress passed resolution in 1966 opposing nontariff commitments made by the johnson administration that had not been approved by congress setting up the debate that would eventually be resolved with the creation of the fast track authority for trade agreements8 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33743crs5 9 us congress senate committee on finance trade reform act of 1974

pregeljthe creation of fast track trade authority the results of the kennedy round made evident that nontariff barriers would increasingly dominate the agenda of future multilateral trade agreements and would require changes in us law if the united states were to adhere to them congressional concern over presidential croachment on its legislative authority prompted congress to seek legislative remedy after the expiration of the tariff modification authority in the trade expansion act of 1962 the administration sought new authority to negotiate the tokyo round in the gatt which congress granted in the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 as before the act provided the president with the authority to negotiate and implement the reduction and elimination of tariffs within certain parameters to address the issue of agreements that required changes in us w beyond tariff modifications the act stipulated that non tariff barrier agreements tered into under the statute could only enter into force if congress passed implementing legislation it was argued that subjecting implementin g legislation to or dinary congressional debate and amendment procedures would defeat the purpose for delegating trade negotiating authority to the president in the first place to reduce the parochial pressures implicit in trade policymaking ma ny members also recognized that trade partners would not be willing to negotiate agreements that would be subject to unlimited congressional debate and amendments as stated in the senate finance committee report accompanying the trade act of 1974 the committee recognizes that such agreements negotiated by the executive should be given an upordown vote by the congress our negotiators cannot be expected to accomplish the negotiating goals if there are reasonable assurances that the negotiated agreemen ts would be voted upordown on their merits our trading partners have expressed an unwillingness to negotiate without some assurances that the cong ress will consider the agreements within definite timeframe9 as solution congress agreed that each chamber would suspend its ordinary legislative procedures and give trade agreements expedited treatment which became known as fast track the relevant committees would be given limited time to consider implementing bills once they reached the floor the implementing bills would be subject to timelimited debate and amendments in exchange congress required the executive branch to consult with relevant committees during the negotiations and to notify congress 90 cale ndar days before signing an agreement the act also provided for the accreditation of 10 members of congress as advisers to the us delegation of negotiators the trade act of 1962 had provided for five such advisers thus fast

to use them however is subject to time limits and congress has revised them over the years the initial grant of trade negotiating authority and the authority to enact tariff modifications by proclamation under the trade ac t of 1974 were in effect for five years ending on january 2 1980 residual presidential au thority to proclaim tariff modifications expired january 2 1982 the trade

agreements on nontariff barriers but made other changes to the or iginal authority the act did not extend presidential tariff modification authority the trade and tariff act of 1984 this act amended the trade act of 1974 to provide for the negotiation and implementation of bilateral free trade agreements that both reduce or eliminate tariffs and address nontariff barri ers congress was taking

support in the house in september 1998 the house voted on fast track authority legislation but the bill failed to pass 180243 several reasons may explain the failure of the clinton administration and congress to get fast track procedures reauthorized for one although both the republican congressional leadership and the clinton administration wanted fast track authority the two sides could not ag ree on how labor and environmental issues should be addressed in trade agreemen ts negotiated under renewed authority republicans wanted limited coverage while the clinton administration and many democrats in congress prefe rred broader coverage in addition the wto failed to launch new round of negotiations at the 1999 ministerial meeting in seattle and therefore major trade negotiations were underway that might have made the adoption of fast track statute political priority the bipartisan trade promotion authority act of 2002 in 2001 president bush requested renewal of fast track authority which was renamed in the legislation trade promoti on authority tpa in part to counter negative connotation associated with the fast track name the renewed au thority is contained in the bipartisan trade promotion authority act btpaa of 2002 which was enacted as title xxi of the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 the structure of tpa is consistent w ith previous negotiating authority it includes environmental and bor provisions as principal negotiating objectives but does not mandate the inclusion of minimal enforceable labor standards in trade agreements10 the lack of mandate to

an emphasis on meeting the needs of developing countries12 although many argue that tpa is necessary for the us bargaining position to remain credible others note that tpa is not required to complete the negotiations as the exampl of the uruguay round discussed above suggests should breakthrough be made on an agreement that the us congress would approve congress coul d extend tpa exclusively fo r the doha round at any time most observers acknowledge that the doha round probably makes the most compelling argument for tpa extension at this time the elements of tpa through tpa in its various iterations congress has sought to achieve four major goals in the context of supporting trade negotiations 1 to define its trade policy priorities and to have those prioritie s reflected in trade agreement negotiating objectives 2 to ensure that the executive branch adheres to these objectives by requiring periodic notification and consultation 3 to fine the terms conditions and procedures under which trade agreem ent implementing bills will be approvedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33743crs9 13 for summary of bills authorizing tpa and trade agreements approved under its provisions see crs report rs21004 trade promotion authority and fasttrack negotiating authority for trade agreements major votes by carolyn c smithand 4 to reaffirm congresss overall constitutional authority over trade by placing limitations on the trade agreements authority these four goals and some important procedural precedents that fall outside the formal legal tpa process are examined below negotiating objectives congress exercises its trade policy role in part by defining trade negotiation objectives in tpa legislation in the 2002 tpa congress made clear that trade is an important aspect of us foreign econo mic and security policy because it generates broad benefits for the unite d states and the global economy to take the fullest advantage of these benefits congress drawing on its constitutional authority and historical precedent defined the objectives that the president is to pursue in trade negotiations although the executive branch has some discretion over implementing these goals they are definitive statements of us trade policy that the administration is expected to honor if it expects the tr ade legislation to be considered under expedited rules for this reason trade negotiating objectives stand at the center of the congressional debate on tpa congress establishes trade negotiating objectives in three categories 1 overall objectives 2 principal objectives and 3 other priorities these begin with broadly focused goals that encapsulate the overall direction trade negotiations are expected to take such as enhancing us and global economies principal objectives are far more specific and provide detailed goals that congress expects to be integrated into trade agreements such as reducing barrier s to various types of trade eg goods services agriculture electronic commerce protecting foreign investment and intellectual property rights encouraging transparency fair regulatory practices and anticorruption ensuring that countries pr otect environment and labor conditions and rights providing for an effective dispute settlement process and protecting the us right to enforce its trade remedy laws objectives also include an important obligation to consult congress discussed in detail below in the past language defining trad negotiating objectives has been highly contested contributing to the 2002 rene wal controversy in which tpa passed virtually along partisan lines and by only the narrowest of margins13 t h i s controversy reflects the importance of tpa negotiating objectives as template for future trade agreements negotiated under th guidelines for example if the language of tpa objective is highly cont entious it stands to reason that the same issue may prove even more acerbic when specific trade agreement is brought before congress for approval the labor provisions which are emphasized repeatedly in all three groups of negotiating objec tives provide the best illust ration in particular the decision not to include minimal enforceable standards anywhere in tpa caused acrimonious debate over both tpa and the ft as that later adopted the tpa language on labor this issue was perhaps most evident in the debate on the dominican republiccentral americaunited states free trade agreement caftadrhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33743crs10 14 the private sector advisory system was established by congress in 1974 to ensure that us trade policy and negotiations benefit from and reflect broad array of private sector continuedbecause the structure of trade agreements mirrors tpa objectives and highly disputed agreements base d on those objectives brought before congress under tpa have so far survived often narrowly all challenges from opponents the vote on renewing tpafast track is among the most critical trade votes congress takes in part for this reason key members of the 110th congress have indicated preference for proceeding cautiously in pursuing tpa renewal notification and consultation the trade agreements authority is extended to the president provided he consults regularly with congress including the congressional oversight group cog created in the 2002 trade act whose member s are accredited as official advisors to the trade negotiation delegations notifi cation and consultati on requirements have been expanded in each renewal of authority most of these requirements are found in their own section within the tpa statute the timing of these notifications is detailed in the time line presented in appendix first the president must conduct certain notifications and consultations before negotiations begin that include 1 notifying congress in writing of his intention to enter into negotiations at least 90 calendar days prior to commencing negotiations 2 consulting with the house ways and means senate finance other relevant committees and the cog on the nature of the negotiations and 3 providing special consultations on agriculture import sensitive agricultural products fishing and textile indus try tariffs and other issues the president must also conduct speci fic notifications and consultations before and after agreements are entered into signed to include 1 notifying congress

purview of the legislative branch by establishing in law opportunities to affect the nature and direction of trade negotiations the ffectiveness of the consultation process however has been questioned the g overnment accountability office gao evaluated this process based on multiple interviews with current and former congressional staff and executive branch employees it found that from 2002 to 2007 the ustr had conducted extensive c onsultations with members and staff of congress on all ftas that were to be presented to cong ress for approval under tpa15 majority of congressional staff however indicated that despite the frequency and high quality of informa tion conveyed the meetings w ith ustr officials often did not allow for sufficient time to provide input into the negotiation process were often cast more as briefings than true consultations that imply an exchange of views and did not always include last minute change s to draft fta texts in short there was ongoing concern expressed that the congressional consulta tion process may need to be amended to allow for greater cong ressional input into the crafting of ftas16 trade agreements author ity and implementation as discussed above when the statutory authority to negotiate trade agreements was limited to reducing tariffs the trade agreement was implemented by presidential proclamation and without further congressional acti on provided the tariff rate reductions were within legislatively preapproved limits this process changed when trade negotiations were expanded to incl ude nontariff barriers ntbs

ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33743crs12 17 under tpa reciprocal ftas and multilateral ntb agreements that go beyond tariff reductions are treated as congressionalexecutive agreements which require the approval of both houses of congress such approval expresses congress consent to bind the united states to the commitments of the agreement under international law this type of agreement is distinguished from both the executive agreement requiring only presidential action and the treaty requiring twothirds vote of the sena because reciprocal trade agreements typically result in tariff rate revenue changes the house of representatives is necessarily involved for more detailed legal discussion see crs report 97896 why certain trade agreements are approved as congressionalexecutive

only with passage of implementing legislation17 at the heart of what is now called tpa are the expedited rules for moving such trade implementing legislation through cong ress which have been used for nearly all reciprocal trade agreements18 importantly the fast tr ack procedures are rules of the house and senate either house may change them at any time with majority vote19 congress makes these expedited pr ocedures available for trade implementing bill provided the president uses the trade agreements authority granted to him to the satisfaction of congress first by entering into agreements that meet tpas overall and principal negotiating objectives and second by satisfying the notification and consultation requirements in addition under the trade agreements authority section congress requires that the president 1 as mentioned above at least calendar 90 days prior to signing the agreement notify congress of his intention to do so to provide opportunity for cong ressional input before the agreement is signed at which point it can longer be changed 2 within 60 calendar days of signing the agreement provide congress with list of required changes to us law needed for the united

interestingly while congress authorized funding for us contributions and for continuedof administrative action proposed to implement the agreement and supporting statements on how the agreement meets congressional objectives changes existing agreements and serves the purpose of us commercial interests as an important caveat the tpa expe dited procedures are extended only to implementing bills with provisions limited to those necessary or appropriate to implement the trade agreements either repealing or amending existing laws or providing new statutory authority this requirement presumably limits the implementing bill to provisions related to the pending trade agreement although the meaning of necessary or appropria has been subject to debate should these requirements be fulfilled to the satisfac tion of congress it has agreed to follow certain expedited legislative procedures in effect these rules require that congress must act on the bill sent over by the white house and in other ways represent significant departure from ordinary legislative procedures the rules are defined below see appendix b for greater detail and involve 1 mandatory introduction of the implementing b ill in both houses of congress and immediate referral to the appropriate committees house ways and means senate fi nance and possibly others20 2 automatic discharge from house and senate committees af ter limited period of time 3 limited floor debate and4 amendment meaning that congre ss must vote either up or down on the bill which passes with simple majority congressional procedures outside tpa in addition to the expedited procedures defined in tpa congress with the effective consent of the executive branch has followed certain procedures during the consideration of trade agreement imple menting bills that although not formally defined in tpa have been integrated in to the process of c ongressional approval of trade agreements three in particular stand out side agreements and letters outside of formal tpa statutory requirements congress has insisted on dditions or clarifications to trade agreements this insistence has resulted at times in side agreements and letters side agreements are additional obligations accepted by all parties after the original trade agreement has been signed the most notable examples are the environment and labor side agreements of nafta21 side letters serve as clarifying deviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33743crs14 21 continued participation in the administrative bodies crea ted by the nafta side agreements it did not expressly approve the

addressed from and to the top trade negotiating representative eg the ustr trade minister or equivalent side agreements and letters accompany the agreement but neither changes its text and both require official signatures of all th negotiating parties to come into force hearings and mock markups congress has insisted on reviewing the negotiated trade agreement prior to the imp lementing bill being introduced this is done first in hearings before the hous ways and means and senate finance committees as well as possibly other interested committees the ways and means and finance committees typically follow with an informal or mock markup on an informal draft version of the implementing bill which is sent over by the white house along with draft of the final text of the trade agreement the informal mockup is in effect st run of congressional response to the trade bill because it is only an informal draft bill there is real legislation to mark up but the meetings afford co mmittee members an opportunity to comment on the draft trade agreement as well as the informal draft implementing legislation and offer amendments that serve as important signals to the administration of changes to the implementing bill they would like to see made the two revenue committees may also decide to hold mock conference to reconcile any differences in their mock markups although the agreement at this point has already been concluded clarification or translation of key points that do not lter the basic agreement can be made in the final implementing bill22 the administration however can exercise discretion in accepting suggested changes from congress for example while the committees offered many changes to the caftadr agreement that the bush administration tried to accommodate the administration declined to include the language of an amendment unanimously supported by th senate finance committee with respect to the usoman fta implementing legisl ation citing tpas ow n requirement that only legislation necessary or appropriate to implement the agreement be included the oman bill passed but new bipartisan call for better consultation prior to the president entering into trade agreement arose because of dissatisfaction with both the oman fta and the tpa process23 informal agreements some members of cong ress have also relied on promises from the administration to address issues raised in mock markups these often relate to special interests and concerns and their fulfillment relies on measure of good will between congress and the admin

adopted tpa rules on pragma tic grounds as selflimiting conditions to prevent trade implementing bills from being delayed or obstructed by congressional procedures that can either keep bill from moving out of committee or delay it on the floor of the house or senate with exte nded debate trade agreements can also be the product of fra gile consensus between trade partners and tpa procedures were designed to protect such consensus from unraveling due to congressional amendments that would change the basic agreement in crafting tpa however congress did not agree to surrender its constitutional authority over trade matters and wrote into tpa number of provisions that can limit the use of the expedited procedures sunset provision each renewal of the trade agreements authority has provided the use of expedited procedures for trade agreement implementing bills for limited time the 2002 statute made thes procedures available for trade agreements entered into before july 1 2007 importantly however the act provides deadline for submitting implementing legislation for the agreement if it is entered into before the july 1 deadline extension disapproval tpa legislation requires that the president request an extension of the tpa authority after certain period of time the extension is granted unless either house of congress adopts disapproval resolution such resolution of disapprova l may not be considered unless it is reported out of either the house ways and means or senate fina nce committee although such resolutions have been reported out of committee in the past none has been passed in either house of congress this process is reminder to the executive branch that the availability of expedited legislative procedures is congressional prerogative that can be denied if congress becomes dissatisfi ed with how the president has conducted trade agreement negotiations procedural disapproval the requirement that the president fulfill consultation and reporting oblig ations also helps preserve the congressional role on trade agreements by giving congress th opportunity to influence the agreement before it is finalized should congress termine that the president has failed to meet these requirements it may decide that the implementing bill is not eligible to be considered under tpa rules it would implement this decision by adopting joint procedural disapproval resoluti on in both houses of congress withdrawal of expedited procedures the trade act of 1974 as amended provides that the expedited pr ocedures for consideration of trade implementing bills are enacted as rules of procedures for each house with the full recognition of the constitutional right of either house to change the rules so far

take effect with vote by either house of congress26 this summary suggests that in addition to binding rules the longterm success of tpa rests on cooperativ spirit and partnership be tween the legislative and executive branches of government and by extension between the two major political parties27 many have noted that the sense of such cooperation was absent under the previous tpa placing strain on the trade legislative process in recent years in fact bipartisan agreement on tpa has been absent since at least 1993 as evident in the eightyear lapse during the clinton administration and the highly partisan passage of the 2002 tpa renewal the current dissatisfaction with tpa results from philosophical differences that have developed in part along partisan lines and raises the distinct possibility that tpa now lapsed once again may not be renewed issues for congress tpa expired on july 1 2007 and is curre ntly not available for the potentially most important trade agreement still under negotiation the wto multilateral doha development round as well as any future b ilateral ftas president bush formally requested tpa renewal on january 31 2007 and the congressional response ranged from immediate support to deferred cons ideration of approval and outright opposition currently the democratic leader ship has signaled that tpa renewal is not priority for the immediate legislative agenda28 reluctance to take up tpa renewal rests with number of concerns first increasingly congress is focuse d on addressing the negative effects of trade policy and more broadly globalization job displacement falling wages the growing income gap in the united states and developing countries and the us trade deficit all reinforce an overall sense th at the costs and benefits of trade are not being distributed equally and that legisla tive policy responses in this area should be paramount congress has res ponded by insisting on significant changes to bilateral ftas and introducing new trade adjustment assistance bills importantly each of the issues mentioned above has causes and potential policy responses rooted as much orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33743crs17 29 one

fta countries with perhaps new emphasis on japan the european union and other large economies insisting on linking revised trade priorities to tpa renewal may be another way for congress to exercise its authority over trade policy third the democratic leadership has indicated that tpa renewal will require lengthy deliberations to craft new model for future us trade policy one likely to incorporate the key provisions of the new trade policy of america among others there is perceived need to rush consideration of such complex issue at this time particularly given the slow pace at wh ich the doha round is progressing the continuing debate on tpa rene wal shaped by these and other factors may focus on number of specific issues reflecting unresolved concer ns over the tpa process in general and trade policy issues of particular intere st to congress the need for tpa recurring question is whet her tpa is really necessary one way to explore this issue is to consider the alternatives first given the breadth and scope of modern trade accords executive agreements are ge nerally an insufficient means for fully implementing trade agreements where the amendment repeal or enactment of new laws is required second the treaty approach presents two problems the high hurdle of twothirds vote of approval in the u s senate and lack of house action for an agreement involving revenue30 further congress has long considered us trade agreements to be nonselfexecuting that is requiring impleme nting legislation if existing law is insufficient to carry out agreement obligations31 because legislative action involving bot h houses of congress is needed the options appear limited to either tpa approach or relying on ordinary rules of procedure to consider trade implementing legislation to date the challenge of representing the diverse interests of num erous economic stake holders has several times led congress back to the idea of using carefully structured timelimited grant of trade agreements authority subject to implementing legislation being considered under streamlined legislative ru despite the fact that strategically important but commercially insignificant fta with jord an was approved without tpa some of the debate over the need for renewa l may hinge on how important congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33743crs18 32 yerkey gary g renewal of

p 158 perceives it is for the united states to continue trade negotiations in world that will continue to integrate irrespective of us policy the role of congress if the success of tpa were to be meas ured simply by the number of trade agreements that have been approved nd implemented under its authority then it might be argued that tpa has proven its merit many members of congress however have complained that in recent years the tpa process has failed demonstrating that binding congressional rules of procedure are not sufficient to guarantee consensus position or c ooperative working arrangement on trade32 such criticism is largely but not exclusively made along partisan lines complaints point to multiple problems 1 trade negotiation objectives that do not include all key concerns of congress g enforceable labor standards and are open to interpretation by the executive branch 2 an executive branch consultation process including the cog denounced as superficial and unresponsive to congressional input 3 the passage of widely unpopular ftas negotiated under tpa authority and 4 ineffectiven ess of procedures for deterri ng the use of tpa eg the extension disapproval resolution and repeal of fast track rules because power has at times been held closely through partisan control of committee chairs33 in short there has been growing sense for the need to rekindle trust between the administration and congress as well as ensure greater bipartisan cooperation within congress on trade matters trade policy issues many specific trade issues are likely to emerge in the course of congressional debate over tpa renewal the current congressional debate and those over recent trade agreements point to numerous issues labor environmen t and public health standards trade adjustment assistance trade remedy laws and the temporary entry of service providers known as mode4 labor standards perhaps the single most contentious specific trade issue for tpa renewal particularly in the house has been the treatment of labor standards they have been included as negotiating objectives in fast tracktpa authority since the omnibus trade and competitiveness ac t of 1988 the partisan differences were evident in two competing bills offered during the 2002 renewal and they are still reflected today34 hr 3009 introduced by thenhouse ways and means committee chairman thomas was

difference congressional l eaders and the bush administration have attempted to bridge these differences through the mandatory framework included in the new trade policy for america the first legislative test of this compromise language was congressional implementing legislation for the bilateral fta with peru approved by congress in december 2007 lang uage reflecting key elements of the compromise framework is also contained in proposed ftas with colombia panama and south korea the next question is wh ether such language might be incorporated into new tpa environment and public

program has focused prima rily on workers and has been funded and administered through the us department of labor other programs also exist including small one for firms administered by the us department of commerce because the effects of gl obalization and pa rticularly trade liberalization both positive and negative can be far reaching th ere is growing interest in developing more

congress has had toward safeguarding the interests of constituents35 despite such clear message from congress the bush administration included trade remedy laws as part of the doha round arguing that

congressional consideration of the implementing bills for the uschile and us singapore free trade agreements some members of the house and senate judiciary committees objected to the inclusion of changes in us visa policies to allow increases in the quotas of workers enteri ng the united states they argued that changes in visa rules must be separate from trade legislation that is considered by congress under expedited fast track pro cedures compromises were reached to allow the two bills to be voted on but not without bipartisan warnings from both committees that changes in visa policy s hould longer be pa rt of bilateral or multilateral trade agreements36 options for congress with the expiration of tpa on july 1 2007 congress has number of options with respect to its possible renewal four that span the spectrum are discussed below tpa renewal congress at present does not appear read to extend or renew tpa although the lack of tpa may delay action on future reciprocal trade agreements many sector specific and other more narro wly targeted agreements have been concluded in the past without tpa the united states s also launched trade negotiations prior tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33743crs21 37 some have argued that the circumstances at that time were different from what they are now because the trade authority had more support in congress 38 see for

summer 2006 pp 5455having tpa authority in place both situa tions suggest that the conduct of us trade negotiations can continue in some form w ithout tpa still trade partners may be reluctant to negotiate with the united stat without tpa since the agreement would be subject to ordinary legislative procedures and amendment by congress therefore one question that congress faces is whether there are potential trade agreements outstanding that may compel c onsideration of tpa ex tension or renewal extend tpa temporarily congress could extend the current tpa w ith few or revisions long enough to allow the united states to complete specific agreement this approach might be favored by those who are reluctant to rene w the authority but do not want to hinder the completion of agreements that they view as potentially beneficial to the united states for example congress extende d the authority for 10 months in 1993 to complete the uruguay round agreements and could do so again for the doha round37 in as much as labor and environm ent provisions are not being contemplated as part of the doha negotiations congre ss could extend tpa for the sole purpose of concluding the multilateral agreement pe rhaps without compromising the concerns of those members who support stronger labor environment public health and other provisions in bilateral ftas renew tpa authority under this option congress could grant the president new authority with or without major changes in its structure and without restricting it to specific agreement negotiations such an approach would give more time to complete pending trade negotiations and allow for the opportunity to launch new negotiations in so doing this option would provide the president w ith the flexibility to implement complex trade negotiating agenda congressional ac tion on this approach implies however that political agreement could be struck on the overall framework of trade agreements objectives and negotiating priorities among majority in congress and between congress and the president grant permanent tpa authority some trade policy experts have sugge sted that congress could grant the president form of permanent fast tracktpa38 the proponents of this option envision twotier procedure 1 congre ss would enact into law permanent fast track procedures and 2 before specifi c negotiations can begin both houses of congress would have to pass resolution approving the negotiations and objectives designed for the specific set of negotiations step 2 is designed to satisfy those who might be concerned that c ongress could be surrendering its authority permanentlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33743crs22 supporters argue that the permanent author ity would signal to trade partners that the united states is committed to trade liberalization over the long term the prior approval procedure for specific negotiations might address the concern that this option could result in giving the president blank check to negotiate ftas with any country he chooses one criticism of this approach is that congress might not be willing to give permanent authority even with the required preapproval process prospects for tpa renewal the 110th congress began the tpa renewal deba early but then shifted focus to addressing the key issues of pending b ilateral ftas with peru panama colombia and south korea each was signed in time to be considered under the 2002 tpa authority the remaining outstanding case for nearterm renewal of tpa is the doha round although the ustr continues to argue that the lack of tpa could delay future bilateral negotia tions as well and in any case other countries will continue to negotiate trade agreements irrespective of us policy it falls to congress to weigh the costs and benefits of when and if to consider tpa renewa l as part of the us trade policy agenda the tpa decision will also have significant implications for defining the future of the congressionalexecutive relationship for the

days potentially lasting many monthsappendix b short guide to the expedited legislative procedures for passage of trade implementing bills under tpa39 i before the formal tpa expedited pro cedures come into play the house ways and means and senate finance committ ees typically hold mock markups on informal drafts of the implementin g legislation voting to approve or disapprove the vote and any amendments to the draft legislation however are not binding on the administration thes meetings provide the last opportunity to make recommendations to the administration before it sends final implementing legislation to congress which initiates the expedited procedures ii the president sends final legal draft text of the trade agreement and draft implementing bill with suppor ting materials to congress on day that it is in session the draft bill may or may not reflect some or all of any amendments adopted by committees in the mock markup iii identical b ills are subject to mandatory intr oduction in each house of congress on the day received the bills are refe rred to the house ways and means and senate finance committees jointly with others if jurisdiction warrants40 iv each committee has 45 in session days to report the bill or it is automatically discharged and the bill is pl aced on the appropriate calendar41 n implementing bill subject to tpa procedures is likely to be revenue bill in which case the constitution requires that the senate ultimately act on the house bill under these conditions the sena finance committee has until the later of the 45th day of session after the senate bill is introduced or the 15th day of session after the senate receives the house bill v in each house after the implementing bill is reported or discharged any member may offer nondebatable motion to consider it debate is limited to 20 hours evenly divided between those fo r and against the measure cannot be amended and motion or unanimousconsent request to suspend this restriction is not in order if the chamber has not completed floor action by the 15th day after the bill is reported or discharged any member may bring it to vote vi bill passes by simple majority unde r the statute whichever house acts second typically the senate assuming the bill is re venue bill considers and debates its own bill but takes its final vote on the bill received from the otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33743crs25 42 in fact the senate can act and has acted on its own bill before receiving the house bill in the case of the chile fta implementing bill the senate finance committee reported out first when the house bill which was identical came over it was put on the senate calendar directly for the caftadr bill the senate actually voted first on its own bill necessitating later procedural vo to substitute the identical language of the senate bill into the housepassed bill when received these proceedings in the senate permitted final action to occur on the house measure as constitutionally requiredhouse typically the house of representatives42 this procedure ensures that both houses will ultimately act on the same measure thereby clearing it to be presented to the president without the need for conference once the implementing bill is signed under its terms the agreemen t enters into force for the united states by presidential proclamation
