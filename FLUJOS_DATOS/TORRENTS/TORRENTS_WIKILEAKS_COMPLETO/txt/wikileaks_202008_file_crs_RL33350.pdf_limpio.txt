representative schiff for various reasons additional legislative activity related to the court improvement program may occur in the 109th congress likely as part of the expected reauthorization bate for the child welfare program authorized under title ivb subpart 2 of the social security ac t now called the prom oting safe and stable families pssf program funding for the original cip grant program for improving and assessing cour t handling of child welfare proceedings is statutorily reserved from total pssf funding and that funding is set to expire with fy2006 congress may consider whether this fundi ng setaside for cip should be extended and if so whether the author ization language for this grant meets the current program needs in addition congress may want to review the adequacy of the authorizing language provided for the two new grant programs related to timely decisions on behalf of children and training judges and other courtlegal personnel which was added during conference ne gotiations on the deficit reduction act pl 109171 and was not previously debated by congre ss third while the new grant programs and several other changes made by pl 109171 meet number

statutory language but was moved to section 438 of the social security act by pl 107133 enacted in january 2002child welfare the court improvement program introduction the court improvement program cip section 438 of the social security act first authorized in 1993 pl 10366 provides grants to highest state courts intended to improve their handling of child welfare cases1 as authorized for fy2006 these grants are for three purposes to assess ndling of child abuse and neglect cases and make needed improvements fy2006 f unding 129 million to train judges legal personnel and attorn eys in handling of child welfare cases fy2006 funding 10 million and to impr ove timeliness of decisi ons regarding safety permanence and wellbeing of ch ildren fy2006 funding 10 million the latter two grants were first author ized and funded by the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 which author ized and funded them through fy2010 funding under the cip grant for assessing and improving court handling of child welfare cases was first made available in fy1995 and is provided as setaside from appropriations made for services to ch ildren and families under title ivb subpart 2 of the social security act now called the promoting safe and stable families program that funding is set to expire with fy2006 the 109th congress may consider whether to extend funding for this initial cip grant whether to add to the relatively limited instructions provided in the deficit reduction act regarding purposes of the tw newest grants and whether additional courtrelated measures intended to improve court performance on behalf of children in child abuse and neglect cases are needed legislative history as first enacted in 1993 pl 10366 court improvement pr ogram grants were made to permit state highest courts to assess their role responsibilities and effectiveness in carrying out required court processes in fede ral and state child welfare law including regarding determinations about foster care placement termination of parental rights nd placement for adoption or another permanent living arrangement and implement changes deemed necessary from that assessmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33350crs2 2 title ivb subpart 2 of the social secur ity act was created in 1993 to authorize grants to state child welfare agencies for family support and family preservation services this program was expanded and renamed the promoting safe and stable families in 1997 by the adoption and safe families act asfa pl 105189 and in 2001 congress acted to extend the program through fy2006 pl 107133funding was provided as setaside from title ivb subpart 2 at 5 million for fy1995 and 10 million for each of fy1996fy1998 eligible state highest courts with an approved application for cip grant were entitled to receive 75000 rising to 85000 in fy1996 and each subsequent year plus share of the remaining cip setaside based on their states rela tive share of the population under age 212 the adoption and safe families act asf pl 10589 continued the set aside funding for the court improvement program at 10 million annually through fy2001 the promoting safe and stable families amendments of 2001 pl 107 133 extended cip through fy2006 made clear that the funds c ould be used to implement improvements made necessary by asfa as well as any made necessary by corrective action plan required of state child welfare agency following federal child and family services review cfsr finally that law authorized up to 166 million in annual setaside funding from what is now called the promoting safe and stable families pssf program this amount is the sum of the previous 10 million setaside from the mandatory pssf program funding plus 33 of any funds appropriated under the new 200 million annual pssf discretionary funding authorization congress has never provided the full discre tionary funding authorized for the pssf and the discretionary setaside for the cip has never been more than 33 million see table 1 for program funding history the deficit reduction act of 2005 p l 109171 expanded the cip and provided new independently appropriated funds for th program the law appropriates 20 million in each of fy2006fy2010 total of 100 million over five years for two new kinds of cip grants to ensure that the safety permanence and wellbeing needs of children are met in timely and complete manner and to provide for the training of judges attorneys and other legal personnel in child welfare cases these grants are in addition to the previously authorized cip grant currently authorized through fy2006 and funded via setaside from the promoting safe and stable families program current program structure in fy2006 state highest courts may apply for one or more of the three grants now authorized under the court improveme nt program courts must submit separate application for each grant and must meet certain requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33350crs3 3 at the same time pl 109171 amended the state plan requirements for child welfare services title ivb subpart 1 of the social s ecurity act so that any state seeking these funds must be able to demonstrate substantial ongoing and meaningful collaboration with state courts in developing and implementing that state plan as well as the state plans for the promoting safe and stable families program title ivb subpart 2 adoption and foster care assistance title ive and any program improvement plan required due to federal child and family services reviewapplications pl 109171 provides that an pplication for any of the three grant programs must demonstrate meanin gful and ongoing collaboration between the courts the state child welfare agency r any other agency under contract with the state child welfare agency to administer ch ild welfare programs authorized under the social security act and indian tribes where applicable3 in an application for funds related to the newly authorized grant for improving timely and complete actions on behalf of children state highes t court must include description of how it and the child welfare agencies on the local and state levels jointly plan for the collection and sharing of all relevant data and information in an application for training funds under the cip state highest court must demonstrate that at least part of the grant will be used for crosstraining initiatives jointly planned and carried out with the state child welfare agency or an agency under contract with the state agency finally as was previously require d for receipt of cip funds in each of the grant applications state highest cour t would need to supply any additional information or assurances that the depar tment of health and human services hhs might require formula and entitlement pl 109171 followed the formula established in prior law for the cip grant each state highest court with an approved application is entitled to receive minimum grant of 85000 and portion of any of the remaining setaside funds that is equal to its states share of individua ls under 21 years of age compared to all states with an approved application for the grant this same formula is applied to each of the new grant programs thus if state highest court successfully applies for all three grants it will receive three minimum allotments of 85000 total of 255000 and share of the remaining funds for each grant program based on the size of its states population under 21 years of age relative to all states whose highest court has an approved application for each of the grants program funding table 1 shows total funds authorized and appropriated for the court improvement program for fy1995 first year of funding authority through

and deliberation the pew commission on children in foster care released its recommendations related to federal financing of child welfare servi ces and improving court oversight of child welfare proceedings4 the courtrelated suggesti ons made by the commission were largely incorporated in legisla tion introduced earlier in the 109th congress in the senate s 1679 by senators dewine and rockefeller and in the house hr 3758 by representative schiff and many of the recommendations were incorporated in the deficit reduction act the commission noted that in order for states to ensure childrens rights to safety permanence and wellbeing are met in timely and complete manner courts must be able to track childrens progress identify which children need attention and identify sources of delay in court proceedings to address this issue they recommended states adopt performance measures5 for their activities on behalf of children that judges and judicial leadersh ip use performance data collected to ensure accountability and inform decisions about resource allocation and finally that congress appropriate 10 million in the first years additional sums as necessary to help states build the capacity to track and analyze their caseload second the commission urged that chil d welfare agencies and courts be required to demonstrate effective colla boration on behalf of children the commission recommended that hhs require co llaboration as part of developing variety of service and program improveme nt plans and in collecting and sharing relevant data between the child welfare ag encies and courts further it asked that congress appropriate 10 million to train court personne l and that portion of this funding should be designated for joint trai ning of court personne l and child welfare agency staff and others i nvolved in protecting and caring for children it also called on hhs to require states to establish broadbased state commissions on children in foster care that would be led by the states child welfare agency director and the state chief justice substantial parts of these first two sets of recommendations are included in the deficit reduction act for instance while state highest courts are not required to develop performance measures they may pply for their allotment of an annual 10 million fund for each of fy2006fy2010 intende d to help improve their

able to demons trate meaningful and ongoing collaboration between themselves and child welfare agen cies in addition to receive cip funding to improve timely decisionmaking on behalf of children courts must describe how they will collaborate with child welfare agencies to collect and share relevant data finally to receive training f unds courts must assure that part of the grant will be used to provide crosstraini ng of court personnel and ch ild welfare agency workers further the deficit re duction act also requires state child welfare agencies as condition of certain federal f unding to involve the courts in information gathering program planning and prog ram improvement efforts6 the pew commission proposed third set of recommenda tions intended to ensure that childrens best interests are represented and that the voices of children and their parents are heard in dependency court proceedings these provisions are not included in the deficit reduction act they include an additional 5 million in federal funds to expand the court appoint ed special advocates casa program adoption of standards of practice prep aration education and compensation for attorneys practicing child pendency law and funds for loan forgiveness or other demonstration programs inte nded to attract and retain dependency court attorneys7 finally the commission urged law schools ba r associations and law firms to help build the pool of qualified attorneys ava ilable to practice in dependency courts there are number of proposals in c ongress that would fund student loan forgiveness program for child welfare attorneys s 1431 senator dewine s 1679 senators dewine and rockefeller nd hr 3758 representative schiff but none of these have been acted on in additi on congress recently reauthorized

departments rather than in departments with jurisdiction over multiple issues creation of resource workload and training standards for dependency courts judges and attorneys along with standards of practice for dependenc judges and codes of judicial conduct that support the practices of problemsolving cour ts and finally state court procedures that enable and encourage judges who have dem onstrated competence in the dependency courts to build careers on the dependency bench with regard to ensuring sound standa rds of practice and qualified attorneys acting on behalf of children in abuse and neglect courts the national association for counsel of children using grant money provided by hhs september 2002 september 2005 has deve loped national certification for child welfare lawyers the american bar association aba has grante d approval of this certification process and of the national association for couns of children as certifying agency9 certification exam was piloted in 2005 nd attorneys in limited number of states may now apply for this certification na tional dissemination of the certification is also planned finally s 1679 as introdu ced in july 2005 would require states to develop and encourage the implementation of practice standards for all attorneys representing the state or local agency admin istering the program under this part title ive of the social security act including standards regarding the interaction of such attorneys with other attorneys who pr actice before an abuse and neglect court the fourth and last set of recommendations are directed to chief justices and state court leadership and urge them to act as champions of children in their court systems and leaders of reform10 legislative history of court role in federal child welfare policy court improvement program f unds recognize the integral role courts must play if states are to achieve the federal goals of keeping children safe and finding them permanent homes state laws related to determinations of safety and the need to remove child from the home eg what is child abuse and neglect termination of parental rights and placement for adoption are key operating contexts for the state child welfare agency state courts implement or ratify agency decisions based on these state laws federal child welfare policy both affects these state laws and assumes active involvement of the court with child welfare agencies in achieving the primary goals of safety permanence and we llbeing for children however federal child welfare funding is to very large ex tent directed toward state child welfare agencies and these agencies are held acc ountable for adhering to and achieving range of courtrelated pr ocedures and outcomes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33350crs8 11 these hearings and determinations may also be done by an administrative body but only if it was appointed or approved by the court courts have played an explicit role in federal child welfare policy at least since 1961 when the first federally authorized reim bursement of state foster care costs was conditioned in part on court finding that remaining in the home would be contrary to the welfare of the child p l 9731 the adoption and child welfare assistance act of 1980 pl 96272 which largely established the framework for current federal child welfare policies and programs extended and expanded the significance of courts in federal child welfare policy in addition to contrary to the welfare findings federal foster care fundi ng to state child welfare agencies was further conditioned on court finding that reasonable efforts had been made both to preserve childs family in order to prevent removal and once child had been removed that reasonable efforts had been made to enable the child and hisher family to be reunited further to receive full foster care and child welfare f unding pl 96272 required state child welfare agencies to tablish case review system for children in foster care that ensured each foster child court hearing within 18 months of hisher entry into foster care and periodically thereafter11 at each of these dispositional hearings pl 96272 stated th at the court was to consider the future status of the child including but not limite d to whether the child should be returned to the parent should be continued in fo ster care for speci fied period should be placed for adoption or should because of the childs special needs or circumstances be continued in foster care on permanent or longterm basis in 1997 the adoption and safe families act asfa pl 10589 revised federal child welfare policy in ways that give special urgency to timeliness of court actions in child welfare proceedings and that also emphasize safety as key determining factor in all of its decisions asfa changed the name of the dispositional hearing to permanency hearing insisted that such hearing must be held later than 12 months after ch ild enters foster care and every 12 months thereafter at this hearing the court must determine the plan for the childs permanent placement reunifica tion adoption legal guardianship placement with fit and willing relative or if none of these plans would be in the childs best interest placement in another planned permanent living arrangement in keeping with its emphasis on safety asfa amended the statute to provide that reasonable efforts to preserve or reunite family are not needed in cases where child is determined under state law to be an abandoned infant been subjected to statedefined aggravated circumstances or where the childs parent has committed certain specified egregious crimes eg murd er of another of the parents children at the same time it required the child we lfare agency to initiate court proceedings necessary to terminate the parental righ ts of any such abandoned infant or child whose parent had committed specified egregious crime further state agencies were required to initiate th same termination of pare ntal rights proceedings on behalf of any child who has been in fo ster care for the last 15 out of 22 months unless specified situations are met or child welfare agency can document to court why this would not be in childs best interest like the earlier courtrelatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33350crs9 12 among the requirements of pl 96272 that ffected courts and which were noted by the victims of child abuse act were 1 the determination of whether child welfare agency has made reasonable efforts to prevent foster ca re placement 2 approval of voluntary foster care placements and 3 provision of procedural safeguards for parents when their parent child relationship is affected 13 for additional information see crs report rl32976 child welfare programs authorized

various times and somewhat in sync with this legislative history congress has acted to authorize projects intended to improve court handlin g of child welfare cases however funding to support these projects has not always been appropriated and even before the recent amendments and expanded program funding provided by the deficit reduction ac t pl 109171 the court improvement program represented the largest single source of funding and program authority related to court performance in child welfare proceedings victims of child abuse act citing both an increase in abuse and neglect cases attributed to drugrelated maltreatme nt of children and the new requirements placed on juvenile and family courts by the adoption assistance and child welfare act of 1980 pl 96272 the victims of child abuse act of 1990 title ii pl 101647 required the department of jus tices office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention ojjdp to provi expanded technical assistance and training to judicial personnel and attorn eys to improve the judicial systems handling of child abuse and neglect cases with specific emphasis on the role of the courts in addressing reasonable effort s that can safely avoid unnecessary and unnecessarily prolonged foster care placement12 the statute authorized grants for these purposes to be made to 1 nationa l organizations to develop model technical assistance and training programs and 2 juvenile and family courts congress has never ppropriated separate funds under this authority for grants to state courts however funding to deve lop model technical ssistance and training programs has been provided to the nati onal council of juven ile and family court judges in every year beginning with fy1992 over that time funding has risen gradually from 500000 to just over 2 million13 the national council has primarily used this funding to develop its model courts initiative through which it provides training technical assistance and other resources intended to permit courts to test new ways to continually improve their handling of child welfare cases there are some 31 model courts located in 23 states and the district of columbia currently part of this initiative and with this funding th national council has developed publications and pr ovides technical assistance and training programs to improve handling of child abuse and neglect cases14
