expenditures have been voiced over the past 30 years one key flaw in the budget process id entified by critics of tax expenditures is the divided treatment of tax expenditures and direct ex penditure programs in the executive branch the treasury draws up the ta x expenditure budget for review by the office of management and budget omb and other administrative agencies prepare the direct expenditure budgets in congress the budget and appropriations committees fix the discretionary spending levels for each functional budget category while the taxwriting committees the ways and means committee in the house and the senate finance committee are given revenue floor within this revenue level the taxwriting committees can trade off tax rate changes with tax expenditures and the appropriations committees can tradeoff one direct expenditure program for another typically replacing tax expe nditure with direct expenditure would involve moving bill through multiple co mmittees consequently tax expenditures often either overlap or conflict with dir ect expenditures because they have not been integrated into the budget process for appropriations tax expenditures are often alternatives to other policy instruments such as grants consequently national social and economic goals are sometimes met through the tax code rather than through direct ex penditures regardless many experts argue tax expenditures are often less efficient than direct expenditure programs in promoting these important economic and social goals at the same time still other tax expenditures appear not to meet any social or economic goal in general tax expenditures tend to reduce the progressiv ity of the income tax system and add to the complexity of the tax system from the taxpayers point of view furthermore unlike direct expenditures the benefits of much of the tax expenditures go to taxpayers in the upper part of the income distribution and they often subsidize an activity for which the taxpayer receives benefit this report will be updated as gislative developments warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33641contents estimates and trends 2 revenue losses 19742007 4 word of caution about

and credits have been added to the tax code of course for the first 25 years of the income tax tax expenditures were relatively unimportant prior to world war ii the federal income tax was of little economic importance individual nd corporate income tax receipts amounted to less than 2 of gross domestic product gdp by 1945 however income tax receipts accounted fo r over 15 of gdp and as the income tax became more economically important so did the tax subsidies from the special deductions exemptions exclusions and credits the joint committee on taxation jct estimates that these tax subsidies also known as tax expenditures will amount to 1034 billion in 2007 over six times the projected 2007 federal budget deficit2 in the mid1960s the department of the treasury became interested

are not examined in the annual budget process6 third more welloff taxpayers benefit disproporti onately from tax expenditures because of the progressive nature of the income tax system7 this report examines the trends in tax expenditures the arguments for and against tax exemptions the composition of tax expenditu res and who benefits from selected tax expenditures estimates and trends tax expenditures include reductions in tax liability resulting from special tax provisions to determine if provision is tax expenditure the jct defines baseline or reference income tax structure referred to as the normal income tax law which has broader concept of income than under us tax law8 the committee staff uses its judgement to distinguish between what are normal income tax provisions and what ar special provisions the department of the treasury uses similar procedure to identify tax expenditures but uses two baseline income tax structures the normal income tax baseline and the reference income tax baseline the reference tax baseline is closer to existing tax law and c onsequently identifies fewe r tax expenditures this baseline has been used by the treasury since 1982 prior to 1982 there were few differences between the tax expenditures lists of the jct and the department of the treasury since both used the same baselin after 1982 the differences between the two lists have grown the jct has used consistent methodology to define and estimate tax expenditures over time whereas the department of the treasurys methodology has changed from admin istration to administration9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33641crs3 9 continued expenditures stated in the fy2002 budget b ecause of the breadth of this arbitrary tax base the administration believes that the c oncept tax expenditure is of questionable analytic value see tax expenditures ch 15 in omb analytical perspectives budget of the united states gover nment fiscal year 2002 feb 2001 p 61 10 the choice of the baseline tax law system is probably the most controversial aspect in defining and measuring tax expenditures see douglas kahn and jeffrey s lehman tax expenditure budgets critical view tax notes mar

287other baseline tax law struct ures have been proposed10 one commonly proposed baseline is the consumption tax ba seline this base line has fewer builtin distortions than the income tax for example the choice between future consumption that is saving and current consumption is not biased as it is when income is taxed many of the largest ta x expenditures would longer be defined as tax expenditures using this baseline concept and an alternative set of tax expenditures would be produced neither the jct nor the department of the treasury however use this baseline fu rthermore many obs ervers believe it is unlikely that the us income tax will be replaced by consumption tax in the foreseeable future the value of tax expenditures can be estimated in two ways the jct estimates tax expenditures in terms of revenues lost to the us tr easury the revenue loss of tax expenditure is straightforward and easily understood concept it is simply taxes not paid and represents revenues forgone by the gove rnment in addition to the revenue loss estimates the department of the treasury also estimates the outlay equivalent of tax expenditures this concept is not as intuitive as the revenue loss concept and assumes that the tax expenditures could be replaced by direct government outlay11 the jcts revenue loss estima tes are used throughout this report the top 16 tax expenditures

deep recession in the early 1980s income tax revenues fell in relation to gdp the economic expansion in the mid to late1980s did not increase income tax revenues relative to gdp to an appreciable

2001 recession and the 2001 nd 2003 tax cuts income tax revenues began to pick up in 2004 due to th strengthening economic recovery source authors calculations of omb and jct data the trend in aggregate revenue losses from tax expenditures the solid line is displayed in figure 1 aggregate revenue losses from tax expenditures depend on the number of special tax provi sions tax rates and the level of income marginal tax rates affect revenue losses of tax expenditures by ch anging the amount of taxes that would be paid in the absence of tax expenditures for example the government forgoes 50 in tax revenue for each 100 in sh ielded income if th tax rate is 50 but forgoes only 30 if the tax rate is 30 so even if shielded income remains constant the revenue loss can change by changing the tax rate as the level of income rises individuals will be pushed into higher tax brackets with higher marginal tax rates consequently the revenue loss from shielded income will increase holding the amount of shielded in come constant in addition rising income0510152025 1974 1977 1980 1983 1986 1989 1992 1995 1998 2001 2004 2007yearpercentage tax expendituresincome tax revenuesfederal

for an explanation of the actlevels probably increase the amount of inco shielded from taxation as individuals increase charitable contributions or take on greater mortgage debt the number of tax expenditures increased from 71 in 1974 to 133 by 1987 the period when aggregate revenue losses of tax expenditures increased from less than 6 of gdp to almost 10 of gdp see figure 1 in addition to the increase in the number of tax expenditures some existing tax expenditures were expanded such as allowing nonitemizers to deduct charitable contributions13 the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 reduced tax rates eliminated or scaled back various tax expenditures and broa dened the tax base14 consequently the aggregate revenue losses of tax expenditures fell dramatically from 97 of gdp in 1987 to 54 of gdp just two years later essentially the tax rate reductions were paid for by the elimination or reduction of various tax ex penditures in ddition the tax rate reductions reduced the revenue losses of th remaining tax expenditures throughout the 1990s the revenue losses of tax expend itures slowly increased as 1 income increased during the economic expansion 2 new tax expenditures were enacted and 3 several existing tax expenditures were expanded by 2007 the aggregate revenue losses of tax expe nditures were estimated to be 76 of gdp about 63 times the federal budget ficit in that year word of caution about aggregate revenues losses the revenue loss of each tax expenditure is estimated separately that is it is an estimate of the gain in income tax revenue from the repeal of only the provision under consideration assuming changes in ot her provisions or in taxpayer behavior many tax expenditures were in fact adopted to affect taxpayer behavior it is therefore unlikely that the aggregate estimated revenue losses of all tax expenditures as reported in figure 1 would be equal to the actual gain in income tax revenue from the repeal of all tax expenditure provisions there are variety of reasons the two would not be equal first taxpayers itemize only if their deductions are greater than the standard deduction or zero bracket amount for example suppose two itemized deductions are individually less than the standard deduction but together are greater eliminating one deduction would increase the amount of tax paid by taxpayers affected because they now take the sta ndard deduction elimin ation of the other deduction now would have effect on tax liability in this case the sum of the individual tax expenditure estimates would be greater than the gain in revenue from elimination of both tax expend itures in simulation limination of 12 selected tax expenditures led to the sum of the indi vidual tax expenditure s estimates being 175httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33641crs7 15 this is based on the authors analysis of the irss 2002 public use tax file the 12 tax expenditures are the mortgage interest deduction the property tax deduction the deduction for state and local income taxes the charita ble contribution deducti on the ira contribution deduction the student loan interest deduction the exclusion of untaxed social security benefits the exclusion of taxexempt interest the tuition tax credit the savers tax credit the child tax credit and the earned income credit these tax expenditures were chosen because they are reported on tax returns and are available in the data file see the appendix for description of this data file 16 the same logic applies to the budgetary sa vings from eliminating or scaling back program that provides transfer payments to individuals as the benefits are reduced or eliminated individuals may become eligible for other similar government programs or change their behavior to qualify for these programs consequently the budgetary savings could be less than expectedgreater than the revenue gain from elimination of all 12 tax expenditures15 this simulation ignores however unmeasurable ch anges such as the increase in interest rates and thus interest inco if taxexempt bonds were longer taxexempt the taxexempt interest reporte d on tax returns likely understa tes the additional taxable income taxpayers would have if this exclusion were eliminated second eliminating exclusions and deduc tions could push taxpayer into higher tax bracket in this case the sum of the individual tax expenditure estimates could be less than the revenue gain from elimination of all the tax expenditures for example the elimination of two large tax expenditures the exclusion of pension earnings and contributions and employer c ontributions for health insurance would push many middleincome taxpayers into higher tax brackets whereas the elimination of only one may not third taxpayer behavior may change in response to the elimination of special tax provisions taxpayers would probably l ook for alternative ways to shield income from taxation consequently revenue gains from the elimin ation of tax expenditures may be less than estimates th at incorporate the above in teraction effects but ignore behavioral changes16 because of these three effects simply summing the tax expenditure revenue loss estimates may not provide an accu rate estimate of the effect that elimination of tax expenditures would have on federal tax revenues it is unknown if the sum of individual tax expenditure re venue losses oversta tes or understates the actual effect of the simultaneous elimination of all tax expenditures nevertheless examining the sum of tax expenditure revenue loss estimates over time probably provides good approximation of the general trend in the effect of tax expenditures on income tax revenue given the relatively long life of many tax expenditures it is unlikely that the bias from simply summing tax expenditures estimates changes much from year to yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33641crs8 17 see stanley s surrey pathways to tax reform cambridge ma

expenditures appeared when the term was first coined stanley surrey the assistant secretary for tax policy in the johnson administration argued that tax expenditures were inferior to dir ect expenditures in achieving various social and economic goals and were barrier to tax reform that woul d restore fairness to the tax system17 recent criticisms of tax expenditu res often fall into one of three categories first there are those who iden tify the budget process as the source of the growth in the use of tax expenditures s econd many analysts continue to argue that tax expenditures are less effective than direct expenditures in achieving social and economic goals18 third some argue that tax expenditures increase the complexity and reduce the fairness of the income ta x thus undermining public support for the tax system these criticisms are examined in turn tax expenditures in the budget process the flaw in the budget process identifie d by critics of tax expenditures is the divided treatment of ta x expenditures and direct expenditure programs19 i n the executive branch the department of the treasury draws up the tax expenditure budget for review by the office of ma nagement and budget omb other administrative agencies prepare the direct expenditure budgets for example the department of health and human services prepares the budget for several public assistance

discretionary spending levels for each functional budget category the taxwr iting committees the ways and means committee in the house and the senate finance committee are given revenue floor within this revenue level the taxwriting committees can trade off tax rate changes with tax expenditures the appropriations committees can trade off one direct expenditure program for another but committee can trade off tax expenditure for direct expenditure in particular category the two tax writing com mittees could however repl ace tax expenditures with mandatory spending programs within their

advantages that tax expenditures had in the budget process the bea not only set discretionary spending caps but also t payasyougo paygo requirement for mandatory spending and tax changes paygo required that any new increase in mandatory spending or decrease in tax reve nues could not add to the deficit the bea was revised and exte nded throughout the 1990s but most of its provisions expired at the end of fy2002 critics of tax expenditures argue that the two taxwriting committees and the department of the treasury especially the internal revenue service often lack the expertise background and staff resources to design effective tax expenditures to meet desired economic and social goals24 consequently these critics suggest closer coordination between the depa rtment of the treasury and the other agencies and between the taxwriting committees and ot her committees to make better use of program area expertise but they note that efforts at coordination between government agencies often produce delay and confusion rather than cooperative activity25 in contrast to these critics there are those who argue that the treasury and the congressional taxwriting committees are less pr one to

important but have fallen into disuse over the years the various analyses of tax expenditures suggest that neither the executive branch nor the congress appear to have much enthusiasm for comprehensive examination of tax expenditures several analyst have observed that tax expenditures resemble entitlement spending in many respects 29 first everyone who qualifies receives the benefits of tax expenditures second jurisdiction for tax expenditures and many entitlement programs is with the two congressional taxwriting committees from time to time commissions have been set up to exa mine entitlement spending and recommend reforms to reduce the longterm costs of these programs yet tax expenditures are rarely discussed within the context of entitlement reform in 1994 however some

empirical research suggested that tax expenditures for charitable contributions would be more effective than comparable direct expenditure program39 subsequent research challenged the theoretical justification for the charitable contribution tax expenditure40 furthermore recent empirical research indicates that taxpayers charitable contributions may not be as sensitive to the tax system as originally estimated41 fairness and complexity of the income tax ideally commentators suggest that tax policy should be structured to meet several basic principles or goals42 most importantly tax system should raise adequate revenue to run the government and meet the needs of the governed second the tax system should be fairly s imple and comprehensib third basic sense of fairness suggests that those with equal ability to pay ta xes should pay equal taxes this is sometimes referred to as horizontal equity lastly many argue that the principle of vertical equity or progressiv ity those with greater ability to pay taxes should pay greater proportion of thei r income in taxes is important43 this last principle however is somewhat controve rsial even though about twothirds

should pay larger share of their income in taxes than those with lower income44 tax expenditures or the special exclus ions exemptions and deductions from income often conflict with one or more of these tax policy principles one tax analyst for example simply states tax expenditures make the tax system worse according to the goals of fairness efficiency and simplicity45 in addition wall street journal columnist noted that tax breaks generate lot of hassle and complexity that chews up time and money and i suspect the government creates tax breaks that are claimed far more ofte n by sophisticated upperincome taxpayers than by others46 this suggests that tax expenditures tend to reduce the progressivity of the income tax system as an example of the complexity that tax breaks or loopholes add to the tax system consider the individual income tax forms taxpayers must file one of three income tax forms form 1040ez form 1040a or form 1040 the easiest form to fill out is the form 1040ez it is for taxpay ers who claim depe ndents do not itemize deductions do not claim adjustments to in come and receive only selected types of income next form 1040a is for taxpayer s who can take advantage of some tax breaks but do not itemize deductions last form 1040 is for taxpayers who receive income from variety of sources can take advantage of any tax break or itemize deductions table 2 shows the estimated average preparation times for the three income tax forms for the 2007 tax year th amount of time that must be devoted to filling out each of the forms increases drama tically with

conflict with the goal of horizontal equity since the deductions exemptions exclusions and tax cr edits are typically targeted or claimed by subset of taxpayers one analysis shows that the eic and the child tax credit provide much more favorable treatment for lowincome families with children than for other families with similar income47 the same analysis suggests that phasing out itemized deductions personal exemptions and the child tax credit could increase horizontal equity at the upper end of the in come distribution with the demonstrated inequities in the us income tax system it is hardly surprising that almost half of the respondents in recent survey said the federa l income tax is either not too fair or not fair at all48 the changing composition of direct and tax expenditures tax expenditures represent an important share of total government support for many economic and social goals over time national priorities change as do the favored policy instruments to address new and existing priorities consequently the importance of tax expenditures in providi ng government support in meeting various goals will likely change as well for example one analyst has documented that tax expenditures have been increasingly used to promote social policy goals instead of business investment49 but how does the changing composition of tax expenditures interact with direct expenditures have tax expenditures become more important than direct expenditures in providing government support the first set of two bars in figure 2 shows the proportion of total government support accounted

tax expenditures in th is function include the mortgage interest deduction the deduction for pr operty taxes on owneroccupi ed residences and the exclusion of investment income on life insurance and

governme nt support from tax expenditures fell from 44 in 1980 to about 34 in 2007 this is probably due to the dramatic growth in medicaid outlays over this 27year period the final functional category with si gnificant proportion of tax expenditures is general government and fiscal assistance this category includes for example the deduction of state and local government income taxes as tax expenditure and funding for legislative functions as dir ect expenditure the importance of tax expenditures in this functional category increased from 62 in 1980 to over 75 in 2007 overall the proportion of government support offered through tax expenditures increased by only three percentage points ove r the past 27 years but almost 90 of tax expenditures occur in only 5 of 18 broa d

improve the wellbeing of individuals and families these policies can include government programs that promote educa tion health housing and income security often social welfare direct expenditures ie

outlays two of these the earned income and the child tax credits are refundable tax credits in that if the tax credit exceeds the taxpayers tax liability the government sends the taxpayer check for the difference55 consequently these two tax credits are both tax expenditure and direct expenditure the federal outlays shown in table 3 are the direct expenditure portion of these tax credits the total federal outlays for these 15 direct expenditure programs were 13977 billion in fy2007 the social security pr ogram both retiremen t and disability is the largest with direct expenditures of 5843

expenditures the remaining programs are considerably smaller each has less than 40 billion in federal outlays these social welfare programs can be divided into public assistance and social insurance

for fy2007 they are estimated to total 1034 billion equiva lent to 76 of gdp and 401 of estimated federal reve nues in comparison the congressional budget office projects that the fy2007 budget deficit was 162 billion about 16 of the estimated revenue losses from tax expend itures in recent years both the dollar amount and the number of tax expenditure s have been growing tax expenditures however are an im portant source of government support designated to achieve variety of economic and social objectives of the total government support directed to achieving social policy goals tax expenditures account for almost third of this suppor t but unlike social welfare direct expenditures the benefits of much of the tax expenditures go to taxpayers in the upper part of the income distribution and th ey often subsidize an activity for which the taxpayer receives benefit furthermore research has questioned the effectiveness of some tax expenditures in achieving the stated social objectives over the years number of analysts academics and policy makers have voiced their concern about the growing importance of tax expenditures and their effect on longterm fiscal problems some mbers of the 1994 bipartisan commission on entitlement and tax reform thought that ta x expenditures should be included as part of reforms to rein in titlement spending more r ecently the century foundation working group on tax expenditures recomme nded that the administration and the congress consider scaling back or eliminating many existing tax expenditures and exercising restraint in proposing new ones and the government accountab ility office recommended that tax expenditures be subjected to systematic reviews and performance evaluations but various obser vers suggest that neither the executive branch nor congress appear to have much enthusiasm for such comprehensive examination the research evidence suggests that comprehensive examination of tax expenditures would likely conclude that some tax expenditures make use of the strengths of the tax system and have been successful in achieving their economic or social objectives some tax expenditures address valid economic and social goals but have been ineffective direct expenditures may be more effective means for achieving the objectives and some tax expenditures do not appear justified on either economic or
