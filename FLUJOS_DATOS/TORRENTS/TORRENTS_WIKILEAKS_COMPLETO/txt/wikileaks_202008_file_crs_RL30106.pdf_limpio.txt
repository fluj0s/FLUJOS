distinguish between statelevel and locallevel agencies in the determination f eligible re cipients all eligible providers are guaranteed direct and equitable accesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30106crs10 in terms of matching federal funds 75 federal share or 25 nonfederal share means10 that for every 4 spent on an activity 3 comes from federal sources and 1 must be derived from nonfederal sources this
