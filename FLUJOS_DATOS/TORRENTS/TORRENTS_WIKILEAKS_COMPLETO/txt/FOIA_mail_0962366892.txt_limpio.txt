from mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk to noguer maria mnoguermetogovuktar10 tar10egsuctacza subject re precipitation map for the box date fri 30 jun 2000 080812 0100 xflowed dear chapter 10 sorry i missed out on the meeting in general i like the proposed figure and suggested box contents and i particularly agree that the diversity of downscaling methods and results precludes using them as basis of consolidated regional conclusions i also agree with others that it looks better with the signs included however there are 23 points that concern mostly from the perspective of climate scenarios chapter 13 and also chapter 9 it needs to be made very clear if any numbers are cited in the box eg 26degc for continental warming that these refer to only one forcing scenario namely 1 pa rather than talk about ghg and sul i would suggest the more conventional nomenclature of gg and gs the sul runs are not just sul forcing of course which might give that impression another very important caveat concerns the gs sul results these all stem from is92a type aerosol forcing ipcc sar most of the new sres forcings used in tar and chapter 9 for example have much smaller or even positive so4 forcing relative to 1990 in principle this could actually switch the sign of the precip changes in some regions there is the danger of inconsistency here between chapter 9 tar aerosol effects and chapter 10 box sar aerosol effects if this is not carefully explained for example in cam and jja it appears that aerosols switch the p change from strongly negative to being uncertain but this is only for is92a aerosol forcing it is not conclusion that would be valid for sres aerosol forcing as filippo says another key uncertainty not represented in the box is forcing uncertainty again chapter 9 present wide range of tglobal results part of which relates to prior assumptions about which sres forcing materialises we do disservice if we give the impression in chapter 10 box that these regional responses are independent of what future forcing materialises for example under the lowest sres forcing b1 the precip response in some regions would revert back to being very small and therefore indistinguishable from noise with regard to temperature and filippos comment chapter 9 has global maps of t change averaged across the standard set of aogcm experiments ranges are also shown this is in effect the information being soughtfor by readers of chapter 10 is it not i would have thought that backreferences in the box to figure 99 would be sensible see you all in victoria mike at 1435 270600 0100 noguer maria wrote dear all here are two examples that paul has put together regarding the map of changes in precipitation drawn from figure 105 do you think it works please send any suggestions that you may fig01apdf fig01bpdf regards maria dr maria noguer ipcc wgi technical support unit hadley centre for climate prediction and research the met office london road bracknell berkshire rg12 2sy uk tel 44 0 1344 854938 fax 44 0 1344 856912 email mnoguermetogovuk wwwmetofficegovuk wwwipccch xflowed
