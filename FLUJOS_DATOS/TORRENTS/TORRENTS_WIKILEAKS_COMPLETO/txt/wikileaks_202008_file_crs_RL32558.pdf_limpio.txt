httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32558the 911 commission and national counterterrorism center issues and options for congress summary the national commission on terrorist att acks upon the united states hereafter 911 commission issued its final report in july 2004 as one of its 41 recommendations the 911 commission reco mmended the creation of national counterterrorism center nctc as proposed by the commission an nctc would have two primary functions intelligence nd joint operational planning the director of an nctc would be appointed by the pr esident with the advi ce and consent of the senate and would report to the commi ssions proposed new national intelligence director on august 27 2004 the president si gned an executive orde r establishing the nctc legislatively there are numerous b ills which have proposes the codification of an nctc the commissions recommendation would use the existing terrorist threat integration center ttic as the foundati on for an nctc concept incorporated in both the executive order and in some draft legislative proposals appendix i compares the main provisions of the 911 commissi ons nctc recommendation with the existing executive order and some legislative pr oposals on this matter the ttics primary mission is to fuse analyze and disseminate terrorism threat intelligence across the us government prior to the publication of the final report the intelligence community was moving to collocate the ttic with elemen ts of the fbis counterterrorism division and components of the central intellig ence agencys counterterrorism center although the ttic itself does not have any ope rational role the functions and roles of the as yet unnamed new entity while devoid of statutory basis may be approaching the commissions nctc concept this report which will be updated exa mines number of issues as congress considers codification of an nctc one issue is whether the centralization remedy the commission has recommended fits the problems associated specifically with the 911 intelligence failure and perhaps more broadl the systemic maladies affecting the intelligence community while some say centralization is remedy for lack of intelligence coordination particularly across the foreigndomestic divide others say it may have an unintended effect of creating groupthink bias or an inclination of groups working under pressure to bolster information which supports the groups perceived conclusion while di scounting contradictory inform ation some believe that the success of the goldwaternichols dod reorganization act of 1986 in improving interservice relationships and in breaking down the individual military services stovepipe problems makes it valid model for intelligence community reform others note that goldwatern ichols applied to one cabinet department sharing the specialized military culture and with the militarys unique mission of warfighting they argue that this does not necessarily make it good model for broad range of separate civilian and military agencies trying to improve analysis and operation there may be ideal model for intelligence community re form the joint operational planning role recommended for an nctc may be worthy of debate as it is open to interpretation there are at least four options for congressional consideration 1 nctc with intelligence and operational planni ng duties 2 nctc restricted to an intelligence role 3 nctc restricted to an operational planning role and 4 status quo plus viewing the newly forming collocated entity as pilot program for potential nctc

the question of how the term policymaking is defined could affect any debate on differentiating the respective roles of an nctc and the nscs counterterrorism staff particularly with respect to the

execution of these operations it would assign opera tional responsibilities to lead agencies such as state the cia the fbi defense and its combatant commands homeland security and other agencies6 the commission recommends that an nctc have personnel and budgetary authorities but it would not have any authority for policymaking7 function the report stated would be best left to the president and the nati onal security council the commissions report recommends the nc tc director who would be appointed by the president and confirme d by the senate must have the right to concur in the choices of personnel to lead the ope rating entities focused on terrorism specifically including the head of the count erterrorist center the head of the fbis counterterrorism division the commanders of the defense departments special operations command and northern command and the state departments coordinator for counterterrorism8 the commission believes an nctc should function as civilianled unified

of coordinator or lead agency quarterback according to the commission the numerous strate gic and tactical maladies that contributed to the overall intelligence failure on 911 were caused in part because one was fir mly in charge of managing the case and able to draw relevant intelligence from anywhere in the government assign responsibilities across the agencies foreign and domestic track progress and quickly bring up obstacles to the level where they could be resolved11 inadequate jointness crossing the foreigndomestic divide the commission points out distinc tion between ad hoc cooperation and true joint action of tentimes citing the example of reform of the department of defense dod unde r the department of defense reorganization act of 1986 pl 99433 oct 1 1986 100 stat

behalf of the fbi or cia or bilateral coordination across the fo reigndomestic divide12 it cites three interrelated and tangible benefits of joint action 1 more effective and comprehensive planning 2 execution with one quarterback informed by common knowledge bank and 3 pooling of relatively scarce count erterrorism talent13 lack of adequate integration be tween joint intelligence and joint action

presidents preferences however traditional functions of the assistant to the president for national security affairs and the nsc staff include policy advisory role and an institutional process manager role although the nsc velops and promulgates national security policies and strategies and plans for contingenc ies it is generally not directly involved in the execution of operations designed to implement those strategies other than through its coordinating role see philip odeen organizing for national security international security vol 5 1 summer 1980 see also philip odeen andrew j

state of the union speech jan 28 2003 would integrate not just the intelligence collected across the government to inform various c onsumers but also the operations foreign and domestic that may be required to proactively act upon this knowledge base the commission describes how the responsibility for joint planning is often left to the relatively small white house national security council14 coordinating body that was not necessarily designed to be directly involved in the execution of operations to implement the national security strategies it coordinates nd develops since the publication of the 911 commissions final report in late july 2004 there has been substantial movement on the creation of national counterterrorism center on august 27 2004 president george w bush signed executive order national counterterrorism center creating the nctc as created by the executive order the nctc has similar responsibilitie s to those which were recommended by the 911 commission two bills which have proposed the codification of an nctc are hr 10 the 911 recommendations implementation act and s 2845 the intelligence reform act of 2004 the ttic and the functions it performs are an integral part of an nctc in the commissions recommendation the executive order and the draft legislation the existing terrorist threat in tegration center and an nctc the establishment of the ttic was first announced in the january 2003 state of the union speech established to reme dy the oftenstated pre911 failure to connect the dots regarding counterterrori sm intelligence the organizations stated purpose is to merge all terrorist threat information in single location15 the organization became operational in may 2003 and was intended to be stand alone joint venture of the intelligence

member agencies of ttic include the fbi cia the departments of homeland secu rity state defense health and human services and energy as well as the nuclear regulatory commission16 how does the commissions proposed nctc differ from the ttic in hearings before the senate governme ntal affairs committee ttic director john brennan stated that once the ttic has acquired through its member agencies the requisite number of strategic intelligence analysts it would have the integrated intelligence analysis capability the commission recommended for an nctc17 according to mr brennan the proposed nctc would expa nd the number of ttic partners provide for an overall framework for how the constituent members interact and constitute recognition that the new organization was center of gravity for analysis of counterterrorism intelligence with such recognition brennan stated would flow an ability to acquire additional analysts and further integr ate counterterrorism intelligence however one of the most significant differences in what functions the proposed nctc would perform that ttic ca nnot now is joint operational planning this function which will be ddressed more indepth belo w has not been very well defined and may be regarded as the most contentious element of the nctc proposal nctc institutionalizing existing practice another similarity between the ttic and the proposed nctc is based on the current reorganization of certain counterterrorism elements in the us intelligence community the ttic elements of the fbis counterterrorism division g enerally special agents and strategic intelligence analysts working on international terrorism and some parts of the cias counterterrorism center are in the process of being collocated intelligence officials point out that this process of co llocation is not formal merger but rather an organizational construct that will allow existing agencies to integrate intelligence analysis yet operate under their own legal authorities as currently envisioned and particularly from an operational persp ective each of these collocated agency elements will fuse their intelligence and information for greater analytical capability but retain control over their own intelligence operations that may be informed by the enhanced integrated analysis according to director brennan the ttic has completed its move to the new facility john pistole the fbis executive assistant director for counterterrorism and counterintelligence has stated that the fbi has moved into the new locati on less than 100 people18 mr pistole believes the proposed nctc when compared to the ne w combined effort already in process serves to institutionalize some of the policies and practices that we are currently engaged in19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32558crs6 20 some observers believe that while the fa ilure to connect the existing dots may have contributed to the 911 intelligence failure th more proximate reason for the failure was an inability of the us government to collect the right dots simply stated these individuals believe that the intelligence comm unity failed to penetrate terrorist cells at home and abroad resulting in too few useful dots see robert bryant america needs more spies the economist july 10 2003 21 see statement of philip mudd assessing americas counterterrorism capabilities before

the following functional and regional threats weapons of mass destruction proliferati on international crime and narcotics chinaeast asia middle east and russiaeurasia see final report p 413issues for congress the commissions recommendation to tablish national counterterrorism center raise potential issues for congress many of these issues relate to centralization and information sharing and the various roles of an nctc does the centralization remedy fit the problem n f t h structural and systemic problems often cited as contributing to the 911 intelligence failure was the failure of the intelligence community to c onnect the dots20 the essence of this claim is that while there was plethora of information indicating that qaeda was planning to attack us interests there was insufficient information sharing and coordination be tween various elements of the us government to prevent such an occurrence more centralization is seen as potential remedy to the lack of coordination and information sharing among existing intelligence entities centralization could bring together disparate elements of the intelligence community working against the same target with common goal albeit with different tools and means particularly from an intelligence analysis perspective the possibility of having frequent interactions among analy tical colleagues from the numerous agencies of the intelligence community could be hi ghly valuable as philip mudd deputy director of the cias counterterrorist center stated in recent congressional testimony in reference to the collocation of his unit w ith other counterterrori st elements of the intelligence community i think collo cation is underrated in terms of the importance for cooperation and we have started moving21 centralization and information sharing there are numerous intelligence centers22 currently in existence across the intelligence community each was established based on the premise that integrating various intelligence disciplines the methods by which intelligence is coll ected with respect to particular functional or geographic threat could lead to more timely information sharing and clearer assessment of that issue23 some have questioned the success of the center concept judging it dubious orga nizational remedy to what may be ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32558crs7 24 see frederick p hitz and brian j weiss

international terro rism activities see executive order 12333 united states intelligence activities 27 see final report operational opportunities pp 355356 28 going back to the codification of the intelligence community in 1947 there was reluctance on the part of many policymakers to unite foreign and domestic intelligence for fear that doing so would estab lish an american version of secret police see stewart baker should spies be cops foreign policy winter 19941995 for an assessment of some of the intelligence abuses which led to th development of further restrictions and the

intelligence activities apr 26 1976 see also senate committee on the judiciary domestic security investigation guidelines hearings juneaug 1982functional problem that is the cultural bias in the intelligence and law enforcement communities not to share information24 furthermore some say although the intelligence business is largel an inexact social science and the intelligence function s inherent limitations the estab lishment of integration centers such as the cias counterterrorism cent er in 1986 for onestop shopping may have reinforced the implicit expectation that the mission to preempt disrupt and defeat terrorist activities at the earliest possible stage was achievable within the united states with high degree of confidence25 another aspect of the sharing problem that contributed to the 911 intelligence failure was the lack of coordination between foreign intelligence26 and domestic intelligence elements27 over the years real or perceived wall had developed between the foreign intelligence and domestic intelligence entities of the intelligence community28 the uniting and strengthening american by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct

killer of innovation including innovative thinking about information sharing in recent testimony before the senate select committee on intelligence amy b zegart former nsc staffer stated although any meaningful reform must start with structure structural changes alone will not be enough organizational culture is sile nt but deadly innovation killer fixing cultural pathologies that have crippled our intelligence system is hard but not impossible two good first steps woul d be to change training and career incentives30 consistent with other recomme ndations of the commission the fbi in particular is attempting to alter its culture by establishing cadre of intelligence professionals who approach rrorism with proactive and national security bias as opposed to its traditional law enfo rcement and reactive approach31 the concept of knowledge bank such as an nctc is another manner through which such authorities may be exploited to ensure that gaps between the foreign and domestic intelligence communities are filled centralization and analysis while one of the weaknesses of the intelligence community has been failure to share intelligence according to some another systemic problem has been an inability to adequately assess existing intelligence centralizing analytical capability is another contentious issue some think it could lead to group think32 mentality report on

steps that we go through to produce analysis it remains an imprecise proce ss neither the process nor the product will ever be perfect communitys prewar intelligence assessments on iraq published by the senate select committee on intelligence concluded the intelligence community ic suffered from collective presumption that iraq had an active and growing weapons of mass destruction wmd program this group think dynamic led the intelligence communitys analysts collectors and managers to both interpret ambiguous evidence as conclusively indicative of wmd program as well as ignore or minimize evidence that iraq did not have active and expanding weapons of mass destruction programs this presumption was so strong that formalized ic mechanisms established to challenge presumptions and group think were not utilized33 some intelligence professionals argue that there are benefits to analytical decentralization and the intentional development of competing analyses consistent with this concern and directed more at the proposed nid recommendation than the nctc proposal yet nevertheless german henry kissinger former national security adviser and secretary of state recently wrote that an excessively centralized system may magnify the inherent danger of intellectual conformity34 the 911 commission recognized the need to encourage and nurture innovative analysis and cited as one of four systemic failures35 the lack of imagination36 across the us government with respect to projecting scenarios in which qaeda would conduct catastrophic attack inside the united states using

recommends th establishment of what could be considered centralized bureaucracy it was aware that the most serious disadvantage of the nctc is the reverse of its greatest vi rtue that any clear cut centralization of authority to manage and be held acc ountable for the struggle against islamist terrorism may concentrate too much power in one place37 nevertheless the recommendation that nctc be established illustrates that thecommission concluded that th overall benefits of joi ntness and centralization outweigh those arguments favoring analyti cal decentralization in recent testimony before the house select committee on homeland security thomas h kean chair of the commissi on stated we be lieve our proposal will strengthen analysis and enhance competitive analysis arguing robust nctc with strong official in charge of the intelligence community would have forced the type of sharing that could have prevented the attacks of 911 38 there are potential tradeoffs and inhere nt tensions between remedies which address two of the major maladies facing the intelligence community failure to connect the dots or of imagination and analytical tendencies toward groupthink remedies for the former include centraliza tion while those for the latter include the development of possibly decentralized analytical units in direct or indirect competition with one another john hamre former deputy secretary of defense asserts that implementing an organizational solution to just one of these problems connecting the dots will worsen the other he proposed that if nid be established it only be given authority over the intelligence factories that is the national reconnaissance agency nati onal security agency and national geospatial agency while leaving the craft shops conducting human intelligence collection and intelligence analysis more decentralized39 while this argument is directed more at the nid concept it could also have implications for the centralization of strate gic counterterrorism anal ysis within an nctc goldwaternichols and the intelligence community40 the 911 commission draws analogies between the recommendations it made and the substantial and positive changes that took pl ace in the defense department as result of the goldwaternichols act41 among some experienced intelligence professionals conventi onal wisdom in the wake of 9 11 has been in favor of somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32558crs11 42 see john j hamre better way to improve intelligence 43 these legal authorities include 10 usc armed forces 32 usc national guard 50 usc war and national defense as well as 37 usc pay and allowances of the uniformed services 44 for example the national security act of 1947 and executive order 12333 united states intelligence activities outline the respective duties and responsibilities for members of the intelligence community yet the domestic in telligence community operates largely under attorney general guidelines which do not gene rally govern the overseas activities of the foreign intelligence or defense intelligence agencies similarly depending on the subject area the director of central intelligences directives dcids may or may not apply similarly across the intelligence communityversion of goldwaternichols for the intelligence community specifically proponents of this view point to goldwa ternichols provisions which increased the authority responsibility and staff resources of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff jcs with corresponding diminuti on of the powers of the corporate jcs and other jcs members increased the author ity and responsibility of the unified and specified combatant commands that control us forces globally and changed officer personnel management po licies so as to increase the importance of joint interservice assignments and expertise similar legislation it is ar gued would improve central management and control over the disp arate components of the intelligence community some who have worked in the defense and intelligence communities at senior levels acknowledge that the pentagon fiercely fought goldwaternichols but now almost 20 years late r swears by its results42 although some of the underlying coordi nation and stovepipe problems within the modern day intelligence community are similar to those facing the armed forces in the pregoldwaternichols era there are several differences for example whatever the extent of the interservice coordination problems prior to goldwater nichols all of the dod operated under the same broad legal and statutory authorities43 while each of the military services operated and trai ned with minimal joint coordination prior to goldwaternichols they all operated under the same legal authorities title 50 us code war and national defe nse by contrast the intelligence community is composed of 15 different agencies spread across numerous executive departments and operating under some common and some distinct legal and regulatory authorities44 although debatable it coul d be argued that the defense community is more homogenous than the intelligence community the army navy marine corps air force and the numerous interservice defense agencies and field activities are all in one cabinet department nd perhaps more importantly share the unique common mission and culture of the uniformed military preparing for and waging war the intelligence community under existing law nd policy could be perceived as more of loose confederation of related agencies as mentioned above the domestic intelligence community defined largely as

communities continue to opera under different legal guid elines and the need for these distinctions may remain if the united states is concerned about establishing an intelligence service that could be perceived as secret police45 goldwaternichols type reform for the intelligence community could be interpreted as meaning the elimination of any distinctions between foreign and domestic intelligence henry kissinger addressed the issue it does not follow that eliminating the distinctions altogether is the best solution foreign and domestic intelligence should not be merged but should be coordinated by task forces depending on the subject the coordination between domestic and foreign intelligence activ ities could be achieved by institutions such as the national count erterrorism center and possibly by presidential assistant for national intelligence charged in addition with making certain that significant co mpeting intelligence assessm ents reach the president46 some say

anning exceeding the gilmore commissions recommendation in reference to commission staff trip to pakistan and afghanistan to investigate coordination with respect to the hunt for osama bin laden zelikow stated what they found was number of disparate agencies with different legal authorities all doing their thing and then meeting every day in series of meetings in many places trying to make it all converge49 the proposed joint operational role of an nctc is probably its most contentious element because operations are the m eans by which intelligence and defense organizations take tactical actions to imp lement broader nationa l security goals and objectives and they are considered highly sensitive the dimensions of this role are not clear the language of the commissions final report supporting the recommendation is open to inte rpretation with the report stating at one point that law or executive order must define the scope of such line authority50 more strict or literal interpretation of the report language may lead one to conclude that an nctc would engage in joint planning only at the strategy level leaving tactical details and actual ope rational execution to other agencies however given that terms like joint planning and operations can and are construed as meaning more definitive and defined tasks to be acco mplished by existing entities and staff particularly in the military more direct and controlling role in operations for an nctc could also be envisioned there are unanswered questions not only on the scope of this authority but also on how the authority would be implemented some of these questions include operations and the relationship between operational personnel and analysts in both the defense partment and within the intelligence community operations are considered highly sensitive because they can be cove rt and involve the deployment of intelligence sources and methods whic h must be protected to prevent detection some

needs of intelligence operators yet not be captive of or beholden to those responsible for operations for the sake of analytical integrity organizational schemes should ensure that the relationship is

of the cia by deploy ing its best personnel outside the agency doing essentially defensive work mainly concerned with analyzing threats and providing warnings51 moreover there is also concern that by detailing an agencys operational or analytical personnel to an nctc the ss of the close relationship52 between analysts and operationa l personnel at their re spective home agencies may undermine the

different activities to representatives of different agencies of the intelligence community planning and joint planning are generally thought of as terms of art within the overlapping defense and intelligence communities in the military the term joint operational planning has very we lldefined interpretation joint operational planning is conducted within the chain of command that runs from the national command authorities president to the secretary of defense to the combatant commanders and is primarily the responsibility of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the combatant commanders53 it is sequential process performed simultaneously at the strategic operational and tactical levels of war54 among other activities it i nvolves decisions about how to deploy military assets to achieve national security goals and objectives developed and outlined by the national command authority as assisted by the nati onal security council it involves prioritizing targets deciding which military resources should be deployed against certain targets when and how the joint staff at the pentagon particularly j3 ope rations and j5 strategic plans and policy are most

testified the nctc would not break the military chain of commandit would be like the j3 for operations in the joint staff the j3 is not part of the formal chain of command between the president secretary of defense and the combatant commanders but everyone agrees that join t operations planning is essential the nctc would develop joint plans for terrorism operations with military officers directly involved in that planning if th secretary of defens didnt like the plan the plan would change or the head of the nctc would have to bump this issue up to the national security council and the

authorities of an nctc there are major personnelrelated issues asso ciated with potential establishment of an nctc the first involves the official to whom th nctc director re ports the commission recommends that the director of an nctc report to the proposed national intelligence director who in turn would probably report to the president the executive order establishing the nctc stipulates that the nctc director reports to the director of central intelligence under the 911 national security protection act the nctc director would report to th proposed national intelligence director given the joint operational planning role that the 911 commission proposed for an nctc an argument could also be made that in the absence of nid the director nctc could report to either the existing dci or to the special assistant to the president for national security affairs the second issue involves the authority of the nctc director compared to other appointed counterterrori sm officials in the intelligence community under the commissions proposal and as mentioned above the direct or of an nctc must have the right to concur in the choices of personnel to lead the operating entities of the departments and agencies focusing on terrorism specifically including the head of the counterterrorist cent er the head of the fbis counterterrorism division the commanders of the defense department s

is fundamental questi on about whether center such as an nctc should be staffed with its own inde pendent employees that is have its own fte positions and recruit hire train and retain them independe nt of the personnel practices of its constituent agencies or like the existing ttic rely on assignees from existing intelligence community agencies in general and historically the personnel practices and prom otional incentives of intelligence community agencies have indirectly contributed to system that does not encourage an agencys best and brightest employees to undertake detail or assignment to community center according to former nsc official several years ago dci tenet issued directive requiring that officials do rotational tour in another intelligence agency to get promoted to senior ranks every inte lligence agency including the cia ignored him taking temporary assignment in an agency outside ones home is still viewed as careerlimiting move84 it could be argued however if an nctc became the center with respect to counterterrorism as the commission intends then it could become more attractive assignment moreover changes in intelligence community personnel policies requiring cer tain assignments to joint interagency details as prerequisite for promotion to senior level may also pr ove effective if an nctc continues current ttic practice assi gnee staffing the commission recommends allowing leaders of an nctc to be the rating officials for assessing the performance of assignees while at the center proposed budget authorities of an nctc the commission recommends that the head of the proposed nctc should work with the director of the office of management and budget in developing the presidents counterterrorism budget85 the issue of the extent to which the director of an nctc develops coordinates executes and controls the counterterrorism budget is linked to the authorities that may or may not be given to the proposed nid theoretically if nid or strengthened dci were given an appropriation fo r national intelligence and apportion the funds to the appropriate agencies in lin with that budget and with authority to reprogram the funds among the national intelligence agencies to meet any new priority86 the director of an nctc may serve as the nids primary advisor with respect to the allocati on of counterterrorist fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32558crs23 options given the issues outlined above there are at least four broad options the congress may consider with respect to th potential statutory cr eation of an nctc each of the options could be adjusted particularly with respect to an nctcs reporting relationships and placement in the executive office of the president these options include nctc with intelligence fusion and joint operational planning roles this option would essentially adopt the commissions proposed role for an nctc supporters of such an option coul d state that such centralization would remedy the lack of coordination between foreign and domestic intelligence community agencies having counterte rrorism responsibilities the alleged proximate cause of the 911 intelligence failure supporters could also argue that this option would ensure there is one pers on in charge of both the domestic and international counterterrorism analysis w ho is responsible for planning operations based on analysis of the entire us g overnments knowledg bankon terrorism however critics could argue that notwithstanding the view that not all counterterrorist analysts should be incorpor ated into an nctc that by centralizing analysis of counterterrorism information an nctc could foster as an unintended consequence an analytical tendency towa rd groupthink this may be particularly true if an nctc represents the us governments only center for strategic analysis while responsibility for tactical analysis re mains within individual agencies of the intelligence community moreover some critics could argue that by detailing intelligence analysts and those responsible for joint operational planning to an nctc the offensive operational effectiveness of the intelligence community agencies currently conducting counterterro rism operations could be diminished nctc restricted to an intelligence role under this option an nctc would have responsibilities for joint operational planni ng essentially an nctc would represent knowledge bank for anal ysis which could be called upon by all intelligence community agencies conduc ting counterterrorism operations in practice an nctc would look like the cu rrent ttic only with additional agency membership perhaps significantly more analysts as well as additional authority over personnel and budgetary matters supporters of this option could argue that while the concept of having knowledge bank for intelligence analysis is sound operational planning is unique depending upon the intelligence community or defense department entities i nvolved thus operational pl anning should remain the province of existing agencies these propone nts might add that while there are also clear benefits to joint ope rational planning major decisi ons such as which agencies should be brought into individual joint ope rational planning exer cises should be left to the agencies originating the operation cr itics of this option could argue that in order to prevent the next catastrophic terrori st attack against the united states there must be one individual in charge who can integrate not only intelligence analysis with respect to threat assessments but so the operations whic h may be based on an holistic assessment of the threat simply stated these critics could argue the organizational separa tion of strategic counterterro rism intelligence from joint operational planning based on that intelligence would likely result in dysfunctional intelligence community httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32558crs24 nctc restricted to joint operation planning role under this option an nctc would not have any respons ibility for analysis of the threat yet would be responsible for join t operational planning vari ation of this option could have an nctc responsible for just inte rnational or solely domestic operations and intelligence collection while the ttic would continue to exist an nctc would focus its energies utilizing ttic analyses and assisting elements of the intelligence community to jointly plan operations to preempt and prevent terrorist attacks against us interests at home and abroad suppor ters could argue the benefits of joint operational planning are so ta ngible and important that this function should be the sole focus of an nctc under this opti on an nctc would build close relationships with the ttic for analysis but maintain separate structure to ensure the integrity of ttic analysis these supporters might also argue that benefits of joint operational planning are so great that resistance to it must be surmounted they might note that the individual military serv ices were all vehemently opposed to the goldwater nichols act when it was debated and enacted in 1986 but have long since acknowledged its overwhelmingly positive ffect on dod operational planning and actual conduct of military opera tions critics could argue because the relationship between operations and analysis should be close it makes little nse to maintain an artificial and organizational distinction between ttic and an nctc with only joint operational planning respons ibilities critics might add that an nctc with sole responsibilities for joint planning might simply draw away existing and scarce operational planning talent that would be best left in the agencies and close to the actual operators status quo plus under this option ttic would continue on its current path and congress would provide rigor ous oversight of the ongoing executive branch effort to collocate elements of the fbis c ounterterrorism division the ttic and elements of the cias counterte rrorism center supporters could argue that what is happening on the ground today is in essence piloting of the nctc concept these supporters could argue th at further executive action andor formal legislation may be premature at this time supporters of this option might also argue that better way to coordinate across the domesticforeign intelligence divide is to further utilize the interagency task force concept bringing together experts across the intelligence community and other agencies to coordinate count erterrorism matters without creating permanent new bureaucracies and finally supporters might argue that quickly codified facto merger between foreign and domestic counterterrorism agencies c ould discount the complexities associated with these issues on the other hand critics could argu that lack of codification of existing practice could result in the perception that the united states is implicitly endorsing the creation of what could be perceived as secret police development which may further undermine the credibility of the in telligence community in the eyes of the public critics could argue that while the us government is moving in the right direction on counterterrorism the status quo even with enhanced oversight is unacceptable and reform is not taking place quickly enough critics might also contend that it is essential that congress and the executive branch expeditiously and clearly define what have b een historically somewhat va gue relationships duties and roles among foreign domestic and military intelligence agencies with respect to counterterrorism without such an explic it overarching and codi fied framework for coordination across the foreigndomestic divide on counterterrorism thereby coveringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32558crs25 any potential intelligence gaps the united states may repeat the same mistakes it made prior to the att acks of september 11 2001 conclusion with respect to the functions an nc tc would perform the 911 commissions proposals appear to be fairly consistent with draft legi slative proposals as well the executive order 13354 national counterterrorism center however whether an organization identical to the executive orde rs nctc or some va riation is codified may depend on whether lawmaker s believe that centralization can remedy what some consider to be major cause of the 911 intelligence failure inadequate sharing of existing intelligence across the foreigndomestic divide conceptually centralization produces benefits through closer coor dination and sharing of information historically organizational culture also has played an important role in impeding information sharing it is possible that organizational changes may have the greatest probability of success if they are combined with shifts in organizational cultures as well as human resource practices that reinforce sense of jointness in the intelligence community one potential unintended c onsequence of centralization can be however the discounting of contentious or contrarian views of national security threats continued awareness of this possible unintended consequence along with training to ensure that competitive analyses and independent thought which identifies and questions underl ying andor inherited assu mptions may go long way toward ameliorating any groupthink tendencies the relationship between intelligence analysts and operators is another important issue which may be worthy of some debate as qualified operational and analytical talent is in relatively short supply in the shortterm centers may be force to positively leverage the scarcity of human resources however detailing substantial portion of ones strategic analytical or operational pla nners to center could have negative implications for contributing agencys own counterterrorism effectiveness in carrying out assigned missions
