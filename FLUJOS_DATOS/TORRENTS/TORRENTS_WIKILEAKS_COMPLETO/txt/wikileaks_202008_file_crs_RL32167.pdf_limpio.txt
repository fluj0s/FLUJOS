policy summary at least 50 documented incidents in mo re than 20 countries around the world many involving arrest or tention of north korean di plomats link north korea to drug trafficking such events in the context of credible but unproven allegations of large scale state sponsorship of drug production and trafficking raise important issues for the united states and its allies in combating international drug trafficking the challenge to policy makers is how to pursue an effective counter drug policy and comply with us law which may require cutting off aid to north korea while pursuing other highpriority us foreign policy objectives including 1 limiting possession and production of weapons of mass destruction 2 limiting ballistic missile production and export 3 curbing rrorism counterfeiting and international crime and 4 addressi ng humanitarian needs reports that the democratic peoples republic of north korea dprk may be limiting some of its food crop pr oduction in favor of drug crop production are particularly disturbing given the countrys chronic food shortage s though the acreage in question is comparatively small anothe r issue of rising concern is the degree to which profits from any north korean drug trafficking counterfeiting and other crimeforprofit enterprises may be used to underwrite the costs of maintaining or expanding north korean nuclear and missile programs as the dprks drug trade becomes increasingly entrenched and argu ably decentralized analysts question whether the pyongyang regime or any s ubsequent government would have the ability to effectively restrain ch activity should it so desire since 2003 overall seizures of north koreanlinked methamphetamine and heroin are generally down arguably in res ponse to enhanced inte rnational attention paid to such activity in the wake of th april 2003 seizure of heroin carried on the north korean vessel the pong some suggest that this decline in seizures being identified as dprk origin is because north korean source methamphetamine is now regularly being mistakenly identified as chinese source given growing links of chinese criminal elements to north koreas drug pr oductiontrafficking activities in line with such conclusion are press repor ts in late 2006 of the arrests in differing locations in china of north korean nationa ls involved with chinese criminals in the trafficking of methamphetamine however it is not clear from the reports whether the drugs were of dprk origin or whethe r the north koreans arrested had links with dprk officials reduction of illicit drug seizures linked to the dprk has also given rise to speculation that north korea has cu t back on if not dramatically curbed its drug trafficking activity and is compensating from the loss of income in this arena by beefing up its production and traffi cking of counterfe it brand cigarettes it remains clear however that regardless of the mix of dprk criminal activities at any particular given point in time income from dprk criminal activity continues to play pivotal role in overall dprk financeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32167contents background 1 l l g t i n s f d r u g t r f f i c k i n g4i s s u s

and south korean intelligence sources pattern of activity emerges which indicates that 1 in the 1970s north korean officials bought and sold foreign source illicit drugs 2 in the mid1970s north korea began cultivating opium poppy as matter of state policy 3 in the mid1980s north korea began refining opium poppy for export and exportin g refined opium products 4 and in the mid1990s after heavy rains reduced opium production in 1995 and 1996 north korea began manufacturing and exporting methamphetamine to expanding markets in southeast asia increasingly enlisting the help of foreign criminal groups in its smuggling operations if this pattern reflects reality an important question is the degree to which the government of north korea may respond to increased financial pressures and expanding methamphetamine markets in southeast asia by dramatically increasing already record leve ls of reported drug trafficking activity some analysts however question the reliability of information reported in the press attributed to north korean defect ors and south korean government sources they note that in closed state such as north korea harddata is difficult to obtain thus what is obtained is fragmentary and i ndirect at best north korea continues to dismiss media reports and speculation on gove rnment involvement in drug trafficking activities as antinorth korean slander based on politically motivated adversary propaganda sources north korean offici als are known to stress privately that corruption drug use trafficking and cr iminal activity in gene ral are maladies to which individuals in all soci eties may fall prey and that any involvement by north korean individuals in such activity is in way stateconnected or state sanctioned further officials have stressed that in instances where such activity has come to the attention of authorities individuals involve d have been duly punished finally north korean officials maintain that issues ch as drug trafficking and production are matters that should be handled and are be st handled by their government as an internal matter officials also point to the politically charged milieu of allegations of drug trafficking by north korea and point out that drug smuggling by individuals in the diplomatic community is not limited to north korea36 issues for decisionmakers at least fifty documented drug

production are partic ularly disturbing though the acreage in question is compara tively small another issue of rising concern is the use of profits from any rth korean drug trafficking counterfeiting and other crimeforprofit enterprises to underwrite the costs of maintaining or expanding north korean nucl ear and missile programs37 central to the policy bate over the quantity of dprk illicit poppy production is the need for hard data such as satellite imagery to confirm the extent of reported opium poppy cultivation in north korea if such data have been collected through remote sensing they have not been publically disclosed38 enhanced policy focus and law forcement intelligence cooperation on targeting reporting and tracking north korean opiumheroin and methamphetamine trafficking and production in the late 1990s have made it significantly more difficult for north korean entities to enga ge in illicit smu ggling activities39 the apparent result has been need for north korean trafficking fronts to enter into joint venture arrangements with criminal organizations in neighboring nations notably russian chinese and south korean and japanese criminal enterprises as profits are generally shared often as much as 5050 in such ventures the level of north korean drug smuggling activity might need to more orless double to keep income levels for dprk illicit drug enterpri ses

see japans illegal drug seizures down 50 in 2005 mof report by kyodo news continuedany such joint ventures were established to facilitate the smuggling and distribution of dprk source drugs in contrast re ported information in the pong case can be interpreted as sign that such joint venture relationships to the degree they may exist have become twoway street with north korean enterprises smuggling drugs for partner groups as well gr owing area of international concern is escalating ties between those in the dprk who engage in criminal activity and foreign transnational criminal groups notwithstanding growing number of analysts attach significance to the fact that there have been few documented instances of dprk drug trafficking activity being detected recently they note that the scale of north korean linked drug trafficking activities that has been detect ed since 2003 is small relative to seizures linked to the dprk in previous years th ey cite as well the fact that although in 2004 two incidents were publi cally reported involving dp rk officials stationed abroad at embassies these two incidents had been the first to come to light in several years41 in addition the march 2006 incsr notes that there were seizures of methamphetamines in japan in 2005 linked to the dprk traditionally as much as 30 to 40 of methamphetamine seizures in japan have been linked to the dprk however the report speculates that increasingly seizures of dprk source methamphetamine may be mistakenly identified as chinese source given growing links of chinese criminal elements to north koreas drug productiontrafficking activities supporting the theory of dec line in dprk drug productiontrafficking activity the march 2005 incsr notes that the origin of heroin and methamphetamine seized in taiwan during 2004 was genera lly ascribed to domestic manufacture whereas in past years dprk origin illicit drugs have been among those seized moreover japanese pre ss reports cite government offici

china in the same report what appears to be chinese mafia figure states in fluent japanese that japanese yakuza members are now buying dprk source methamphetamine directly in china and that since 2002 drug traffi cking between china and the dprk has increased by several to ten times both in number of transactions and volume43 notwithstanding lack of hard evidence of any recent seizures involving illicit drugs of confirmed dp rk origin or drugs being tra fficked by dprk nationals with confirmed or likely links to dprk official s press reports in early 2007 cite earlier arrests in china of north korean nationals involved with chinese criminals in the trafficking of methamphetamine44 for example in november 2006 chinese police in shenyang reportedly arrested north korean and others connected to an international drug ring which had trafficked large quantities of methamphetamine into china earlier in july 2006 the media reported arrests by chinese police in two other cities dalian nd dandong where chinese police arrested other north koreans and japanese appare ntly trying to bring methamphetamine purchased near the north koreanchinese border to japan45 these were the first cases of involvement of dprk democratic people s republic of korea nationals in drug trafficking to become public in two years arguably however fewer seizures may simply be the result of changes in patterns of shipments designed to conceal any direct dprk role in the process countermeasures spurred by in creased international scrutin of north korean trading activities consistent with this line of reasoning would be the conclusion that since levels of enforcement success against dprk linked trafficking in illicit drugs often vary dramatically it is not possible at th is time to reach definitive consensus about any changes in trends underlying such ente rprise an alternative explanation would be that north korea has cut back on if not dramatically curbed its drug trafficking activity and is compensating from the loss of income in this arena by beefing up its production and trafficking of counterfeit bra nd cigarettes in contrast the aggregate portfolio of north korean criminal activity over the past decade paints different picture information available points to an expansion in both the scale and scope of north korean cash generating criminal activity46 in addition

result is situation in which criminal activity is seen as playing an increasingl pivotal role in supporting north koreas fragile economy best us available source estimates sugge st that the dprk earns at least 500 million per year in profit from combined criminal activity and gross revenues are suggested by some to total 1 billion or more regardless however of the current dollar amount such ventures generate it ppears that the scale and scope of north korean criminal activities are on the rise increasingly analysts view this as global and not just as regional concern another question yet unresolved is the degree to which pyongyang will be able to maintain control over drug smugglin g and other foreign currency generating activities if they become more decen tralized with more foreign criminal organizations and gangs par ticipating deteriorating economic conditions and rising corruption among midlevel dprk party functionaries threatened with declining lifestyles gives rise to speculation in the intelligence community that rogue operations constitute an incr easing proportion of any current dprk drug smuggling activity48 final and daunting challenge facing policymakers both in the dprk and beyond is the degree to which the north kor ea regime would be able to curtail any remaining illicit drug activity and other foreign currency generating criminal enterprises should it desire to do so49 policy analysts in the past have suggestedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32167crs16 49 continued in the dprk is on the rise especially among party elites and other affluent peoplethat north korean drug trafficking activity has been carefully controlled and limited to fill specific foreign exchange shortfalls however increasingly concern exists that north korean crimeforprofit activity may become runaway train gaining momentum but out of control experien ce suggests that those engaged in the drug trade and other continuing criminal enterprises often find themselves addicted to the income generated and are unlikely to cease such activity absent draconian disincentives moreover over time such illicit activity is often seen as becoming institutionalized taking on life on its own phenomenon which does not bode well for those who would seek to curb drug trafficking and othe r revenue generating international criminal activity based in north korea
