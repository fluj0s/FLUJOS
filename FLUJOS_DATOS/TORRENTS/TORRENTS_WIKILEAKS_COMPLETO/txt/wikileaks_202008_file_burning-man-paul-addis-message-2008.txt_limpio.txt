date wed 2 jul 2008 153021 0700 subject staffannounce 2007 arson outcome by now most of you have probably heard the news that the perpetrator of the arson at the 2007 burning man event has plead guilty to the crime of second degree arson and has been sentenced to 1248 months in jail and ordered to pay restitution of 25000 in damages to the burning man organization often times the news media doesnt always give the full backstory so were sending additional information to our staff because we believe that all of you who were affected by the arson have right to know the full story plus every one of us is representative of the project and we sometimes find ourselves being asked questions within the community about the organizations position on issues like this one in fact some members of the staff have already asked few questions about burning mans role in the arson so were going to address them here please note that this email is being sent to staff only and staff policies prevent cutting and pasting work emails to other online forums but feel free to communicate the information contained in this email should others in the community inquire about the organizations take on the outcome q what was the burning man organizations role in the prosecution of the defendant the defendant was arrested by the pershing county sheriffs office and faced charges in nevada for first degree arson destruction of property and illegal fireworks the prosecutor had choice to bring fullblown trial and seek the maximum penalties for all of these charges or to accept pleabargain for reduced crime with lesser sentence the prosecutor advised the burning man organization that he believed pleabargain would be the best choice for all parties involvedthe state the defendant and the victim in the interests of justice and fairness the burning man organization agreed with the prosecutor that lesser charge and lighter sentence would be better for everyone including the defendant q what would have happened if the defendant had demanded trial instead of pleabargaining the defendant could have been sentenced to nine years in jail for firstdegree arson q could burning man have refused to press charges or refused to turn over receipts to the prosecution part of putting on the burning man event means maintaining good relations with pershing county so that we can continue to have the burning man event on blm land within that county good relations means cooperating with criminal prosecutions refusing to press charges for felony arson that threatened human life would not bode well with the government and law enforcement agencies in nevada that support our event nor would it bode well with the participants and staff who could have been seriously injured or killed by this crime plus if the organization had not submitted receipts the prosecution would have subpoenaed them anyway finally there was enough evidence against the defendant for the county to prosecute without burning man pressing charges q how did the organization compute the restitution costs once the prosecutor requested the information the accounting department compiled documentation of the following costs lumber hardware burlap wax fabric neon labor fuel meals delivery charges and heavy equipment use because some receipts were not available the organization relied on the costs for the first build as evidence of what the costs of the second build were of all the receipts that were available the total came to little over 30000 based on the evidence submitted by the prosecution as well as the good points raised by the defendants counsel the court felt that 25000 was fair and reasonable amount q what about the cost of the artwork under the pavilion that was never exhibited due to the crime the total cost of the art grants and the wages of the staff who worked so hard to get the projects on playa came to an additional 42000 in documented costs however criminal restitution only covers materials that were actually lost to recover these additional costs would require bringing civil suit for destruction of property q is the burning man organization going to pursue civil suit against the defendant for the additional costs that were not recovered in the criminal sentencing the organization feels that the defendants plea bargain is fair and just outcome for all parties involved q so how does the organization feel about the sentence an organization does not have feelings of course only the individual people within it do like all of you and the rest of the community the staff and the board were diversely affected by the premature burn and each of us has our own human response to the outcome not one of us can speak for what everyone around here feels now that this chapter of our history ends but we can say that were uniformly glad to have this crime behind us and were looking forward to burning the man together in 2008 ray allen executive project manager black rock city
