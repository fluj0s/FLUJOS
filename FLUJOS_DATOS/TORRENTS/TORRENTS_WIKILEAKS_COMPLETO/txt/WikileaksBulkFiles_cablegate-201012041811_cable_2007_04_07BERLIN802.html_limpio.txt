scenesetter for angela merkel in washington goals for europe goals at home ref berlin 747 classified by dcm john koenig reason 14b and d 1 c summary angela merkel arrives in washington in an enviable position of political strength both at home and in the eu however she is conscious that her strength derives largely from the weakness of her counterparts and other factors beyond her control achieving her goals for the eu in the transatlantic context these are focused on climate change and the transatlantic economic initiative will reinforce her position at home and in the eu and serve as springboard to success on the larger g8 stage success for merkel is also success for the us even after the german eu presidency we will want the atlanticist merkel to remain dominant force within the eu in berlin successful summit will strengthen her and other transatlanticists against those who favor policy of vocal public antagonism end summary leading in the eu muddling through at home 2 c angela merkels role as germanys and europes leader is undisputed other leader of large member state is politically fit enough to offer himself up as leader her leadership of the g8 and germanys intrinsic weight and economic recovery are further boosts at home merkel is not only riding high in opinion polls 70 percent popularity rating and enjoying the benefits of leadership at time of longsought economic growth but has also wrongfooted her coalition partner social democrats with reformist domestic social policies however in both cases her apparent strength is not entirely of her own making but derives in large part from her office the weakness of her counterparts or from other factors beyond her control she took the helm of the eu at time when progress on the european project had largely come to halt when european institutions were unsure of how or in which direction to move and as noted alternative leaders were present in berlin her coalition partner and rival the social democrats spd are dealing with weak leadership vacuum of ideas and challenge from the left 3 c merkel has responded to these similar circumstances with quite different tactics in the eu she has asserted german and her personal leadership over the council secretariat especially with respect to her goal of sipdis developing road map for furthering the eu constitution she has sidelined brussels by putting her own representatives on the road to discuss the constitution in other capitals and has weighed in personally as needed to find compromises that keep the constitutional project moving forward likewise she has vigorously pursued the transatlantic economic initiative within the eu to remove regulatory barriers and has pushed for agreement on the new eu climate change and energy initiatives she has not succeeded in all her undertakings prospects for new eu partnership and cooperation agreement with russia remain distant for example still the view that we hear from brussels is of vigorous and effective leadership in berlin merkel is known for her reticence to engage in aggressive politics preferring to stay in the background until the correlation of forces is clear and then engaging to nudge the debate in her preferred direction though the spd is weak merkel has been reluctant to push it hard her strategy appears to be aimed at building and consolidating her own and her partys dominance with view toward clear victory in 2009 elections rather than attempting to score victories now that could alienate significant voter groups washington whats in it for merkel 4 c we sum up merkels goal for the useu summit as being to achieve substantive progress in the useu relationship for its own sake and to build lasting foundation for her leadership in the eu and in germany the substantive agenda is clear and we need not explore it in detail here it is focused on our political cooperation in key areas climate change and energy security as well as the transatlantic economic initiative we recognize that in these and other areas european goals are not exactly aligned with our own nonetheless success in these areas the former key concern of european publics and the latter important to sustaining european growth after long period in which transatlantic relations were dominated by negative headlines and exchanges focused on other regions would prove merkels particular competence at succeeding in europes key external relationship after success in washington merkel berlin 00000802 002 of 002 can count on maintaining her position in europe against any incoming french president and uk prime ministerinwaiting brown success in washington will also strengthen her hand in the followon summits with russia canada and japan and sets the stage for success in g8 summit deliberations on climate change 5 c at home summit success may enable merkel to end the spds ability to use loud public principled criticism of the us as winning tactic gerhard schroeder won the 2002 election with his public attacks on us iraq policy but if merkel brings home meaningful agreements especially on issues with domestic resonance such as climate change and transatlantic economic cooperation she will have shown the german public that her policy of constructive engagement with the us brings real benefits on issues of concern to it foreign policy especially transatlantic relations is one of the few areas where the spd still enjoys greater public support than does the cducsu success in washington may undercut the spd on that theme as the cducsu has already undercut it on many domestic social themes note on style 6 c merkel is pushing for summit that is more than predictable setpiece quickly forgotten she looks for real decisions to be made during the summit discussions this does more than just ensure that she has something important to do it emphasizes her personal commitment to restoring europeanamerican relations and her belief in facetoface engagement we recognize the difficulty of organizing discussions in this format but believe we too stand to gain by such an approach whats in this for washington 7 c post has previously reported on merkels riskaverse approach to foreign policy we do not expect her to change her leadership style because of success in washington the real benefits for the us lie in how success will affect the public understanding of how germany can best build relationship with washington and its view of the us the changing of which is frequent theme in conversations with german leaders and thinkers successful summit will also reinforce our message that the us and eu are natural partners closely bound by common interests as cautious conservative in difficult coalition merkel will not run great risks for the us but if she can show the public that cooperation with the us works the effect will be to cut the risk she runs by cooperating with the us it is more complex path to closer and more effective relationship than we would perhaps like but our observation of merkel and our conversations with her advisors lead us to see it as the best path available timken jr
