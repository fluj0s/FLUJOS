eric weiss analyst in financial institutions government and finance division changes to the sba disaster loan program proposed legislation in the 110th congress summary members of the house of representatives and senate have introduced bills in the 110th congress hr 1361 and s 163 respectively to modify the small business administrations sba response to major disasters the bills agree on certain fundamental questions but differ in the details both bills address ways to improve sbas response to large disasters there is some congressional concern that following an exceptionally large disaster sba staff may not be large enough to be able to respond as rapidly as congress might wish both bills would increase disaster staffing and both would augment sbas staff by allowing certain private lenders to either make loans on behalf of sba or make loans that sba would guarantee in manner similar to sbas other loan programs other provisions would allow for closer congressional oversight of sba disaster responses under both bills sba would continue to make disaster loans to households and businesses the maximum personal real property limit of 40000 and the real personal property limit of 200000 would not change the maximum size of disaster loans to businesses would increase from 15 million to 3 million house or 2 million senate both bills would allow economic impact disaster loans to be made to nonprofits for the first time under both bills sba would make smaller quickly approved loans that could be folded into larger permanent loan the house would set maximum for the expedited business loans of 25000 the senate leaves the maximum to sba this report will be updated as events warrant contents introduction 1 background 2 similarities 3 major provisions unique

disbursement schedule 11 changes to the sba disaster loan program proposed legislation in the 110th congress introduction since the disastrous hurricane season of 2005 congress has continued to examine legislative options that would enhance the federal response to natural disasters members of both the house of representatives and the senate have introduced separate bills in the 110th congress to improve the small business administrations sba disaster loan programs1 witnesses at hearings held by the house small business committee and the senate small business and entrepreneurship committee reported that sba was slow to start accepting disaster loan applications issued unclear guidance to those applying for loans did not adequately coordinate the disaster loan programs with state and other federal agencies was slow in processing applications and lacked loan programs that could have sped rebuilding after the hurricanes sba has responded by making internal changes2 federal disaster assistance has long history in 1906 congress appropriated 25 million to speed the recovery from the san francisco earthquake and subsequent fires since its creation in 1953 sbas disaster loans have contributed to the recovery from disasters that have large impact over large area because sba disaster loans are the federal governments main disaster relief program they are available to individuals businesses regardless of size and nonprofits although sba disaster loans are not meant to replace insurance against disasters evidence shows that homeowners do consider flood insurance and disaster loans to be substitutes for each other3 1 rep nydia m velazquez and 10 cosponsors from both parties introduced hr 1361 on march 6 2007 sen john f kerry introduced s 163 on january 4 2007 with four cosponsors from both parties 2 see for example us congress house committee on small business sba unprepared to respond to future largescale disasters february 14 2007 available at

evaluation american journal of agricultural economics vol 61 3 august continued crs2 reduced interest rates to disaster victims amount to federal grant to those receiving disaster loans all disaster loans carry belowmarket interest rate and borrowers who are unable to obtain credit on similar terms elsewhere pay lower rate than borrowers who can obtain loans from other sources4 for example sba disaster loans to homeowners to repair their houses following hurricane katrina in 2005 were charged interest rates of 2687 and 5375 in comparison the rates on private sector 30year fixedrate mortgage in the fourth quarter of 2005 ranged from 577 to 633 on an average sba homeowner disaster loan of 45000 this could save the borrower between 100 and 1000 over the 30year life of the loan according to the sba more than 97 of the disaster loans made for the 2005 hurricanes were at the lower rate and very few loans were at the statutory maximum sba has more relaxed underwriting standards than private sector lenders but it can and does reject applications when the ability to repay is doubtful5 background most sba programs involve technical assistance grants to nonprofits that provide technical assistance to small businesses advocacy and guaranteeing private sector disaster loans to small businesses but the agency does make disaster loans directly to renters homeowners businesses and nonprofits these loans are at lower interest rates than can be obtained from private sector lenders and are made to borrowers who cannot obtain private sector loans on similar conditions currently homeowners and renters may borrow up to 40000 to cover unreimbursed personal property losses following disaster declaration although there are exclusions for unusually expensive property such as art work homeowners may also borrow up to 200000 to cover unreimbursed real property losses businesses and nonprofits may borrow up to 15 million for unreimbursed real property losses in addition businesses but not nonprofits may borrow up to 15 million combined with the previously mentioned real property losses for economic injury which is the inability to make normal payments for supplies payroll etc overview of congressional proposals hr 1361 as engrossed and s 163 as reported seek to speed sba processing of disaster loan applications by adding and reallocating staff to the agencys disaster loan office involving the private sector streamlining processing and increasing congressional oversight both bills also expand the disaster loan programs the bills take different approaches to implementing these goals 3 continued 1979 pp 496505 4 13 cfr 123104 and 13 cfr 123203 5 some federal emergency management agency programs will accept applications only from those who have been denied disaster loans by the sba crs3 similarities hr 1361 and s 163 take different approaches to modifying the disaster loan programs but they also share some common features both bills would allow selected private lenders to make disaster loans under certain circumstances that the sba would guarantee hr 1361 section 208 s 163 section 202 increase the maximum size of disaster loans to 3 million under the house bill section 212 and to 2 million under the senate bill sections 102 and 2026 provide for quicklyreviewed business disaster loans for up to 25000 under the house bill section 203 and an unspecified amount under the senate bill section 204 make nonprofits eligible for economic injury disaster loans hr 1361 sections 201 and 214 or such loans as the administrator determines to be appropriate s 163 section 101 require sba to develop disaster response plan and to keep it upto date hr 1361 sections 101 102 103 104 105 106 202 209 and 301 s 163 section 105 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 and 301 increase congressional oversight hr 1361 section 301 s 163 section 301 direct sba to study making economic injury disaster loans due to lack of snowfall hr 1361 section 218 s 163 section 116 and require sba to coordinate its activities with fema hr 1361 section 105 s 163 section 219 implementation details of these common features differ between the two bills major provisions unique to hr 1361 in addition the house bill would revise repayment and disbursement terms sections 205 and 206 allow the sba administrator to make grants of up to 100000 to certain small businesses that were turned down for sba disaster 6 the house bill would allow the administrator to waive the limit in certain cases hr 1361 section 215 crs4 loans and are located in areas affected by hurricanes katrina rita or wilma of 2005 section 210 authorize the sba administrator to make offsetting grants to victims of hurricanes katrina rita or wilma who receive other aid that must be used to repay sba loans section 211 allow the sba administrator to refinance existing sba disaster loans in the gulf coast that would allow the borrowers to defer repayment for up to four years section 219 create the position of associate administrator for disaster assistance to be filled by presidential appointee with the advice and consent of the senate section 106 allow economic injury disaster loans eidls for ice storms and blizzards sections 217 allow the administrator to increase the deferment period for repaying disaster loans to up to four years section 204 and direct sba to create disaster loan processing redundancy section 209 major provisions unique to s 163 the senate bill would create small business energy emergency disaster loan and agricultural producer loans sections 401 402 403 and 404 increase the small business bonding maximum threshold from 2 million to 5 million which could be increased by the administrator to 10 million in major disasters section 1067 and require sba to insure consistency between the code of federal regulations cfrs and agency standard operating procedures sops section 110 table 1 summarizes sba disaster loan programs as of january 1 2007 and changes to borrowing limits under hr 1361 and s 163 in all cases the amount that can be borrowed is limited to the lesser of the amount for the disaster loan program shown in the maximum amount column and the

reservist regardless of economic size injury disaster source hr 1361 s 163 and 15 usc 636b analysis of changes to sba planning following the 2005 hurricane season congressional oversight hearings highlighted many shortcomings in the federal governments response among the issues raised were inadequate disaster planning inadequate and inexperienced staffing of sba disaster loan centers and lack of governmentwide planning and coordination the bills seek to address these concerns similar provisions this section analyzes provisions in the house and senate bills that are similar but not identical required disaster planning the house bill would require the sba to develop disaster response plan for each of the sbas 10 regional offices based on the types of disasters likely to occur in the region sba would determine the resources such as staff telecommunications computers and office space required to respond to each type of disaster the report would be completed in 180 days of enactment of the bill and would be updated at least annually the plan would be crs6 developed implemented and maintained by person with substantial knowledge in the field of disaster readiness and emergency response8 the senate bill would direct sba to update existing disaster response plans within three months of enactment and report to congress on provisions including an agencywide disaster oversight council ability to respond to different sized disasters state and local coordination surge plans staffing training lessons learned from the 2005 hurricane season and coordination with fema9 annual disaster drill the house bill would require sba to conduct an annual disaster drill and to report to congress on the exercise10 the senate bill would require onetime disaster simulation exercise11 senior management of disaster planning and response the house bill would require sba to have an associate administrator for disaster assistance who would be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate12 directors for disaster planning and disaster lending would be selected from sba staff and thus would not require net increase in the number of fulltime employees13 the senate bill would require the sba to hire fulltime disaster planning specialist but would not establish the level of the job reserve corps the house bill would require the sba to create disaster reserve corps of at least 1000 people not working fulltime at the administration and who would be able to respond to disasters14 an annual disaster simulation with at least half of the disaster reserve corps would be required to test the disaster response plan and the capacity of sba systems members of the corps would receive annual training and would be distributed around the nation15 sba would be required to develop longterm plans to obtain workspace for the disaster reserve corps to use in times of disaster it would be required to have 8 hr 1361 section 101 9 s 163 section 112 10 hr 1361 section 102 11 s 163 section 112 12 hr 1361 section 106 the sba presently has an associate administrator for disaster assistance but this position is not explicitly listed among the five associate administrators authorized in 15 usc 633b the position does not require senate confirmation the number of associate administrators would not change under the house bill 13 us congress house committee on small business relief for entrepreneurs coordination of objectives and values for effective recovery act of 2007 or the recover act report to accompany hr 1361 110th cong 1st sess hrept 11082 p 25 14 hr 1361 section 103 15 hr 1361 section 104 crs7 backup disaster loan processing facility that could be activated within two days if the primary facility were unusable16 the senates approach would require sba to hire new fulltime disaster planning specialist17 at least 800 employees would be assigned to the office of disaster assistance and 750 employees would be assigned to the disaster cadre18 one employee in each district office would be assigned to be disaster loan liaison between the disaster processing center and disaster loan applicants19 coordination with fema the house bill would require that sba establish regulations to ensure that disaster assistance application procedures are coordinated with fema and other agencies within 270 days of enactment20 analysis of sba response including reporting this section analyzes how hr 1361 and s 163 would change sba response after disaster occurs revised disaster response both bills would require sba to take certain actions as part of its disaster response and mandate new reports to congress this section discusses the similarities and differences in approaches communications tracking the house would require sba to 1 track all communications with applicants for disaster loans 2 keep applicants informed of any additional information that is needed 3 notify applicants of the decision to approve or deny the loan and 4 alert applicants when the primary contact person managing the loan application is changed21 s 163 has similar provision required reporting the house bill would require sba to send congress an annual report on disaster assistance programs22 the report would discuss staffing operational changes program effectiveness and changes to sba disaster procedures in the event of an incident of national significance sba would submit monthly report detailing 1 the number of disaster assistance applications distributed and received 2 the average processing time the amount of disaster loans approved 3 the average time for initial disbursement of disaster loans and 4 the amount of disaster loans disbursed 16 hr 1361 section 209 17 s 163 section 113 18 s 163 section 115 it is not clear if the 750 employees in the disaster cadre are included in the 800 employees in the office of disaster assistance sba requested authorization for 2123 full time equivalent employees in its fy2008 budget request 19 s 163 section 114 20 hr 1361 section 105 21 hr 1361 section 202 22 hr 1361 section 301 crs8 the senate bill would require sba to send congress an annual report plus monthly reports on disaster loan programs during periods of declared major disaster23 the report would discuss 1 lending volume and changes in lending volume 2 the number of disaster loans and dollar amounts 3 funding spent and available 4 how long the available funding is likely to last and 5 details of expenses during presidentially declared disaster sba would be required to make daily reports to congress on sba staffing applications processing decisions disaster loans disbursed and the dollar amounts involved other reports would be required on federal contracting and possible improvements to the disaster loan process new or revised disaster loan programs both the house and senate bills would direct sba to take extraordinary actions in response to super catastrophes that exceed the normal major disaster actions but they differ in both what would trigger the extraordinary actions and what the extraordinary actions would be under provisions in the house bill an incident of national significance would activate special programs and call for stepped up response from the sba an incident of national significance is defined in homeland security presidential directive 5 hspd5 and the department of homeland securitys dhs national response plan and it includes both potential and actual threats as well as actual disasters regardless of cause24 the conditions are more general than major disaster which is limited to natural catastrophes fires floods droughts or explosions that are severe enough for the president to warrant major disaster assistance under the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act stafford act25 the national response plan mentions stafford act major disasters and emergencies as reasons that an incident of national significance might be declared any event requiring coordinated federal and state response such as political convention presidential inauguration or large sporting event could be declared an incident of national significance not every major disaster is an incident of national significance and conversely not every incident of national significance is major disaster in short an incident of national significance includes the most devastating of major disasters along with other events an incident of national significance that would activate the mandatory private sector participation could be an event that is not disaster such as the visit of an international dignitary or national political convention 23 s 163 section 301 24 hspd5 is available at httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200302 200302289html the national response plan is available at httpwwwdhsgov xpreprespcommitteeseditorial_0566shtm 25 for the stafford act see 42 usc 5121 et seq crs9 the senate bill would create category of catastrophic national disasters it would require the sba administrator the secretary of dhs and the fema administrator to establish threshold for catastrophic national disasters and to incorporate the threshold into regulations26 following catastrophic national disaster declaration disaster loans could be made to small businesses adversely affected by the disaster throughout in the nation congress might wish to consider the appropriate place for the provisions establishing and defining the category of catastrophic national disaster27 in the small business act28 or the stafford act in considering the placement congress might consider whether catastrophic national disaster is more an sba disaster issue or if it has broader implications for the nations disaster response increased maximum business disaster loan size the house bill would increase the maximum sba guarantee on business disaster loan to 3000000 from 150000029 in the case of direct loans from sba the maximum loan amount would be 3000000 the senate bill would increase the aggregate business disaster loan limit to 2000000 and authorize sba to increase the aggregate disaster loan limit based on appropriate economic indicators for the region in which that disaster occurred30 the bill would authorize sba to make all types of disaster loans to nonprofits that are located in disaster area or are providing services to those evacuated from disaster area31 it would authorize sba to create contracting outreach and technical assistance program for small businesses that had significant presence in disaster area32 disaster loans for nonprofits under current law business but not nonprofit is eligible for an economic injury disaster loan eidl if the president the sba administrator the secretary of agriculture or state governor finds that disaster has hurt small businesses33 economic injury is defined as the inability to pay bills and operating expenses as they 26 s 163 section 201 27 s 163 section 201 28 pl 85536 as amended 15 usc 29 hr 1361 section 212 section 215 would allow sba to waive the new 3000000 limit for loans to major sources of employment or businesses that would become major sources of employment in the area 30 s 163 section 102 31 hr 1361 section 101 32 s 163 section 105 33 15 usc 636b2d3iii there are also military reservist economic injury disaster loans that would not be affected by this provision crs10 become due or the inability to market or conduct normal business activities both bills would authorize economic injury disaster loans to nonprofits34 postdisaster mitigation loans currently homeowners and businesses may borrow an additional 20 of the disaster loan amount for postdisaster mitigation35 the house bill would authorize sba to make or guarantee postdisaster mitigation loans to small businesses that receive other disaster loans as the result of an incident of national significance36 the amount of mitigation loan could be up to 20 of the damages incurred regardless of insurance or reimbursement nonprofits and businesses in the areas affected by hurricanes katrina rita and wilma would be eligible also for these mitigation loans after an incident of national significance the senate bill would modify the existing 20 postdisaster mitigation loan limit to make the limit 20 of the amount of destruction not 20 of sba disaster loan37 quick decision business small disaster loans the house bill would authorize private lenders to make immediate business disaster loans of up to 25000 to businesses that apply for disaster loans38 sba would guarantee 85 of the expedited loan amount sba would have 36 hours after receiving an application for an immediate loan to make determination on whether or not to grant the loan the proceeds of regular business disaster loan could be used to repay the immediate business disaster loan the senate bill would require sba to create program of immediate shortterm disaster loans within one year after enactment of the bill39 loan amount is specified in the bill regular business disaster loan could be used to refinance the expedited loan and the maximum interest rate on the expedited loan would be one percentage point over the prime rate revised terms the house bill would make several changes to make it easier to repay disaster loan delayed repayments it would prohibit any requirement to start repaying disaster loan for the first 12 months after the final loan disbursement is made and 34 hr 1361 sections 201 and 214 s 163 section 101 35 123 cfr 107 and 123 cfr 204 36 hr 1361 section 201 37 s 163 section 102 38 hr 1361 section 203 39 s 163 section 204 crs11 authorize the administrator to allow deferments of up to four years40 repayment presently based on the amount applied for would become based on the amount disbursed41 sba would be prohibited from imposing supplemental payment on disaster loans in excess of 1 million during the first five years of repayment42 the senate bill has similar provisions regarding repayments collateral requirements the house bill would prohibit sba from requiring business owner to use his or her home as collateral on disaster loans of 100000 or less43 the senate bill would raise to 14000 from 10000 the amount that could be borrowed under the disaster loan program without requiring collateral sba could raise the amount in the event of catastrophic national disaster44 disbursement schedule the house bill but not the senate bill would establish new disbursement schedules based on the amount of the loan45 table 2 summarizes these provisions in all cases the first disbursement could be less if the borrower and sba agree table 2 hr 1361 revised disbursement schedule maximum maximum disbursement loan amount first second third fourth 1 40 50 of remaining 150000 remaining amount 150001 20 30 of 25 of remaining 500000 remaining remaining amount more than 100000 amount and number of disbursements to be 500000 determined by sba but the amount must be at least 100000 source hr 1361 section 206 grants the house bill would authorize two types of grants the first sba grant would be up for to 100000 to small businesses in certain counties and parishes affected by hurricanes katrina rita and wilma46 to be eligible for the grant business must have been in existence for two years before the hurricane 40 hr 1361 sections 204 and 205 41 hr 1361 section 205 42 hr 1361 section 212 43 hr 1361 sections 204 and 207 44 s 163 section 201 45 hr 1361 section 206 46 hr 1361 section 210 crs12 certify that it intends to reestablish itself in the same or certain other counties or parishes and must have been rejected for an sba disaster loan the second type of grant would be to an individual with losses due to hurricanes katrina rita or wilma who received an sba disaster loan and is required to use benefits from other sources such as louisianas road home program to pay off the sba disaster loan47 the grant would be limited to the amount of the repayment to sba the grant would not be considered duplication of benefits ice storms and blizzards the house bill but not the senate would allow economic injury disaster loans for ice storms and blizzards48 both the house and senate bills direct sba to study the possibility of providing disaster loans for the lack of snow49 private sector participation in disaster loan program the house bill would allow sba to create program in which selected private lenders could process approve close and service disaster loans50 these would be sba loans sba would pay private lenders fee not to exceed 2 of the total loan amount most of the time private lender participation would be at sbas discretion during an incident of national significance or when sba approval time for disaster loans averages 30 days or more private sector participation would be activated by statute private lenders with inordinate default rates in the program could be denied further participation high default rate could also be used to exclude private lender from sbas preferred lenders program the senate bill would permit qualified private lenders to make sba guaranteed small business disaster loans51 online disaster loan applications would be permitted sba could not charge the lender fee for the guarantee subject to available funding sba could reduce the interest rate on private disaster loans by up to 3 percentage points house only provisions the following provision in hr 1361 has comparable provision in s 163 military reservist economic disaster loans application period presently sba makes military reservist economic injury disaster loans to small businesses that suffer or are likely to suffer substantial economic injury as the result of an essential employee being called to active military duty during period of 47 hr 1361 section 211 48 hr 1361 section 217 49 hr 1361 section 218 and s 163 section 116 50 hr 1361 section 208 51 s 163 section 202 sba would guarantee up to 85 of the loan crs13 military conflict the small business can apply for the loan starting on the date that the essential employee is ordered to activity duty and not later than 90 days after the essential employee is released from active duty the house bill would extend the 90 days to one year52 senate only provisions several provisions in s 163 as ordered reported have comparable provision in hr 1361 special grants to small business development centers sbdcs sbdcs are nonprofits that obtain some of their funding from the sba they provide training and advice to small businesses in specific geographic area currently sba can make special grants to sbdcs in areas where small businesses have reduced employment because of closing of large business or government facility the senate bill would authorize sba to make grants of up to 100000 each to sbdcs for future closings53 sba would be given the authority to make larger grants in extraordinary situations sba could authorize sbdcs to provide assistance outside of their normal geographic areas when there is disaster declaration54 surety bonding threshold some contracts including many government contracts require the business doing the work to post financial guarantee that the work will be completed as specified in the contract this guarantee is called surety bond and either can be money posted by the business or by pledge by surety bonding company which charges the business fee for the service sba currently guarantees surety bonds on contracts of 2 million or less the senate bill would allow sba to guarantee small business surety bonds on contracts of up to 5 million this could be raised to 10 million at the request of the head of another government agency55 energy emergency and agricultural producer loans the senate bill would create new loan program for small businesses that have suffered or are likely to suffer economic losses as the result of increased heating fuel prices since october 1 200456 the energy loan program would require the president sba administrator or governor to make an appropriate declaration of economic impact following an increase of 40 in heating fuel prices the maximum loan amount of 1500000 could be waived by sba similar program for small agricultural producers would be created in the department of agriculture57 52 hr 1361 section 216 53 s 163 section 103 54 s 163 section 104 55 15 usc 694b 56 s 163 sections 401 and 402 57 s 163 section 403 crs14 analysis of additional issues some additional issues that congress might wish to consider are the impact of the disaster loan program on participation in other government programs and the influence that disaster loans might have on the decisions of people and businesses to locate in disasterprone areas policy analysts frequently examine the relationship between meeting the legitimate needs for assistance following disaster minimizing the cost to the government and taxpayers and encouraging prudent behavior58 people and businesses make decisions about where to locate and to undertake economic activity by considering the costs and benefits of alternative decisions new or expanded disaster loan program could affect these decisions by providing lowcost funds for recovery an enlarged disaster loan program could also affect decisions to engage in pre or postdisaster mitigation as mentioned earlier some may view disaster loan as good substitute for optional flood insurance analysts view subsidized loan programs as way to transfer risk from the private sector to the government few would argue against this transfer when it is because of the failure of federal programs such as federal levee or dam to perform according to specifications or when the private sector has failed to respond as in the case of flood insurance some might argue that the federal government should not intervene in other cases where alternative resources including local government or private planning are available in considering whether to extend disaster loan coverage to more types of disasters such as ice storms blizzards and the lack of snow one concern might be if these are normal or regular occurrence that should be anticipated and whether the expansion of the disaster loan program would encourage businesses to undertake activities with less regard for the risk than they would without the program expansion for example would including the lack of snow shift ski resort on the margin from adding snow making equipment or locating in another location to one that depends on economic injury disaster loans both bills recognize the need for exceptional federal response when the magnitude of the problem is extremely large by historical standards because of the interrelatedness of decisions to rebuild along the gulf coast after the 2005 hurricane season extraordinary federal assistance was offered congress appears to have decided to institutionalize this experience by expanding sbas disaster response team and authorizing private sector participation the two bills differ on what would trigger this response the house bill would trigger the private sectors participation during an incident of national significance or when the average loan processing time for single disaster exceeds 30 days the senate bill would trigger the private sectors response following major disaster or catastrophic national disaster congress might wish to consider whether the new category of catastrophic national disaster is more appropriate than the incident of national significance which 58 see for example us congress senate bipartisan task force on funding disaster relief federal disaster assistance 104th cong 1st sess sdoc 1044 washington gpo 1995 crs15 includes many other events besides natural disasters it might wish to consider whether catastrophic national disaster should be part of the stafford act which might imply that it would be used by other disaster response and recovery programs or if it should be part of the small business act which would imply that it would be used only by sba both bills would create small expedited disaster loans with the rapid approval there will be less time to review the loan applications and it is likely that the loss rate will be higher than on other disaster loans on the other hand the loans would be smaller which would reduce the dollar amount of losses legislative status hr 1361 was introduced in the house on march 6 2007 the house small business committee reported it to the full house on march 30 2007 the house approved the bill on april 18 2007 by vote of 267 to 158 s 163 was introduced in the senate on january 4 2007 on may 7 2007 the senate committee on small business and
