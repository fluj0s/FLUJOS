material and information zachary s davis specialist resources science and industry division summary congress is focusing on problems with security at the department of energys doe national security facilities especially the nuclear weapon laboratories problems include espionage from within the labs and protection of nuclear material and facilities from outside attack this report describes the main components of does security system and reviews current efforts to address shortcomings this report will be updated as events warrant issues for congress several committees of the house and senate are investigating security problems at doe facilities long history of problems has prompted efforts by congress and the executive branch to improve doe security special house committee established in 1998 investigated chinese spying at the doe national laboratories1 the senate select committee on intelligence also conducted an investigation and other committees have held hearings serious breaches of security involving chinese efforts to acquire sensitive nuclear and missile technology from the labs have come to light the cia the fbi doe and the presidents foreign intelligence advisory board have confirmed there were serious losses of classified information from the doe labs2 1 report of the select committee on us national security and militarycommercial concerns with the peoples republic

department of energy presidents foreign intelligence advisory board june 1999 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 related issue involves the security of nuclear weapon materials at doe facilities concerns about inadequate protection of weapon materials intensified after reports that military plutonium at does rocky flats facility near denver colorado could be vulnerable to terrorist attack 3 the director of does office of safeguards and security ed mccallum and contractors responsible for security at rocky flats attempted to call attention to the problems but their concerns were reportedly not heeded by doe headquarters subsequently the contractor filed suit against doe which placed mr mccallum on administrative leave for allegedly disclosing classified information in telephone discussions with the contractor4 doe maintains that security is adequate at rocky flats but has agreed to improve physical security at weaponsrelated sites to address problems with doe security the president issued presidential decision directive pdd61 in february 1998 in april 1998 secretary of energy bill richardson announced new security measures for the national laboratories to address backlog of longstanding security problems on may 11 1999 secretary richardson announced reorganization that would consolidate doe security functions into new central security office in june the presidents foreign intelligence advisory board recommended creating an autonomous or semiautonomous nuclear weapon agency richardson initially opposed creating new agency but now supports senatebacked plan to establish semiautonomous agency congress is currently considering whether these steps are adequate to address the problems of doe security several alternatives to the administrations initial security reform package have been introduced including legislation to move the nuclear weapons program out of doe restrict foreign visits to the labs and improve the accountability of doe contractors on june 9 the house unanimously passed the defense authorization for fy2000 hr 1401 which contained 26 of the 38 recommendations of the house select committee on us national security and militarycommercial concerns with the peoples republic of china5 the senate passed the intelligence authorization for fy2000 hr 1555 that would establish semiautonomous nuclear weapon agency this report reviews the main problems of doe security and summarizes proposed remedies missions of doe labs and the nuclear weapons complex the primary mission of does nuclear complex is to maintain the us nuclear weapons stockpile doe produces nuclear weapons for the department of defense dod the division of responsibilities between doe and dod preserves longstanding policy of keeping nuclear weapons under civilian authority the doe nuclear complex consists of eight governmentowned contractoroperated sites which contribute to the production maintenance and retirement of

although other facilities such as oak ridge and y12 make major contributions although they are federally funded and accountable to doe headquarters the labs are operated by contractors and exercise high degree of autonomy the high degree of autonomy often results in inconsistent implementation of doe policies including security policy since the moratorium on nuclear testing in 1992 and signing of comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt in 1996 us nuclear weapons are maintained through the stockpile stewardship program scientists at the doe national labs utilize broadbased scientific approach to ensure the safety and reliability of us nuclear weapons without testing6 the doe also utilizes nuclear and scientific expertise to support us nonproliferation and arms control policy for example the labs provide expertise on foreign nuclear programs export controls and efforts to strengthen controls on nuclear weapons and materials in russia and other fsu countries the usrussia labtolab program has played central role in us cooperative threat reduction programs ctr lab scientists have installed material protection control and accounting mpca equipment at numerous russian and fsu facilities to reduce the risk of theft or diversion in russia7 the labs also maintain broad array of basic scientific research programs in fields such as computing materials science energy physics and others which are critical to maintaining the expertise needed to support stockpile stewardship and the other national security missions8 however the free exchange of information that is typical of unclassified scientific research sometimes clashes with the requirements of classified weaponrelated activities the participation of foreign citizens particularly from sensitive countries such as china russia and india in unclassified laboratory research raises concerns about the security of classified and sensitive information legislation has been introduced in the senate and house to put new restrictions on foreign visitors to the labs9 doe security protecting against insider and outsider threats the department of energy maintains several types of security systems to protect us national

maintained by the nuclear explosive and weapon surety program in conjunction with other measures does material control and accountability mca system tracks the quantities and whereabouts of nuclear materials throughout the doe complex congress the gao and doe internal reviews have identified numerous problems with does safeguards and security system10 the problems include weak security for classified information concerns about foreign visitors and their possible access to classified information and failures of the nuclear materials tracking system to account for weapon usable material many of the problems have persisted for years despite repeated efforts to spur doe to take action11 recently the problems have resurfaced in connection with reports of chinese espionage at the labs and reports of weak security for nuclear weapons material plutonium at the rocky flats site cyber security computer security is major challenge for doe in addition to protecting its computers from hackers doe faces some unique problems like other agencies that handle classified information doe and its labs maintain separate computer systems for classified and unclassified information the technical challenge is to prevent the transfer of classified information to an unclassified system which is often in close proximity this type of transfer apparently occurred at alamos when lab employee wen ho lee reportedly copied classified files to disk and put them on an unsecure computer where they were vulnerable to unauthorized access the fbi found that the files had been accessed but have not determined by whom technical solution used by some agencies is to remove the hard drive so that nothing can be downloaded from the classified system except when authorization to install or unlock the hard drive has been granted such solution however would not prevent people from transferring classified information onto an unclassified computer by memorizing it or copying it on paper first the policy question is where to draw the line between classified and unclassified research some unclassified research in areas such as computing and highenergy physics is relevant to the weapons program it is also possible to create classified information by combining unclassified sources doe scientists must continually distinguish between 10 department of energy key factors underlying

concern despite existing rules and procedures governing such contacts counterintelligence counterintelligence includes measures to prevent and detect espionage by foreign countries does counterintelligence apparently failed to effectively detect or prevent spying at doe facilities despite many warnings foreign spying on the us nuclear program began during the manhattan project in the 1940s which was managed by the us army and continued through the 1950s when several soviet agents penetrated the alamos lab in the 1970s chinese spies apparently penetrated livermore national lab and acquired information on us nuclear weapons doe inherited the weapons program when it was created in 1974 chinese espionage at us nuclear facilities reportedly continued through the 1980s and 1990s and succeeded in acquiring detailed information on most us nuclear weapons as well as other advanced weapons 12 various executive branch agencies including doe itself and congress have criticized does counterintelligence efforts some of the criticism dates back nearly 20 years13 problems have included lax handling of classified documents inadequate background checks on lab personnel mishandled investigations and problems associated with foreign visitors according to recent investigations some problems stemmed from years of mismanagement and from the low priority given to counterintelligence by does top management14 some problems resulted from inconsistent security practices at the labs and from the disconnect between doe headquarters and the labs pdd61 and secretary richardsons reform package seek to restore confidence in does counterintelligence office by increasing its budget and authority and by putting seasoned fbi counterintelligence official in charge the director of the new
