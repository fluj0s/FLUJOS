characteristics summary the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 established the state childrens health insuran ce program schip under new title xxi of the social security act in general schip provides states with fede ral matching funds to cover uninsured children in families with income that is above medicai d eligibility levels to date the upper income eligibility limit under schip has reached 350 of the federal poverty level or fpl in one state states may choose among three options when designing their schip programs they may expand medicaid create new separate state insurance program or use combination of both approaches all 50 st ates and the district of columbia have schip programs in operation as of june 30 2003 among these 51 jurisdictions 15 were medicaid expansions 18 were parate state programs and 18 used combination approach medicaid expansion programs must provide all mandatory bene fits and covered optional services offered in the states medi caid program costsharing is prohibited for children separate state programs mu st follow certain coverage and benefit options outlined in schip law while costsharing provisions in separate state programs vary by family income in numbe r of states the total annual aggregate costsharing including premiums enrollment fees deductibles copayments coinsurance and other similar charges fo r any family may not exceed 5 of total income in year preventive services are exempt from costsharing states must ensure that schip does not substitute for coverage under group health plans phenomenon known as cr owdout the primary method for preventing substitution is requiring waiting period during which applicants must be uninsured prior to enrollment in schip states that want to make changes to their schip programs that go beyond what the law allows may do so through what is called section 1115 waiver these waivers allow states to use schip funds to cover populations not normally covered under schip such as pregnant women and parents of schip children as well as to modify certain statutory provisions such as costsharing limitations and benefit requirements this report provides an ove rview of state

eg section 1115 to cover persons who would not otherwise be eligible for medicaida statebystate compilation of key state childrens health insurance program schip characteristics the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 established the state childrens health insuran ce program schip under new title xxi of the social security act the program ffers federal matching funds for states and territories to provide health insurance coverage to uninsured children fro m families whose annual incomes are higher than medicaid eligibility thresholds total federal funding is nearly 40 billion for fy1998 through fy2007 eligibility in general title xxi defines targeted lowincome child as one who is under the age of 19 years with health insuran ce and who would not have been eligible for medicaid under the rules in effect in the state on march 31 1997 states can set the upper income level for targeted lowin come children up to 200 of the federal poverty level fpl1 or if the applicable medicaid income level for children was at or above 200 fpl prior to schip the upper income limit may be raised an additional 50 percentage points above that level2 within these general rules states may provide medical assistance to qualifying children in two basic ways they may cover such children under their medicaid programs andor they may create separa schip program for this purpose when states provide medicaid coverage to targ eted lowincome children medicaid rules typically apply when states provide coverage to targeted lowincome children through separate schip programs title xxi rules typically apply in both cases the federal share of program costs come s from federal schi p appropriationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32389crs2 3 appendix 1 describes the information sources and methods used to compile the data presented in this reporttitle xxi does not establish an individual entitlement to benefits instead title xxi entitles states with approved state plans for medicaid coverage or separate schip programs to predetermined fe deral allotments base d on distribution formula set in the law however ta rgeted lowincome children covered under medicaid are entitled to the benefits offe red under that program as dictated by medicaid law these children retain their entitlement to medicaid benefits even if schip terminates unless the state elimin ates this coverage group such individual entitlement exists for targeted lowincome children covered in separate schip programs under medicaid states may cover targeted lowincome children in the following ways 1 by establishing new optional eligibility group for such children as authorized in title xxi andor 2 by liberalizing the financial rules for any of several existing medicaid eligibility categories states may also provide coverage to ta rgeted lowincome children by creating separate schip program states define the group of ta rgeted lowincome children who may enroll in separate schip programs title xxi allows states to use the following factors in determining eligibility under separate state programs geography eg substate areas or statewide ag eg subgroups under 19 income and resources residency disability status so long as any standard relating to that status does not restrict eligibility access to other health insurance and duration of schip enrollment as of june 30 2003 among the 50 states and the district of columbia 15 were medicaid expansions 18 were separate state programs and 18 used combination approach financial eligibility standards table 1 presents summary of state eligibility thresholds and other eligibility information under schip3 the first column shows c ounts of medicaid expansions the second column shows counts of separa state programs and the last column shows counts of states note that the total number of progra ms does not add up to 51 the 50 states and the district of columbia because states with combination programs have medicaid expansion and at least one separate state program several states have two or more separa state programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32389crs3 table 1 general eligibility criteria for states as of december 31 2002 through july 31

appendix 1 combination states that have this characteristic in at least one of their programs are included in this count b in determining income eligibility for schip and medicaid some states apply income disregards see the next row in this table typically these are dollar amounts subtracted from gross income to compute net income which is then compared to the states income standard for determining eligibility the number type and amount of disregarded income varies from applicant to applicant depending on each persons specific financial circumstances some states apply selected disregards to all applicants for example in new jerseys separate schip program all income between 200 to 350 of the fpl is disregarded for every applicant in state schip plans and related documentation the sources for information on applicable income levels used in this table and elsewhere in this report it is unclear whether the reported income levels reflect the applicable standards before or after income disregards are applied in most cases the reported income levels probably reflect the standards before any income disregards are taken into account use of disregards increases the effective income level above the stated standard the exception is those states like new jersey that apply specific disregard for all applicants in these cases the reported income standard most likely accounts for universally applied disregards and more closely reflects the effective income level as seen in the first row last column of table 1 12 states had an upper income eligibility threshold below 200 fpl 26 states had an upper income eligibility threshold of exactly 200 fpl and 13 states had an upper income eligibility threshold above 200 fpl eligibility thresholds among separate state programs tend to be higher than among medicaid expansions states with combination programs use their medicaid expansion program for lower income child ren and one or more separate state programs for children with higher income levelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32389crs4 4 states are classified as using basic inco disregard if they 1 disregard some amount of earnings 2 allow deduction for child ca re expenses andor 3 disregard all income between specified range of the federal poverty level see appendix 1 for further detailsin determining financial eligibility for schip states may elect to disregard some portion of income andor deduct certain expenses when calculating familys net income which is then compared agai nst the income thres holds reported above with these methods states extend eligibility beyond the stated financial standards for example many states disregard some amount of earned in come andor deduct specified amounts of child support payments in other cases states may disregard all income within specified range for example new jersey has expanded eligibility to 350 fpl the highest of any state in one of its separate state programs by disregarding all income between 200 fpl and 350 fpl as shown in table 1 46 states use basic income disregards4 states may also take resour ces or assets into account in determining financial eligibility for schip states determine wh at items constitute c ountable assets and how those countable items are valued generally resources such as homes and wedding rings have not been counted regard less of their value while cars savings accounts and savings bonds for example have generally been counted as shown in table 1 only two states one under its dicaid expansion program and one in its separate state progra m use an asset test other eligibility and enrollment characteristics presumptive eligibility and continuous eligibility see table 1 are policies designed to assist children in getting and staying enrolled in medicaid and schip under presumptive eligibility states ar allowed to enroll children whose family income and resources appear to be below the applicable financial standards until formal eligibility determination is completed nine states offer presumptive eligibility continuous eligibility allows child to remain enrolled for set period of time regardless of whether the childs circumstances change eg the familys income rises above the eligib ility threshold thus making it easier for child to stay enrolled thirtysix states offer continuous eligibility the majority of them for 12 monthperiod capping enrollment is one means states can use to control program spending while an individual entitlement exists for children enrolled in medicaid expansions there is such entitlement under separate state programs states with separate schip programs can cap enrollment by r eceiving centers for medicare and medicaid services cms approval to amend their state schip plans to include such cap two states montana and utah have specific enrollment caps written into their state plans and another state florida has langua ge in its state plan allowing the state to cap enrollment at any time w ithout additiona l cms approval under medicaid states must provide cove rage to pregnant women of any age living in families with income at or below 133 of fpl states also have the option to extend such coverage up to 185 of fplhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32389crs5 while schip does not include pregnancy status among its eligibility criteria and as rule does not cover persons over age 18 there are thr ee circumstances under which pregnant women over 18 could be covered in separa schip programs first the family coverage option allows states to provide coverage under group health plan that may include maternity care states may cover the entire family including parents if the purchase of such family coverage is cost effective when compared to the cost of covering only the targeted lowincome children in the family and would not substitute for other health insurance there are official data that identify for which states this circumstance applies second states can apply for waivers of program rules to extend covera ge to adults as of june 2003 10 states had section 1115 waivers that expanded schi p coverage to include one or more categories of adults with children typically parent s of medicaidschip children caretaker relatives legal guardians andor pregnant women finally in rule published in october of 2002 the definition of child for schip purposes was changed such that states may consider an unborn child to be targeted lowincome child if all other applicable eligibility requirements are met this change allowed states to extend schip coverage to pregnant women of any age who meet all financial eligibility requirements of the program three stat illinois michigan and rhode island provide prenatal care to unborn children in their separate schip programs state by state detail on income disregards asset tests presumptive and continuous eligibility enrollment caps and wa iting lists and prenatal coverage for unborn children can be found in appendices 2 and 4 benefit packages as noted above when designing their sc hip program states may expand their current medicaid program create new separate state insurance program or devise combination of both approaches states that choose to cover targeted lowincome children under medicaid must provide the full range of mandatory medicaid benefits as well as all optional services specified in their state medicaid plans states that create separate state programs choose any of three benefit options 1 benchmark benefit package 2 benc hmark equivalent coverage or 3 any other health benefits plan that the secretary of health and human services determines will provide appropriate coverage to the targeted population of uninsured children referred to as secretary approved benefits plan in addition for florida new york and pennsylvania specific progra ms already in existence when the law establishing schip was enacted were designated as meeting the minimum benefit requirements under schip these grandf athered programs are called existing comprehensive statebased programs benchmark benefit package is one of the following three plans 1 the standard blue crossblue

costsharing rules of the medicaid pr ogram which prohibits costsharing for children under 18 nominal costsharing is allowed for persons 18 years of age and older however if state has secti on 1115 waiver that allows costsharing for children enrolled in its medicaid program th state may also impose costsharing for children enrolled in medicaid expansion under schip six states arkansas missouri

rhode island and wisconsin require monthly premiums only with copayments for services and one state ohio8 has approval to implement an annual fee only costsharing under separate state programs if state implements schip through separate state program premiums or enrollment fees for program participation may be imposed but the maximum allowable amount is depende nt on family income for all families with incomes under 150 fpl and enrolled in separate state programs premiums may not exceed the amounts set forth in federal medicaid regulations additi onally these families may be charged servicerelated costsharing but such costsharing is limited to 1 nominal amounts defined in federal medicaid regulati ons for the subgroup with income below 100 fpl and 2 sligh tly higher amounts defined in schip regulations for families with income be tween 101150 fpl for family with income above 150 fpl costsharing ma be imposed in any amount provided that costsharing for higher income children is not less than costsharing for lower income children the total annual aggregate costshari ng including pr emiums deductibles copayments and any other charges for all children in any schip family may not exceed 5 of total family income for the year in addition states must inform families of these limits and provide mechanism for families to stop paying once the costsharing limits have been reached most separate state programs require costsharing in the form of either premiums copayments or both some stat charge quarterly or annual enrollment fee instead of monthly premium table 3 shows costsharing patterns among the 44 separate state programs in the 36 states with such programs most of these programs have sliding scale for cost sharing ie the amount paid depends on family

those in the lowest income coverage groups substitution of schip for private health insurance finally states that establish schip pr ograms must ensure that schip does not substitute for coverage under group hea lth plans phenomenon known as crowd out10 the primary method for preventing cr owdout is requiring waiting period that is specified lengths of time for which applicants must be uninsured prior to enrollment in schip waiting periods are only permitted in medicaid expansions under section 1115 waiver as seen in the third to last column of appendix 2 30 states require waiting period ranging from one to six monthshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32389crs11 11 unless the state has waiver specifying othe rwise states must insure that the benefit packages and costsharing obligations under employersponsored insurance programs meet the requirements in schip statute if the i benefit package falls short of the statutes requirements states must prov ide wraparound services to bridge any gaps between the esi benefit package and the schip benefits package offered by the staterequiring costsharing under schip may also serve as crowdout prevention measure by discouraging applicants from viewing schip as more attractive than employersponsored insurance for which co stsharing is common as noted above 38 states require costsharing finally premium subsidy programs can encourage use of private instead of public insurance for lowincome children whose parents have access to employer sponsored insurance esi but cannot afford their share of the premium11 under separate state programs states that provide premium assistance for employer sponsored insurance to the families of target ed lowincome children must require 1 with some exceptions waitingperiod of si x to twelve months without group health plan coverage before covera ge through the premium assi stance program begins 2 identify reasonable minimum employer cont ribution level and pr ovide justification for that level and 3 premium subsidy that does not exceed the payment the state would otherwise make on the ch ilds behalf as shown in appendix 2 six states provide access to esi under at least one of their separate state programs as noted above some states have multip separate schip programs two of these states have section 1115 waivers one waives the minimu m employer contribution and the other requires 50 employer contribution the remaining states require employer contributions ranging from 30 to 50 states may also provide premium ssistance for employersponsored health insurance through medicaid expansions under medicaid states may pay beneficiarys share of the costs for group health coverage for any medicaid enrollee for whom employerbased coverage is available and that coverage is both comprehensive and costeffective for the state an individuals enrollment in an employer plan is costeffective if paying the premiums deductibles coinsurance and other costsharing obligations of the employ er plan is less expensive than the states expected cost of directly providing medicaidcovered serv ices two states offer esi through their medicaid expansions using section 1115 waiver au thority one requires minimum employer contribution of 40 section 1115 waivers states that want to make changes to their schip programs that go beyond what the law will allow may do so through what is called section 1115 waiver named for the section of the social security act th at defines the circum stances under which such waivers may be granted the secretary of health and human services may waive certain statutory requireme nts for conducting research and demonstration projects under schip that allow states to adap t their programs to specific needshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32389crs12 12 the 13 states are az ca co il md mn nj nm ny oh or ri and wi nm has two approved schip section 1115 waivers th remaining states have one waiver each 13 states have the option to purchase family coverage under group health plan that may cover adults as long as it is costeffectiv to do so relative to the amount paid for comparable coverage for the children only nd it must not substitute for health insurance that would otherwise be provided to the child ren for states seeking greater flexibility both in selecting which adults to cover and in th benefit package offered to those adults waiver is required 14 in general for medicaid expansions under schip all medicaid rules apply thus when states with schip medicaid expansions want to implement other rules eg establish waiting periods before enrollment implement rollment fees etc waiver is required 15 due to variety of budget and resource constraints in may 2002 oh decided not to pursue implementation of its waiveron august 4 2 001

is based primarily on information contained in official schip state plans and accompanying documentation including all amendments approved by cms as of june 30 2003 schip state plans do not contain deta iled information on certain program characteristics in particular for sec tion 1115 waivers and for medicaid expansion programs in addition to the crs database other sources of data used in this

information contained in these documents for medicaid expansion programs information on income eligibility thresholds lower and upper bounds is taken from documentation accompanying schip state plans schip annual evaluation reports and crs report rl30642 the state childrens health insurance program eligibility enrollment and program funding by evelyne baumrucker data as of april 2003 on asset

eligibility information for such programs states are not required to provi detailed information on income counting methods in their state schi p plans data on basic income disregards for medicaid expansi ons and separate schip programs are taken from two surveys 1 crs survey of selected program characteristics for separate schip programs as of december 31 2002 and 2 survey conducted under contract to crs by the george washington university of selected program characteristics for medicaid expansions and eligibility rules for other groups of medicaid children as of decembe r 31 2002 throughout this report yes entry for the basic income disregards field means that the state disregards some amount of earnings or 2 allows deduction for childcare expenses or 3 disregards all incomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32389crs15 between specified range of the federal poverty vel eg in its separate schip program new jersey disregards all income between 200350 fpl coding of basic income disregards among medicaid expansion programs re quires additional explanation schip law defines schip eligible as targeted lowincome child under the age of 19 with health insurance and who would not have been eligible for medicaid unde r the rules in effect on march 31 1997 under medicaid states ma cover targeted lowincome children in one or more of the follo wing ways 1 by establishing new optional eligibility group for such children as authorized in schip law 2 by liberalizing the financial rules for any of several existing medicaid eligibility categ ories eg the povertyrelated groups using section 1902r2 authority andor 3 by liberalizing the income standards or methodolog ies applicable to family coverage under section 1931 many states have chosen to cover targeted low income children under existing medicaid eligibility pathways especially the povertyrelated groups rather than by establishing the optional coverage group identified in schip law on the crs sponsored medicaid eligibility survey conducted by george washington university there was field indicating which of these options state used to create its schip medicaid expansion group the basic income disregards field was coded as yes if the criteria described above were met for any of the relevant groups there are inconsistencies in state schip plans in how states report lower income boundaries that appl to different age groups under schip the lower income boundaries shown in this report reflect the upper income boundary applicable to the next adjacent age or income group for example children up to six years of age in families with income up to 133 of the fede ral poverty level fpl must be covered in the regular medicaid program for state implementing separate schip program for th same age group the lower income boundary shown in this re port would equal 133 fplhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32389 crs16 appendix 2 selected schip program characteristics by state as of december 31 2002 through july 31
