social security protect ion act of 2004 pl 108203 although the payment of ssi benefits to fugitive felons was prohibited in 1996 this prohibition initially did not apply to ssdi or oasi benefits the prohibition was extended to these programs effective january 1 2005 with the passage of the social security protection act of 2004 pl 108203 in its report on this bill the house committee on ways and means explained that prohibiting fugitive felons from receiving ssdi and oasi benefits was in tended to help stop fraud wa ste and abuse in these programs in addition the committee expre ssed concern that ssd i and oasi benefits were being used to aid fugitive felons in their flights from prosecution or punishment18 in its report on the bill the senate committee on finance explained that the fugitive felon provision should only apply if law forcement agency is actively pursuing the person the committee stated that this instru ction which is not ex plicitly mentioned in the law as enacted was intended to prevent the ssa from becoming the law enforcement agency of last resort for people who may have committed crimes but whom local or state law enforcement is longer interested in pursuing the committee cited that it was aware of numerous cases in wh ich law enforcement agencies chose not to pursue individuals identified as having ope n warrants through the enforcement of the existing ssi fugitive felon rules19
