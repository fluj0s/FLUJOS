104th congress rules changes beginning with the convening of the 104th congress have addressed most aspects of the committ ee system decisionmaking autonomy jurisdictions internal committee procedures and structure and the role of committee staff rules changes since the 104th congress have also addressed most aspects of consideration of legislation on the house fl oor and organization of the chamber for example the minority was guaranteed the ability to offer the motion to recommit with or without instructions commemora tive legislation was banned the names of signatories of discharge petitions were publicized pr ovisions were made for convening house with reduced membersh ip due to terrorist attack and the speaker was subjected to term limit that was later repealed two of the eight goals of the contract with america dealt with budgetary legislation house rules were changed to re quire threefifths vote to pass federal income tax rate increase nd cost estimates replaced base lines as the preferred way of understanding the yeartoyear changes in federal spending rules changes in the administration of the house were extensive offices were abolished and others cr eated responsibilities were shifted and accountability clarified rules changes affecting ethical standards were largely technical with most major changes taking place through freestanding and other legislation the house rules changes made starting in the 104th congress reflected republican frame of reference that was built over many years as the minority party most rules however did not change either at all or substantially since they had been built up over decades to support the ma jority in its organization and operation of the house rules changes do not necessarily enable majority to pass legislation to overcome voter sentiments or to work smoothly with the minority rules facilitate the majoritys organization nd operation of the house th ey do not dictate to party leaders and others how to run the h ouse or what outcomes can be achieved this report describes and analyzes only rules changes made on the opening day of new congress but it references other legislation and

since the 83rd congress 19531955 by prac tice the majority party organizes the house it elects its speaker chairs its committees holds majorities on its committees selects its officers and manages its legislative agenda one of the majoritys prerogatives is writing the houses rules and using its majority status to effect the chambers rules on the day the new house convenes it is feature of the house but not of th senate that it must adopt rules at the convening of each congress it is also f eature of the house that it relies heavily on its formal rules and formal means of temporarily changing them rather than on the informal ad hoc procedures so often us ed in the senate although each new house largely adopts the chamber rules that exis ted in the previous congress each new house also adopts changes to those rules among the many subjects that the rules may cover these changes can strengthen the ability of the majority to control the legislative process and the legislative ag enda and they can bestow rights on the minority party minority intere sts and individual members1 house rules might also be changed for other reasons such as the contemporary needs of the chamber for example the suspension of the rules procedure has evolved from occasional use just 40 years ago to specifically being in order on several days each month to being in order in the 108th and 109th congresses on mondays tuesdays and wednesdays of each week the house is in session the house often concurrently with the senate has also ma many extensive changes in its organization and rules at times other than the c onvening of new congress the legislative reorgani zation act of 1946 the legislative reorganization act of 1970 the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 and

caucus and republican conference can also have profound influence on the organization and procedures of the house the house and senate together or i ndependently have so established process for reform but then not followe d through on recommendations for example in the 102nd congress the house and senate established joint committee on the organization of congress to report reform recommendations during the 103rd congress3 the joint committee performed exte nsive work and made farreaching recommendations legislation embodying the recommendations was introduced in both chambers hr 3801 and s 1824 in the 103rd congress but action was not taken on either of these bills while the majority party in the house can use its numbers to effect the chamber rules it desires the minority party often tries to ame nd the rules proposed by the majority and at least critique the rules fo r what they contain and do not contain the disagreement in the house between the parties over the rules of the 103rd congress organized by the majority democrats and the failure of congress to act on the recommendations of the joint committee on the organization of congress provide background or context for some of the rules changes made by the republicans when they organized the house in the 104th congress 103rd congress prelude to republican frame of reference 103rd congress rules the democratic caucus at its early organization meeting in december 1992 approved number of rules changes which continued to be developed until the rules package hres 5 was put before the house at the convening of the

of the frank and criminal indictments and investigations of members both democratic and republican5 an innovation of the rules package pr ovided vote in the committee of the whole to the four delegates and the pu erto rican resident commissioner and allowed these five individuals to chair the committee of the whole as other members were able to do this change wa s modified before the rules package was brought to the house floor to allow re vote in the house if the delegates or resident commissioners votes affected the outcome of vote in the committee of the whole the delegates and resident commissioner were not to be given vote in the house meeting as the house the delegates and reside nt commissioner could also be appointed to any conference committee not just those created for legislation reported from committee on which they served during bate democratic members portrayed this change as matte r of fairness and democracy in action and pointed out the services of citizenship unde rtaken by residents of the territories puerto rico and the district of columbia they argued that allowing the delegates and resident commissioner to vote in the committee of the whole did not flout constitutional requirements since their votes could not affect the outcome of votes in the house6 democratic members indicated that othe r major changes proposed to the house rules were made for purpos of legislative effici ency and productivity committees were allowed to meet while the house wa s sitting under the fiveminute rule withouthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33610crs4 7 the lives

of order on the floor was prohibited in most instances when measure was reported by voice vote or nimous consent teller vote procedures in the committee of the whole were eliminated except when the electronic voting system malfunctioned the speaker was authorized to declar short recesses throughout congress rather than only by authorization of special rule usually agreed to at the end of congress if question of the privileges of the house was raised by the majority or minority leader it would be considered imme diately if privileges of the house resolution was offered by nother member it would be ticed and the speaker was required to schedule debate on it within two legislative days debate time on question of the privileges of the house would be divided between the proponent on the one hand and the leadership of the party in opposition to the motion on the other as determined by the speaker in instances where the senate added legislative language to general appropriation bill and motion was made to in effect change existing law the chair of the authorizing committee with jurisdiction over the subject matter could make motion to insist on disagreement to th amendment the motion would then be debated for one hour with time divided between the proponent of the motion to insist on disagreement and proponent of the motion to change existing law the speaker was also authorized to add memb ers to and remove them from conference committees and select committees the house fair employment practices resolution was codified in the rules and changes were made in procedures of the office of fair employment practices the permanent authorization of the select committee on aging was repealed and the temporary authorizations of three existing select committees were not included in the rules package thus terminating the life of those select committees7 rules change that had been endorsed by the democratic caucus was dropped from the proposed rules package this ch ange would have limited special orders to three hours or not later than 900 pm whichever came first republican critique republicans argued against the proposed rules on the basis of what they did and what they failed to do representa tive gerald solomon as ranking republican on the rules committ ee and republican floor manager of the rules debate used his opening remarks to argue that after the events of the last congress voters had chosen change in the 1992 election and democrats were misreading the voters message the amer ican people thought last november they were voting for change where is it8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33610crs5 8 continued in the house in the 103rd congress perhaps more indicative of the change that occurred in the congressional elections was the number of new member s elected 110 of whom 63 were democrats and 47 were republicans 9 the constitution states the house of representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people

dc cir 1994 10 rep robert michel remarks in the house cong ressional record vol 139 jan 5 1993 pp 9396many of the republican members who spoke during debate on the rules spoke against allowing the delegates and resident commissioner to vote in the committee of the whole their arguments were based on constitutional objections that only representatives of states are members of the house9 the constitutionality of delegates and the resident commissioner voting on committees had not been established the disparity in population am ong the territories puerto rico and the district of columbia and between the territories and the congressional districts and the return of federal income tax receipts to the territories and puerto rico some members also argued that practically the votes of the delegates and resident commissioner would be sought to build majority and politically the change reduced the republicans election gains by half since the delegates and resident commissioner were all democrats this last point was reinforced in editorial columns representing range of political orientation although other specific proposals in th rules package evoked criticism none besides the delegate voting was criticized so much as the loosening of the requirement for quorum to be physically present in committee to report out legislation minority leader robert michel stated rolling quorum feats the purpose of collective deliberation and decision making the very word congress has at its root the concept of coming togetherof being together of political community and to institute procedures thatfragment the collective sense of decision making and responsibility in the houseis to demean the very concept of the congress 10 in discussing the proposed change to this rule representative bob walkers remarks revealed sense of the comity that appeared to be lacking between the two parties under the rolling quorum concept what can happen is that legislation can be passed not by committee meeting in room and deciding that it is time to passthe legislation but by declaration that what we are going to do is allow thevote to remain open until sufficient members of the

minority did three othe r things during the debate on the proposed rules package first they prepared an extensive alternate package of rules changes see table 1 although they were not allowed to offer the alternate as an amendment12 second they inserted in the congressional record nearly 24 pages of documentation explaining and in support of their alternate rules package third they offered two motions that pr ovided alternative ways to amending to get votes on changes to the proposed rules package as soon as the resolution containing the majoritys rules package was reported on the floor representative gerald solomon offered motion to refer the resolution to special committee to study the constitutionality of giving voting rights in the committee of the whole to the delegates and reside nt commissioner the motion was tabled on vote of 224176 at the conclusion of debate on the majoritys rules package representative michel offered motion to commit the resolution to select committee with instructions to report back forthwith with two amendments to strike provisi ons related to new privileges for the delegates and resident commissioner and to add new provision of term

said earlier in this report the house rules changes made in the 104th congress and since including changes affecting the organization of committees and the administration of the house reflected republican frame of reference that was built over many years as the minority party republican criticisms of changes in the house made at the direction of the democratic caucus beginning after the 1974 election and continuing through the 103rd congress the ideas of the conservative opportunity society in the 1980s the re publican 92 group th republican rules package of the 103rd congress the recommendations of the bipartisan joint committee on the organization of congress the contract with america and other sources came together in the rules packag the republicans put before the house in the 104th congress the republican majority continued to draw on these antecedents in rules packages for subsequent congresses the extensive changes of the 104th congress were followed by incremental changes in the 105th 106th and 107th congresses at the same time number of rules did not change either at all or substantially the great bulk of house rules was continued from congress to congress since the rules had been built up over decades to support the majority in its organization and operation of the house after control of four congresses howev er confluence of events caused the republicans to revisit the rules and some of the changes they had made with the events of 911 and anthrax attacks on capitol hill publication of the 911 commission report the return of the federa l budget deficit republican president in the white house and republican cont rol of both houses of congress and widening of republican margins in the house and senate h ouse republicans made more extensive changes in house rules in the 108th and 109th congresses in these congresses the republican majority adapted to changed conditions they adjusted to the end of the first round of committee chair term limits discontinued the speakers term limit accommodated demands for additional subcommittees created homeland security committee and altered other committees jurisdictions visÃ vis homel and security realigned appropriations committee subcommittees to handle homeland security spending and thenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33610crs47 reorganized the subcommittees to better handle republican spending priorities implemented new analyses of tax legisla tion grappled with the possibility of terrorist attack that could kill or disable many representatives and picked their way through ethical breaches by both mocratic and re publican members through actions intended to open up c ongress and especially the house including the advent of thomas putting documents online at committee and other websites and webcasting congress llowed more citizens to know more and to know more quickly about congress nd concomitantly and unavoidably readily gave lobbyists and political activists more knowledge and insight into congress and policymaking committee and floor acti ons were increasingly accompanied by intense lobbying grassroots communications public relations nd coverage 247 by an array of traditional and ne w news and opinion outlets in variety of media most members also felt compelled to be in their districts three or four days every week and many full weeks making themselves available to their constituents the cost of campaigns and the pressure to raise money for their parties too opened many members to more contact with more people who became interested in an individual members actions cong ressional districts have become more politically homogeneous through redistric ting and fewer voters are registering by party leaving arguably more politically homogeneous set of voters voting in each partys primaries rules changes do not necessarily enable majority to pass legislation to keep all the partys members together to work smoothly with the minority to achieve the same outcomes as the other body or to overcome voter sentime nts rules facilitate the majoritys organization and operation of the house but they do not dictate to party leaders and others how to run the house in more recent congresses the republican majority needed to accommodate wider more assertive range of republican members perspectives and to deal with an emboldened minority consequently the number of open and modified open special rules diminished and the number of structured rules increas ed third day for the consideration of legislation by suspension of the rules wa s added fewer days we re spent in session more competition over jurisdiction between committees occurred and some measures passed by the house could not pass the senate and convening conferences between the chambers was sometimes problematic despite the extensive rules changes in the house since the 104th congress the house remains one of the two independent political institutions of congress designed to be so by the framers in terest balances interest as noted in the federalist papers and unless there is majority political will not necessarily party majority but major ity of members of each house to take an action such as make specific law that action will not happen one role of congress is to make law but its larger role is to winnow the proposals about what should be law because some proposals are bad ideas or lack public support or offend constituency or cost too much or are impractical or are for some other reason unable to generate the needed majorities if rules in the broadest sense not house special rules allow opportunities for all memb ers to participate at all stages of the legislative process in both chambers then the framers system would be viewed by many as workinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33610crs48 in looking to the future it is telling statistic that 60 of representatives delegates and the resident commissioner have not known another set of rules and operational frame of refere nce than the one that has existed since the 104th congress of the 438 members of the house in au gust 2006 265 sitting members began their service in the 104th or later congress 153 republicans and 112 democrats another 16 members so far whose service began in the 103rd congress or before will be leaving the house and th ere are currently two vacancies rules changes are likely to be incremental rather than extensive with republican majority or at some future time with democratic majority looking to the very next congress the package of rule changes presented by the majority party would take into consid eration the size of the party majority the changes would need to balance that fact and protect minority prerogatives against the need to govern republican house might consider further committee jurisdictional realignments more changes to the budget pr ocess incremental changes to reduce the number of times the minority might make certain motions or introduce certain resolutions and other adjustments to hous rules democratic house would likely consider whether to abolish some ch anges made by the republicans giving consideration to the circumstance that nearly 60 of the democratic caucus is junior enough not to have served in the major ity observers question whether democrats might eliminate committee chairs term limits return some degree of aut onomy to subcommittees restore proxy voting or use more open special rules the house majority party would also need to consider majority control of the senate as it contemplates rules package the house majority party might contemplate the party arrangements and the effectiveness of the president and congress over the past 25 years presiden t reagan began with republican senate and democratic house and ended with democratic congress president george hw bush held office with democratic congress president clinton began office with democratic congress and served most of his two terms with republican congress president george w bush s served only with republican congress except for portion of the 107th congress when democrat s controlled the senate the presidents have succeeded and failed with their major policy initiatives under each arrangement the rules of the house do not exist to achieve specific legislative result they are available to all members and to any majority many factors besides party control and the partys use of rules affect the congressional environment to look back in history speaker thomas bracken reed could be said to have created the modern majorityminority house with his rulings but he could not have contemplated how very strong speaker like joseph cannon would use the speakership to dominate the house the corrections calendar was announced with great fanfare when it was created in 1995 it had long been moribund when it was terminated in the rules package for the 109th congress as noted in the report the consideration of legislation under suspension of the rules was minor procedure 40 years ago now motions to suspend the rules are in or der mondays tuesdays and wednesdays when the house is in session the congressiona l budget act of 1974 called for two budgethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33610crs49 71 exogenous developments also affect congress for example the installation of air conditioning in the capitol complex after world war ii made it thinkable to spend thesummer and fall in washington dc the jet plane and the growth of air travel made itpossible for most members to go home weekends and to have their families live at homerather than in the washington dc area and the world wide web email and otherinformation technology advances have connected probably every member and his or herstaff with the members constituents and anyone else to receive and send communicationsresolutions each year the procedure was impractical and hugely time consuming and was abandoned71 the house rules the common language of the house are very important components of governance and they exist for all members and ll majorities to use
