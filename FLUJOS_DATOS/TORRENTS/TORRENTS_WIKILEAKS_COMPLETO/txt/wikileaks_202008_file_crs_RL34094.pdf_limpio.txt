potential federal action summary recent senate hearing state efforts and media attention have brought the issue of pharmaceutical companies gifts and payments to physicians into focus pharmaceutical companies sometimes give gift s or make payments to doctors as part of their marketing efforts senator herb kohl has expressed in terest in introducing federal bill that would mandate disclosure of such gifts and payments this report briefly outlines the arguments for and against federal disclosure measure next it describes the state disclosure laws already in effect finally it analyzes potential legal hurdles to federal di sclosure requirement proponents of disclosure express concern that gifts and payments from pharmaceutical companies increase prescripti on drug costs and create incentives for physicians that obscure patients best inte rests they argue that disclosure would alleviate those problems by providing transparency opponents of disclosure emphasize the educational bene fits that marketing provide s in addition they argue that disclosure is unnecessary because exis ting professional codes such as american medical association guidelines discourage pharmaceutical representatives and physicians from engaging in unethical behavior several states and the district of colu mbia have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to disclose gifts and payments made to physicians the state laws require disclosure to the states of such gifts and payments on an annual basis certain categories of gifts and payments are exempted from reporting requirements under most of the state laws fo r example nearly all of the laws exempt product samples intended for fr ee distribution to patients and gifts worth less than certain amount the state laws also provide for dissemina tion to the public or state legislatures of information di sclosed pursuant to the laws if federal disclosure re quirement was enacted and s ubsequently challenged it appears likely to survive judicial scrutiny on first amendment grounds if pharmaceutical companies challenged federal disclosure measure they would likely argue that it violates their first amendment

educational seminars and r eceive detailed information about particular medications7 at the senate hearing representa tive from the pharmaceutical company trade association pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma refuted the suggestion that unethical ties between pharmaceutical representatives and physicians are prevalent8 she stated that pharmaceutical representatives associated with phrma adhere to stri ct ethical code one that starts with the fundamental principle that healthcare professionals care of patients should be based and should be perceived as being based solely on each patients medical needs and the healthcare professionals medical knowledge and experience9 representative from the american medical association ama similarly highlighted the ethical codes already in place within the medical profe ssion discussed below which he believes discourage improper conduct10 he also stated that pharmaceutical company representatives provide physicians with the necessary tools to make the right prescribing decisions and stressed that phy sicians depend on close relationships with pharmaceutical industry representatives in order to receive valid scientific information11 supporters of federal disclosure provision empha size concern about the effects of gifts and payments on both the cost of prescription medication and on health care quality they point to recent data showing that payments from pharmaceutical companies influence some physicians decisions to prescribe certain medications occasionally resulting in overprescribing of the most expensive medications or even causing unnecessary health risks for patients12 they also argue that the ethicalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34094crs3 12 continued unapproved gardiner harris and janet roberts states

noncomplying companies63 west virginias law does not contain any mechanism for enforcement legal analysis of federal disclosure requirement if congress were to enact federal disclosure requirement it would likely survive judicial scrutiny preliminary question when considering the constitutiona lity of any federal statute is whether any power enumerated in the constitution authorizes congress to take such action disclosure requirement would likely pass that preliminary threshold congress has broad authority to regulate activities unde r its commerce clause64 power including the authority to regulate wholly intrastate activities as long as they substantially affect interstate commerce65 the second question in determining the constitutionality of federal statute is whether the statute violates any constitu tional provision the first amendment is one plausible basis for constitutional challeng to disclosure provision specifically pharmaceutical companies might argue that mandatory disclosure of gifts and payments to physicians violates their first amendment freedoms of speech and association pharmaceutical companies might identify two different manifestations of speech implicated by federal disclosure provision first they might argue that the disclosure of information regarding gifts and payments is unconstitutionally compelled speech second they might argu that the gifts and payments are themselves speech that the w unconstitutionally restricts federal provision would likely survive compelled speech challenge the first amendment generally prohibits the government from compelling speech66 however two case law trends suggest th at court would uphold federal provision compelling disclosure of gifts and payments made to physicians first court might analyze the disclosure by pharmaceutical companies in the context of compelled commercial speech67 commercial speech is speech that proposes commercialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34094crs10 67 continued advertising see eg zauderer v office of discip linary counsel 471 us 626 651 1985 upheld state law mandating disclosure of specific payment information in lawyers advertisements for contingency fee services the disclosure at issue here would seem to differ from advertising disclosures because it in volves direct disclosure to the government rather than to consumers however court might analyze the disclosure involved here in the commercial context despite this difference be cause it like advertising disclosures would compel information regarding business tran sactions with one potential purpose being to disseminate the disclosed information to public audience 68 bd of trustees of the state univ of ny v fox 492 us 469 482 1989 emphasis in original 69 zauderer 471 us at 651 70 one

the purpose of increasing business in the compelled commercial speech categ ory under applicable case law the governments interest need only be reasonably related to the disclosure requirements to survive judicial scrutiny69 mandatory disclosure of gifts and payments to physicians appears reasona bly related to potential governmental interests such as transparency and patie nt protection second even if the compelled speech at issue is viewed as noncomme rcial court would likely uphold the provision although the court has invalidated nearly all laws it has reviewed in the noncommercial compelled speech category70 most of the courts noncommercial compelled speech cases addressed political speech which garners greater level of constitutional protection than other types of speech71 in contrast the speech implicated here if not commercial is medical rather than political therefore federal disclosure provision would likely survive compelled speech challenge under the first amendment mandatory disclosure provision would likewise probably survive restricted speech challenge such challenge woul d allege that the provision unconstitutionally restricts pharmaceutical companies gifts and payments to physicians as threshold matter it is not clear that gifts and paym ents made to physicians are speech the supreme court has treated monetary tran sactions as speech in the past most notably in the area of campaign finance72 however the payments at issue here are arguably distinct from campaign contri butions because they are not political expression or discussion of governmental

proposes commercial transaction74 because the likely message conveyed by the gifts and payments is th at doctors should prescribe the promoted drugs commercial speech garners less c onstitutional protection than political or other types of speech75 the applicable test for determining the constitutionality of commercial speech is the fourpart central hudson test76 under the central hudson framework the preliminary questions are 1 whether the speech is protected by the first amendment ie is not unlawful or misleading and 2 whether the governments asserted interest in regulation is substantial77 if the regulation satisfies both preliminary questions the th ird and forth prongs then apply 3 whether the regulation directly advances th governments assert ed interest and 4 if so whether the regulation is more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest78 assuming that the gifts and payments made to physicians are not unlawful or misleading court would find that the first central hudson prong is satisfied court would also likely find that federal disclosure requirement satisfies the second prong in rubin v coors brewing co the supreme court found substantial the governments interest in deterring efforts by beer companies to advertise the most potent beer79 here the governments potential interests for example transparency reduced drug costs and pa tient protection would seem likely to be at least as substantial as the interest asserted in rubin the third and fourth central hudson prongs could be closer issues but would still likely result in finding of constitutionality when applying the third prong the supreme court has indicated th at courts should consider th effect of the regulation in its general application rather than as applied to the

where the association mandated by the law did not involve membershipthe law80 in case invalidating law on the ba sis of the third prong the supreme court stated that the government must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to material degree81 although it seems likely that the government could identify real harm caused by gifts and payments to physicians some question exists as to whether mandatory disclosure of such gifts and payments would materially alleviate that harm the court noted in the above case that the government offered studies giving evidence of the asserted harm and failed to present even anecdotal evidence that the law would address the harm identified82 thus the question might be whether the government can present sufficient studies and anecdotal evidence to show that the disclosure would alleviate any identified harm created by gifts and payments to physicians regarding the fourth central hudson prong the supreme court has clarified that more extensive than necessary s hould not be interprete d strictly to require the government to use the least restrictive means of all available alternatives to accomplish its purpose rather the fourth prong merely requires reasonable fit between the legislatures ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends83 thus court need only find reasonable fit between disclosure rule and the governments asserted inte rest in order to uphold the government action for laws affecting political speech in contrast the mo re onerous least restrictive means test applies nonetheless in disclosure cas involving political speech in the context of campaign finance the court stated that disclosure is generally the least restrictive means of addressing co rruption in government84 since the fourth central hudson prong is less onerous than the least restrictive means test it is likely that disclosure would survive first amendment scrutiny in the commercial speech arena federal disclosure re quirement would likely also survive freedom of association challenge the supreme court has stated that compelled disclosure in itself can seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief85 to be constitutional disclosure law must have relevant correlation or substantial relation to the asserted government interest86 it is unclear whether the right of association would extend to an association between pharmaceutical company and physician since the supreme court cases to date have genera lly invalidated laws on freedom of association grounds only when political or membership associations were at issue87 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34094crs13 88 buckley 424 us at 61 89 ims health inc v ayotte 06cv280pb 2007 wl 1244077 dnh april 30 2007even if court found that the pharmaceu tical companyphysician relationship constituted an association such that it tr iggered right of asso ciation claims under the first amendment it is unlikely that court would find that disclosure law violated privacy of association rights b ecause the court has uphe ld disclosure laws against freedom of association challenges in other contexts for example in buckley v valeo the supreme court upheld federal ws mandating disclo sure of certain campaign finance activities holding that the governments interest in regulation outweighed the private association c oncerns raised by the requirements88 it seems likely that government interests asserted here would similarly outweigh the pharmaceutical companies freedom of association concerns finally it is telling in assessing federal disclosure requirements constitutionality that the state disclosure laws now in effect have faced significant legal challenges although us distri ct court recently invalidated on first amendment grounds new hampshire law re gulating prescription information that law was distinct from the possible federa l requirement discussed here because it prohibited disclosure of prescription information89 conclusion in sum state efforts media atten tion and recent senate committee hearing have highlighted the issue of the relationship between physicians and pharmaceutical companies senator herb kohl and others have indicated support for the introduction of federal legislation that would require pharmaceutical companies to disclose gifts and payments made to physicians arguing that such measure is necessary in order to prevent negative result for health care cost and quality opponents argue that such measure is unnecessary because exis ting guidelines such as amas principles of medical ethics and the ama code of medical ethics discourage unethical behavior several states have already enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to disclose gifts and payments to physicians the state laws require pharmaceutical companies to submit annual reports detailing gifts and payments most state laws exempt certain categorie s of gifts from the reporting requirements including product samples inte nded for free distribution to patients and gifts worth less than specified amount federal disclosure requirement would likely survive legal challenge pharmaceutical companies might challenge the provision on first amendment grounds however it appears likely that it would survive judicial scrutiny under the various applicable tests of constitutionality
