g5g152g151g140g142g155g151g501g561 foreign ownership of federal debt has become growing concern among some members of congress because of the nations large and rising trade deficit during the past three decades us national saving has not been adequate to finance its capital investment needs and borrowing from abroad has covered the gap in order for foreigners to invest in the us economy on net the united states must import more than it exports run trade deficit when the government runs budget deficit as it has done since 2002 it reduces the national saving rate this implies that domestic investment must fall unless private savi ng rises or borrowing from abroad increases 4 as seen in table 1 as the national debt has increased foreign ownership of us treasuries has followed closely suggesting that the budget defic it has been financed in part through borrowing abroad by june 2004 foreigners held more than 50 of the public debt held by private investors for the first time although this percentage has particular economic significance it may have other significance 4 crs report rs21409 the budget deficit and the trade deficit what is their relationship by marc labonte

foreign purchases of us treasuries has changed beginning in that year significant fraction of the trade deficit was financed through official purchases of us assets such as purchases by foreign central banks although direct data on official purchases of treasuries by country exist one can infer that the treasuries may have been purchased by certain asian and oil producing countries because they were the only countries that had large increases in their foreign reserves during that period although the effect on the us economy of official purchases of treasuries is the same as private purchases the motivations behind the purchases are different whereas private purchases are typically motivated by the profit incentive official purchases may be motivated by countrys desire to keep its exchange rate constant or mitigate its rise against the dollar 5 many observers are concerned that the large fraction of national debt held by foreigners has the potential to be harmful to the us economy specifically they fear that if foreigners suddenly decided to stop holding us treasury securities or decided to diversify their holdings the dollar could plummet in value and interest rates would rise others are concerned that chinas accumulation of hard currency assets will allow it to undertake activities in the foreign affairs and military realms that are not in the us interest some economists argue that foreign borrowing at current levels is unsustainable and could cause problems for the us economy down the road 6 when foreigners purchase us treasuries or any other us asset the interest rate is lower than when borrowing is financed domestically out of national saving thus when overall interest rates are lower as result of net capital inflows more interestsensitive spending is undertaken interestsensitive spending includes capital inve stment eg production plants and equipment residential investment eg new homes and durable consumption goods eg automobiles and appliances on the other hand us foreign borrowing induces trade deficit by reducing exports and importcompeting production the trade deficit occurs because foreigners must first purchase us dollars before purchasing us assets when the demand for dollars increases the dollar appreciates making us exports and importcompeting goods relatively more expensive thus foreign borrowing shifts production out of the trade sector and into the interestsensitive sector 7 g21g142g149g142g140g157g142g141g561g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g156g561 crs report rs21409 the budget deficit and the trade deficit what
