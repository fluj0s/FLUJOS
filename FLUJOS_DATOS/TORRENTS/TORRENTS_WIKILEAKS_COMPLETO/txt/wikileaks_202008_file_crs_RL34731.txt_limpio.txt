specialist in asian affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division nepal political developments and bilateral relations with the united states summary with its recent fundamental political shift from monarchy to republic the federal democratic republic of nepal has entered new phase in its political development peace is being consolidated and elections have been held that said much ground remains to be covered to fully consolidate these gains some observers are concerned that widespread violence may return if the communist party of nepal maoist cpnm the group which waged 10year armed struggle against the former government of nepal feels its political agenda has been thwarted by political opposition in the constituent assembly the constituent assembly elections of april 10 2008 were key step toward consolidating peace in nepal and enhancing nepals democratic process the constituent assembly has been elected to form the structure of the new government of nepal it will also be confronted with the need to address economic development and ethnic issues the maoists will likely lead this process as they have the largest representation in the constituent assembly as violence associated with the former maoist insurgency has abated inter communal tensions have mounted and at times become violent this has been particularly acute in the terai region where the madhesi live the madhesi or plains folk seek autonomy to free themselves from what they feel is domination by pahadis from the more mountainous parts of northern nepal the madhesi have added new regional dimension to nepals struggle for political stability new threat to the political stability of nepal has emerged from number of groups representing madhesi in southern nepal relations between the united states and nepal have traditionally been friendly us policy objectives toward nepal include supporting democratic institutions and economic liberalization promoting peace and stability in south asia supporting nepalese independence and territorial integrity and alleviating poverty american foreign policy in nepal has sought to strengthen democracy and to prevent the collapse of nepal which should it become failed state could undermine regional stability the united states had previously provided support in nepals struggle against the maoists us policy towards the maoists who remain on two of three us terrorist lists appears to be dependant on the continued participation of the maoists in the democratic process nepal has been described as yam between two boulders nepals geopolitical status as small

instability and achieving peaceful transition to stable democracy are viewed by observers as key to providing the basis for economic growth the maoists will likely focus on how to retain control of the next government as the constituent assembly ca determines its form uncertainty remains over how well nepal will negotiate this political transition in the months ahead some analysts have expressed concern that the maoists could once again resort to widespread violence if they view their influence as curtailed too much by democratic political opposition although the maoists have the most seats in parliament they do not have an outright majority this makes them to an extent reliant on smaller coalition partners the fact that the maoists were not able to place one of their own in the office of the president demonstrates that there are limits to their power in the current configuration of government the communist party of nepal maoist cpnm has been supported by the communist party of nepal united marxistleninist cpnuml and the madhesi peoples rights forum mprf in the ca see box below the nepali congress nc is the main opposition party the economist intelligence unit has described the cpnm as having established its political preeminence while falling short of outright dominance4 the maoist government has received criticism in nepal for not having made progress on drafting new constitution5 historical context to the present political situation nepal has been an independent kingdom since 1768 never colonized the country was almost totally isolated from outside influence until the early 1950s transition from strict rule by the king to constitutional monarchy began in 1959 when thenking mahendra issued new constitution and held the countrys first democratic elections in 1960 however the king declared the parliamentary system failure dismissed the fledgling government suspended the constitution and established partyless system of rule under the monarchy although officially banned political parties continued to exist and to agitate for return to constitutional democracy in february 1990 student groups and the major political parties launched the movement for the restoration of democracy the centrist nepali congress nc party joined with the leftist parties to hold peaceful demonstrations in nepals urban centers in april 1990 after more than 50 people were killed when police fired on crowd of demonstrators thenking birendra turned power over to an interim government this government drafted constitution in november 1990 establishing nepal as

the approval of twothirds majority of parliament in february 1996 the leaders of the underground cpnm launched peoples war in the midwestern region of nepal with the aim of replacing the constitutional monarchy with oneparty communist regime the uprising appears to have been fueled by widespread perceptions of government corruption and failure to improve the quality of life of citizens including providing access to cultivable land the maoists ran parallel government established their own tax system burned land records and redistributed seized property and food to the poor in 45 districts6 the insurgency was waged in part through torture killings and bombings targeting police the military and public officials number of bank robberies combined with revolutionary tax revenue made the nepali maoists one of the wealthiest rebel groups in asia7 the kathmandu government faced additional turmoil in june 2001 when crown prince dipendra shot and killed his parents king birendra and queen aishwarya seven other members of the royal family and himself reportedly after disagreement over whom he should marry this incident did much to undermine the legitimacy of the monarchy king gyanendra the former kings brother was crowned on june 4 2001 and he appointed commission to investigate the assassinations by midjune the country began returning to normal following rioting and widespread refusal to believe official accounts of the massacre in july 2001 prime minister girija prasad koirala stepped down amid fears of continuing instability and his governments failure to deal with the growing maoist insurgency he was replaced by nc leader sher bahadur deuba who then became the head of nepals eleventh government in as many years constitutional crisis during the summer of 2002 the government of nepal was thrown into constitutional crisis that interfered with its ability to effectively combat the maoist insurgency the crisis began in late may when king gyanendra at the request of the prime minister dissolved parliament and unilaterally declared threemonth extension of emergency rule which had expired on may 24 2002 the prime minister who also scheduled early elections for november 2002 reportedly took such action after his centrist nepali congress party refused to support his plan to extend emergency rule following the prime ministers actions 56 former members of parliament filed lawsuit against him claiming there was constitutional precedent for the dissolution of parliament during emergency rule in august 2002 the supreme court rejected this lawsuit although opponents of the prime minister agreed to accept the verdict they emphasized the difficulty of holding free and fair 6 aniket alam abductions political message by

was under either rebel or army control8 although the prime minister pledged that there would be emergency rule during the scheduled november 2002 elections maoist attacks and threatened strikes prompted the government to consider various measures to prevent maoist disruption of the polls the government discussed imposing partial state of emergency in areas most affected by the insurgency however opposition parties which urged the government to open dialogue with the maoists argued that by curbing civil liberties emergency rule would inhibit free and fair elections as an alternative the government announced in september 2002 that it would hold the elections in six stages over two months starting in midnovember so that government troops could be transferred around the country to protect voters and candidates9 after further deliberation however nepals cabinet concluded that the security situation was too risky to hold elections on october 3 2002 the cabinet asked king gyanendra to postpone the national elections for one year10 the next day the king dismissed the prime minister disbanded his cabinet and assumed executive powers the kings takeover the security situation in nepal deteriorated after the collapse of the ceasefire between the maoists and the government on august 27 2003 the maoists favored drafting new constitution that would abolish the monarchy the king opposed such move and wanted the maoists to relinquish their weapons accommodation between the king and opposition democratic elements had been thought to be key to creating the unified front necessary to defeat the maoists with his direct assumption of powers and arrest of opposition democratic elements the king decided to try to defeat the maoists on his own this move proved to be the beginning of the end of the power of the monarchy in nepal after seizing direct power in february 2005 king gyanendra exerted control over democratic elements but made little progress in the struggle against the maoists the king reportedly thought he could take advantage of split in the maoist leadership and disarray amongst democrats to seize control and use the royal nepal army rna to defeat the maoists11 the seizure of power by the king appears to have been aimed as much if not more so at asserting the kings control over democratic forces many observers felt that military

by the king and the democrats was needed to establish unified front to defeat the maoists12 when the king assumed power he stated that he would take steps to reinstate constitutional democracy within 100 days which he then failed to do although some political prisoners were released by the king hundreds of others remained under arrest and restrictions on civil liberties such as public assembly and freedom of the press remained in place office of the high commissioner of human rights team was established in nepal in april 2005 to monitor the observance of human rights and international humanitarian law13 by moving against the democrats who under different circumstances could have worked with the king against the maoists the king strengthened the position of the maoists by some estimates almost half of the rna was occupied with palace security civil administration and efforts to restrict communications and civil rights14 the kings legitimacy with the people was weakened due to the circumstances under which he assumed the throne the way he seized direct rule and due to poor popular perceptions of his prince paras shah15 the former crown prince was unpopular with nepalis for his drunken antics and playboy lifestyle16 maoist reaction from february 13 to 27 2005 the maoists reacted to the kings actions by blockading major highways linking the countrys 75 districts as well as international road links to india and china17 this led to clashes between maoists and the rna and brought trade by road to standstill the army organized armed convoys which allowed limited trade to continue18 the maoists had earlier cut off land routes to kathmandu in august 200419 during the weeklong blockade in 2004 prices of some basic foods more than doubled and fuel was rationed20 this increase in food prices reportedly recurred in the 2005 blockade by blockading kathmandu the maoists successfully increased pressure on the kings government and demonstrated their power 12 us

seething over the result and viewed the indian government as derelict of its duties and violative of its oath of office to safeguard the countrys interests it is thought by some observers that much of this concern stems from fear by some in india that chinas power in the region would grow as result of the outcome of the ca election55 china the nepali leadership has long resented indian economic influence and has sought to establish more independent foreign policy kathmandu has at times played the china card in seeking to counterbalance what it considers undue pressure from india beijing has

marking the 1959 failed tibetan uprising against chinese rule57 it was reported in september 2008 that china had approved rs 100 million in military assistance to nepal during visit to china by nepals minister for defense ram bahadur thapa58 it appears that nepal will continue with one china policy and continue to take hard line on tibetan refugees as the cpnm and other major parties will likely be
