february 1 2005 steven woehrel specialist in european affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress ukraines political crisis and us policy issues summary in 2004 many observers believed that ukraine was at key period in its transition that could shape its geopolitical orientation for years to come in part due to presidential elections held on october 31 november 21 and december 26 2004 in their view ukraine could move closer to integration in euroatlantic institutions real democracy and the rule of law and genuine free market economy or it could move toward russian sphere of influence with managed democracy and an oligarchic economy for the past decade ukraines political scene had been dominated by president leonid kuchma and the oligarchic clans regionally based groups of powerful politicians and businessmen that have supported him the oligarchs chose prime minister viktor yanukovych as their candidate to succeed kuchma as president the chief opposition candidate former prime minister viktor yushchenko was proreform prowestern figure seen by many observers as man of high personal integrity international observers criticized the election campaign and the first and second rounds of the election as not free and fair citing such factors as governmentrun media bias in favor of yanukovych abuse of absentee ballots barring of opposition representatives from electoral commissions and inaccurate voter lists nevertheless yushchenko topped the first round of the vote on october 31 by razorthin margin over yanukovych other candidates finished far behind after the november 21 runoff between the two top candidates ukraines central election commission proclaimed yanukovych the winner yushchenkos supporters charged that massive fraud had been committed they blockaded government offices in kiev and appealed to the ukrainian supreme court to invalidate the vote as fraudulent the court did so on december 3 calling for repeat of the second round on december 26 yushchenko won the december 26 revote with 5199 of the vote to yanukovychs 4419 after several court challenges by yanukovych were rejected yushchenko was inaugurated as president of ukraine on january 23 2005 the european union and the united states strongly denounced electoral fraud in ukraine in the first two rounds and hailed the largely free and fair conduct of the repeat vote in contrast russian president vladimir putin openly backed yanukovych and publicly congratulated him on his victory soon after the second round vote russian officials have charged that the united states and the european unions charges of electoral fraud were an attempt to bring ukraine under western influence us policymakers must tackle such difficult issues as how to promote democracy in ukraine ukraines possible troop withdrawal from iraq and us russian tensions over ukraines future geopolitical orientation the 109th congress adopted

that could shape its geopolitical orientation for years to come in part due to presidential elections held on october 31 november 21 and december 26 2004 in their view ukraine could move closer to integration in euroatlantic institutions real democracy and the rule of law and genuine free market economy or it could move toward russian sphere of influence with managed democracy and an oligarchic economy ukraine comparable in size and population to france is large important european state in its own right1 the fact that it occupies the sensitive position between russia and new nato member states poland slovakia hungary and romania adds to its geostrategic significance regionally and for the united states many russian politicians as well as ordinary citizens have never been fully reconciled to ukraines independence in 1991 russian nationalists in particular view reunion with ukraine as highly desirable natural and virtually inevitable the us and european view especially in central and eastern europe is that strong independent ukraine is an important source of regional stability over the past decade ukraines political scene has been dominated by president leonid kuchma and the oligarchic clans regionallybased groups of powerful politicians and businessmen that have supported him kuchma was elected president in 1994 and reelected in 1999 he could not run for third term under the ukrainian constitution his rule was characterized by fitful economic reform albeit with solid economic growth in recent years widespread corruption and deteriorating human rights record the oligarchs chose prime minister viktor yanukovych representative of the powerful donetsk clan in eastern ukraine as their candidate to succeed kuchma as president during the campaign yanukovych and other ukrainian government leaders called for closer ties with moscow and 1 ukraine became part of the russian empire in the late 1600s experienced brief period of independence at the end of the first world war was reconquered by soviet armies and was republic of the soviet union from 1922 until the dissolution of the ussr in december 1991 eastern ukraine is heavily industrialized with large defense industrial sector and large though inefficient coal and steel industries ukraines industries are closely integrated with those of russia the population of eastern ukraine is also said to be substantially russified it has substantial population of ethnic russians and most of the ethnic ukrainian population in the east speaks russian as their first language western and central ukraine are more agricultural and ukrainian nationalism is more prominent there crs2 downplayed the prospects for nato membership and euroatlantic integration for the foreseeable future yanukovych supporters also used antiamerican themes in their campaign the chief opposition candidate former prime minister viktor yushchenko is proreform and prowestern figure seen by many observers as man of high personal integrity the kuchma regime reportedly feared that yushchenko could move to clean up corruption if elected which could expose kuchma and other current leaders to criminal prosecution the oligarchs could also lose property acquired through privatizations of dubious legality some occurring in the weeks and months leading up to the vote electoral campaign conditions prior to the election us and international officials expressed concern about the lack of press freedom in ukraine almost all major broadcast media were under tight control of the government or of businessmen with close ties to the government governmentcontrolled broadcast and press outlets engaged in biased reporting in favor of yanukovych while yushchenko was sharply criticized according to long term observer mission from the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce independent print media and the few independent broadcast outlets expressed wide variety of views but ukrainian journalists have been subject to harassment and in some cases violence2 independent media were subject to selective tax audits libel suits pressure on printing and distribution and refusal to renew broadcasting licenses according to most international observers ukrainian authorities violated standards for free and fair elections in other ways during the campaign osce observers noted in reports in september and october 2004 that government employees factory workers and students were threatened with dismissal unless they supported yanukovych opposition efforts to hold election rallies were hampered at times by government harassment in early september 2004 yushchenko accused the authorities of trying to poison him on september 6 yushchenko fell seriously ill shortly after attending dinner with the chief of the ukrainian security services after his condition worsened he was rushed to medical clinic in austria doctors were unable to determine the cause of the illness at the time yushchenko soon resumed campaigning but his health remained fragile and his face severely pockmarked over 3500 election observers registered to monitor the october 31 vote according to ukrainian officials these included group of 600 observers from the 2 in november 2000 an audio tape provided by former bodyguard of ukrainian president kuchma purportedly captured kuchmas orders to top officials to neutralize independent journalist georgiy gongadze whose headless mutilated body had been found by police kuchmas alleged involvement in this murder is seen by some as key factor in undermining his public support and credibility in ukraine crs report rl30984 ukraines future and us policy issues p 1 crs3 osce other institutions represented included the council of europe the international republican institute the national democratic institute freedom house the world congress of ukrainians and the commonwealth of independent states similarly large number of international observers were present for the second round of the election on november 21 ukrainian law did not provide for domestic nonpartisan election observers serious shortcoming according to the osce election results on november 10 after substantial delay the ukrainian central election commission announced the final results of the first round of the election according to the cec yushchenko won 3987 of the vote while yanukovych won 3932 socialist party leader oleksandr moroz won 581 and communist party leader petro symonenko received 497 of the vote the remaining 20 candidates split the remaining vote according to ukrainian law since candidate received 50 of the vote the top two finishers yanukovych and yushchenko moved on to november 21 runoff election the distribution of the first round vote broke down sharply along regional lines with the more nationallyoriented western and central ukraine supporting yushchenko and the more russified eastern and southern ukraine supporting yanukovych for example yanukovych won 8694 in his home region of donetsk while yushchenko received only 294 in the lviv region in western ukraine yushchenko won 8725 while yanukovych won 581 turnout for the first round was an impressive 74953 international observers from the osce criticized the first round of the election saying that it fell short of international democratic practices in several respects the observers noted problems in the campaign including heavy media bias use of government resources on behalf of yanukovych and government interference with opposition campaign events observers noted significant problems on election day including large number of names missing from voting rolls and the lastminute barring of some members of local electoral commissions from their posts4 pointing to exit polls and parallel vote count conducted by the opposition the yushchenko campaign charged that widespread government fraud and intimidation denied yushchenko large lead over yanukovych perhaps even outright victory in the first round despite these concerns yushchenko said that he was prepared to go forward with the second round of voting on november 21 on november 24 the ukrainian central election commission announced that yanukovych had won the second round with 4946 of the vote with yushchenko receiving 4661 turnout for the election was said to be 8085 yushchenkos supporters charged that massive fraud had been committed they pointed to exit 3 for the official results of the elections see the website of the ukrainian central election commission httpic2wwwcvkgovuawp0011e 4 for the texts of the osce observation mission reports on the ukrainian elections see the osce website httpwwwosceorg crs4 polls that showed victory for yushchenko by comfortable margin as well as improbable turnout figures in yanukovych strongholds including 9665 in the donetsk region the officially reported second round results showed the same regional split as the first round with yushchenko winning overwhelmingly in western and central ukraine and yanukovych winning by massive margins in eastern and southern ukraine5 election observers from the osce again said that the conduct of the november 21 runoff was not consistent with democratic standards fraudulent practices noted by international observers included abuse of absentee ballots abuse of mobile ballot boxes expulsion of opposition representatives from electoral commissions violence against media representatives inaccurate voter lists and official pressure on students and government and private sector workers to vote for yanukovych the yushchenko campaign also provided what it called taperecorded evidence of systematic largescale fraud in the vote count ukraines political crisis on november 22 after preliminary results favoring yanukovych were published yushchenko claimed victory in the election and his supporters warned that they would launch court challenges massive nonviolent street protests and other forms of civil disobedience to overturn the fraudulent result on november 23 yushchenko in symbolic move took the oath of office of the president of ukraine in the parliament chamber while as many as 200000 yushchenko supporters demonstrated outside the building tens of thousands attended protests in other ukrainian cities mainly in western ukraine the government of the capital kiev as well as the cities of lviv ivanofrankivsk vynntsia and ternopil in western ukraine announced that they would recognize only yushchenko as president on november 25 the ukranian supreme court blocked official publication of the election result the last step required before the winning candidate can be inaugurated pending its consideration of yushchenkos fraud charges on november 27 the ukrainian parliament approved resolution calling the election invalid and passed vote of confidence in the central election commission although neither of these votes was binding on the government they denoted that the pro regime majority in the parliament was fragmenting or bending to popular pressure and represented serious blow to the regimes prestige on december 1 the parliament took the further step of adopting motion of noconfidence in the yanukovych government which required kuchma to decide whether to keep yanukovych as the head of caretaker government or appoint someone else another indication of the erosion of the regimes support after the second round vote was the refusal of journalists at progovernment broadcast stations to continue to follow regime guidelines on coverage they provided more balanced coverage of opposition leaders and the massive opposition demonstrations in kiev the opposition kept the pressure up on the regime by holding massive rallies in kiev in 5 ukrainian central election commission httpic2wwwcvkgovuawp0011e crs5 which hundreds of thousands of people participated and by peacefully blockading the parliament and government office buildings it was unclear at first whether ukrainian internal security forces or the army would obey possible orders to use violence against protesters statement by the ukrainian prosecutor general the interior ministry and the security services on november 22 warned that they would put an end to any lawlessness by the opposition quickly and firmly on the other hand the defense minister and the head of the security service of ukraine ukraines chief intelligence agency said that they would not issue orders to use force against protesters the leading posts in ukraines internal security services were deemed by analysts to be held by supporters of an oligarchic group led by ukrainian presidential administration chief viktor medvedchuk however the large number of people that yushchenko managed to turn out into the streets appeared to give the regime pause moreover it appears that yushchenko and his supporters made substantial inroads in persuading rankandfile police not to obey orders to use force against protestors december 14 report in the financial times cited western intelligence reports yuri baziv deputy head of the presidential administration and others as saying that yanukovych and medvedchuk urged president kuchma to use force against the demonstrators on november 28 but that kuchma refused another report claimed that leaders of the security service of ukraine and ukrainian military intelligence played key roles in persuading senior interior ministry officers not to implement oral instructions presumably by medvedchuk and yanukovych to use violence against protesters on november 286 the massing of several hundred thousand ardent yushchenko supporters in kievs independence square and the continuation of this people power pressure on the government for two weeks was extraordinary in several respects the demonstrators remained peaceful and well disciplined throughout extensive logistical support was put in place very quickly to support the mass demonstrations these efforts testify not only to the determination of the demonstrators but suggest strong leadership and advanced planning preparation and training as well perhaps fearful of the regimes loss of control of the situation in kiev on november 29 officials from 17 regional governments in southern and eastern ukraine met in yanukovychs eastern ukraine power base and adopted resolution warning that their regions would seek autonomy within ukraine if yushchenko becomes president the regional legislature in donetsk yanukovychs home region announced that it would hold referendum on autonomy for the region the announced referendum was later cancelled on december 3 the ukrainian supreme court ruled that the second round of the election was invalid due to vote fraud it called for repeat vote of the second round to be held on december 26 the courts decision marked major victory for yushchenko however subsequent negotiations between the parties over how to implement the decision proved difficult yushchenko wanted kuchma to dismiss the 6 cj chivers back channels crackdown averted new york times january 17 2005 1 crs6 yanukovych government and the central electoral commission which oversaw the fraudulent vote he also wanted the ukrainian parliament to pass changes to electoral legislation to eliminate the methods used by the authorities to falsify the previous vote for his part president kuchma resisted dismissing the yanukovych government he granted yanukovychs request for temporary leave of absence from his post during the campaign for the repeat vote kuchma and regime loyalists in parliament said that they would support election law changes and dismissing the central election commission only if the parliament approved amendments to the ukrainian constitution to reduce the powers of the presidency and increase those of parliament and the prime minister the move served to split antiregime forces in the parliament the socialists who favor yushchenko also strongly supported the amendments the communists who rejected both candidates in the second round also advocated these political reforms on december 8 the ukranian parliament agreed on package of measures aimed at ending the political crisis the parliament approved changes to the election law to reduce the chances of electoral fraud in the december 26 revote the parliament dismissed the central election commission and approved new commission majority of the new members were proposed by proyushchenko groups in contrast the candidacies of the former chairman of the commission and supporters of yanukovych were voted down the parliament also overwhelmingly approved political reforms reducing the powers of the presidency which will go into effect in september 2005 if new law on local government is passed and in january 2006 if it is not under the reform the cabinet of ministers will be the supreme executive body in ukraine the president will have the power to nominate the prime minister the foreign minister and the defense minister subject to the approval of parliament the rest of the government will be nominated by the prime minister and approved by the parliament the president will retain the power to appoint governors in ukraines regions power in the parliament appeared to be shifting to yushchenko the proregime majority in the parliament which appeared increasingly shaky during the crisis began to fall apart with many former regime loyalists either drifting toward yushchenko or adopting more neutral stance kuchmas shift from support of yanukovych to his support for the reform package also demonstrated the lack of solidarity among senior regime leaders yanukovych sharply criticized the reform package saying that he doubted the new vote would be free and fair given that he now had representatives on the cec he added that he felt that kuchma had betrayed him on december 11 doctors at austrias rudolfinerhaus clinic who treated yushchenko for his mysterious illness during the election campaign confirmed that yushchenko had been poisoned with the toxic substance dioxin after the report the parliament and government prosecutors reopened their inquiry into the case yushchenko called for the investigation to be put off until after the vote so as to not unduly influence the campaign however observers noted that the report was likely crs7 to further increase sympathy and support for yushchenko and antipathy toward the regime results of the december 26 repeat election on december 28 the ukrainian central election commission announced that with 100 of the vote counted yushchenko had beaten yanukovych 5199 to 4419 as in the first two rounds support for the candidates was divided sharply on regional lines yushchenko won decisively in western and central ukraine while yanukovych won in southern and eastern ukraine although yushchenko made modest inroads in some areas of eastern ukraine turnout for the repeat election was 773 international observers said that although some problems remained the conduct of the repeat election marked great improvement over the conduct of the first two rounds moving ukraine substantially closer to osce standards yanukovych refused to accept the election result and charged that fraud had been committed on december 31 he resigned as prime minister he lodged series of legal challenges to the results after these appeals were rejected by the ukrainian supreme court yushchenko was inaugurated as president of ukraine on january 23 2005 yushchenko has said that he will divide government positions proportionately among the parties and group that supported him and that he will replace all of kuchmas regional governors including those in eastern ukraine on january 24 yushchenko announced the nomination of yulia tymoshenko as prime minister tymoshenko is energetic charismatic leader with sometimes combative political style who campaigned effectively on yushchenkos behalf however she is controversial figure due to her connection in the mid1990s with oligarchic elites including former prime minister pavlo lazarenko currently serving sentence in us prison for fraud money laundering and extortion tymoshenko served as head of gas trading firm and as deputy prime minister in lazarenkos notoriously corrupt government she is reportedly extremely wealthy however when serving as deputy prime minister in yushchenkos government from 1999 to 2001 she pushed through reforms that squeezed an estimated 2 to 3 billion in tax revenue from her former colleagues in the energy sector earning their bitter enmity as result she was ousted from the government in 2001 and yushchenkos government later collapsed she was then investigated on corruption and money laundering charges and was briefly jailed all charges were formally dropped after yushchenkos election russia also filed bribery charges against her shortly before the election campaign these charges may effectively bar her from traveling to russia if she becomes the prime minister unless russian prosecutors decide to drop them yushchenko has said that his key domestic priorities included reducing the size of the unofficial shadow economy maintaining macroeconomic stability and above all fighting corruption he vowed to prosecute those guilty of crimes including fraud during the recent election and the attempt on his life he said that he does not envision wholesale reversal of sometimes dubious privatization deals in the past 15 years possible relief to some oligarchs but that he will revisit few highly questionable privatizations that occurred in the runup to the election his main crs8 foreign policy priority is expanding ties with the eu at first seeking eu designation as market economy after ukraine receives world trade organization membership he wishes to establish free trade zone with the eu and finally an association agreement in 2007 the first step to eu membership international response russia during the campaign president putin and other russian leaders made many statements in support of yanukovych large number of russian political consultants associated with the kremlin advised yanukovychs campaign us officials have said that there were credible reports that russia supplied large sums to the yanukovych campaign president putin visited ukraine just before each of the two rounds of the vote and praised the achievements of yanukovychs government in contrast to western concerns about the election russian president putin pointedly congratulated yanukovych on his alleged victory in the second round of what putin called fair election even before the official vote count was announced7 russian officials strongly condemned western and osce charges of electoral fraud as interference in ukraines internal affairs and motivated by desire to increase western influence in ukraine at moscows expense after hasty meeting with kuchma in moscow after the second round of the election putin ridiculed the idea of repeat of the second round after the ukrainian supreme courts decision putin said on december 6 that he would work with any democraticallyelected ukrainian leader but then charged that yushchenko was trying to seize power by force at an osce foreign ministers meeting in sofia bulgaria on december 7 russia blocked statement supporting the ukrainian supreme courts decision invalidating the election and calling for new vote on december 26 russian officials sharply criticized the political reform package passed by the ukrainian parliament on december 8 putin waited until all of yanukovychs legal appeals were exhausted to congratulate yushchenko on his election despite moscows former hostility president yushchenko visited president putin in moscow on january 24 in fulfillment of campaign pledge to make his first foreign trip as president to russia both leaders attempted to strike conciliatory tone yushchenko called russia permanent strategic partner of ukraine putin for his part tried to shift the blame for moscows support for yanukovych claiming that russia never acted in underhanded ways in the former soviet states and that moscow did only what the outgoing leadership requested of us however yushchenko made clear that his main priority would be to integrate into the eu and other euroatlantic structures and would subordinate any participation in the russianled single economic space to this goal russias conduct during the political crisis in ukraine could be important in shaping russias relations with the united states and most of the rest of europe for 7 rferl newsline crs9 years to come many observers in ukraine europe and the united states see moscows actions in connection with the ukrainian election and the subsequent political crisis as an attempt by the putin regime to reassert russian dominance over ukraine moscow mayor yuri luzhkov attended the november 29 meeting of leaders from ukraines southern and eastern regions that called for autonomy in response to possible yushenko victory he delivered speech praising the group and harshly denouncing yushchenko some observers assert that luzhkovs appearance at the gathering may be sign that russia was willing to go so far as to appear to support separatism in ukraine in order to retain its influence there some critics of russian policy are quick to point out that this ukrainian issue is not an isolated event they note russias increased pressure on neighboring georgia and moldova where moscow maintains military bases in defiance of those governments oftrepeated demands for their withdrawal and russian support of armed separatist regimes there8 they see this as an attempt to reestablish russian control on the territory of the former soviet union many of these critics also call attention to what they see as similarly disturbing policies of president putin inside russia such as curtailing press freedom especially of the broadcast media moving even beyond managed democracy toward form of soft authoritarianism thinly disguised by sham elections and undermining free markets by dismantling yukos one of russias biggest most important and most independentminded businesses and threatening similar action against other businesses that oppose the kremlin some observers view russian intervention in ukraine as critical issue they believe that without ukraine russia cannot be an empire with ukraine russia is automatically an empire and whether or not russia is an empire is profoundly important in shaping russias own evolution in its relations with its neighbors and also for the security interests of united states9 european union the presidency of the european union and the european parliament rejected the second round results as fraudulent and advocated repeat election even before one was ordered by ukraines supreme court eu leaders expressed this view during november 25 eurussia summit meeting with president putin the european union and some of its member countries played key roles in international efforts to broker solution to the political crisis after the second round german chancellor gerhard schroeder who has cultivated close relationship with the germanspeaking putin reportedly tried during several telephone conversations with 8 russia provides economic political and military support to the abkhazian and south ossetian separatist movements in georgia and to the selfproclaimed dniester republic in moldova 9 see for example zbigniew brzezinski the grand chessboard american primacy and its geostrategic

lithuanian president valdas adamkus have served as mediators in several rounds of talks in kiev with president kuchma and both candidates after the december 26 revote eu leaders noted the positive assessment by international observers of the conduct of the election and said that the resolution of ukraines political crisis would clear the way for closer euukraine cooperation now that yushchenko has taken office the eu will be faced with the issue of whether to upgrade its relationship with more democratic ukraine including whether to offer the possibility of eventual membership the eu has unveiled new neighborhood policy aimed at strengthening ties with countries around the newly enlarged eu including ukraine but the new policy does not include even the remote prospect of membership eu officials have greeted with little enthusiasm yushchenkos ambition to sign an association agreement with brussels by 2007 many observers note that some eu countries including france and germany appear more reluctant to offend moscow than countries such as poland and baltic states which see democratic ukraine as buffer against possibly neoimperialist russia in contrast france germany and other eu countries stress the importance of maintaining good ties with moscow in order to preserve regional stability and key economic ties with russia in addition possible membership for ukraine poses difficult problems of its own for the eu which is struggling to incorporate recently admitted members as well as possible future new members in turkey and the balkans us policy before the elections the united states warned ukrainian leaders that ukraines prospects for euroatlantic integration would be strongly influenced by whether ukraine held free and fair vote us officials said the united states could work with either major candidate if he is elected fairly in an october 14 press statement state department spokesman richard boucher said that the united states was deeply disappointed that the campaign fell short of international standards he warned that the united states would reexamine its relationship with those engaged in election fraud and manipulation on november 1 state department spokesman adam ereli said that the united states agreed with the assessment of the osce observers that the conduct of the first round of the vote fell short of democratic standards noting particularly flawed voter lists and arbitrary expulsion of electoral commissioners shortly before the vote senator richard lugar chairman of the senate foreign relations committee monitored the november 21 runoff at the request of president bush he said after the vote that it is now apparent that there was concerted and forceful program of election day fraud and abuse enacted with the leadership or cooperation of the authorities senator lugar said that he had carried letter from president bush to president kuchma that warned that tarnished election will cause the united states 10 putin to respect new ukraine election germany reuters november 30 2004 crs11 to review its relations with ukraine senator lugar stressed that kuchma has the responsibility and the opportunity for producing even at this point an outcome which is fair and responsible11 president bush and administration officials issued sharp criticisms of the conduct of the second round of the elections on november 24 secretary of state colin powell said that the united states could not accept the officially declared election results as legitimate due to the extensive and credible reports of fraud in the election powell called for full review of the conduct of the election and the tallying of election results12 on november 26 president bush said that the validity of ukraines elections was in doubt and warned that the international community is watching very carefully how the ukrainian government responds to allegations of vote fraud13 on november 29 secretary powell stressed in discussions with kuchma and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov us support for peaceful solution to the crisis that respects ukraines territorial integrity state department officials have expressed strong us opposition to any separatist initiatives in ukraine14 on december 2 president bush added that any election if there is one ought to be free from any foreign influence these elections ought to be open and fair15 secretary powell praised the ukrainian supreme courts decision to hold repeat vote calling it victory for the ukrainian people16 us officials issued statements strongly supporting the political reform package agreed to by president kuchma and the ukrainian parliament on december 8 us spokesmen also called for thorough and transparent investigation of the alleged poisoning of yushchenko during december 7 hearing before the house international relations committee john tefft deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs detailed us efforts to promote free and fair elections in ukraine he said that electionrelated assistance amounted to about 138 million the aid included support for independent media nonpartisan political party training voter education training for election officials and observers the united states funded antifraud efforts such as independent exit polling and parallel vote counts the united states also provided financial support for osce and other election observers tefft also announced that the administration had submitted congressional notification for an additional 3 million for the december 26 repeat vote

the free and fair conduct of the december 26 repeat vote as historic day for democracy in ukraine and said that the united states looks forward to working with the new ukrainian president secretary powell attended yushchenkos inauguration on january 23 2005 during january 26 meeting in krakow poland with yushchenko vice president dick cheney hailed ukraines free and fair election and said president yushchenko was an ally in freedoms cause and president bush and the american people stand with him he said that the united states supports ukraines aspirations to join the institutions that bind the free nations of the west17 us policy issues one important issue for us policy will be how to support the new democratic leadership in ukraine political measures could include an early visit to washington by yushchenko or visit to ukraine by president bush perhaps during his february 2005 trip to europe the united states could also increase bilateral aid and lending from international financial institutions and offer other forms of support to the new leadership current aid levels are relatively modest the conference report for the fy2005 foreign aid bill pl 108447 provides 70 million for ukraine in freedom support act aid for political and economic reform and 3 million in foreign military financing if the presidents fy2005 request for other accounts such as international military education and training the peace corps childrens health programs and nonproliferation assistance are fully funded the total would reach 849 million some experts propose that congress approve legislation to graduate ukraine from the provisions of the jacksonvanik amendment which conditions normal trade relations ntr status on freedom of emigration18 ukraines efforts to join the world trade organization would be enhanced if the department of commerce designated ukraine as market economy such us assistance and similar assistance and support from the eu could be important to consolidating the gains of democratic forces in ukraine in the runup to the march 2006 parliamentary elections which have assumed even greater importance due to the political reforms adopted as part of the solution to ukraines political crisis there is also the issue of the impact of ukraines political crisis on the bilateral relationship between the united states and russia some observers have questioned whether the united states in hopes of fostering good bilateral relationship with moscow has overlooked longstanding russian rhetoric and actions aimed at consolidating russian sphere of influence over many of the soviet successor states such as georgia moldova belarus and now ukraine they say that an alleged reluctance by the united states to strongly criticize putins own increasing 17 white house transcript of vice president cheneys remarks january 27 2005 from the state department website httpwwwstategov 18 stephen pifer next steps in ukraine washington post january 1 2005 a23 crs13 authoritarianism at home may have also encouraged moscow to believe that the united states would not try to stop his efforts to support similar managed democracies in neighboring countries in response administration officials have noted that they have firmly rejected russian accusations of us interference in ukraines internal affairs saying the issue is one of democracy in ukraine not alleged geopolitical competition between russia and the west they say that publicly raising ukraine as an issue in overall usrussian relations would not help resolve the issue and could hurt usrussian cooperation on vital issues such as the global war on terror19 there is also the question of possible nato membership for ukraine yushchenko has said that he favors eventual ukrainian membership in nato although he has given more emphasis to the goal of eu membership the kuchma regime at least until the recent election campaign also said that it sought membership in the alliance and the united states expressed support for ukraines aspirations however ukraines lack of progress on reforms made such statements largely moot the emergence of westernoriented regime in kiev may make this issue more important if the united states decided to strongly support ukraines nato aspirations it will likely also have to cope with moscows strident opposition to ukraines nato membership as well as tension with european nato allies more eager to accommodate moscow on the issue possible us efforts to urge the eu to take more flexible stance on possible eu membership for ukraine could also increase friction with some european countries iraq another important issue for us policymakers is the possible withdrawal of ukrainian troops from iraq us officials said before the presidential election that ukraines contribution of 1600 troops while appreciated would not cause the united states to overlook ukraines democratic shortcomings however some observers were concerned that ukrainian
