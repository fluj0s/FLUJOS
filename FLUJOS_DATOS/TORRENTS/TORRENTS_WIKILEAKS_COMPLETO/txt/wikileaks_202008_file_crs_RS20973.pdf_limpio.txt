initiatives to integrate acute and longterm care edward alan miller analyst in social legislation domestic social policy division summary congres s has considered many approaches to improve the financing and delivery of longterm care services to vulnerable populations these approaches have included ways to improve the delivery of care to persons who qualify for both medicare and medicaid acute and longterm care services or dual eligibles because persons who are dual eligibles are especially vulnerable and costly both the federal and state governments are interested in finding more effective ways of serving them this report characterizes the dually eligible population and describes the problems associated with meeting their health and social service needs it briefly describes federal and state programs that seek to integrate acute and longterm care services for this population policy implications are also discussed this report summarizes the more indepth crs report rl30813 federal and state initiatives to integrate acute and longterm care issues profiles and will not be updated dual eligibles defined over the past two decades congres s has considered variety of proposals to improve the financing and delivery of longterm care one such approach is to better coordinate the acute and longterm care services needed by many of the 7 million medicare beneficiaries who also qualify for medicaid ie the dual eligibles compared to other beneficiaries dual eligibles are especially vulnerable and costly to serve not only are they disproportionately poor but they are more likely than other medicare beneficiaries to be age 85 or older disabled nonwhite female living alone in only fair or poor health cognitively and functionally impaired andor suffering from many chronic ailments and diseases see table 1 not surprisingly dual eligibles use disproportionate share of resources relative to their numbers although they constituted only 16 of medicare beneficiaries in 1995 dual eligibles accounted for approximately 30 of total medicare expenditures 53httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20973crs2 1 health care financing administration hcfa now the center for medicare and

lewin group inc for the office of the assistant secretary for planning and evaluation dhhs 2000billion1 although only 17 of medicaid recipients dual eligibles accounted for approximate ly 35 of medicaid expenditures 53 billion overall the 106 billion consumed by this population was onethird of total spending by both the medicare and medicaid programs combined in 1995 based on demographic projections that indicate significant growth among the oldest old those 85 years and older and growing ranks of the population that will be chronically ill and disabled medicare and medicaid expenditures for longterm care services for the elderly are projected to double between 2000 and 20252 it is likely that an increasingly disproportionate share of these resources will be consumed by dually eligible individuals since they are more likely to be among the populations requiring longterm care table 1 comparison of medicare beneficiaries by dual eligibility status 1998 characteristics

eligibles separate systems given their disprop ortionate share of disease and disability dual eligibles often require continuum of acute and longterm care services that meet their changing health and social service needs including services delivered in the home and the community the pepper commission defined longterm care as an array of services needed by individualshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20973crs3 3 call for action the pepper commission us bipartisan commission on comprehensive health care final report september 1990 p 90who have lost some capacity for independence because of chronic illness or condition longterm care consists of assistance with basic activities and routines of daily living such as bathing dressing meal preparation and housekeeping it may also include skilled and therapeutic care for the treatment and management of chronic conditions3 different programs and levels of government have been assigned primary responsibility for financing planning and administering the care that dual eligibles require dual eligibles are served by two programs medicare and medicaid administered under different rules by different authorities the federal and state governments that for these persons cover different categories of services acute and longterm care delivery of these two basic types of services has been delegated to different organizations and delivery systems whereas most acute care services are provided within hospitals and physicians offices most federal and state funded longterm care services are provided by nursing homes and communitybased health and social service organizations though the center for medicare and medicaid management cms formerly the health care financing administration hcfa administers both programs at the federal level states have been granted primary administrative responsibility for the medicaid program while medicaid provides coverage for both acute and longterm care services its coverage of longterm care is especially significant because dual eligibles rely on medicare as the primary payer for acute care services variety of other federal and state programs also support longterm care services federal programs include home and communitybased services funded through the older americans act the social services block grant the department of veterans affairs and various housing programs administered by the department of housing and urban development though not nearly as large as medicare or medicaid these programs play role in serving the longterm care needs of dual eligibles and others who do not meet the eligibility criteria of medicare andor medicaid their varying administrative structures eligibility requirements and available services make care coordination even more difficult divided responsibility implications and reform goals many believe that the bifurcation of responsibility for caring for dual eligibles between medicare and medicaid and sometimes other programs has helped create fragmented service delivery system fraught with administrative inefficiencies barriers to more effective care and incentives to shift costs from one payer to the other in view of perceived problems in the way acute and longterm care services for medicaremedicaid dual eligibles are financ ed administered and delivered some observers argue that reform of the health care delivery system is required if this population is going to be served more costeffectively among the most commonly articulated goals of reform are tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20973crs4 4 capitation refers to the payment of all health and longterm care services under an arrangement where providers are reimbursed for clients served on preset amount per patient capitation payments may be adjusted by various factors such as health and disability status and demographic characteristics of the population to be served as well as geographic variations in cost of services in the longterm care context the purpose of capitating payments to providers is to create an incentive for them to delay or prevent the need for institutional care by maintaining patients in communitybased settings by coordinating health and social services through effective case management and to use services efficiently 5 the shmo program also has the authority to capitate medicaid covered benefits though this only occurs in limited circumstanceseliminate fragmente d service delivery while promoting enhanced continuity of care and more simplified access to services develop communitybased options that prom ote beneficiary independence through the use of the most costeffective least restrictive care settings ie reduc institutional care in favor of home and communitybased care make benefits more flexible and responsive to the diverse and changing needs of individual beneficiaries promote improvements in care quality and beneficiary outcomes and control costs through greater emphasis on prevention and primary care reduced incentives to use institutional care fewer opportunities to cost shift streamlined administration and oversight and less reliance on cost based reimbursement systems federal and state initiatives the federal government and several states have developed number of pilot initiatives aimed at integrating acute and longterm care services for medicaremedicaid dual eligibles examples include federal initiatives such as the program for allinclusiv care of the elderly pace which uses managed care approach and capitates4 medicare and medicaid as well as the evercare demonstration and social health maintenance organization demonstration shmo which capitates medicare only5 comprehensive state demonstrations such as minnesota senior health options the wisconsin partnership program and the continuing care network demons tration of monroe county new york which like pace capitates both medicare and medicaid benefits and capitated state medicaid demonstrations such as the arizona long term care system oregon health plan and floridas communitybased diversion pilot project which capitate medicaid only but actively pursue various medicare coordination strategies implementation of dual eligible programs such as these require cms approval of waivers of certain medicaid and medicare program rules medicaid waiver in particular allows states to waive certain federal requirements in order to operate specifichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20973crs5 6 for more information on these approaches see crs report rl30813 federal and state initiatives to integrate acute and longterm care issues profiles by edward alan millerkinds of programs these waivers are usually referred to according to the section of the social security act under which they are authorized states have traditionally sought waivers of federal law when considering mandatory medicaid managed care programs and home and communitybased service expansion those explicitly incorporating medicare services into their managed care efforts have also sought medicare waivers which allow them to contract with plans that are not medicare risk contractors and to alter the way such contractors are paid waiver applications are reviewed and approved by cms though extant initiatives use varyin g approaches and combinations of waiver authorities general similarities exist in their strategies for integrating financing and service delivery see table 2 while financial integration involves capitation of medicare andor medicaid benefits service delivery integration typically involves comprehensive provider networks case management and interdisciplinary teams of providers less effort however has been made to integrate medicare and medicaid

financing and delivery of longterm care services but has primarily taken an incremental approach including development of federal and state initiatives to integrate acute and longterm care services though these programs serve comparatively small number of the nations dual eligibles they provide models that congress may want to consider when formulating longterm care policy in the future before taking action in this area however congress may want to consider variety of issues including doubts about managed cares appropriateness for serving vulnerable populations many worry that incentives under managed care to control utilization may have deleterious effects on patient welfare and qualityespecially for frail recipients however there is currently dearth of evaluation evidence to support or reject this claim definitively nevertheless proponents strongly believe in the efficacy of using managed care to integrate acute and longterm care financing service delivery and administration under medicare and medicaid they see managed care as way to eliminate fragmentation develop community service options make benefits more flexible promote quality of care improvements and control costs at the same time however they also point to number of statutory and regulatory requirements inhibiting the development and implementation of these programs given the concerns expressed by both advocates and opponents to using managed care to integrate acute and longterm care for medicaremedicaid dual eligibles congressional action in this area might include an examination of one or more of the following possibilities put forward by various health care experts streamlining or eliminating the cms waiver approval process allowing all states and not only few oregon arizona and minnesota to limit medicaid payment of medicare costsharing to dual eligibles who elect to obtain care through their states medicaid networks of providers promoting the development of care coordination mechanisms facilitating unified medicare and medicaid program administration including contracting enrollment and oversight using alternative payment mechanisms such as partial capitation which reduce plan risk thereby promoting participation in programs targeted toward potentially resourceintensive groups spurring the develop ment of better risk adjustment methodologies to guard against overpayment for healthy beneficiaries and underpayment for frail and disabled beneficiaries developing incentives that encourage health plans to participate in both medicarechoice and medicaid managed care simultaneously continuing and expanding existing federal initiatives such as pace shmo and evercare until more research evidence becomes available directing additional resources toward evaluation of existing programs and supporting the development of medicare or medicaidbased care management options independent of capitation
