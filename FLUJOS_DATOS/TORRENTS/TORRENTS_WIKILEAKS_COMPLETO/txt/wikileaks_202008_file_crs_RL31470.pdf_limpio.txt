congress and signed by president bush earlier in the year since the bta went into effect us imports from vietnam have more than doubled most of this increase is due to the sharp rise in clothing

international textile and apparel trade regime from 1974 to 1995 the multifiber arrangement mfa provided the framework for international trade in textiles and apparel the mfa was set of rules governing bilateral agreements that applied quotas on imports into countries whose domestic industries were facing seri ous damage from rapid surg of imports from developing countries the mfa in allowing importing countries to set different quota levels for individual exporting countries conflicted with the th general agreement on tariffs and trades gatt principle of qual treatment for

job losses by us clothing and textile workers opponents of negotiating an agreement contend that the final deal was too restrictive to vietnam and to us consumers prior to the signing of the agreement members of the us apparel manufacturing industry called for usv ietnam textile agreement to protect domestic producers against potential surge of vietnamese exports with the view that vietnam with its low labor costs mostfavorednation stat us and unrestrained access to the us market is threat to domestic production they contended that the lack of textile agreement could lead to increased job losses and factory closings in an industry already hard hit by the worl dwide recession and trad benefits extended to other countries20 domestic pressure for textile agreemen t was further heightened by us quota concessions granted to pakistan in fe bruary 2002 estimated at nearly 500 million over three years to help repay pakistan for its help in the war against terrorism at the time sources in the textile industry asserted that such concessions would have substantial impact on the us textile industry and could cost as many as 2500 jobs21 in order to offset this negative impact on domestic industry it has been suggested that quota space from another country be shifted to pakistan prior to the opening of negotiations with vietnam some sources hi nted that vietnam was the most likely candidate to lose potential quota22 once the agreement was finalized how ever several tex tile lobbying groups condemned it on the day the agreemen t was signed for instance the american textile manufacturers institute atmi issued statement labeling the quotas given vietnam as enormous calling special atte ntion to the largest quotas in history that were granted for woven trousers and cotton knit shirts domestic industrys most sensitive pr oducts the institute also published fact sheet alleging that us negotiators made large increases to vietnam between the time the formal negotiations

districts to support presidents bush request for trade promotion authority also known as fast track authority in december 200124 those opposed to negotiating textile ag reement with vietnam argued that by restricting trade any textile agreement would hurt american consumers us industries and the textile industry itself limiting the amount of apparel goods available to us consumers in theory would restrict choice and raise the cost to consumers of those goods which in turn would reduce us consumer spending on goods from other industries textile agr eement opponents maintained that us job losses would weaken us consumers purchasing power also it would limit vietnamese export earnings thereby reduc ing vietnams ability to buy us goods they asserted that textile quotas in re ducing the us industrys competition from abroad would discourage th industry from modernizing and improving productivity leaving the industry more vulnerable to in ternational competiti on after textile quotas expire under the atc in 2005 they also c ontended that freer trade with vietnam may also contribute to great er voice for the private s ector in the economic and political affairs of that country some opponents of vietnam textile ag reement have asked whether vietnam can truly be considered threat they have asserted that imports of vietnamese textile and clothing products accounted for less than 15 of the 78 billion in textile and apparel that the us imported in 2002 moreover in order for vietnams production to be true threat to us domestic producers it has to be shown that vietnams increased market share would come out of the market share of us producers opponents contended that the more likely scenario is that increased imports from vietnam displaces the market share of china or other developing country producers25 opponents of textile agreement also ve argued that the imposition of quotas could discourage potential investment in vi etnams textile industr if vietnam is subject to us quotas and is not wt member by 2005 the country would be at significant disadvantage against wto co mpetitors who will enjoy quotafree trade in textiles and apparel pponents have noted that poten tial investors eyeing post bta vietnam may choose not to risk be ing stranded in an industry that cannot compete well in the world market after 2005 another argument made against setting quotas on vietnam was that us producers of raw cotton one of the united states leading export items to the vietnam would benefit from expansion of vietnams garment sector since the bta was signed us cotton

in the united states and internationally27 within the broader debate about the eff ects of trade on labor standard s and the impact of varying labor standards on trade competitiveness is the question of whether trade agreements should include legallyenforceab standards to protect worker rights labor rights proponents argue that the wtos tradere lated aspects of in tellectual property rights trips which protects owner rights for seven types of intellectual property sets precedent for including legallybinding standards that protect the rights of resource holders in trade agreements some also ask whether it is morally acceptable for the united states to import items ma under labor conditions that would be illegal if the production occurred in the ited states proponent s believe that critical advantage of including labor rights provision in the body of trade agreement is that it allows for the use of the agreements dispute settlement process to ensure that labor standards are enforced on the other hand many argue that trad and labor issues should not be linked some economists point out that labor provisi ons inhibit free trade thereby raising the prices and reducing the sel ection of

of the agreement where they would be subject to dispute resolution procedures the labor provisions require each country to enforce its own labor laws and authorize sanctions for nonenforcement however controversy over the use of sanctions to enforce labor standards led to last minute exchange of letters between jordan and the us agreeing to make ever effort to resolve the disputes without recourse to the formal di spute resolution procedures34 some members of congress have called on the administration to include the jordan standard in the areas of trade and labor in future trade agreements35 possible approaches concerning vietnam labor provision new labor provisions this essentially is the option adopted in the usvietnam bilateral textile agreement which calls for vietnam to reaffirm its existing commitments to and coope ration with international and us labor agencies the agreement also commits the two countries labor ministries to meet to review progress toward the goal of improving working conditions in vietnams textile sector prior to the signing of the usvietnam bilateral textile agreement many argued that there was need for labor provision in any textile agreement including one between the us and vietnam in addition to the arguments mentioned above regarding the potential negative effect s on workers and consumers opponents of labor provision contended that the bta in itself will improve labor rights by promoting economic development foreign investment nd the rule of law in vietnam36 other critics of labor provision pointed out that vietnam is already working with the united states to improve its labor situation under memorandum of understanding mou signed during former president clintons visit to vietnam in november 2000 the vietnamese ministry of labor

bta its numerous labor programs with the ilo and other foreign governments nd its recent revision of the labor code vietnam has already demonstrated its co mmitment to improving labor standards these critics concluded that labor provision was not only unnecessary but that it could potentially distort the current efforts to improve worker rights in vietnam as discussed above however labor rights supporters viewed labor provision both as leverage to level the competitive playing field and as insurance against the use of unfair or substandard labor practices to bolster exports mou plus another approach that was discussed prior to signing the agreement was supplementing the current usvietnam labor cooperation program with an initiative tailored to the purpose of the labor provision for example if the goal of the labor provision were to improve conditions in the garment sector efforts could have been targeted at building the capacity of the vietnamese labor inspectorate to identify and enforce violations in that sector this could also have entailed focusing attention on the garment industry throug h cooperation with the ilo such an approach would likely have been supported by those who argue that the improvements in cambodias garment sector are the result of the international attention focused on the industry rather than the specific incentives of the us cambodia textile agreement jordan standard some supporters of labor provision have argued that at minimum any textile agreement should have language similar to that in the us jordan free trade agreement that requires vietnam to enforce its labor laws which have been substantially reformed over th past decade step beyond that might have included dispute resolution procedures that would have provided mechanism for the us to legally enforce the labor provision this would have given the united states economic recourse in the event that vietnam lowered its labor standards us opponents of dispute resolution mechanisms th at include labor st andards in general argue that it opens the door to the imposition of trade sanctions fo r alleged violations or lack of enforcement of countrys own labor laws based on vietnams reaction to us comments on its human rights s ituation vietnam would likely have viewed this approach as an unwarranted interference in its internal affairs cambodia model some suggested that vietnam textile agreement include trade incentive provision modeled af ter the cambodia textile agreement advocates of this provision pointed to numerous improvements in cambodias labor system as evidence of the models effectiv eness for example since the agreement began in 1999 cambodia has established tripar tite labor advi sory committee ratified 7 of the 8 ilo core conventions and established ne w regulations on union representation for collective bargaining in addition the minimum wage in the garment sector has been raised and the number of registered unions has risen

1997 to 245 by january 2002 approxima tely 218 of those unions are in the garment sector37 the cambodia ilo monitoring system itself has also been praised for contributing to increased communication trust and understanding of cambodian labor laws among unions employers nd the government through project advisory committee the monitoring program has provided forum for the tripartite social partners to discuss labor issues related to the project that committee also serves as an effective monitor of the mon itoring program itself since all three social partner groups review and in some cas approve activitie s under the project through factory visits and meetings with workers the monitoring program has also increased awareness among factory mana gement and employees about cambodian labor laws other supporters of the cambodian model viewed it not only as way to encourage governments to take action to improve labor conditions but more importantly as mechanism to empower workers because enterprises have to demonstrate good working cond itions in order to receive quota bonuses under the agreement it is in their interest to keep workers satisfied in order to minimize the incidence of complaints and disputes th is provides workers with an environment in which their issues are more likely to be addressed to their satisfaction and without reprisal from management supporters of the cam bodia mode l emphasized that as labor conditions improved through the incentive system so did the economic benefits to cambodia since the start of 1999 cambodia has increased its garment and textile exports to the us by roughly 500600 million the number of garment factories has increased and approximately 100000 j obs have been created in the sector38 some contend that the ilos neutral review of labor conditions makes cambodias garment sector more attractive for buyers and re tailers who are concerned about social responsibility they also assert that by contributing to improved labor re lations the cambodia model has enhanced political stability anot her critical factor in economic growth thus according to some the cambodia mode l proves that linking trade and labor can bring about the winwin results of economic growth and improved working conditions in january 2002 us trade re presentative robert zoellick called the cambodia agreement an exce llent example of the way trade agreements lead to economic growth and promote great er respect for workers rights39 on the other hand the ca mbodia agreement has been criticized for several reasons some critics argue that focusing international attention and inspection resources on the garment sector distorts the equal protection of workers in other sectors although garment sector work ers account for 50 of the industrial workhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31470crs16 40 labor trends report 2002 us embassy in cambodia 41 inside us trade uscambodia textile deal leaves most trade unrestrained january 11 2002 42

sector to determine whether cambodia comp lies with internati onal labor standards these critics also point out that despite the increased international attention and cambodias efforts there tinue to be reports of child labor forced overtime and antiunion discrimination in the garment sector other critics have called into question the effec tiveness of the cambodia incentive provision citing the fact that most of cambodias appa rel exports to the united states are not under quota accordin g to privatesector source cambodias unrestricted trade to the united states as of october 31 2001 wa s almost two and half times the volume of the trade under quota41 some observers suggest that leaving most textile and appa rel trade unrestrained is greater benefit to cambodia than the bonus quota offered through the bor provision of the factories that do produce quota goods there is the question of whether those in compliance with labor laws actually receive the bonus quota or mo re of the bonus quota than noncomplying factories42 if cambodian garment factories do not need additional quota nor expect to receive it the bonus quota may ve little impact on f actory management behavior some cont end that it is the international attention focused on its main industry rather than the quotas that prompted the repor ted improvements in cambodias labor situation another criticism of the incentive provision is that it acts in effect like reverse sanction under regular quota the exportin g country is entitled to ship set amount of goods to the united states if the unite d states believes labor laws in that country are not being enforced then the united stat must prove it in order to take that countrys quota away under the incentive approach the presumption is that the exporting country has poor labor standards in order to receive its bonus quota the country must prove that presumption wrong if in the end it receives less than the full amount of bonus quota as the case has been with cambodia it has little recourse some opponents of the cambodia agreemen t assert that it suffers from lack of transparent criteria used to meas ure cambodias substantial compliance43 while the ilo monitoring program bases its factory inspections on comprehensive checklist of criteria the program is still gathering baseline data on most factories and has yet to release followup report th at will show whether conditions have improved or worsened since 1999 howev er the us has awarded bonus quota to cambodia 3 times for improvements in comply ing with core labor

consulta tions conducted under the textile agreement is not available to the public on the flipside these critics ask whether monitoring program is necessary at all if the data used to ma ke the substantial compliance determination is available from other sources another view holds that the cambodia model whether effective in cambodia or not would not have been applicable to the vietnam context during testimony before the house ways and means committee on february 26 2003 us trade representative robert zoellick explaine d that the cambodia model would not be applied to vietnam because its economy is much more diverse than cambodias which is dominated by the textile and apparel industry therefore ambassador zoellick said providing incentives for improvements in the textile industrys working conditions would only meet tion of the united states broad labor interests in vietnam44 some argue that it would be difficult for vietnam to comply with the labor standards criteria and difficult for the united states to find vietnam in substantial compliance the key question is how to deal with the issue of freedom of association one of the inte rnationallyrecognized core labor standards although vietnam as an ilo member state is obligated to promote freedom of association workers in vietnam are reportedly not accorded that right by the government according to the state department in vietnam workers are not free to join or form unions of their choosing trade unions ar controlled by the party and have only nominal independence individual unions lega lly are not free to affiliate with join or participate in international labor bodies45 the argument can be made that by restricting freedom of association in this way vietnam does not comply with international core labor standards theref ore some observers believe that vietnam would be ineligible for any bonus quota under an incentive provision critics of applying the cambodiast yle incentive provision to vietnam speculated that the only way vietnam c ould receive bonus quota would be if the united states focusing on the term subs tantial chose to reward vietnams compliance with other labor standards lternatively the united states could have examined other perhaps more factoryle vel indicators of free dom of association such as whether workers are free to join or not join unions or whether factory unions have the ability to represent workers and negotiate on behalf of workers given that the united states has been strong suppor ter of labor standa rds and as an ilo member state is obligated to respect all of the core standards such an approach may have been inconsistent with avow ed us policies on labor standards additionally some questioned whether textile agreement would press vietnam to lift its restrictions on fr eedom of association since this would have required the communist party to relinquish significan t control the achievement of complete freedom of association over the next few years generally is thought to be highlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31470crs18 46 labor trends report 2002 us embassy in cambodia synthesis reports from the ilo garment sector working conditions improvement projectunlikely however strong labor in centive could perhaps influence vietnam to allow greater freedom for the hundreds of fficial labor associ ations that exist in vietnam in terms of applying cambodialike monitoring program to vietnam some argued that the logistics would be much more complicated and costly in cambodia the garment sector is limited to an estimated 220 factories located mostly in and around phnom penh that employ 200000 workers46 in vietnam there are over 1000 textile and apparel terprises located across the country with 16 million employees even if monitoring program were focused solely on garment factories since clothing rather than textiles dominates the sectors exports to the united states this would still have require d substantial financ ial and manpower resources if the cambodia programs monitoring and re porting schedule had been applied to vietnam with rate of inspection of pproximately 100 factorie s per year it would have taken several years for sizeable sample of vietnamese factories to be evaluated the bureaucracy of conducting surprise inspections critics contend may also have been cumbersome because factories are located across numerous provinces and special investment zones approval for random inspections would have been needed from the national government provincial governments exportprocessing and industrial zone authorities national and local unions national and local industry associations and the factories themselves in addition to maintaining geographic balance among participating factories ba lance would have to have been sought in ensuring that stateowned domestic privat and foreigninvested enterprises are treated equally inspection of the stateow ned enterprises in particular may have been politically sensitive issue especially if the monitoring process finds violations moreover unlike cambodia where the indepe ndent tripartite social partners the employer association unions and government ensure the neutrality of the monitoring program by voicing their different interests vietnams social partners are all linked in varying degrees to the communist party this implies some argue that the interests of the government the entity most closely connected to the party will dominate any type of monitoring program
