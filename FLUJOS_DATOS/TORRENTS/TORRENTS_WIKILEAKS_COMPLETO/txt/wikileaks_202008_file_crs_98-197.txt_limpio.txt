to the military or the peoples liberation army pla and those in the defense industries under the state council this crs report focuses on plaowned businesses some advocate limiting economic ties with pla companies others say targeting the pla would unnecessarily hurt strategic goals with china and would be formidable to enforce complicating the issue is the ban on the pla doing business that

administration did not comply the fy2001 ndaa again required report may be classified on such companies this crs report may be updated as warranted princelings arms sales and civilian business the plas diversification into increasingly civilian profitmaking business originated with late paramount leader deng xiaopings military and economic reforms in january 1982 deng articulated the

commission of science technology industry for national defense costind was created in 1982 under the central military commission cmc and the state council to integrate the civilian and military sectors of research and development and production1 in 1985 military reforms cut back the plas budget and began to demobilize 25 one million of the soldiers there were surplus people and less money the pla began seeking profits in arms sales including the sale of missiles to the middle east the plas profits were also tied to the personal fortunes of princelings the children and their spouses of

reorganized solely under the state council congressional research service the library of congress crs2 civilian leaders the princelings connections provided the plas companies with clout to make even missile sales poly technologies was good example the equipment department of the general staff department of the pla set up poly ostensibly as part of the china international trade and investment corporation citic in 1983 to export and import military equipment the president of poly is he ping who is also the late deng xiaopings sonin law he ping retired from the pla as major general after also serving as director of the equipment department serving as polys chairman is wang jun wang is also president of citic and of the late wang zhen who was retired general and prc vice president other executives included major general he pengfei of the late marshal he long and director of the equipment department from 1986 to 19922 poly has exported defense products specialized technology military vehicles telecommunications and radar equipment special purpose instruments and machinery and chemical industrial machinery its conducted sales on governmenttogovernment basis through the bureau of military equipment and technology cooperation also under the general staff department poly technologies was probably behind the sale of css2 mediumrange ballistic missiles to saudi arabia in 1987 the sale reportedly earned 3 35 billion for the pla like other plaowned companies china poly group diversified from simply arms sales to more open and conventional civilian commerce3 few pla companies have sought foreign capital overseas operations joint ventures foreign technology and tax havens abroad civilian business earning perhaps 80 of polys total profits has become more important than arms sales poly has also become conglomerate independent of citic with its own headquarters in beijing poly plaza top players in 1998 there were about 24 large businesses that belonged to the highest levels of the pla and the peoples armed police pap4 these companies included china poly group baoli or poly technologies incorporated under the general staff department gsd kaili corporation also known as carrie enterprises under the general political department xinxing corporation group under the general logistics department gld and xinshidai new era development corporation under the

defenseindustrial organizations defense intelligence continued crs3 ban on pla businesses total plaowned companies from conglomerates to small factories and shops numbered an estimated 20000 at its peak in 19936 from 1993 to 1996 the leadership tried to bring greater discipline and control to militaryrun businesses and restrict commercial operations to units above the group armies in 1998 there were approximately 1000015000 plaowned businesses complicating identification of such companies is the 1998 ban on the pla doing business in the most ostentatious and commercial areas in conceding the pla and paps detrimental problems with criminal activities like smuggling and corruption president jiang zemin on july 22 1998 ordered the pla and pap to stop engaging in commercial activities china said that the pla and pap completed the divestment of commercial enterprises by december 15 1998 having transferred them to the state economic and trade commission at the central or local level hong kongbased specialist tai ming cheung reported that the 5000 or so transferred commercial businesses actually remained in period of transition for few years while about 10000 selfsupporting industrial enterprises and those employing dependents remain as before the divestment focused on large conglomerates but with exceptions the arms sales parts of the poly group were reassigned to the ged some of xinxings factories supplying the pla remained in the gld the pla air force retained its united airline the pla kept telecommunications ventures eg great wall mobile century mobile communication corp partly to keep up with useful technological advances7 us operations and joint ventures before the 1998 ban on military businesses the pla set up subsidiaries in the united states these companies may have retained some ties to the pla seeking capital technology and at times intelligence pla companies increasingly established us operations or joint ventures with us companies some stress that these developments have increased the burden to us law enforcement counterintelligence efforts and export controls while others say that just small fraction of the prc companies are in illicit business beyond the complications presented by the ban on pla businesses estimating the total number of pla companies in the united states depends on whether the parent companies or their proliferating subsidiaries are counted depending on how they are set up it is also difficult to identify which companies are owned by the pla each of the conglomerates has dozens to hundreds of subsidiaries including some in the united states and other countries the two most wellknown companies in the united states are the gsds poly technologies and the glds xinxing corporation study by the aflcio found that eight of these parent companies may have number of us subsidiaries the rand corporation estimated that between 2030 of the plas companies are operating in the united states some said that almost 800 small prc businesses are seeking 5 continued report di19216500 december 2000 6 cheung tai ming serve the people far eastern economic review october 14 1993 7 washington post january 25 1999 wall

some with ties to the pla operate in the united states joint 1999 ciafbi report said that the vast majority of prc businesses in the united states are legitimate companies while there are some that collect intelligence9 policy issues one view target plaowned companies an issue arose about whether us sanctions and trade policies should target plaowned companies in the united states or ban us firms from engaging in business with plaaffiliated companies in china some in congress the aflcio and others advocate that us trade policies target plaowned companies if not defenserelated companies in general at hearing held by the senate foreign relations committee on november 6 1997 on the commercial activities of the pla the aflcios witness advocated campaign to kick the pla out of the usa some argue that for moral reasons us companies should not trade with or invest in companies owned by the pla or pap which are chinas coercive instruments to suppress human rights and separatists in tibet others contend that for security interests us companies markets and investments should not contribute to pla modernization moreover allowing plaowned firms to have us operations and joint ventures with us firms facilitates chinas efforts to circumvent us export controls to acquire militarilyuseful us technology most analysts agree that the profits of the plas companies are used as extra budgetary funds in support of military modernization it is uncertain however as to how much of the profits directly support pla modernization in general the profits are thought to be divided among personal coffers eg foreign bank accounts and lavish lifestyles reinvestment by the companies improving morale of the units with better wages housing and meals lower level military units training and procuring weapons one expert tai ming cheung estimated that the overall contribution of the plas businesses to the prc economy in 1997 totaled that of mediumsize province in china perhaps 23 of gross domestic product the roughly 10000 plaowned companies earned 13 billion year about 90 were smallscale operations 300400 were medium to largescale companies the top 20 conglomerates earned 80 of the total profits poly was the most profitable with assets of over 1 billion 8 fiedler jeff aflcio chinas peoples liberation army where to find pla companies in america what products the pla

other means new york ww norton company 1997 9 report to congress on chinese espionage activities against the united states 1999 crs5 some who advocate targeting plaowned companies are concerned about their technology acquisition through us operations or joint ventures with us firms10 although not all of the plaowned companies may seek to acquire militarily useful or dualuse technology those belonging to the gsd or costind probably focused on technology and intelligence acquisition in july 1997 the official china daily reported that costind and the equipment department of the gsd decided to open the defense industries to foreign investment in may 1998 costind the new ged the equipment department and the ministry of electronics industry held the first china international defense electronics exhibition to host us and other foreign defense manufacturers another concern has to do with imports of prc guns which became illegal in 1994 in may 1996 federal law enforcement agents ended sting operation targeting the smuggling of 2000 fully automatic ak47 weapons through the port of oakland the two prc companies were poly technologies and its us subsidiary ptk international inc and norinco nonpla arms industrial company11 alternative protect us interests but not target the pla others argue that there is existing legislation to protect us interests through law enforcement and export controls without having to specifically target the pla also targeting plaowned companies would undermine larger us strategic goals with china including engagement with the pla and obtaining cooperation in law enforcement third because of the ongoing divestment of pla firms difficulties in identifying small plaowned subsidiaries and the prevalence of pla companies throughout the prc economy policy targeting such companies would be impossible to enforce for us firms doing business in china and formidable to enforce in the united states also such as policy may inadvertently harm legitimate prc or us businesses fourth any confusion between plaowned companies and those belonging to the defense industries may affect us trade in aerospace aviation and other industries fifth some point to alternative technology acquisition by other prc nationals such as those at us corporations or universities last the plas businesses have corrosive effects on pla modernization although us policy has not restricted business with the pla export controls and laws have targeted categories of militaryrelated investment and trade such as gun imports technology transfers for missiles or nuclear and chemical weapons the administration argues that laws and export controls are enforced to protect us interests for example existing laws allow for restricting investment in the united states by foreign firms on national security grounds in 1990 president bush ordered china aero technology import and export corporation catic defenseindustrial not pla owned company to divest from its earlier acquisition of mamco manufacturing inc of seattle president bush acted on the recommendation of the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius and the authority of the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 pl 100418 after the tiananmen square crackdown of 1989 congress imposed sanctions on china including suspension of sales of munitions list items including parts for 10 wortzel larry the administration must name chinese defense companies in the united states heritage foundation october 10 2000 11 angeles times may 23 1996 crs6 helicopters satellites and crime control and detection equipment those sanctions are in sec 902 of the foreign relations authorization act of fys 199091 pl 101246 also the commerce department has the entity list it bans exports to certain prc nuclear weaponrelated organizations and other foreign entities without license while not specifically targeting imports from prc military or defenseindustrial companies president clinton on may 26 1994 decided to ban prc munitions from importation into the united states the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms then revoked all permits to import defense articles from china under the arms export control act enforcement of this ban was helped by targeting specific category of trade items which did not require evidence of whether the exporter eg poly belonged to the pla in 1999 the clinton administration denied the export of the apmt satellite for pla use administration officials and others also contend that engaging the pla is important for us security interests in asia the rand report argues that chinese military and defenseindustrial enterprises should be allowed to operate within the united states on grounds that problems related to these companies do not appear sufficiently large to warrant the damage to sinous relations that would result from banning them the administration also maintains that targeting pla companies would be an impossible task for us law enforcement agencies because such policy would lead to attempts to hide affiliations with the pla or pap some us companies in partnerships with plaowned firms have found lowpriced goods to import and advantages for competing in the prc market including large networks and privileges in transportation and distribution lastly commercialization has had corrosive effects on the pla criminal activities corruption and uneven business opportunities hurt professionalism training and morale congressional action in 1998 the fy1999 national defense authorization act ndaa pl 105261 authorized the president to use the international emergency economics powers act ieepa to investigate regulate or ban prc military police or intelligence companies operating in the united states the ndaa also required published list of such companies however in 1999 the secretary of defense declined to examine us persons saying that effort would go beyond the foreign intelligence role of the defense intelligence agency and declined to publish list that could disclose collection sources and methods 12 the director of the fbi also reportedly contended in march 3 2000 letter that the bureau is not the appropriate agency to compile the list13 in 1999 some members of congress questioned whether the clinton administration complied with the law in 2000 congress passed the fy2001 ndaa pl 106398 with section 1233 requiring an annual report of pla companies operating in the united states this provision amended the earlier requirement by dropping the call for published list and allowing the secretary of defense to submit classified report with the initial report due by march 1 2001 in subsequent years the secretary is to make revisions to the list 12 secretary of defense william cohen
