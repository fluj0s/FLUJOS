research service the library of congress filibusters and cloture in the senate summary the filibuster is widely viewed as one of the senates most characteristic procedural features filibustering includes any use of dilatory or obstructive tactics to block measure by preventing it from coming to vote the possibility of filibusters exists because senate rules place few limits on senators rights and opportunities in the legislative process in particular senator who seeks recognition usually has right to the floor if other senator is speaking and then may speak for as long as he or she wishes also there is motion by which simple majority of the senate can stop debate and allow the senate to vote in favor of an amendment bill or resolution or any other debatable question almost every bill actually is subject to two potential filibusters before the senate votes on whether to pass it first filibuster on motion to proceed to the bills consideration and second after the senate agrees to this motion filibuster on the bill itself senate rule xxii however known as the cloture rule enables senators to end filibuster on any debatable matter the senate is considering sixteen senators initiate this process by presenting motion to end the debate the senate does not vote on this cloture motion until the second day after the motion is made then it usually requires the votes of at least threefifths of all senators normally 60 votes to invoke cloture invoking cloture on proposal to amend the senates standing rules requires the support of twothirds of the senators present and voting the primary effect of invoking cloture on question is to impose maximum of 30 additional hours for considering that question this 30hour period for consideration encompasses all time consumed by rollcall votes quorum calls and other actions as well as the time used for debate during this 30hour period each senator may speak for more than one hour apiece although several senators can have additional time yielded to them under cloture the only amendments that senators can offer are amendments that are germane and that were submitted in writing before the cloture vote took place the presiding officer also enjoys certain additional powers under cloture for example to count to determine whether quorum is present and to rule amendments motions and other actions out of order on the grounds that they are dilatory the ability of senators to engage in filibusters has profound and pervasive effect on how the senate conducts its business on the floor in the face of threatened filibuster for example the majority leader may decide not to call bill up for floor consideration or to defer calling it up if there are other equally important bills that the senate can consider and pass without undue delay similarly the prospect of filibuster can persuade bills proponents to accept changes in the bill that they do not support but that are necessary to prevent an actual

filibuster is widely viewed as one of the senates most distinctive procedural features today the term is most often used to refer to senators holding the floor in extended debate more generally however filibustering includes any tactics aimed at blocking measure by preventing it from coming to vote as consequence the senate has specific rules for filibustering instead possibilities for filibustering exist because senate rules deliberately lack provisions that would place specific limits on senators rights and opportunities in the legislative process in particular those rules establish generally applicable limits on the length of debate nor any motions by which majority could vote to bring debate to an end the only senate rule that permits the body by vote to bring consideration of matter to an end is paragraph 2 of rule xxii known as the cloture rule invoking cloture requires supermajority vote usually 60 out of 100 senators and does not terminate consideration but only imposes time limit it also imposes restrictions on certain other potentially dilatory procedures in recent years as result cloture has increasingly been used to overcome filibusters being conducted not only by debate but through various other delaying tactics this report discusses major aspects of senate procedure related to filibusters and cloture the two however are not always as closely linked in practice as they are in popular conception even when opponents of measure resort to extended debate or other tactics of delay supporters may not decide to seek cloture although this situation seems to have been more common in earlier decades than today in recent times conversely the senate leadership has increasingly utilized cloture as routine tool to manage the flow of business even in the absence of any apparent filibuster for these reasons the presence or absence of cloture attempts cannot be taken as reliable guide to the presence or absence of filibuster inasmuch as filibustering does not depend on the use of any specific rules whether filibuster is present is always matter of judgment the following discussion focuses chiefly on the conduct of filibusters through extended debate and on cloture as means of overcoming them the discussion does not encompass all possible contingencies or consider every relevant precedent authoritative information on cloture procedure can be found under that heading in riddicks senate procedure1 senators and staff also may consult the senate 1 us congress senate riddicks senate procedure precedents and practices sdoc 10128 101st cong 2nd sess by floyd m riddick parliamentarian emeritus and alan s frumin parliamentarian rev and ed by alan s frumin washington gpo 1992 pp 282 crs2 parliamentarian on any question concerning the senates procedural rules precedents and practices the right to debate the core rule of the senate governing floor debate is paragraph 1a of rule xix which states that when senator desires to speak he shall rise and address the presiding officer and shall not proceed until he is recognized and the presiding officer shall recognize the senator who shall first address him senator shall interrupt another senator in debate without his consent and to obtain such consent he shall first address the presiding officer and senator shall speak more than twice upon any one question in debate on the same legislative day without leave of the senate which shall be determined without debate this is essentially all that the senates rules have to say about the right to speak on the floor so the rule is just as important for what it does not say as for what it does say the lack of discretion by the chair in recognizing senators and the lack of time limits on debate combine to create the possibility of filibusters by debate the right to recognition rule xix affords the presiding officer choice and discretion in recognition as general rule if senator seeks recognition when other senator has the floor the presiding officer must recognize him or her the presiding officer may not decline to recognize the senator whether for reasons of personal preference or partisan advantage or to enable the senate to reach vote on the pending matter as result when the senate is considering any debatable question it cannot vote on the question so long as any senator wants to be recognized to debate it if more than one senator seeks recognition rule xix directs the presiding officer to recognize whichever is the first to do so the result is that although senator can be sure that he or she will be recognized promptly for debate on pending question each can be sure of recognition eventually as senate rules provide for motions that could have the effect of terminating debate senator can do nothing while she or he has the floor that would preclude another senator from being recognized afterwards the motion to table and time agreements by unanimous consent both of which represent partial exceptions to this statement are discussed later by wellestablished precedent and practice the senate does not comply strictly with the requirement that the first senator addressing the chair be recognized all senators accept that the majority leader and then the minority leader must be able to secure recognition if they are to do some of the things the senate expects them to do 1 continued 334 crs3 to arrange the daily agenda and weekly schedule and to make motions and propound unanimous consent agreements necessary for the relatively orderly conduct of business on the floor in practice the party leaders receive preference in recognition this means that if two senators are seeking recognition at more or less the same time and one of them is party floor leader the presiding officer recognizes the leader and the majority leader in preference to the minority leader next after these two leaders the majority and minority floor managers of legislation being debated also generally are accorded preference in recognition they receive this preference because they also bear responsibilities for ensuring an orderly process of considering measure the right to speak at length and the twospeech rule under rule xix unless any special limits on debate are in effect senators who have been recognized may speak for as long as they wish2 they usually cannot be forced to cede the floor or even interrupted without their consent there are some exceptions for example senators can lose the floor if they violate the senates standards of decorum in debate or as discussed later they may be interrupted for the presentation of cloture motion rule xix places limit on the length of individual speeches or on the number of senators who may speak on pending question it does however tend to limit the possibility of extended debate by its provision that senator shall speak more than twice upon any one question in debate on the same legislative day without leave of the senate which shall be determined without debate this provision commonly called the twospeech rule limits each senator to making two speeches per day however long each speech may be on each debatable question that the senate considers senator who has made two speeches on single question becomes ineligible to be recognized for another speech on the same question on the same day the day during which senator can make more than two speeches on the same question is not calendar day but legislative day legislative day ends only with an adjournment so that whenever the senate recesses overnight rather than adjourning the same legislative day continues into the next calendar day legislative day may therefore extend over several calendar days the leadership may continue to recess the senate rather than adjourning as means of attempting to overcome filibuster by compelling filibustering senators to exhaust their opportunities of gaining recognition senators rarely invoke the twospeech rule because they generally do not believe that there is any need to do so sometimes however they may insist that the two speech rule be enforced as means of attempting to overcome filibuster on such occasions nevertheless senators often can circumvent the twospeech rule by making motion or offering an amendment that constitutes new and different 2 the record for the longest single speech remains that made by sen strom thurmond of south carolina on aug 2829 1957 which consumed 24 hours and 18 minutes us senate committee on rules and administration senate cloture rule committee print 99th cong 1st sess sprt 9995 washington gpo 1985 p 40 crs4 debatable question for example each senator can make two speeches on each bill each firstdegree amendment to bill and each seconddegree amendment to each of those amendments as well in recent practice the senate considers that being recognized and engaging in debate constitutes speech the senate however does not consider that recognition for any purpose constitutes speech currently effective precedents have held that certain procedural motions and requests were examples of actions that did not constitute speeches for purposes of the two speech rule these matters include such things as making parliamentary inquiry and suggesting the absence of quorum3 nevertheless if senator is recognized for substantive comment however brief on the pending question that remark may count as speech the motion to table there is one way in which the senate can end debate on question even though there may be senators who still might want to speak on it during the debate it is normally possible for senator to move to table the pending question more formally to lay the question on the table the motion is not debatable and requires only simple majority vote to be adopted in the senate to table something is to kill it so when the senate votes to table matter it thereby disposes of the matter permanently and adversely the senate frequently disposes of amendments by voting to table them rather than by taking what often are called up or down votes to agree to or not agree to the amendment itself if there is unanimous consent agreement in effect that limits the time for debate the motion to table may not be offered until the time is consumed also in order to offer the motion senator must first be recognized another senator who has already been recognized may not be interrupted for motion to table matter how long he or she has been speaking within these limitations if majority of senators oppose matter the motion to table may enable them to prevail at time of their choosing by this means senators can prevent debate from continuing indefinitely if they are prepared to reject the amendment motion or bill that is being debated if on the other hand opponents of matter do not command enough support to table it they may decide to extend the debate by conducting what supporters of the matter might well characterize as filibuster the motion to table however offers means for supporters of matter to overcome filibuster being conducted against it through extended debate if the senate agrees to motion to table the debate is brought to an end but only at the cost of defeating the matter if the senate votes against the tabling motion the matter remains before the senate and senators can resume debating it at length instead for purposes of overcoming filibusters the chief use of the motion to table arises when the filibuster is being conducted through the offering of potentially dilatory amendments and motions for example supporters of filibuster may offer 3 therefore the two speech rule requires not mechanical test but the application of the rule of reason riddicks senate procedure pp 782783 crs5 amendments in order to renew their right to recognition under the twospeech rule each time the senate tables such an amendment it can continue debate on the underlying bill or at least can go on to consider other amendments the conduct of filibusters conducting filibuster by extended debate is simple though it can be physically demanding senator seeks recognition and once recognized speaks at length when that first senator concludes and yields the floor another senator seeks recognition and continues the debate the debate can proceed in this way until all the participating senators have made their two speeches on the pending question then it usually is possible to offer an amendment or make some other motion in order to create new debatable question on which the same senators can make two more speeches there is need for the participating senators to monopolize the debate what is important is that someone speak not that it be someone on their side of the question although one purpose of filibuster is to try to change the minds of senators who support the question being debated the purpose of delay is served by senators speaking matter which side of the question they take germaneness of debate more often than not there is need for the debate to be germane to the question being considered with one important exception paragraph 1b of rule xix often called the pastore rule in recognition of former senator john pastore of rhode island requires that debate be germane each calendar day during the first three hours after the senate begins to consider its unfinished or pending legislative business in other words the time consumed by the majority and minority leaders and any speeches during routine morning business at the beginning of daily session is not included in this threehour period the senate can waive this germaneness requirement by unanimous consent or by agreeing to nondebatable motion for that purpose like the twospeech rule the pastore rule usually is not enforced because senators do not see the need to enforce it during filibusters however senators may be called upon to comply with the germaneness requirement on debate when it is in effect in practice this does not put much extra burden on participating senators because most speeches made during filibusters today tend to be germane anyway in earlier times filibustering senators were known to speak about virtually anything in his 1940 study of filibusters franklin burdette reported that senator huey long of louisiana would dictate for the benefit of the congressional record recipes for cooking upon which his authoritative advice had been regularly in demand in washington social circles he then proceeded to tell the senate at great length and in crs6 meticulous detail how to fry oysters nor did he omit rambling discourse on the subject of potlikker4 at that time the senate had rule of germaneness in debate even during the first three hours of each day but even at the time to which burdette referred discourse such as senator longs was unusual yielding the floor and yielding for questions senator who has the floor for purposes of debate must remain standing and must speak more or less continuously5 complying with these requirements obviously becomes more of strain as time passes however senators must be careful when they try to give some relief to their colleagues who are speaking senate precedents prohibit senators from yielding the floor to each other to gain the floor senator must seek recognition from the presiding officer thus if senator simply yields to colleague he or she has yielded relinquished the floor however inadvertently this is another one of those senate procedures that often is not observed during the normal conduct of business on the floor but during filibusters senators are much more likely to insist on it being observed senator may yield to colleague without losing the floor only if the senator yields for question6 with this in mind colleague of filibustering senator may give that senator some relief by asking him or her to yield for question the senator who retains control of the floor must remain standing while the question is being asked the peculiar advantage of this tactic is that it sometimes takes senators quite some time to ask their question and the presiding officer is reluctant to force them to state their question before they are ready to do so in this way participating senators can extend the debate through an exchange of what sometimes are long questions followed by short answers rather than by relying exclusively on series of long uninterrupted speeches quorums and quorum calls there are ways other than debate by which senators can delay and sometimes even prevent the senate from voting on question that it is considering for example each amendment that is offered on the senate floor must be read in full before debate on it can begin although the senate usually agrees by unanimous consent to waive the reading in addition quorum calls can be demanded not for the purpose of confirming or securing the presence of quorum but in order to consume time 4 franklin burdette filibustering in the senate new york russell russell 1965 reprint of 1940 princeton university press edition p 4 5 riddicks senate procedure p 755 6 senators sometimes ask unanimous consent to yield to colleague for something other than question without losing their right to the floor any senator can object to this request crs7 senator who has been recognized can suggest the absence of quorum asking in effect whether the senate is complying with the constitutional requirement that quorum majority of all senators be present for the senate to conduct business the presiding officer normally does not have the authority to count to determine whether quorum actually is present which is rarely the case and so directs the clerk to call the roll senators usually use quorum calls to suspend the senates floor proceedings temporarily perhaps to discuss procedural or policy problem or to await the arrival of certain senator in those cases the clerk calls the roll very slowly and before the call of the roll is completed the senate agrees by unanimous consent to call off the quorum call to dispense with further proceedings under the quorum call because the absence of quorum has not actually been demonstrated the senate can resume its business such quorum calls can be timeconsuming and so can serve the interests of filibustering senators during filibuster however the clerk may be directed to call the roll more rapidly as if rollcall vote were in progress doing so reduces the time that the quorum call consumes but it also creates the real possibility that the quorum call may demonstrate that quorum in fact is not present in that case the senate has only two options to adjourn or to take steps necessary to secure the presence of enough absent senators to create quorum typically the majority leader or the majority floor manager opts for the latter course and makes motion that the sergeant at arms secure the attendance of absent senators and then asks for rollcall vote on that motion senators who did not respond to the quorum call are likely to come to the floor for the rollcall vote on this motion almost always therefore the vote establishes that quorum is present so the senate can resume its business without the sergeant at arms actually having to execute the senates directive this process also can be timeconsuming because of the time required to conduct the rollcall vote just discussed nonetheless the proponents of the bill or other matter being filibustered may prefer that the roll be called quickly because it requires unanimous consent to call off routine quorum call in which the clerk calls the roll very slowly before it is completed filibustering senator has only to suggest the absence of quorum and then object to calling off the quorum call in order to provoke motion to secure the attendance of absentees and with the support of at least 10 other senators rollcall vote on that motion if this motion is likely to be necessary one way or the other it is usually in the interests of the bills proponents to have the motion made and agreed to as soon as possible when senators suggest the absence of quorum however they lose the floor also it is not in order for senator to demand quorum call if business has intervened since the last call business must intervene before second quorum call or between calls if the question is raised or point of order made7 these restrictions limit the extent to which quorum calls may be used as means of conducting filibusters 7 riddicks senate procedure p 1053 on what constitutes intervening business see pp 10421046 crs8 roll call voting as the preceding discussion indicates rollcall votes are another source of delay any question put to the senate for its decision requires vote and minimum of 11 senators can require that it be roll call vote each such vote consumes at least 15 minutes unless the senate agrees in advance to reduce the time for voting8 the constitution provides that the yeas and nays shall be ordered at the desire of onefifth of those present article i section 5 because quorum is presumed to be present the senate requires at least 11 senators onefifth of the minimal quorum of 51 to request rollcall vote on the pending question when senator wants rollcall vote other senators frequently support the request as courtesy to colleague during filibuster however the supporters of the bill or amendment sometimes try to discourage other senators from supporting requests for timeconsuming rollcall votes also the proponents sometimes can make it more difficult for their opponents to secure rollcall vote when the request for rollcall vote is made immediately after quorum call or another rollcall vote senators can insist that the request be supported by onefifth of however many senators answered that call or cast their votes9 since this is almost certainly more than 51 and in practice is much closer to 100 the number of senators required to secure roll call can increase to maximum of 20 the time allowed for senators to cast roll call votes is minimum of 15 minutes unless the senate agrees before the vote begins to reduced time when the 15 minutes expire the vote usually is left open for some additional time in order to accommodate other senators who are thought to be route to the floor to vote thus the actual time for roll call vote can extend to 20 minutes or more during filibusters however call for the regular order can lead the presiding officer to announce the result of roll call vote soon after the 15 minutes allotted for it senators usually can secure two votes in connection with the disposition of each bill amendment motion or other question the first is the vote on the question itself or on motion to table it the second is the vote on motion to reconsider the vote by which the first question was decided or on motion to table the motion to reconsider with sufficient support roll call votes can be ordered on each motion so that completing action on both of them consumes at least 30 minutes 8 the senate unlike the house does not use an electronic voting system 9 the sufficiency of the number of senators demanding rollcall is based on the last preceding rollcall the chair noting that 81 senators had just voted denied the yeas and nays when only 16 senators responded to request for sufficient second demand for the yeas and nays immediately following call of the senate is seconded by onefifth of those answering such call or immediately following yea and nay vote seconded by one fifth of those voting riddicks senate procedure p 1417 crs9 scheduling filibusters contemporary filibusters usually are fairly courteous affairs the senates daily schedule normally is arranged so that filibusters are not unduly disruptive or inconvenient to senators one way to make conducting filibuster more costly and difficult is to keep the senate in session until late at night or even all night requiring the participating senators to speak or otherwise consume the senates time during some contentious filibusters of the 1950s cots were brought into the senates anterooms for senators to use during aroundtheclock sessions today allnight sessions are very unusual the senate may not even convene earlier or remain in session later when filibuster is in progress than it does on other days one reason may be that filibusters are not the extraordinary and unusual occurrences that they once were another may be that senators are less willing to endure the inconvenience and discomfort of prolonged sessions the latter point is important because latenight or allnight sessions put as much or more of burden on the proponents of the question being debated than on its opponents the senators participating in the filibuster need only ensure that at least one of their number always is present on the floor to speak the proponents of the question however need to ensure that majority of the senate is present or at least available to respond to quorum call or roll call vote if late in the evening or in the middle of the night senator suggests the absence of quorum and quorum does not appear the senate must adjourn or at least suspend its proceedings until quorum is established this works to the advantage of the filibustering senators so the burden rests on their opponents to ensure that the constitutional quorum requirement always can be met invoking cloture the procedures for invoking cloture are governed by paragraph 2 of rule xxii which also governs procedures under cloture as discussed later in this report the process begins when senator presents cloture motion that is signed by 16 senators proposing to bring to close the debate upon the pending question the motion is presented to the senate while it is in session and must be presented while the question on which cloture is sought is pending for example it is not in order for senator to present motion to invoke cloture on bill that the senate has not yet agreed to consider or on an amendment that has not yet been offered senator does not need to be recognized by the chair in order to present cloture petition the senator who has the floor may be interrupted for the purpose but retains the floor thereafter and may continue speaking the motion is read to the senate but the senate then returns to whatever business it had been transacting the senate does not act on the cloture motion in any way on the day on which it is submitted or on the following day instead the next action on the motion occurs on the following calendar day but one that is crs10 on the second day after it is presented so if the motion is presented on monday the senate acts on it on wednesday during the intervening time the senate does not have to continue debating the question on which cloture has been proposed but can turn to other business one hour after the senate convenes on the day the cloture motion has ripened or matured the presiding officer interrupts the proceedings of the senate regardless of what is under consideration at the time and presents the cloture motion to the senate for vote at this point the presiding officer is required to direct that an actual or live quorum call take place the senate often waives this quorum call by unanimous consent when the presence of quorum is established the senate proceeds without debate to vote on the cloture motion the presiding officer shall without debate submit to the senate by yeaandnay vote the question is it the sense of the senate that the debate shall be brought to close 10 the terms of the rule require an automatic roll call vote invoking cloture usually requires threefifths vote of the entire senate threefifths of the senators duly chosen and sworn if there are vacancies therefore 60 senators must vote to invoke cloture in contrast most other votes require only simple majority that is 51 of the senators present and voting assuming that those senators constitute quorum in the case of cloture vote the key is the number of senators voting for cloture not the number voting against failing to vote on cloture motion has the same effect as voting against the motion it deprives the motion of one of the 60 votes needed to agree to it there is an important exception to the threefifths requirement to invoke cloture under rule xxii an affirmative vote of twothirds of the senators present and voting is required to invoke cloture on measure or motion to amend the senate rules this exception has its origin in the recent history of the cloture rule before 1975 twothirds of the senators present and voting quorum being present was required for cloture on all matters in early 1975 at the beginning of the 94th congress senators sought to amend the rule to make it somewhat easier to invoke cloture however some senators feared that if this effort succeeded that would only make it easier to amend the rule again making cloture still easier to invoke as compromise the senate agreed to move from maximum of 67 votes twothirds of the senators present and voting to minimum of 60 votes threefifths of the senators duly chosen and sworn on all matters except future rules changes including changes in the cloture rule itself11 if the senate does vote to invoke cloture that vote may not be reconsidered on the other hand it is in order to reconsider the vote by which the senate voted against invoking cloture on few recent occasions supporters of cloture have moved to reconsider vote against cloture so that second vote on cloture vote occurs without second petition being filed 10 rule xxii paragraph 2 11 committee on rules and administration senate cloture rule pp 119121 crs11 the senate sometimes agrees by unanimous consent to alter the way in which various requirements of the cloture rule apply to consideration of specified matter in particular senators by unanimous consent sometimes permit cloture motion to be filed on matter that is not then pending also as mentioned the required quorum call preceding cloture vote is often waived by consent in addition the senate may give unanimous consent to adjust the time when the cloture vote will take place on some occasions the senate has even agreed by unanimous consent to vote on cloture at specified time even though cloture motion is formally filed matters on which cloture may be invoked any debatable question that the senate considers can be filibustered and therefore may be the subject of cloture motion unless the time for debate is limited by the senates rules by law or by unanimous consent agreement consequently senators may present cloture motions to end debate on bills resolutions amendments conference reports and various debatable motions in relation to the senates initial consideration of bill or resolution there usually can be at least two filibusters first filibuster on the motion to proceed to the measures consideration and second after the senate agrees to this motion filibuster on the measure itself if the senate cannot agree to take up measure by unanimous consent the majority leaders recourse is to make motion that the senate proceed to its consideration this motion to proceed as it is called usually is debatable and consequently subject to filibuster12 therefore the senate may have to invoke cloture on this motion before being able to vote on it once the senate adopts the motion to proceed and begins consideration of the measure itself filibuster on the measure then may begin so that cloture must be sought anew on the measure itself except by unanimous consent cloture cannot be sought on the measure during consideration of the motion to proceed because cloture may be moved only on question that is pending before the senate threatened filibusters on motions to proceed once were rare but have become somewhat more common in recent years sometimes an amendment provokes filibuster even though the underlying bill does not if cloture is invoked on the amendment the operation of cloture is exhausted once the amendment is disposed of thereafter debate on the bill continues but under the general rules of the senate on occasion cloture has been invoked in this way separately on several amendments to bill in succession alternatively cloture may be invoked on the bill itself so that debate on the amendment continues under the restrictions of cloture on the overall measure if the amendment is not germane to the bill however its supporters will oppose this approach for as discussed later the cloture rule requires that amendments 12 senate rule vii paragraph 2 and senate rule viii paragraph 2 although senate rules do not restrict who may offer motion to proceed the senate normally accords the majority leader the prerogative of doing so in pursuance of his functions of arranging the floor agenda riddicks senate procedure p 655 even in the equally divided senate of the 107th cong the powersharing agreement sres 8 adopted jan 5 2001 affirmed this practice crs12 considered under cloture be germane if cloture is invoked on bill while nongermane amendment is pending the amendment becomes out of order and may not be further considered in such case it may be necessary instead to invoke cloture on the amendment so as to secure final vote on it and then after the amendment is disposed of move for cloture on the bill as well after the senate has passed measure additional action may be necessary in order that the senate may go to conference with the house on the legislation the motions necessary for this purpose are debatable and as result supporters of the measure have occasionally found it necessary to move for cloture thereon conference reports themselves unlike measures on initial consideration are not subject to double filibuster because they are privileged matters so that motions to proceed to their consideration are not debatable13 inasmuch as conference reports themselves are debatable however it may be found necessary to move for cloture on conference report occasionally cloture has also been sought on other debatable questions such as motions to waive the budget act motions to recommit measure with instructions that it be reported back forthwith with an amendment or overriding presidential veto timing of cloture motions the relation of cloture motions to filibusters may depend on when the cloture motions are filed prior to the 1970s consideration of matter was usually allowed to proceed for some days or even weeks before cloture was sought or cloture might not be sought at all in more recent decades it has become common to seek cloture on matter much earlier in the course of consideration even immediately after consideration has begun in some cases cloture motion has been filed or has been deemed to have been filed even before the matter in question has been called up because the rules permit filing motion for cloture only on pending question either of these actions of course requires unanimous consent when cloture is sought before any dilatory action actually occurs the action may be an indication that the threat of filibuster is present or at least is thought to be present when cloture is filed at the time the senate commences to consider matter or earlier the senate may then sometimes also lay the matter aside or omit to take it up until the time for the cloture vote arrives if cloture is then invoked in such situation the entire active floor consideration of the matter may occur under cloture in the early months of the 107th congress 20012002 when the senate was equally divided between the major parties the socalled powersharing agreement provided 13 nomination also is subject to only one filibuster because debate is allowed on motion that the senate go into executive session to consider particular nomination crs13 that cloture motion be filed on any amendable matter during its first 12 hours of senate debate14 this arrangement was intended to preclude situations in which senators would have opportunity to debate and especially offer amendments to measure except under the restrictions of cloture there often has been more than one cloture vote on the same question if and when the senate rejects cloture motion senator then can file second motion to invoke cloture on that question in some cases senators even have anticipated that cloture motion may fail so they have filed second motion before the senate has voted on the first one for example one cloture motion may be presented on monday and another on tuesday if the senate rejects the first motion when it matures on wednesday the second motion will ripen for vote on thursday if the senate agrees to the first motion there is need of course for it to act on the second there have been instances in which there have been even more cloture votes on the same question during the 100th congress 19871988 for example there were eight cloture votes all unsuccessful in connection with campaign finance reform bill effects of invoking cloture invoking cloture on bill or on any other question does not produce an immediate vote on it the effect of invoking cloture is only to guarantee that vote will take place eventually time for consideration and debate rule xxii imposes cap of more than 30 additional hours for the senate to consider question after invoking cloture on it this 30hour cap is ceiling on the time available for postcloture consideration not just for debate the time used in debate is counted against the 30 hours but so too is the time consumed by quorum calls roll call votes parliamentary inquiries and all other proceedings that occur while the senate is operating under cloture the 30hour period can be increased if the senate agrees to nondebatable motion for that purpose adopting this motion also requires threefifths vote of the senators duly chosen and sworn during the period for postcloture consideration each senator is entitled to speak for total of not more than one hour senators may yield part or all of their time to any of four others the majority or minority leaders or the majority or minority floor managers none of these senators can accumulate more than two hours of additional time for debate but in turn they can yield some or all of their time to others15 14 sres 8 107th cong adopted jan 5 2001 15 hypothetically therefore one senator could control maximum of 13 hours for debate this would require eight senators to yield all of their time to the four designated party leaders and floor managers two senators yielding their time to one of the four giving each continued crs14 there is insufficient time for all senators to use their allotted hours for debate within the 30hour cap for postcloture consideration this disparity results from recent amendment to the cloture rule before 1979 there was cap at all on post cloture consideration the only restriction in rule xxii was the limit of one hour per senator for debate the time consumed by reading amendments and conducting roll call votes and quorum calls was not deducted from anyones hour as result senators could and did engage in what became known as postcloture filibusters by offering one amendment after another for example and demanding roll call votes to dispose of them senators could consume hours of the senates time while consuming little if any of their allotted hour for debate in reaction the senate amended rule xxii in 1979 to impose 100hour cap on postcloture consideration in theory at least this time period could accommodate the one hour of debate per senator but only if senators used all of the 100 hours only for debate then in 1985 the senate agreed without significant dissent to reduce the 100 hours to 30 hours while leaving unchanged the allocation of one hour for each senator to debate the result is that there is not enough time available under cloture for each senator to speak for an hour16 in principle 30 senators speaking for one hour each could consume all the time for postcloture consideration however rule xxii does provide limited protection for all senators by providing that when the 30 hours expire any senator who has not used or yielded at least ten minutes is if he seeks recognition guaranteed up to ten minutes inclusive to speak only17 under these conditions senators may still be able to pursue postcloture filibuster but it can last longer than the 30 hours available for consideration under cloture as result once cloture has imposed its definitive limit on further consideration opponents may see little benefit in the limited delay they might still obtain and may instead permit final vote well before the available 30 hours expires sometimes the senate agrees by unanimous consent that the 30 hours be considered to run continuously even when the senate is not actively considering the measure or even remains in session there is one other notable difference in the senates debate rules before and after cloture is invoked as discussed above senate floor debate normally does not have to be germane except when the pastore rule applies under cloture debate must be germane this requirement derives from the language of rule xxii that allows each senator to speak for more than one hour on the measure motion or other matter pending before the senate senate precedents make clear that senators should not expect the presiding officer to insist on germane debate at his or 15 continued party leader and floor manager control of three hours apiece if the four designated senators then yielded all of their combined 12 hours to fifth senator who controls one hour in his or her own right that senator would control 13 hours 16 when one senator yields to another for question the time required to ask the question comes out of the hour controlled by the senator who yielded 17 when senator has consumed all of his or her hour for debate that senator may continue to offer amendments but has time to explain them at the end of the 30 hours for post cloture consideration further amendments may be offered crs15 her initiative senators wishing to enforce the requirement that debate be germane can do so by making points of order from the floor offering amendments and motions there are several key restrictions governing the amendments that senators can propose under cloture that do not apply to senate floor amendments under most other circumstances some of these restrictions also apply to other motions senators may offer or actions they may take under cloture germane amendments only only germane amendments are eligible for floor consideration under cloture18 this germaneness requirement applies to the amendments that senators offer after cloture is invoked and the requirement applies as well to any amendments that were pending that is amendments that had been called up for consideration but were not yet disposed of at the time that the senate votes for cloture thus immediately after successful cloture vote the presiding officer may announce at his own initiative that one or more amendments that were pending when the vote began now must fall because they are not germane to the matter on which the senate just invoked cloture this germaneness requirement helps explain why the senate may have to invoke cloture on an amendment to bill and then invoke cloture again on the bill itself it is quite common for senate committee to report bill back to the senate with an amendment in the nature of substitute complete alternative for the text of the bill as introduced the senate almost always adopts this substitute immediately before voting to pass the bill as amended by the substitute however it also is not unusual for the committee substitute to be nongermane to the bill in some respect thus if the senate invokes cloture on the bill before it votes on the committee substitute the substitute becomes out of order as nongermane so that the senate cannot agree to it to protect the committee substitute or any other nongermane amendment that the senate is considering the senate can first invoke cloture on the amendment doing so limits further consideration of the amendment to more than 30 more hours if the senate then adopts the amendment cloture longer is in effect and senators can filibuster the bill as amended however inasmuch as the previous nongermane amendment is now part of the text of the bill it therefore cannot now be nongermane to the bill at this point therefore the senate may again vote to invoke cloture this time on the bill as amended with respect to amendments offered after the cloture vote the presiding officer may wait for senator to make point of order against an amendment before ruling that it is not germane sometimes however the presiding officer has taken the initiative to rule amendments out of order as nongermane in fact when obviously nongermane the chair may rule the amendment out of order even before it has been read or stated by the clerk19 similarly presiding officers have taken the initiative 18 on what constitutes germane amendment see riddicks senate procedure pp 291294 19 riddicks senate procedure p 291 crs16 to rule amendments out of order sometimes even before they were read because the amendments sought to change bill in two or more noncontiguous places any senator can appeal the chairs ruling that certain amendment is nongermane allowing the senate to overturn that ruling by simple majority vote however the senate is unlikely to take this action because doing so could fundamentally undermine the integrity and utility of the cloture procedure in sense the decision to invoke cloture constitutes kind of treaty by which senators relinquish their right to filibuster in exchange for guarantee that nongermane amendments will be offered under cloture that some of those senators would want to filibuster unless senator could be confident that under cloture his colleagues could not offer amendments on unrelated subjects that the senator would insist on filibustering that senator would have serious qualms about ever voting for cloture although there are some senate rules that senators sometimes choose not to enforce when enforcing them would be inconvenient the requirement for germane amendments under cloture is not one of them on some occasions when senator did appeal ruling of the chair under cloture that an amendment was not germane senators who may have supported the amendment on its merits nonetheless voted to sustain the ruling of the chair with the longterm viability of the cloture procedure in mind cloture is sometimes sought not for the purpose of overcoming filibuster by debate but primarily to trigger the requirement for germaneness of amendments one way in which this situation can occur may arise when senators wish to secure floor consideration for bill that the majority party leadership is reluctant to schedule for floor consideration supporters of the bill may offer the text of that bill as nongermane amendment to another bill that the majority party leadership is eager to pass opponents of the amendment may respond by moving for cloture on the bill then prolonging the debate so as to prevent vote on the amendment until the time comes for voting on the cloture motion if the senate votes to invoke cloture the presiding officer announces that the nongermane amendment is longer in order in this way its opponents can dispose of the amendment adversely without ever having to vote on it or even on motion to table it but only of course if they can mobilize threefifths of the senate to vote for cloture this possibility which is more than hypothetical illustrates that not every cloture vote takes place to overcome filibuster that is already in progress amendments submitted in writing to be in order under cloture amendments must be submitted at the desk in writing and for printing in the congressional record before the cloture vote takes place20 there are different requirements for firstdegree amendments amendments to change the text of bill or resolution and seconddegree amendments amendments to change the text of pending firstdegree amendment under rule xxii 20 senator can call up an amendment that another senator had submitted in writing though senators rarely do so also senator may recall amendments that he or she submitted in writing before cloture vote by recalling an amendment the senator removes it from potential consideration under cloture crs17 except by unanimous consent amendment shall be proposed after the vote to bring the debate to close unless it had been submitted in writing to the journal clerk by 1 oclock pm on the day following the filing of the cloture motion if an amendment in the first degree and unless it had been so submitted at least one hour prior to the beginning of the cloture vote if an amendment in the second degree senators sometimes submit large number of amendments to bill for printing in the congressional record even before cloture motion is presented this often is intended and understood to be clear signal that the senators who submitted the amendments for printing are contemplating filibuster in practice the deadline in rule xxii usually gives senators most or all of day after cloture is proposed to draft germane amendments to the bill senators then usually have most or all of the next day to review those firstdegree amendments and to decide what seconddegree amendments if any they might offer to them in this way senators can be fully aware of all the amendments they may encounter under cloture before they vote on whether or not to invoke cloture submitting an amendment in writing does not exempt that amendment from the restriction that only germane amendments are in order under cloture rule xxii establishes separate deadline for submitting amendments in the nature of substitute ie substitutes for the full text of measure which are amendable in two degrees that is an amendment to an amendment in the nature of substitute is firstdegree amendment21 an amendment in the nature of substitute might be submitted at any time up to the deadline for firstdegree amendments if it were submitted just before that deadline senators might have essentially time to prepare amendments to it one result of these requirements is that whenever cloture is proposed senators and their staffs must decide whether they need to prepare and submit amendments to the measure when the senate has voted to invoke cloture on bill it is too late for senator then to think about what amendments to the bill he or she might want to propose when cloture motion is filed senators often conclude that they need to proceed with drafting whatever amendments they might want to offer on the assumption that the senate will approve the motion two days later one result is that there often are more amendments submitted for printing in the record than senators actually offer after cloture is invoked under cloture senator may not modify an amendment that he or she has offered permitting modifications would be inconsistent with the principle implicit in the cloture rule that senators should be able to know what amendments may be offered under cloture before the senate decides if it will invoke cloture rule xxii permits only one limited circumstance in which senators are allowed to change the amendments they offer under cloture if measure or other matter is reprinted for some reason after the senate has invoked cloture on it and if the reprinting changes page and line numbers amendments that otherwise are in order will remain in order and can be reprinted to make conforming changes in page and line numbering 21 riddicks senate procedure p 88 crs18 multiple amendments rule xxii states that senator shall call up more than two amendments until every other senator shall have had the opportunity to do likewise the evident purpose of this provision is to prevent some senators from dominating the senates proceedings under cloture this restriction which senators have rarely if ever chosen to enforce does not create significant problem for those wishing to consume the time available for postcloture consideration from their perspective what is most important is that amendments be offered not who offers them dilatory amendments and motions rule xxii provides that dilatory motion or amendment is in order under cloture furthermore the senate has established precedents that empower the presiding officer to rule motions and amendments out of order as dilatory without senators first making points of order to that effect from the floor presiding officers rarely have exercised this authority on occasion however and whether at their own initiative or in response to points of order presiding officers have ruled amendments and various kinds of motions to be dilatory and therefore not in order22 for example motions to adjourn postpone recess and reconsider have been held to be dilatory there also is precedent supporting the authority of the presiding officer to rule that quorum call is dilatory under normal senate procedures appeals from rulings of the chair usually are debatable though they also are subject to tabling motions under cloture however appeals are not debatable in extraordinary circumstances appeals from rulings of the chair have even been ruled out of order as dilatory23 reading and division of amendments under normal senate procedure each amendment that is offered must be read before debate on it may begin unless the reading is waived by unanimous consent as it usually is under rule xxii however the reading of any amendment automatically is waived if it has been available in printed form at the desk of the members for not less than twentyfour hours this requirement usually is satisfied because amendments considered under cloture must have been submitted for printing before the cloture vote also under normal senate procedure any senator can demand that an amendment be divided into two or more component parts if each part could stand as an independent proposition but amendments in the form of motions to strike out and insert are not divisible under cloture however senator cannot demand as matter of right that an amendment be divided24 22 amendments that only express the sense of the senate or the sense of congress and therefore would not have the force of law if enacted have been considered dilatory per under cloture other type of amendment has been held to be dilatory per under cloture 23 in 1982 the presiding officer stated that the right to appeal is basic right of each senator and would be held dilatory only in the most extraordinary circumstances riddicks senate procedure p 312 24 an amendment that was offered and divided before the cloture vote continues to be considered as divided after cloture is invoked crs19 the authority of the presiding officer when the senate is operating under cloture the senates presiding officer has powers that he or she does not have under the senates regular procedures as already noted the presiding officer may rule amendments and motions out of order at his or her own initiative without waiting for senators to make points of order from the floor and even without waiting for the amendments to be read under the senates precedents once cloture has been invoked the chair is required to take the initiative to rule out of order dilatory amendments and the chair makes the determination regarding dilatory intent also under cloture the chair has taken the initiative to rule out of order amendments that were dilatory nongermane or improperly drafted as each was called up and before the amendment could be reported25 there is one other potentially important authority that the presiding officer exercises after the senate votes to invoke cloture under normal senate procedure the chair is not empowered to count whether quorum is present on the floor when senator suggests the absence of quorum the chairs only response is to direct the clerk to call the roll under cloture however the presiding officer can count to ascertain the presence of quorum business on the senate floor cloture also affects the consequences of filibuster for other legislative and executive business that the senate could conduct rule xxii provides that once the senate invokes cloture then said measure motion or other matter pending before the senate or the unfinished business shall be the unfinished business to the exclusion of all other business until disposed of if the senate invokes cloture on bill in other words the rule requires the body to continue to consider that bill until it completes action on it the rule provides mechanism for the senate to set aside the matter being considered under cloture even temporarily in order to consider other matters even those that are of an emergency nature or far less contentious as result filibuster can affect the fate not only of the matter that provokes it but also other matters that the senate may not be able to consider or at least not as soon as it would like because of the filibuster in practice however the senate often provides by unanimous consent for the consideration of other matters arrangements of this kind permit the senate to accomplish necessary routine business or make progress on other matters at the same time as it continues to move toward final resolution of the matter on which it has invoked cloture 25 riddicks senate procedure p 287 crs20 the impact of filibusters obviously filibuster has the greatest impact on the senate when 60vote majority cannot be assembled to invoke cloture in that case the measure or other matter that is being filibustered is doomed unless its opponents relent and allow the senate to vote on it even if cloture is invoked however filibuster can significantly affect how when and even whether the senate conducts its legislative and executive business in fact it is not an exaggeration to say that filibusters and the prospect of filibusters shape much of the way in which the senate does its work on the floor impact on the time for consideration in principle truly determined minority of senators even one too small to prevent cloture usually can delay for as much as two weeks the time at which the senate finally votes to pass bill that most senators support table 1 summarizes hypothetical example in this example motion to proceed to the bills consideration is made on monday day 1 if filibuster on that motion is begun or is anticipated proponents of the motion and the bill can present cloture motion on the same day however under rule xxii the cloture vote on the motion to proceed does not take place until wednesday day 3 assuming the senate invokes cloture on wednesday there then begins the 30hour period for postcloture consideration of the motion if the senate is in session for eight hours per day monday through friday the 30hour period if fully consumed will extend over almost four full days of session or at least until the end of the senates session on the following monday day 6 if at that time the senate votes for the motion to proceed the bills opponents then may begin to filibuster the bill itself requiring another cloture motion another successful cloture vote on day 8 and the expiration of another 30hour period for postcloture consideration under these conditions rule xxii would require that the vote on final passage occur on the 11th day of consideration or the 15th calendar day after the motion to proceed was made table 1 time that may be required for senate action in typical cloture situation cumulative days consumed senate action days of calendar session days motion to proceed made 1 1 cloture motion filed on motion to proceed 1 1 vote on invoking cloture on motion to proceed 3 3 vote on motion to proceed 6 8 cloture motion filed on measure 6 8 vote on invoking cloture on measure 8 10 vote on final passage of measure 11 15 crs21 how long an actual filibuster can delay final senate action may be affected by the answers that can be given in the individual case to many questions these include is cloture proposed as soon as the motion to proceed is made and then again as soon as possible after the senate takes up the bill after having agreed to the motion to proceed can the bills supporters secure the 60 votes needed to agree to the first cloture motion on the motion to proceed or is more than one attempt necessary before the senate votes for cloture on the motion similarly does the senate adopt the first cloture motion on the bill itself or is cloture invoked on the bill only on second or subsequent attempt can the senate agree by unanimous consent to expedite the process by providing for votes on cloture before the time specified in rule xxii are the bills opponents willing and able to consume the entire 30 hour period for postcloture consideration of the motion to proceed and also the same amount of time for postcloture consideration of the bill after the senate invokes cloture for how many days and for how many hours per day is the senate in session to consider the bill does the senate meet late into the evening or all night or on the weekend in order to consume both 30hour periods more quickly than it otherwise would or can unanimous consent be obtained that the 30hour periods run continuously although the actual time consumed varies from case to case clearly filibusters can create significant delays even when there are 60vote majorities to invoke cloture how much delay the senate experiences depends in part on how much time the senate and especially its majority party leadership is prepared to devote to the bill in question if the bill is particularly important to the nation and to the majority partys legislative agenda for example the majority leader may be willing to invest the days or even weeks that can be necessary to withstand and ultimately end filibuster another consideration is the point in the annual session and in the biennial life of congress at which filibuster takes place in the first months of the first session for example there may be relatively little business that is ready for senate floor consideration in that case the senate may be able to endure an extended filibuster without sacrificing its ability to act in timely way on other legislation toward the end of each session however and especially as the senate approaches sine die adjournment at the end of the second session time becomes increasingly scarce and precious every hour and every day of floor time that one bill consumes is time that crs22 is not available for the senate to act on other measures that will die if not enacted into law before the end of the congress therefore the costs of filibusters increase because their effects on the legislative prospects of other bills become greater and greater even at early stages of congress 30 hours for postcloture consideration is long time for the senate to devote to any single matter in fact the senate never has actually consumed the entire 30hour period for considering any measure or motion under cloture as noted earlier the senate voted in 1985 to reduce from 100 to 30 hours the time permitted for considering matter on which cloture has been invoked this change in rule xxii provoked little if any controversy probably because the senate had never even come very close to consuming the entire 100 hours cutting that time by more than twothirds was not expected to have much practical effect on the ability of senators to delay final floor votes the prospect of filibuster however much effect filibusters have on the operations of the senate perhaps more pervasive effect is attributable to filibusters that have not taken place at least not yet in many instances cloture motions may be filed not to overcome filibusters in progress but to preempt ones that are only anticipated also the prospect of filibuster often affects when or whether the senate will consider measure on the floor and how the senate will consider it holds senator who does not want the senate to take up certain measure whether temporarily or permanently can monitor the senate floor and then object if and when the majority leader proposes to call up the bill for consideration the practice of placing holds on measures however has developed informally as way for senators to interpose such an objection in advance and without having to do so in person on the floor for senator to place hold on bill or resolution is for the senator to request that the majority leader not even try to call up the measure for consideration at least not without giving advance notice to the senator who has placed the hold this request has formal standing in senate rules and is not binding on the leader fundamentally however when senator places the hold he or she is implicitly registering his or her intention to object to any unanimous consent request for the measures consideration in turn the majority leader and the measures prospective floor manager understand that senator who objects to allowing the bill or resolution to be called up by unanimous consent may back up his or her objection by filibustering motion to proceed to its consideration recent majority leaders have accordingly tended to honor holds both as courtesy to their colleagues and in recognition that if they choose not to do so they may well confront filibusters that they prefer to avoid in this way the threat of filibuster often is sufficient to prevent bill from coming to the senate floor at minimum the bills supporters may discuss with the senators making the threat frequently but not necessarily by placing hold on it whether the bill can be amended in way that satisfies their concerns and removes any danger of filibuster even if the bills proponents are satisfied that they could crs23 invoke cloture on the bill they still may be willing to accept unwelcome amendments to the bill in order to avoid protracted process of floor consideration in fact depending on the importance of the bill and the other measures that await floor action the majority leader may be reluctant to schedule the bill unless he is assured that the senate can complete action on it without undue delay linkage and leverage as noted above sometimes filibuster or the threat of filibuster can affect the prospects of other bills simply by compelling the senate to devote so much time to the filibustered bill that there is insufficient time available to take up all the other measures that it otherwise would consider and pass senators also have been known to use their rights under rule xxii to delay action on one bill as leverage to secure the action or inaction they want on another unrelated measure suppose for example that senator opposes s 1 but knows that he or she lacks the support to filibuster against it effectively senator in this situation may not have enough leverage to prevent senate floor consideration of s 1 or to secure satisfactory changes in the bill so the senator may seek to increase his or her leverage by delaying or threatening to delay the senates consideration of other bills that are scheduled for floor action before s1 by threatening to filibuster s 2 s 3 and s 4 for example or by actually delaying their consideration the senator may strengthen his or her bargaining position by making it clear that more is at stake than the prospects and provisions of s 1 in this way senators opposition to one bill can affect the senates floor agenda in unexpected and unpredictable ways consensus more generally the possibility of filibusters creates powerful incentive for senators to strive for legislative consensus the votes of only 51 senators are needed to pass bill on the floor it can however require the votes of 60 senators to invoke cloture on the bill in order to overcome filibuster and enable the senate to reach that vote on final passage knowing this bills supporters have good reason to write it in way that will attract the support of at least threefifths of all senators since 1980 neither party has ever held 60 of all the seats in the senate thus as long as this situation persists every bill that the senate passes must enjoy at least minimal degree of bipartisan acceptance what is more there often are more bills that are ready to be considered on the senate floor than there is time available for acting on them under these circumstances the majority leader may be reluctant especially toward the end of congress even to call up bill unless he can be assured that it will not be filibustered at all the threat of filibuster may be enough to convince the majority leader to devote the senates time to other matters instead even if all concerned agree that the filibuster ultimately would not succeed in preventing the senate from passing the bill in such case bills supporters may not be content with securing the support of even 60 senators in the hope of eliminating the threat of filibuster the proponents may try to accommodate the interests of all senators or at least to convince them that good faith effort has been made to assuage their concerns at best opponents can become supporters at worst opponents may remain opposed but may decide against expressing their opposition through filibuster while true consensus on major legislative issues may be impossible the dynamics of the crs24 senates legislative process do promote efforts to come as close to consensus as the strongly held beliefs of senators permit for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30360
