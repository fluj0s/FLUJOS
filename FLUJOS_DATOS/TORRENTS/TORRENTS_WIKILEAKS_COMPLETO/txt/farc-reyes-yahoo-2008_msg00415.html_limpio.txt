love made leander pass the dreadful flood which cestos from abydos doth divide love made chaos where proud ilion stood through love the carthaginian dido died thus may we see how love doth rule and reigns bringing those under which his power disdains xxvi though you be fair and beautiful withal and i am black for which you despise know that your beauty subject is to fall though you esteem it at so high price and time may come when that whereof you boast which is your youths chief wealth and ornament shall withered be by winters raging frost when beautys pride and flowering years are spent then wilt thou mourn when none shall thee respect then wilt thou think how thou hast scorned my tears then pitiless each one will thee neglect when hoary grey shall dye thy yellow hairs then wilt thou think upon poor corins case who loved thee dear yet lived in thy disgrace xxvii love leave off with sorrow to torment let my hearts grief and pining pain content thee the breach is made i give thee leave to enter thee to resist great god i dare not venter restless desire doth aggravate mine anguish careful conceits do fill my soul with languish be not too cruel in thy conquest gained thy deadly shafts hath victory obtained batter more my fort with fierce affection but shield captive under thy protection i yield to thee love thou art the stronger raise then thy siege and trouble longer xxviii what cruel star or fate had domination when i was born that thus my love is crossed or from what planet had i derivation that thus my life in seas of woe is crossed doth any live that ever had such hap that all their actions are of none effect whom fortune never dandled in her lap but as an abject still doth reject ah tickle dame and yet thou constant art my daily grief and anguish to increase and to augment the troubles of my heart thou of these bonds wilt never release so that thy darlings to be may know the true idea of all worldly woe xxix some in their hearts their mistress colours bears some hath her gloves some other hath her garters some in bracelet wears her golden hairs and some with kisses seal their loving charters but i which never favour reaped yet nor had one pleasant look from her fair brow content myself in silent shade to sit in hope at length my cares to overplow meanwhile mine eyes shall feed on her fair face my sighs shall tell to her my sad designs my painful pen shall ever sue for grace to help my heart which languishing now pines and i will triumph still amidst my woe till mercy shall my sorrows overflow xxx the raging sea within his limits lies and with an ebb his flowing doth discharge the rivers when beyond their bounds they rise themselves do empty in the ocean large but my loves sea which never limit keepeth which never ebbs but always ever floweth in liquid salt unto my chloris weepeth yet frustrate are the tears which he bestoweth this sea which first was but little spring is now so great and far beyond all reason that it deluge to my thoughts doth bring which overwhelmed hath my joying season so hard and dry is my saints cruel mind these waves way in her to sink can find xxxi these waves way in her to sink can find to penetrate the pith of contemplation these tears cannot dissolve her hardened mind nor move her heart on to take compassion then poor corin scorned and quite despised loathe now to live since life procures thy woe enough thou hast thy heart anatomised for her sweet sake which will pity show but as cold winters storms and nipping frost can never change sweet aramanthus hue so though my love and life by her are crossed my heart shall still be constant firm and true although erynnis hinders hymens rites my fixed faith against oblivion fights xxxii my fixed faith against oblivion fights and i cannot forget her pretty elf although she cruel be unto my plights yet let rather clean forget myself then her sweet name out of my mind should go which is th elixir of my pining soul from whence the essence of my life doth flow whose beauty rare my senses all control themselves most happy evermore accounting that such nymph is queen of their affection with ravished rage they to the skies are mounting esteeming not their thraldom nor subjection but still do joy amidst their misery with patience bearing loves captivity xxxiii with patience bearing loves captivity themselves unguilty of his wrath alleging these homely lines abjects of poesy for liberty and for their ransom pledging and being free they solemnly do vow under his banner ever arms to bear against those rebels which do disallow that love of bliss should be the sovereign heir and chloris if these weeping trucemen may one spark of pity from thine eyes obtain in recompense of their sad heavy lay poor corin shall thy faithful friend remain and what i say i ever will approve joy may be compared to thy love xxxiv the bird of thrace which prev by date crisis ecosocial marxismo next by date saludos previous by thread
