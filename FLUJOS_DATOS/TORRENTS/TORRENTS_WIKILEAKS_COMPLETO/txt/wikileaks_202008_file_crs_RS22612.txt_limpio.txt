us department of commerce crs2 merchandise trade versus trade in goods and services merchandise trade statistics are referred to as census basis statistics because they are collected compiled and distributed by the us census bureau these are the data reported here and constitute the one continuing data series using largely uniform definitions merchandise trade statistics are important because they alone are the basis for commodity and country trade information in january 1994 the us department of commerce began reporting and publishing trade data on goods and services as the benchmark monthly trade statistic supplementing merchandise trade data services trade statistics are compiled by the bureau of economic analysis bea on balance of payments bop basis to harmonize census merchandise data with bea services data statistics on goods and services are reported on bop basis this involves such changes as deducting us military sales from merchandise accounts because they are considered services transactions and adding to merchandise statistics parcels mailed to foreigners by individuals in the united states what this means is that the goods component of trade in goods and services is different from the goods measured in merchandise trade statistics httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22612 definitions in merchandise trade merchandise trade is trade in goods only not services and excludes capital transfers and foreign investments exports are defined in this report as total exports they include both domestically produced goods and reexports which constitute imports of goods that are warehoused in the united states then reexported imports are defined here as general imports which measure total arrivals of goods into the united states imports for both immediate consumption channels and warehouses or foreign trade zones balance of merchandise trade is defined here and in standard us department of commerce data as total exports minus general imports dollar amounts are current us dollars that is official statistics with inflation adjustment expressed in millions billions or trillions as noted valuation methods define where in trade transaction the value of good is measured as goods move in international trade they acquire more costs although an automobile has one cost at the end of its assembly line it acquires higher cost when shipping and insurance to local dealer or port for export are added for this report current official us government valuation practice is followed total exports are valued free alongside or fas fas figures provide valuation of exports at the port of exportation and thus exclude charges for loading onto the vessel the transportation itself insurance unloading and foreign transportation general imports are valued on customs valuation customs valuation for imports excludes costs of international transportation and insurance as well as tariffs and is therefore quite similar to fas valuation customs valuation for imports
