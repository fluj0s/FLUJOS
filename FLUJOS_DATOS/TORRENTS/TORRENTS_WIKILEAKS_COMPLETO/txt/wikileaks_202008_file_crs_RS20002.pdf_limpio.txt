informationth see crs report 98991 federal land management agencies background on lan d and resources management introduction four federal agencies administer most of the 657 million acres of federal land 29 of the land in the united states the national park service nps the fish and wildlife service fws and the bureau of land management blm in the department of th interior and the forest service fs in the department of agriculture the majority of the federal lands 92 are in 12 western states and the federal government owns morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20002crs2 alaska arizona california colorado idaho montana nevada new mexico oregon utah 2 washington and wyomingthan half of the land in those states 54 ranging from 27 in washington to 83 i n nevada2 the national park system the national park service nps manages 77 million acres in the 378 units of th national park system also nps many of the largest units are in alaska 51 millio n acres or 65 while the remainder are distributed among the other states and territories nps has many diverse categories for its units with 20 different designations the largest units are the national parks preserves and monuments national parks national parks are established to conserve and protect outstanding natural resources for the enjoy ment of current and future generations and are managed to conserve the natural historic and cultural values for which the area was set aside the 54 full national parks the crown jewels of the system such as ye llowstone national park offer wide range of visitor activities and facilities fishing is allowed in most nationa l parks but hunting and resource development activities eg mineral extraction and timber harvesting generally are prohibited unless grandfathered or expressly permitted in th parks authorizing legislation national parks can only be designated by acts of congress national preserves national preserves many of which are in alaska and abu t national parks are established to protect significant natural resources these areas may include unique ecological comm unities climax communities rare wildlife habitat or flora or other scientific geologic or topographic v alues which contribute to the natural heritage of the nation management of national preserves is generally similar to that of nationa l parks but typically allow not only fishing and other recreation allowed in the parks but also hunting and mineral extraction as long as the natural values for which the preserve was established are not jeopardized national preserves are also designated by acts f congress national monuments national monuments are established to preserve specifi c natural resources of historic cultural or scientific interest including outstanding geologic formations eg unusual caves or dunes or may include unique ecological communities and wildlife habitat the nps manages 73 national monuments 5 are administered b other federal agencies and include broad range of entities such as aniakchak ak canyon chelly az and cabrillo san marcos fl permitted and prohibited uses in national monuments are l argely the same as in the national parks many recreation uses are allowed although hunting may be restricted or forbidden wood cutting and mos t commer cial activities are usually curtailed but mineral extraction may be allowed national monuments may be blished by an act of congress although most have been establishe d by presidential proclamation under the authority of the 1906 antiquities act in addition to these categories t he nps has numerous other designations including national battlefields historic sites nati onal seashores and lakeshores and more the nps also administers 19 national recreation areas nras wh ile 19 are administered by the fs one by the blm and one by the tennessee valley authority nras are principall yhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20002crs3 see crs report 9836 enr federal land ownership constitut ional authority and the history3 of acquisition disposal and retention designated by acts of congress but some have been identified administratively rec reation is the dominan t use but each nra is unique tailored to the characteristics of the area the management philosophy of the administering agency and directions from gress other uses may be allowed in nras including recovery of timber or minera l resources li vestock grazing watershed protection and resource preservation as long as these uses are compatible with the primary purpose for which the area was set aside the national wildlife refuge system the fish and wildlife serv ice fws manages 93 million acres in 512 national wild life refuges 198 waterfowl production areas 50 wildlif coordination areas and 114 other sites fws manages lands in every state and several territo ries but 77 million acres 83 of the national wildlife refuge system nwrs are in alaska the president ca n establish new nwrs units but few have been created by congress with specific pur poses for those units identified in law most are established by fws under general land acquisition authorities especially the migratory bird treaty act the national wildlife refuge system administration act of 1966 and the national wildlife refuge system improvement act of 1997 direct the fws to administer th system primarily to conserve and enhance fish and wildlife and their habitats only uses compatible with these gener purposes and with any specific individual purposes set out for each refuge are permitt ed exceptions to the primacy of conserving plant and animal life and habitat occur chiefly due to preexisting uses or rights especially for minerals and to special conditions establ ished in the specific law creating the refuge for example grazing and mineral activities are permitted in certain refuges and under certain circum stances hunting fishing and other recreational uses generally are permitted in wildlif refuges the public lands bureau of land management the blm administers 264 million acres concentrated in 11 western states alaska arizona california colorado idaho montana nevad new mexico oregon utah and wyoming the federal government acquired most of these lands from the original states or in purchases or treaties with fore ign nations initially most of the lands were expected to be transferred to the states and the private sector however some of these publi c domain lands were reserved from the earliest years of the nation for various purpose s including creating the three sy stems described above the taylor grazing act of 19343 provided for management of the remaining lands and the federal land policy and man agement act of 1976 flpma stipulated that the remaining lands generally be retained in federal ownership and defined them as public lands blm also manages 26 million acres of heavilytimbered revested oregon and california oc railroad grant lands in western oregon congress has provided uniform general guidance for most public lands blm man ages the public lands for sustained yields of multiple uses livestock grazing outdoo r recreation wood production water supply wildlife and fish habitats and

areas nfs lands are concentrated in the west but the fs manages more than half of all federal land in the east congress has provi ded uniform general management guidance for most nfs lands as with the public lands nfs lands generally are administered for sustained yields f multiple uses the fs decides on permitted levels and locations of the uses in land an d resource management plans that are prepared by interdisciplinary teams under the pro visions of the national forest management act of 1976 and other laws plans must be5 revised at least every 15 years and the agency is proceeding with revisions of the initial management plans special systems three special management systems have been created to protect particular features or characteri stics the national wilderness preservation system the national trails sys tem and the nationa l wild and scenic rivers system the units of these systems can be on one or more agencys lands and the designations are superimposed over the manage ment guidance for those lands for example designated wilderness area within national park must be managed to fulfill the requirements of the parks authorizing legislation s well as of the wildern ess act and the areas designating legislation in general congress reserved the right to define the extent of these systems although states can designat rivers and recreational trails that can under certain cir cumstances be added to the systems without congressional action the national wilderness preservation system the wilderness act define s6 wilderness as federal land that is primarily affected by the forces of nature relatively touched by human activity where solitude and primitive recreation are dominant values the agencies can recommended areas for designation but only congress can designat them as part of the system the national wi lderness preservation system includes nearlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20002crs5 in accordance with flpma the blm has submitted recommendations to the president and the7 president to congress to designate another 85 million acres as wilderness see crs report 98848 enr wilderness laws prohibited and permitted uses 8 for more information on the trails system see crs report 98981 enr the national trail s9 system an overview104 million acres of land of whic h 55 are in alaska fs administers 35 million acres of the system nps 43 million acres fws 21 million acres and blm 5 million acres7 the wilderness act defines the purpose of wilderness as devoted to the publi c purposes of recreational scenic scientific educational conservation and historical use the act generally prohibits commercial activities eg timber harvesting motorize d access or mechanical transport and permanent roads structures and facilities in wilder ness areas however several exceptions are identified in the act including continued use of motorboats and aircraft fire insect and dis ease control mineral prospecting water project developments subject to presidential approval continued livestock grazing and certain commercial recreation activities hunting and fishing are not affected by wilder ness designation congress has also specif ied exceptions for particular sites in the various laws designating the areas8 national trails syst em the national trails system act of 1968 established four9 classes of national trails 1 national scenic trails to provide outdoor recreation and th conservation and enjoyment of si gnificant scenic historic natural or cultural qualities 2 national h istoric trails to follow travel routes of national historic significance 3 national recreation trails in or with reasonable access to urban areas and 4 connecting or sid trails to provide acces s to or among the other trails twenty national scenic and historic trails totaling nearly 40 000 miles have been designated by law another 800 recreation trails and 2 connecting or side trails have been designated administratively national trails are administered by the fs nps and blm many in cooperation with appropriate state and local authorities most recreation uses are permitted as are other uses or facilities that do not substantially interfere with the nature and purposes of the trail motorized vehicles generally are prohibited on system trails national wild and scenic rivers system the national wild and scenic rivers act of 1968 established three river classes 1 wild rivers free from impoundments dams diversions etc generally inaccessible except by trail with generally primitive watersheds and undeveloped shorelines 2 scenic rivers free from impoundments in generall undeveloped areas but accessible in places by roads and 3 recreational rivers readil accessible by road wit h some shoreline development and possibly some impoundment or diversion in the pas t to date 155 rivers totaling 10896 miles have been included in the national wild and scenic rivers system the principal protection of t he wild and scenic river designation is the prohibition of water resource projects which may divert or hinder the flow of the river management of permitted use varies with the class of the design ated river congress directed the agencies to protect and enhanc the values that led to the designation but also specified that most other land uses not be limited unless they substantially interfere with public use an dhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20002crs6 enjoyment of these values road building hunting fishing and mining and minera l leasing may be permitted in some instances depending on the classification and whether the activities are consistent with the values of the area b eing protected and with other state and federal laws wild and scenic rivers are us ually managed by nps fws blm or fs but segment of one river the cossatot in arkansas is manage d by the us army corps of engineers states may also propose rivers for designation with the approval of th secretary of the interior and then manage those rivers other federal land designations congress has designated numerous special areas that are separate from the categories discussed above for exa mple several national game refuges and wildlife preserves have been designated by law for prot ecting wildlife but are managed by the fs apart from the national wildlife refuge system fs manages numerous other congressionally desig nated areas that have site specific management guidelines including six scenic areas two national monuments two national volcanic monuments conservation area scenic research area primitive area and various other special management areas most have been established by acts of co ngress to preserve protect or provide specific values and are managed under sitespecific guidelines blm spec ial management areas include 7 national conservation areas ncas 714 areas of cri tical environmental concern acecs and 89 research natural areas rnas ncas are special areas designated by congress for conserving particular purpose r value such as aquatic and wildlife resources or historic scenic cultural biological r paleontological values etc acecs are identified in the blm planning process as areas to be managed to protect and prevent irreparable damage to important historic cultural or scenic values or fish and wildlife habitats rnas also are identified in the plannin g process as areas to be managed primarily for research and education
