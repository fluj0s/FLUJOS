interest in patent ownership as an incentive to private sector developmen t and utilization of federallyfunded rd was evident in series of legislative debates in the mid to late 1970s this was soon

report 98862 21 october 1998context of ongoing congressional interest in this arena it should be noted that while the original stevensonwydler act was passed prior to the bayhdole act the amendments to pl 96480 that are relevant to the current discussion were enacted after bayhdole took effect since several of the amended provisions of stevenson wydler are based upon components of bayhdole the bayhdole act will be addressed first in this report patents in brief interest in the value of intellectual property has grown as technology becomes increasingly important to the united states it is now widely accepted that technological progress accounts for up to onehalf of the nations economic growth1 patents protect the inventors investments in generating the knowledge that is the basis for innovation as written in the constitution patents are intended to promote science and the useful arts and serve as an incentive to the commercialization of new ideas as rd has become more expensive ownership of title to inventions has been used by the federal government as means to foster increased interest in private sector support for such efforts the patent system was created by article i section 8 clause 8 of the us constitution to encourage new discoveries and their reduction to practice commonly known as innovation the grant of patent provides the inventor with means to capture returns to his invention through exclusive rights on its practice for 20 years from date of filing this is intended to encourage those investments necessary to further develop an idea and generate marketable technology at the same time the process of obtaining patent places the concept on which it is based in the public domain in return for monopoly right to specific applications of the knowledge generated the inventor must publish the ideas covered in the patent as disclosure system the patent can and often does stimulate other firms or individuals to invent around existing patents to provide for parallel technical developments or meet similar and expanded demands in the marketplace2 the utility of patents to companies varies among industrial sectors an assessment of the aircraft and semiconductor industries found that patents were not the most successful mechanism for capturing the benefits of investments instead lead time and the strength of the learning curve were

formation in the next decade 40 important3 in contrast patents are perceived as critical in the drug and chemical industries that may reflect the nature of rd performed in those sectors where the resulting patents are more detailed in their claims and therefore easier to defend4 the degree to which industry perceives patents as effective is positively correlated with the increase in duplication costs and time associated with patents5 in certain industries patents significantly raise the costs incurred by nonpatent holders wishing to use the idea or invent around the patent an estimated 40 in the pharmaceutical sector 30 for major new chemical products and 25 for typical chemical goods and are thus viewed as important however in other industries patents have much smaller impact on the costs associated with imitation eg in the 715 range for electronics and are considered less successful in protecting resource investments6 despite questions as to their efficacy firms continue to patent their inventions the number of domestic patents granted to us inventors is growing7 this activity appears to be the result of additional perceived benefits including royalty payments delays to imitators and the ability to use patents as bargaining tools to meet alternative priorities of the firm8 the low expiration rate of high technology patents relative to patents on less sophisticated technologies may indicate the value that compani assign to such protection even in industries where the life cycle of inventions is short9 the bayhdole act rationale pl 96517 the

policy 5 1335 usc 200technology resulting from government funding of research and development while there was ongoing and longterm debate over what government patent policy should entail there was general agreement that the policy adopted should promote the utilization of inventions10 the intent of the legislation as articulated in the house judiciary committee report to accompany the relevant bill was to replace the existing melange of 26 different agency policies on vesting of patent rights in government funded resea rch with single uniform national policy designed to cut down on bureaucracy and encourage private indus try to utilize government funded inventions through the commitment of the risk capital necessary to develop such inventions to the point of commercial application11 at the time the legislation was under consideration only 5 of federallyowned patents were being used this was one consequence of the practice by many agencies of taking title to all inventions made with federal funding while only permitting the nonexclusive licensing of contracto r inventions12 without title to inventions or at least exclusive licenses companies are less likely to engage in and fund the additional rd necessary to bring an idea to the marketpl ace bayhdole by providing universities nonprofit institutions and small businesses with ownershi p of patents arising from federallyfunded rd offers an incentive for cooperative work and commercial application royalties derived from intellectual property rights provides the academic community an alternative way to support further research and the business sector means to obtain return on their financial contribution to the endeavor in enacting pl 96517 the congress accepted the proposition that vesting title in contractor will encourage commercialization and that this should be used to foster innovation in specific segments of the economy as stated in the law it is the policy and objective of the congress to use the patent system to promote the utilization of inventions arising from federallysupported research and development to promote collaboration between commercial concerns and nonprofit organizations including universities to promote the commercialization and public availability of inventions made in the united states by united states industry and labor and to ensure that the government obtains sufficient rights in federallysupported inventions to meet the needs of the government and protect the public against nonuse or unreasonable use of inventions 13 the anticipated payback to the country through increa sed revenues from taxes on profits new jobs created improved productivity and economic growth were seen ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30320crs5 14ibid 15report to accompany hr 6933 3a balance for the initial cost of the technology to the government or any potential unfair advantage to any recipient to achieve such goals the bayhdole act addresses two areas of intellectual property as it pertains to the federal government title to inventions made with federal rd funding and licensing of governmentowned patents the relevant provisions are discussed below title to inventions made with federal funding each nonprofit organization including universities or small business is permitted to elect within reasonable time frame to retain title to any subject invention made as result of rd funded by the federal government except under exceptional circumst ances when it is determined by the agency that restriction or elimination of the right to retain title to any subject invention will better promote the policy and objectives of this chapter14 the owner of the intellectual property must commit to commercialization of the patent within predetermined time frame agreed to by the supporting agency and the performing organization as stated in the house report to accompany the bill the legislation establishe s presumption emphasis added that ownership of all patent rights in government funded research will vest in any contractor who is nonprofit research institution or small business15 certain rights are reserved for the government to protect the public interest the government retains nonexclusive nontransferable irrevocable paidup license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the united states any subject invention throughout the world the government also retains marchin rights that enable the federal agency to require the contractor whether he owns title or has an exclusive license to grant nonexclusive partially exclusive or exclusive license in any field of use to responsible applicant or applicants with due compensation or to grant license itself under certain circumstances the special situation necessary to trigger marchin rights involve s determination that the contractor has not made efforts to commercialize within an agreed upon time frame or that the action is necessary to alleviat health or safety needs that are not being met by the contractor 15 usc 203 the government is authorized to withhold public disclosure of information for reasonable time until patent application can be made this supplements additional law that prohibits the patent and trademark office from releasing information associated with patent until it is issued licensing by contractor retaining title under this act is restricted to companies that will manufacture substantially within the united states initially universities were limited in the time they could grant large companies exclusive licenses for patents derived from governmentsponsored rd 5 of the then 17 years of the patent this restriction however was voided by pl 98620 the trademark clarification act of 1984 according to senate report 98662 extending the time frame for licensing

pharmaceuticals where long development times and major investments are usually required prior to commercialization16 under these provisions several of the governmentowned contractoroperated laboratories of the department of energy doe receive title to inventions under bayhdole because they are operated by universities or nonprofit institutions those contractoroperated laboratories run by large firms also receive paten t rights from doe which has waived the agencys intellectual property claims under authority of the atomic energy act of 1954 and through their management and operating contracts as discussed above certain rights continue to be retained by the government licensing of governmentowned inventions bayhdole also addressed the licensing of inventions to which the government retained title typically because of past agency practices or because of public interest title 35 usc 209 proscribes the licensing of this type of invention the law permits federa l departments to offer nonexclusive exclusive or partially exclusive licenses under certain conditions and with specific rights retained by the government these include the right to terminate the license if commercialization is not pursued as provided in the business plan or if the government needs the license for public use the agencies are required to inform the public about the availability of patent for licensing originally notices were to be published in the federal register for period of three months and if company displayed intent to license the laboratory was mandated to place an additional notice and offer 60 days for objections however pl 106404 the technology transfer commercialization act makes chang in these practices to decrease the time delays associated with this procedure in light of the ability of the internet to offer widespread notification and the necessity of time constraints faced by industry in commercialization activities public notice is now to be provided 15 days prior to the grant of license in providing licenses small businesses are given preferences and licensees must agree that any products embodying the invention or produced through the use of the invention will be manufactured substantially in the united states stevensonwydler technology innovation act background pl 96480 the stevensonwydler technology innovation act as amended was enacted to encourage use of technologies developed in the federal laboratory system this is to be accomplished by technology transfer the process by which technology generated in one organization in one area or for one purpose is applied in another organization in another area or for another purpose in the defense andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30320crs7 17for additional information see congressional research service technology transfer use of federally funded research and development by wendy h schacht crs issue brief 85031 updated regularlyspace arenas it is often called spinoff technology transfer can have different meanings in differen t situations in some instances it refers to the transfer of legal rights such as the assignme nt of patent title to contractor or the licensing of governmentowned patent to private firm in other cases the transfer endeavor involves the informal movement of information knowledge or skills through person toperson interaction the crucial aspect in successful transfer is the actual use of the product or process through which the benefits from more efficient and effective provision of goods and services can be achieved17 in pursuit of mission requirements federal departments and agencies spend approximately 79 billion per year on research and development almost third of this goes to support rd performed in the government laboratory system such an effort has resulted in new and improved technologies and manufacturing techniques that may provide additional benefits beyond specific missionrelated use for example while the major portion of total federal rd spending has been in the defense arena governmentfinanced work has led or contributed to new commercial products and processes including but not limited to antibiotics plastics jet aircraft computers electronics and genetically engineered drugs eg insulin and human growth hormone technology transfer is one way proponents argue that federallyfunded rd can be further developed and applied by the private sector to meet other national needs associated with economic growth the increasing competitive pressures on us firms in the international marketplace coupled with the governments requirements for goods and services can make the collaboration between federal laboratories and industry through technol ogy transfer beneficial to both sectors although opponents may argue that these activities detract from budgeted research the knowledge base created by agencysupported rd may serve as foundation for additional commercially relevant efforts in companies while the government research enterprise is advanced through interaction with innovative firms this transfer is facilitated by cooperat ive research and development agreements cradas particu lar legal instrument created by pl 99502 the federal technology transfer act of 1986 amending stevensonwydler and applicable to governmentowned governmentoperated laboratories the right to use cradas was extended to governmentowned contractoroperated laboratories by an additional amendment to stevensonwydler contained in pl 101189 the fy1990 department of defense authorizations cooperative research and development agreements cooperative research and development agreement crada is specific legal document not procurement contract that defines the collaborative venture it is intended to be devel oped at the laboratory level with limited agency review in agencies that operate their own laboratories the laboratory director is permitted to make decisions to participate in cradas as means of decentralizing and expediting the technology transfer process however at agencies that use contractors to runhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30320crs8 their laboratories specifically the department of energy the crada also has to be approved by headquarters the work performed under cooperative research and development agreement must be consistent with the laboratorys mission in pursuing these joint efforts the laboratory may accept funds personnel services and property from the collaborating party and may provide personn services and property to the participating organization the government can cover overhead costs incurred in support of the crada but is expressly prohibited from providing direct funding to the industrial partner the legislation does not specify the dispensation of patents deriv ed from the collaborative work allowing agencies to develop their own polic ies under crada title to or licenses for inventions made by laboratory employee may be granted in advance to the participating company by the director of the laboratory 15 usc 3710a in addition the director may waive in advance any right of ownership the government might have on inventions resulting from the joint effort regardless of size of the collaborating company at the least the law permits the collaborating party the option to choose an exclusive license for prenegotiated field of use for any such invention under the agreement the director also may negotiate licensing agreements for related governmentowned inventions previously made at that laboratory to facilitate cooperative ventures in all cases the government retains certain rights including nonexclusive nontransferable irrevocable paidup license to practice the invention or have the invention practiced throughout the world by or on behalf of the government for research or other government purposes under exceptional circumstances the government may exercise its right to require party to which it assigned title or granted exclusive license to an invention to license the technology to another organization if it is necessary to address health and safety needs not being addressed to meet requirements for public use specified by federal regulation not being met or if the cooperating party has not performed its obligations as specified in the agreement information related to obtaining patent is protected from disclosure for period of time 15 usc 3710a typical agency activities are summarized below it should be noted that the dispensation of title to inventions made under crad involving government owned contractoroperated laboratory is influenced by provisions of the bayhdole act that gives title to inventions made by those contractors that are universities or nonprofits in addition under the atomic energy act of 1954 pl 83703 the department of energy has provided similar rights to all contractors as outlined in their management and operations contracts in general if an invention is made solely by an employee of governmentowned governmentoperated laboratory the agency may keep title to the invention or may provide title to the collaborating party if an invention is made solely by an employee of governmentowned contractoroperated laboratory the contractor may keep title to the invention either under the auspices of the bayhdole act if the contractor is

may relinquish its interest in the patent if an invention is made jointly by an employee of governmentowned contractor operated laboratory and cooperating institution both organizations may coown the title if an invention is made solely by collaborating party that party may keep title to the invention with certain rights reserved by the government laboratory personnel and former employees are permitted to partici pate in commercialization activities if these are consistent with the agencies regulations and rules of conduct federal employees are subject to conflict of interest restraints in the case of governme ntowned contractoroperated laboratories pl 101189 required that conflict of interest provisi ons regarding cradas be included in all operating contracts preference in determining cradas is given to small businesses companies that will manufacture in the united states or foreign firms from countries that permit american companies to enter into similar arrangements according to senate report 99283 that accompanied the legislation the authorities conveyed by the section dealing with cradas are permissive to promote the widest use of this arrangement18 it should be noted here that cradas are only one form of cooperative activity but because they can be easily identified and quantified they tend to be the most visible other mechanisms include personnel exchanges and visits licensing of patents work for others educational initiatives information dissemination the use of special laboratory facilities and centers set up in particular technological areas cooperative assistance to state and local programs and the spinoff of new firms currentl federal laboratories legislatively are prohibited from competing with the private sector and can only offer the use of expertise and equipment which is not readily available elsewhere technology transfer and cooperative efforts are expressly forbidden to interfere with the laboratories rd missionrelated activities government employee inventions under stevensonwydler as amended federal employees responsibl for an invention are to receive at least 15 of royalties generated by the licensing of that governmentowned patent 15 usc 3710c the agencies may establish their own royalty sharing programs within certain guidelines contained in the legislation the inventor may not receive more than 100000 per year without the consent of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30320crs10 president if the federal agency has the right to an invention but chooses not to patent the inventor either current federal employee or form er one may obtain title to that invention subject to the reservation by the government of nonexclusive nontransferable irrevocable paid up license to practice or have practiced the invention on behalf of the government the stevensonwydler act also provides instructions on the distribution to federal agencies of royalties derived from cooperative rd agreements 15 usc 3710c if after the 15 payment to the inventor royalty income exceeds 5 of the governmentoperated laboratory budget the laboratory may retain 25 of the excess with the remainder paid to the us treasury the funds retained by the laboratory are to be used for expenses incurred in the administration and licensing of inventions to reward the scientific engineering and technical personnel of the laboratory to provide for personnel exchanges between laboratories for education and training consistent with the laboratories and agencies missions or for additional technology transfer activities royalties earned by governmentowned contractor operated laboratories under crada may be used for payments to inventors as well as additional related education training rd andor scientific exchanges additional considerations the bayhdole act and the stevensonwyder act address the ownership of inventions made under different circumstances but which have their roots in the federal rd enterpri as discussed above bayhdole primarily addresses the dispensation of patent title to inventions resulting from federallyfunded research and development and prescribes the licensing of governmentowned patents the stevensonwydler act contains provisions concerning ownership of patents arising from collaborative work between federal laboratories and outside cooperating parties where direct federal funding is involved however different they may be on the surface both laws are intended to promote the commercialization of technology congress ional support for such efforts is founded on the idea that the process of bringing new products processes and services to the marketplace can generate economic growth in the form of new jobs greater productivity and improvements in the health and welfare of the population profound changes in our society have been brought about by advances in federallyfunde d rd in the areas of medicine semiconductors computers and materials just to name few over the years the legislation has been amended to reflect problems and opportunities in the implementation of these laws during the 106th congress there were efforts to make changes in the way governmentowned paten ts are licensed pl 106404 signed into law on november 1 2000 shortens the time required by the bayhdole act 15 usc 209 to publicize the availability of technologies for licensing this law also allows licenses for existing governmentowned inventions to be included in cradas under changes made to the stevensonwydler act the legislative initiatives taken by the congress during the past 20 years reflect the concern that companies that do not control the inventio ns arising from their investments in money or effort tend to be less likely to engage in related rdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30320crs11 necessary to bring an idea to the marketplace under the bayhdole and stevenson wydler acts patent ownership may be provided in return for commercialization of the results of research and development the prospect of new products and processes to improve our health welfare and standard of living has been viewed as promoting the public interest proponents of this approach contend that these benefits are more important than the initial cost of the technology to the government or any potential unfair advantag one company may have over another in their dealings with the federal departments and agencies however as the environment within which rd and innovation are performed changes the effects of stevensonwydler and bayhdole may be altered new challenges and opportunities in this area may be expected disputes have arisen over competing claims to intellectual property developed under governmentindustry ventures delays still exist in the negotiation of cradas due to disagreements over the dispensation of intellectual property concerns have been expressed regarding the right of drug compa nies to set prices on drugs that were developed in part with federal funding or in collaboration with federal agencies problems have been encountered in obtaining technologies for research use by federal laboratories because of apprehensions over diminished effectiveness of intellectual property if new applications are discovered as these and other related issues continue to be explored the information contained in this paper is designed to provide background for any additional congressional activity associated with the implementation of both the bayh dole act and the stevensonwydler act
