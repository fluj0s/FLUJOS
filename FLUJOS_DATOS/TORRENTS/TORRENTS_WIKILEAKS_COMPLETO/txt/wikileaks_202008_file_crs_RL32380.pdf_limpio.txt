industries inc fpi is governmentowned corporation that employs offenders incarcerated in correctional facilities under the federal bureau of prisons bop unicor manufactures products and provides services that are sold to executive agencies in the federal government fpi was created to serve as means for managing training and rehabilitating inmates in the federal prison system through employment in one of its industries the question of whether unicor is unfairly competing with private businesses particularly small businesses in the federal market has been and continues to be an issue of debate the debate has been affected by tensions between competing interests that represent two social goodsthe employment and rehabilitation of offenders and the need to protect jobs of law abiding citizens at the core of the debate is unicors preferential treatment over the private sector unicors enabling legislation and the federal acquisition regulation require federal agencies with the exception of the department of defense dod to procure products offered by unicor unless authorized by unicor to solicit bids from the private sector while federal agencies are not required to procure services provided by unicor they are encouraged to do so it is this mandatory source clause that has drawn controversy over the years and is the subject of current legislation of the eligible inmates held in federal prisons 21836 or 17 are employed by unicor by statute unicor must be economically selfsustain ing thus it does not receive funding through congressional appropriations in fy2008 fpi generated 8543 million in sales unicor uses the revenue it generates to purchase raw material and equipment pay wages to inmates and staff and invest in expansion of its facilities of the revenues generated by fpis products and services approximately 80 go toward the purchase of raw material and equipment 16 go toward staff salaries and 4 go toward inmate salaries the bush administration has made several efforts to mitigate the competitive advantage unicor has over the private sector going beyond the bush administrations efforts congress has taken legislative action to lessen the adverse impact fpi has caused on small businesses for example in 2002 2003 and 2004 congress passed legislation that modified fpis mandatory source clause with respect to procurements made by the department of defense and the central intelligence agency cia in 2004 congress passed legislation limiting funds appropriated for fy2004 to be used by federal agencies for the purchase of products or services manufactured by fpi under certain circumstances in the 110 th congress the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 pl 110181 modified the way in which dod procures products from fpi legislation in the 111 th congress s 41 would among other things require fpi to employ inmates in manufacturing positions by subcontracting with private sector employers would require the attorney general to establish the foreign labor substitute panel that would have review pilot projects by united states companies for using federal inmate labor to produce goods that would otherwise be produced by foreign labo r and would amended current law to restate the mission operating objectives performance standards and contracting requirements for fpi this report will be updated

the late 1800s due to the poor conditions in which inmates were working and their perception that the industries were taking jobs away from law abiding citizens the depression of the 1930s and the resulting high levels of unemployment crystalized the debate unicor was established in 1934 under an executive order issued by president franklin delano roosevelt9 the purpose of unicor was to consolidate the operations of all federal prison industries in order to provide training opportunities for inmates and diversify the production of prison shops so that individual industry would be substantially affected 10 g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g157g162g561 fpi is administered by sixperson board of directors that is appointed by the president its enabling act 11 requires that

federal penalties in the late 19th century such perpetrators were being prosecuted at an increasing rate which contributed to the overcrowding in state and local correctional facilities as result congress authorized the establishment of the first federal prisons in 1891 federal inmates in the 19th and the first part of the 20th centuries tended to be nonviolent offenders who committed property or public orderrelated offenses such offenders stand in contrast to federal offenders in the latter part of the 20th century and currently whose crimes are increasingly more violent andor are often incarcerated for drugrelated offenses for example in 1980 34 of the federal prison population consisted of violent offenders and 25 consisted of offenders who committed drugrelated crimes24 while the number of federal inmates incarcerated for violent offenses has consistently declined since 1980 the number of federal inmates incarcerated for drugrelated offense has consistently risen since 1980 see figure 3 correctional authorities had to accommodate to more frequent history of violence in the inmate population under their jurisdiction 24 see bureau of justice statistics bulletin prisoners

inmates per year 25 many scholars assess the effects of prison on an inmates ability to successfully reintegrate into society and the recidivism rate26 is widely used to measure such effects although there have been many studies on the recidivism rate27 and societal factors that may contribute to it there have not been many studies on the impact of inmates who participate in prison industries work on recidivism several studies conducted at the state level found that on average 47 of inmates recidivate within one year of being released from prison 28 some of the 25 testimony of harley g lappin

job were less likely to recidivate than nonparticipating counterparts as discussed below recent study compared the postrelease employment and recidivism rates of inmates that were employed in state prison industries30 those employed in traditional prison industries and those who were not employed at all while they were incarcerated31 the study found that inmates that participated in state prison industries were able to find postrelease employment quicker than inmates that were employed in traditional prison industries or those that were not employed at all in addition inmates that were employed in state prison industries retained their first job longer than inmates that were not employed in state prison industries state prison industries participants also earned higher wages than those inmates that did not participate inmates that were employed in state prison industries were also arrested convicted and incarcerated at slower rates than inmates who were employed in traditional prison industries or inmates who were not employed while they were incarcerated those proponents of fpi who contend that prison industries improve public safety by reducing crime cite studies that have examined the recidivism rate for inmates who worked in prison industry jobs prior to their release according to some scholars on average inmates who participate in fpi are 24 less likely to return to criminal behavior than those who do not and 14 more likely to be employed following thei r release from prison than their nonparticipating peers 32 opponents contend however that prison industries do not have an effect on whether inmates recidivate according to some critics other factor s such as the inmates readiness to return to society the communitys acceptance of the inmate the inmates participation in rehabilitation programs the inmates educational level the inmates work experience and job availability are all critical in determining if an inmate will successfully reintegrate into society33 29 ibid 30 under current federal law most prisoners are not allowed to work in jobs that produce goods that are sold in open markets however the prison industries

correctional industries programs are beneficial or costly to society for example proponents contend that it is more costly to run prison where the inmates are idle which could lead to disruptive behavior they assert that prison industries can lower expenditures on daytoday prison operations and decrease the likelihood of having to expend resources to thwart disturbances with respect to societal benefits proponents argue that prison labor leads to increased production of goods and services which provides an increase in the overall national economic output additionally some assert that prison industries must purchase raw materials and equipment from businesses thus creating and maintaining jobs in communities see discussion below opponents on the other hand contend that fpi levies extensive costs on society by taking jobs away from law abiding citizens they argue that industries such as furniture and textile continue to lose jobs which could be attributed in part to lost contracts to fpi opponents also assert that fpi does not reduce the cost to taxpayers of housing prisoners it costs on average 40 billion annually to incarcerate prisoners at the local state and federal levels and at least at the federal level none of the wages earned by inmates or fpis profits goes towards the actual cost of incarcerating inmates 34

several efforts to lessen the impact of its industries on small businesses by leveling the playing field with respect to its mandatory preference over the private sector efforts have also been taken to reduce fpis reliance on its mandatory source preference 35 for example in may 2003 unicors board of directors adopted resolution that raises the threshold for mandatory use of fpi from 25 to 2500 by raising the threshold fpis board of directors in essence eliminated fpis mandatory source clause for purchases up to 2500 and is now allowing federal agencies to go directly to the private sector for any purchase under 2500 on related matter fpis board of directors adopted resolution that now requires that fpi approve requests for waivers in all cases where the private sector provides lower cost prior to the boards decision regarding waivers fpi on average granted 87 of waivers that were requested 36 its board of directors also directed fpi to waive its mandatory source status for products where the fpis share of the federal market is in excess of 20 finally the board of 34 with respect to earnings made by federal inmates who work in fpi opponents contend that the amount of money they earn is low anywhere between 023 and 115 per hour and that under current unicor policy 50 of inmates wages must go towards court ordered obligations 35 previous effort to eliminate fpis mandatory source clause came during the clinton administration in 1993 when vice president gore recommended that the mandatory source provision be eliminated and that unicor be exempt from the far in order to better compete with the private sector in terms of delivery schedules and costs 36 crs analysis of fpi waiver data from fy1994 to the first six months in fy2004

of its value contributed by inmate labor37 in addition to fpis board of directors decisions federal agencies began to evaluate fpis contract performance according to testimony at senate hearing on fpi while this the evaluation of fpis contract performance did not change fpis mandatory preference status it was an important first step in helping fpi better monitor and improve its own performance which would assist fpi as they move toward being more competitive in the federal marketplace 38 g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g10g146g156g157g152g155g162g561 while unicor was originally authorized in 1934 through pl 73461 and executive order 6917 the current statutory authority for unicor was first codified in the 1948 revision of the crimes and criminal procedure statutes39 the only amendments to the statute were relatively recent provisions added in 1988 1990 1992 and 200240 the question of whether unicor is unfairly comp eting with private businesses particularly small businesses in the federal market has been and continues to be an issue of debate in 1989 congress considered proposal that would have provided the private sector with greater opportunity to compete for dod contracts in 2002 congress passed legislation that modified fpis mandatory source clause with respect to the dod 41 see discussion below the absence of legislative activity on this issue for over half century from 1934 to 1988 is notable the following developments in recent decades however have increased congressional interest in fpi the erosion of the nations manufacturing sector which has resulted in lower levels of employment in that sector the increase in the federal inmate population at the same time the federal government was downsizing resulting in reduction of unicors federal market and the need to develop more aggressive inmate management techniques in federal prisons as the profile of the federal offender population changed from nonviolent offenders to those convicted of violent crimes 37 some critics contend that fpi is purchasing products that have already been assembled which requires very little labor on the part of inmates 38

between competing interests that represent two social goodsthe employment and rehabilitation of offenders and the need to protect jobs of law abiding citizens at the center of the debate is fpis mandatory source status which many argue has deprived small businesses from competing effectively for government contracts opponents of fpis mandatory source clause assert that it prohibits full and open competition preventing federal agencies from purchasing products in free enterprise market they argue that fpis mandatory source clause has contributed to us workers being displaced from their jobs opponents also argue that fpis mandatory source cl ause allows the industry to set prices for its goods and services fpis mandatory source clause only requires fpi to deliver products at market price 49 which are often higher than the prices set by private companies for comparable products and services they also contend that the mandatory source clause does not require fpi to compete using the same quality and delivery standards as private businesses opponents of fpis mandatory source clause also argue that by law fpi regulates itself and is not subject to federal laws and in some cases state laws that restrict businesses operations with respect to occupational safety health and employment discrimination on related issue opponents contend that through the mandatory source clause fpi has expanded its authority with respect to its product and service lines without congressional approval proponents for fpi argue that the federal prison population has grown significantly see figure 2 and that fpi is necessary component in federal correctional facilities that prevents inmate idleness and contributes to the management of inmates they also contend that fpi provides inmates with job skills job readiness responsibility and accountability which are critical for successful reintegration into society proponents contend that by eliminating fpis mandatory source clause inmate idleness would set in which would undermine the safety and security of federal prisons proponents also contend that an unintended benefi t of fpi is that it keeps work in the united states that would otherwise go overseas they argue that in todays climate of outsourcing low skill lowwage jobs fpis mandatory source clause has become increasingly more important to keeping jobs in the united states proponents cred it fpi with creating jobs for private companies they argue that on average 74 of fpis revenues are poured back into the economy through the private sector with the purchasing of raw material and equipment from the private sector 50 48 fpi mandatory source clause only applies to products it manufactures in 1999 fpi announced plans to start selling services and while fpi is not mandatory source for services as it is for products it is preferential source and federal agencies may purchase services from fpi without going through competitive procurement process 49 fpis authorizing statute and

federal government purchases proponents cite study that was mandated by congress as further support that fpis impact on the private sector is negligible deloitte and touche an independent accounting firm was commissioned by congress in 1990 to conduct market analysis of unicor the study found that unicors sales amounted to only two percent of the federal market for the types of products and services it provided while the study found that unicors operations were concentrated in laborintensive industries it also found that unicors employees federal inmates accounted for only onequarter of the output of workers in the private sector the studys finding also found that unicors mandatory source advantage was offset by its competitive disadvantages 51

satisfied with the corporations business for example 1988 gao study that examined customer satisfaction with respect to fpis delivery performance found that customer agency officials showed wide variation in fpi delivery performance customer agency officials had mixed views on fpis delivery performance 52 another study conducted in 1985 by gao concluded that overall unicor customers appeared satisfied with its prices quality of the produc ts and services and waivers granted by unicor while gao found unicors customers generally satisfied with the corporation it also found that unicor does not complete required market checks to ensure compliance with the law that its prices not exceed market prices 53 opponents on the other hand turn to the study that was commissioned by congress in 1990 as evidence of their assertion of unicors poor cu stomer service record as discussed above deloitte and touche conducted market analysis of unicor and found among other things that unicors customer service and delivery ratings were below average in some of its product lines in comparison with the private sector in one particular industry where fpis largest customer is dod the apparel industry fpi had contract delinquency rate of 21 in the first six months of 2000 between 1992 and 1999 fpi had an average delinquency rate of 3154 however deloitte and touche did not report comparable

rehabilitating federal offenders and its role in providing products and services to federal agencies congress is faced with several questions in general should the mandatory source requirement be maintained stricken or softened how can unicor expand product and service lines to keep an increasing number of inmates productive without adversely affecting the private sector how can unicor expand its product line which is primarily in old economy sectors that have seen employment decl ines into new economy sectors without impacting private businesses do the benefits of rehabilitating offenders and providing them with useful skills balance with the economic hardship imposed on law abiding workers who may lose job opportunities because the employer cannot compete for federal contracts g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 since unicors establishment in 1934 business and labor interests have consistently argued that unicor undercuts the free enterprise system due to the mandatory source requirement corporations that wish to do business with the federal government are restricted in the areas in which they can submit bids opponents contend that citizens who have not committed crimes may lose their jobs due to their employers not being able to secure federal contracts furthermore fpi opponents contend that some of the industries in federal prisons such as the domestic apparel industry are shrinking thus leaving very little demand for inmates once they are released from prison these critics argue that inmates should be trained in growing industry that can afford to lose volume and is able to employ inmates upon their release from prison proponents contend that fpi has taken significant precautions to avoid harm to the private sector they argue that the majority of the sales generated from fpi go towards the purchase of raw materials from small businesses which generates business for those companies proponents also maintain that fpis enabling legislation and policy is such that it is limited to one marketthe federal government and within that market fpi can never sell more than certain percentage of merchandise in any product area 55 as further evidence that fpi does not harm private businesses proponents assert that unicors board of directors is constantly assessing its impact on the private sector for example on june 26 2003 the board of directors adopted resolutions that require fpi to limit the application of the mandatory source clause to products for which fpis share of the federal market is less than 20 56 55 see unicor

section 827 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 pl 110181 amended current law to require the secretary of defense to do market research to determine whether an fpi product is comparable to products av ailable from the private sector that best meet the needs of dod in terms of price quality and time of delivery before purchasing product that fpi produces in which fpi does not have significant market share if the secretary of defense determines that an fpi product is not comparable to private sector products in terms of price quality or time of delivery the secretary of defense must then use competitive procedures for the procurement of the product or make an individu purchase under multiple award contract in accordance with the competition requirements applicable to such contract the secretary of defense is required to consider timely offer from fpi when conducting competition for procurement of the product in cases where fpi is determined to have significant market share the secretary of defense can purchase product fr om fpi only if the secretary uses competitive procedures for procuring the product or makes an individual purchase under multiple award contract in accordance with the competition requirements applicable to such contract in conducting competition for procurement of product the secretary of defense is required to

federal procurement policy dete rmines that fpis share of the dod market for product is greater than 5 section 827 of pl 110181 requires the secretary of defense to publish list of product categories

policy act 41 usc 403 et seq to establish governmentwide requirement that government agencies use competitive procedures when procuring products that are author ized to be sold by fpi the bill would have required the head of an executive agency to notify fpi of the procurement at the same time as other possible bidders and to consider an offer from fpi in the same manner as other offers the bill would not have allowed an executive agency to purchase products or services from fpi unless it is determined that the product or service is comparable to products or services offered by the private

requirement for using competitive procurement procedures it would have allowed an executive agency to use non competitive procedures to enter into contract with fpi only if the attorney general determines within 30 days after fpi has been notified of the procurement opportunity that 1 fpi cannot reasonably expect fair consideration in competitive competition for the contract and 2 the award of the contract to fpi is necessary to maintain work opportunities not otherwise available at correctional facility and the loss of such work opportunities could create circumstances that would significantly endanger the safe and effective administration of the facility the product is only available from fpi the head of the executive agency determines that the product would be produced in whole or in significant part by prison labor outside the us the determination made by the attorney general must be supported by specific findings by the warden of the correctional facility with the fpi workshop that would perform the contract or supported by specific findings by fpi regarding the reasons why it does not expect to be selected for the contract if competitive process is used the bill would have ensured that contractors are not required to use fpi as subcontractor or supplier of products or provider of services the bill would have prohibited executive agencies from 1 including provisions in the solicitation for offers that requires contractor to use or specify products or services of fpi in the performance of the contract 2 inserting clauses in the ct that requires the contractor to use specific products or services offered by fpi in the performance of the contract or 3 modifying the contract to require the use of products or services of fpi in the performance of the contract the bill would have also required contractor that uses fpi as subcontractor or supplier in providing commercial product pursuant to contract to implement management procedures to prevent the introduction of an inmatemade product into the commercial market the bill would have prevented executive agencies from entering into contracts with fpi in cases where inmate workers would have access to 1 data that is classified or would become classified if merged with other data 2 any geographic data regarding the location of infrastructure providing communications or water or electrical power distribution 3 any geographic data regarding the location of pipelines for the distribution of natural gas bulk petroleum products or other commodities or other utilities or 4 any personal or financial information about any citizen including information relating to the persons real property without the prior consent of the individual the bill would have allowed any prison or jail work program that is providing services for sale in the commercial market through inmate labor on october 1 2007 to continue to provide commercial services until either 1 the expiration date specified in the contract or other agreement or 2 september 30 2011 if the work program is providing services directly to the commercial market the bill would have allowed pris on or jail work programs to continue to use inmate labor to provide services for the commercial market beyond the two dates specified above if the program has been certified pursuant to 18 usc 1761c1 and is in compliance with the requirements of the law and the accompanying regulations the bill would have allowed for profit business that has an agreement with fpi on the enactment date whereby federal inmates are providing
