considered number of issues relating to the andean counterdrug initiative the us assistance program to help colombia and its neighbors address drug trafficking and economic development issues1 these issues included ongoing concerns with the effectiveness of the program funding levels human rights and the future of the program the region has been viewed as particularly important because it produces virtually all of the worlds cocaine and increasing amounts of high quality heroin it is estimated that 90 of the cocaine coming to the united states originates in or passes through colombia moreover the stability of colombia and the region is threatened by colombias longstanding leftist guerrilla insurgency and rightist paramilitary groups which are believed to be largely funded by their participation in illegal narcotics production and trafficking the andean counterdrug initiative is the primary us program that supports plan colombia six year plan developed in 1999 by president andres pastrana 19982002 of colombia and continued by current president alvaro uribe the six year plan has ostensibly ended although the same level and types of activities are continuing the colombian government has reportedly developed followon plan plan colombia consolidation phase pccp that would include support for the demobilization of rightist paramilitary groups although aci is the primary program it is not the only one supporting counternarcotics and economic development in the andean region countries in the region also receive foreign military financing fmf and international military education and training imet the department of defense supports drug interdiction operations from its own counternarcotics account in addition the united states provides economic development aid from

counterdrug initiative was designed to provide assistance to seven countries in the broadly defined andean region bolivia brazil colombia ecuador panama peru and venezuela3 the region is important to us drug policy because it includes three major drug producing countries colombia bolivia and peru where virtually all the worlds cocaine and significant quantities of high quality heroin destined for the united states are produced us objectives for the aci program are to eliminate the cultivation and production of cocaine and opium build law enforcement infrastructure arrest and prosecute traffickers and seize their assets the region also includes two major oil producing countries venezuela and ecuador members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec which supply significant quantities of oil to the united states for the five traditional andean countries colombia venezuela ecuador peru and bolivia the andes mountain range that runs through south america poses geographical obstacles to intrastate and interstate integration even though the countries are linked together in the andean community economic integration pact us support for plan colombia began in 2000 when congress passed legislation providing 13 billion in interdiction and development assistance pl 106246 for colombia and six regional neighbors funding for aci from fy2000 through fy2007

and expanding judicial capabilities aci also funds the air bridge denial program that is currently operational in colombia and temporarily suspended in peru after an accidental shooting down of civilian aircraft carrying us missionaries in 2001 after the incident in which two americans died the program in both countries was suspended until enhanced safeguards were developed the program in colombia resumed in august 2003 the program supports an aircraft fleet pilot training and logistical and intelligence support the program tracks aircraft suspected of being involved in drug trafficking 3 panama and brazil are not considered andean countries but are included in aci because they each share borders with colombia bolivia is an andean country but does not share border with colombia crs3 and forces them to land for inspection if an aircraft is repeatedly unresponsive it may be shot down at the direction of the commander of the colombian air force the resumption of program in peru is still pending the development of safety enhancements fy2007 funding request the administration requested total of 7215 million for fy2007 for the andean counterdrug initiative
