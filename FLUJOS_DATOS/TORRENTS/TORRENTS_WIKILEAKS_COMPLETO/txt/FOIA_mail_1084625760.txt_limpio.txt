from tom wigley wigleycgducaredu to sarah raper sraperawibremerhavende sarah raper sraperueaacuk subject volc paper date sat 15 may 2004 085600 0600 cc ben santer santer1llnlgov caspar ammann ammannucaredu attachment volcdoc dear sarah ben and i have had some long discussions about this paper and i have made quite few changes as consequence most of these are minor but i realized that my statement that the peak cooling depended logarithmically on the sensitivity was potentially confusing for this to be the case one has to have relationship like tmax b lns which implies odd results for very low sensitivity instead i have fitted relationship of the form tmax sn which gives tmax 0 when s 0 i have fitted similar relationship to the decay time results and i have done the same for the lg98 results all this information has been added to the manuscript it helps in understanding the differences between us and lg98 i had hoped to send this off earlier this week ie before i go to buenos aires tomorrow but i never received the copyright form from you then i remembered that you were at that ipcc meeting in ireland so i have asked liz rothney to send the ms off next week as soon as she gets the copyright form from you so please fax this back 303 497 1333 as soon as possible best wishes tom
