resolution or amendment thereto or conference report thereon that includes one or more provisions affecting direct spending or revenues direct spending also referred to as mandatory spending generally is provided in substantive legislation under the jurisdiction of the legislative committees and is used principally to fund entitlement programssuch as social security medicare medicaid federal employee retirement and unemployment compensationand other programs of mandatory nature some income to the federal government such as medicare premiums is regarded as offsetting receipts while other income such as certain regulatory user fees is regarded as offsetting collections both are counted as negative spending rather than as revenue the congressional budget office cbo estimates that direct spending will total 1533 trillion for fy2008 reflecting 1708 trillion in direct spending and 175 billion in offsetting receipts and offsetting collections4 all other spending in the budget is referred to as discretionary spending which is provided in and controlled by the annual appropriations proc ess and is not subject to the paygo rule5 4 congressional budget office the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 2008 to 2017 january 2007 table 3 3 pp 5556 5 discretionary spending is provided in regular supplemental and continuing appropriations acts under the jurisdiction of the house and

the federal governments exercise of its sovereign powers to tax or otherwise compel payments and include such revenue sources as individual and corporate income taxes social insurance taxes excise taxes estate and gift taxes customs duties and gifts under house rule x revenue legislation generally falls under the jurisdiction of the ways and means committee in some cases other house committees exercise jurisdiction over legislation including transactions that are treated as revenues such as criminal fines under the jurisdiction of the house judiciary committee the revenue attributed to such cases however represents very small portion of total revenues from time to time provisions affecting direct spending or revenues are included in annual appropriations acts 6 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2001 pl 106554 december 21 2000 for example which was used to wrap up action at the end of the session enacted several measures by crossreference including the medicare medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 and the community renewal tax relief act of 2000 while discretionary spending is not within the purview of the paygo rule direct spending or revenue provisions included in an annual appropriations act could be subject to the rule some maintain however that conventional scoring prac tices may exempt such provisions in annual appropriations acts from coverage under the paygo rule 7 g24g146g152g149g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g20g158g149g142g561 violations of the rule occur when direct spending or revenue provisions in legislation have the effect of increasing the deficit or reducing the surplus two different time periods are used in evaluating the impact of the legislation 1 the sixyear period encompassing the current fiscal year and the ensuing five fiscal years and 2 the 11year period encompassing the current fiscal year and the ensuing 10 fiscal years violation of the paygo rule occurs if the deficit is increased or the surplus is reduced in either or both time periods the current fiscal year is the one in progress when regular session of congress begins the first of the ensuing fiscal years referred to as the budget year is the fiscal year that begins toward the end of the congressional session on october 1 the remaining fiscal years are referred to as outyears accordingly during the first session of the 110 th congress calendar year 2007 the current fiscal year is fy2007 and the budget year is fy2008 and the two time periods covered by the paygo rule during the session are fy2007fy2012 and fy2007fy2017 the rule focuses on the net effect of the provisions on the deficit or surplus thus measure could increase the deficit or reduce the surplus in some years and reduce the deficit or increase the surplus in others but violation would occur only if the net effect over the sixyear or 11 year time periods was an increase in the deficit or reduction in the surplus 6 see for example crs report 98846 revenue provisions in annual appropriations acts by robert keith 7 conventional scoring practices are linked to the baseline methodology under section 257 of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended house budget committee determinations of the budgetary impact of legislation for purposes of enforcing the paygo rule must use baseline estimates made by the congressional budget office consistent with section 257 in adopting and revising section 257 in reconciliation legislation in 1990 and 1997 respectively the conferees included scorekeeping rules in the joint explanatory statements accompanying the conference reports on those measures these scorekeeping rules are available online at the office of management and budget website at httpwwwwhitehousegovombcircularsa11current_yearapp_apdf as appendix in omb circular a11 scorekeeping rule 3 direct spending programs requires in part that changes in direct spending laws

periods used in the congressional budget process under the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 pl 93344 as amended 2 usc 621 et seq under the 1974 act the annual budget resolution must cover period of at least five ye ars beginning with the budget year in addition the budget resolution may include revisions in the current year in past years the house and senate have used budget resolution covering up to 10 years plus the current year

charged with providing estimates to the presiding officer of the impact of legislation on the deficit or surplus when point of order is raised under the paygo rule this feature of the rule is consistent with the manner in which estimates are made to enforce the various points of order under the 1974 congressional budget act in particular section 312a of the 1974 act requires that estimates of new budget authority outlays direct spending new entitlement authority and revenues be made by the house or senate budget committee as applicable estimates prepared by the house budget co mmittee under th paygo rule mu st be made relative to the most recent baseline estimates supplied by the congressional budget office cbo the cbo baseline as adjusted periodically typically underpins the annual budget resolution required by the 1974 act and the budget committee regularly uses cbo cost estimates on legislation for its scorekeeping activities the budget committee retains authority under the 1974 act however to modify the cbo baseline for purposes of developing and enforcing the budget resolution 8 on the other hand in the case of the house paygo rule presumably the budget committee would not be able to modify the cbo baseline or use alternatives to it with respect to budget committee estimates for pur poses of the paygo rule the committee is not restricted in their preparation consequently the committees estimate for measure under the paygo rule could coincide exactly with cbos cost estimate for the same measure or could deviate from it the baseline estimates supplied by cbo to the budget committee for the purpose of making determinations under the paygo rule must be co nsistent with section 257 of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 2 usc 907 section 257 sets forth methodology for preparing budget baseline the original purpose of the section was to set guidelines for the office of management and budget omb and cbo when preparing baseline estimates that would be used to determine whether certain statutory budget enforcement mechanisms had been violated thereby triggering sequestration the procedures for baseline construction set forth in section 257 represented for the most part common approach used by the two agencies for specific purpose but which omb and cbo also used to prepare baselines for the presidents budget and the congressional budget resolution respectively when the statutory budget enforcement mechanisms lapsed in 2002 cbo continued to be required to adhere to the procedures of section 257 though section 257 expired on september 30 2006 cbo has indicated that it views the section as the most recent statement of congressional policy in this area and will continue to follow its procedures 8 for

violation of the paygo rule legislation must be drafted so as to not increase the deficit or reduce the surplus over the two aforementioned time periods measure may contain increases in direct spending over one or both time periods so long as at least an equivalent amount of decreases in direct spending or increases in revenues is included similarly measure may contain decreases in revenues over one or both time periods so long as at least an equivalent amount of increases in revenues or decreases in direct spending is included the paygo rule applies in the same fashion when increases in direct spending and decreases in revenues are combined in the same measure as long as at least an equivalent amount of offsets is included direct spending decreases revenue increases or combination of the two then the rule is not violated the present jurisdictional alignments in the house may afford more flexibility to some committees than to others with respect to incorp orating offsets into their legislation to comply with the paygo rule the ways and means comm ittee with its jurisdiction over revenues generally and its sizeable direct spending jurisdiction has considerable experience in including offsets in its legislation to comply with various budget enforcement mechanisms and may have more flexibility in this regard than any other committee other house committees may include as offsets in their legislation cuts in direct spending that entail reductions in program benefits restrictions on program eligibility the curtailment of benefit increases and the like but they also may propose offsets in the form of new or increased offsetting receipts or offsetting collections or in some instances transactions treated as revenues 9 offsets used to secure initial passage of legislation in the house may be used again until they are enacted at which time they are longer available due to certain requirements in section 257 of the 1985 act pertaining to baseline construction some direct spending and revenue provisions are not subject to the paygo rule section 257 for example requires that direct spending programs with outlays greater than 50 million year and excise taxes dedicated to trust fund are assumed to continue in the baseline even if they are scheduled to expire consequently legislation merely extending such direct spending programs or excise taxes at baseline levels is not scored as having budgetary impact the paygo rule applies on measurebymeasure basis without reference to action on other measures affecting direct spending or revenues in determining compliance with the rule each measure is assessed solely on its own budgetary impact irrespective of prior action on direct spending and revenue measures or assumptions made in the budget resolution as consequence the rule does not allow savings from prior measures to cover the costs of pending measure or for the costs of measure to be accommodated if assumed in the budget resolution in this regard the houses paygo rule differs from the lapsed statutory paygo requirement and the current senate paygo rule the statutory paygo requirement under the 1985 balanced budget act as amended which affected legisl ation enacted during calendar year 1991 through the end of fy2002 assessed the net effect of all direct spending and revenue legislation enacted 9 for listing of mandatory and discre

budgetary impact of each measure was recorded by the director of om b on rolling multiyear paygo scorecar d direct spending or revenue legislation that achieved savings therefore could offset the impact of other legislation that entailed costs in related vein the senates paygo rule in recent years has excepted increases in direct spending and decreases in revenues that are assumed in the budget resolution enforcement of the rule relies on the monitoring of paygo scorecard maintained by the senate budget committee from time to time the leadership may arrange for the consideration of separate but related measures to be paired so that policy and political objectives are not undermined by procedural obstacles in some instances for example special rule may make one measure in order as an amendment to the other possibly under selfexecuting feature of the rule so that it occurs automatically upon adoption of the rule while such an approach lies outside of the scope of the paygo rule it could be used to pair together measure that otherwise would violate the rule with another providing sufficient offsets so that th end result is the same as if the rule had been adhered to

raising the point of order while rule xxi permits points of order in two instances to be raised at any time during pendency of that measure for amendment points of order under the paygo rule must be raised in timely manner ie before consideration of the legislation has begun 10 legislation potentially in viola tion of the paygo rule may be protected from point of order primarily by two techniques first the house commonly uses special rules in the form of simple house resolution reported by the house rules committee to establish procedures for the consideration of particular measure among other things the procedures under the special rule may waive the application of points of order including point of order under the paygo rule most major budgetary legislation is considered under the terms of special rule which requires only simple majority for approval second the house often considers measures under the suspension procedure in which all house rules are waived in order to be passed under the suspension procedure measure must secure twothirds vote the procedure is not usually employed for the consideration of measures with any significant budgetary impact 11 10 the expanded time period under rule xxi during which points of order may be raised applies in the case of appropriations included in legislative measures clause 4 and tax or tariff provisions included in measures reported by committee without such jurisdiction clause 5a in the cas of general appropriations bills that have been reported clause 1 of rule xxi automatically reserves points of order 11 for

the houses paygo rule is one of many different rules effective in the house that enforce budgetary levels the other rules that focus on the enforcement of budget levels are found principally in titles iii and iv of the 1974 congressional budget act and in procedural provisions included in annual budget resolutions12 the paygo rule establishes test that must be met on its own terms compliance with other enforcement provisions does not eliminate or suspend the requirement that legislation comply with the paygo rule the paygo rule may complement the operation of other enforcement mechanisms especially if the annual budget resolution is oriented toward reducing the deficit or not increasing it conversely the paygo rule could complicate the consideration of legislation assumed in the budget resolution especially if direct spending increases or revenue decreases are prominent elements of the budget plan the different orientations of budget enforcement schemes are primary cause of potential conflicts in the implementation of the rule the house paygo rule like paygo procedures generally focuses on changes in direct spending and revenues taken together the 1974 congressional budget act on the other hand requires the house and senate to enforce direct spending changes largely under one set of procedures the spending allocation process under section 302a of the act and revenue changes under another the revenue floor under section 311 while changes in revenue could offset change s in direct spending and vice versa under the paygo rule such offsets generally would not be allowed in the congressional budget process an increase in direct spending beyond what could be accommodated by committees section 302a allocation of spending would violate the 1974 act unless offset by at least an equivalent amount of direct spending decreases in the committees legislation generally offsets in the form of revenue increases would not remedy the direct spending violation in some instances the house and senate have incorporated deficitneutral reserve funds into budget resolutions to allow the use of offsets in ways that otherwise would not be allowed under the 1974 act 13

january 5 2007 when house action on hres 6 was completed the rule does not contain an expiration date but as part of the standing rules of the house it must be renewed at the beginning of new congress to remain in effect 12 titles iii and iv were enacted as an exercise of the rulemaking powers of the house and senate accordingly the house and senate effectively may change these rules at any time even without amending the 1974 act an elastic clause in section 301 of the 1974 act authorizes the house and senate to include within constraints procedural provisions in annual budget resolutions 13
