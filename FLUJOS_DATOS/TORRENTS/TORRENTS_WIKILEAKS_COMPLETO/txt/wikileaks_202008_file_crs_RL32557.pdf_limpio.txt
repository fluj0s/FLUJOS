community however are highly critical of this linkage and have urged that government support of foreign language training be limited to title vi programs7 the federal government has extensive experience in training civil servants and military personnel in foreign languages the defense department operates the defense language institute in monterey california and the national

area instruction in certain rare foreign languages is purchased from commercial agencies when only few students are involved the marine corps recently contracted with berlitz for mont hlong courses in ar abic for marines route to iraq these institutions are know n for the high quality of their instruction and dedication to supporting their parent agencies nevertheless it is widely recognized that language training is an expensive proposition both in terms of the costs of in struction and administration and in the investment of the time of students on the government payroll bringing students to limited working proficiency in foreign languages requires over year of study achieving professional leve l would take considerably longer period that is considered excessive in terms of most ssignments according to the government accountability office gao the army spe nds some 27000 to train cryptologic technician to reach level 2 in one of the more difficult languages but more than 45 of these linguists leave the service after completing their initial tour of duty gao has also reported that in fy2001 the army spent 273 million on foreign language training while in fy2000 th state department spent 231 million on language training and 13 milli on on contract translators nd interpreters in fy2001 the fbi had access to some 463 contract tran slators and interpreters and used them for an average of 16 hours per week at an annual cost of 15 million total dod costs for its foreign language requi rements reportedly approach 250 million annually although costs of language training for the cia and nsa are not publicly available it is likely that they are sizable in recent years attention has been gi ven to the possibility of hiring native speakers in order to avoid long periods of instruction in many cases however personnel with responsib ilities for assignments requiring foreign langua ge skills must have security clearances that in turn require background investigations gao noted that according to fbi and state depa rtment officials conducting background investigations on native speakers can be particularly difficult because many of these individuals have lived abroa d in some cases for years8 in addition language capabilities once acqui red have to be maintained or they will gradually be forgotten the defense department and the central intelligence agency provide special incentive pay for their personnel to maintain foreign language proficiency the cia also has corporate language hiring bonus program for new employees with proficiency in language that is critically needed during the cold war extensive requirements for linguists existed but the principal countries of interest were largely finite and static few would have predicted the number of situ ations throughout the world in which us military would become involved after th early 1990s as result in the past d ecade increasing attention has been given to the employment of contract personnel to greater reliance on military reservists with language capabilities and to consideration of the establishment of civilian linguist reserve corps in response to provision in the fy2003 intelligence

providing timely and accurate translations of foreign intelligence for ll elements of the intelligence communitysecretary of defense9 it concluded that such corps is feasible and suggested pilot study members of such reserve co mponent would be called up in times of emergency to work in either domestic or overseas roles serving as interpreters and translators and perhaps as analysts and area specialists the intelligence authorization act fo r fy2003 pl 107306 also mandated the creation of national virtual transla tion center the ce nter established in february 2003 is intended to serve as cl earinghouse for using technology to permit translations to be made by linguists on parttime asneeded basis issues and questions before the congress to large extent finding languagequa lified personnel for government agencies is responsibility of the executive branch but congress must ppropriate funds for agency efforts and it conducts oversight of programs in additi on federal funding for foreign language instruction in civilian ins titutions originates in legislation at the present time number of issues in regard to foreign language capabilities appear to be receiving congressional attention general questions how important is the inadequate number of foreign linguists to the overall nationa l securitycounterterrorism effo rt what is the relative importance of shortages of tr anslators vs shortages of fficials who have speaking knowledge of foreign languages to what extent can the shortage of linguists be addressed by making better use of temporary employ ees or of permanent employees with nonlanguage rela ted positions being temporarily assigned to languagerelated functions to what extent can this pr oblem be addressed w ith foreign language training for newly hired and midcareer pe rsonnel to what extent can the problem be alleviated by greater reliance on us citizensresidents who are native speakers of the language needed to what extent will the national virtual translation center10 address the problems are the st eps currently being taken to obtain personnel with knowledge of less wi dely spoken languages effective federal language schools the fense language institute the national cryptologic school the foreign service institute these schools are costly to operate nd students receive full pay and allowances while in attendance although credited with excellent instruction they do not prepare ca ndidates with genuine fluency over the course of instruction questions to what extent could language instruction be contracted out to non governmental institutions is there overlap among the language programs of federal schools would it be possible to centralize elementary levels of study and then send students to separate c ourses for training appr opriate to different disciplines is thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32557crs15 problem of achieving higher levels of proficie ncy one of need for harder work on the part of the students the techniques be ing employed by teachers or the inherent difficulties involved in mast ering foreign languages employment of native speakers recruitment of native speakers to government positions saves major costs involved in foreign language instruction and provides personne l who have much better skills also using native speakers under temporary contract provides qualified linguists for the periods necessary however background checks necessary for security clearances are sometimes difficult to conduct questions what have been the results of efforts to hire native speakers for permanent positions have costs in unde rtaking background investigations been significantly higher than for other applicants are their skills significantly higher than those of nonnative speakers are significant number likely to pursue careers in federal service title vi and the dominance of romance language learning at us institutions of higher education questions should the federal government have role in encouraging the academic community to undertake foreign nguage programs th at apparently have little interest among educat ors and students if ex panded funding were made available to language programs across the board what are the chances that graduates would seek employment with federal agen cies how could academic institutions be encouraged to emphasize languages and area studies likely to be of future national security interest the nsep questions arise about funding mechanisms and need for expansion some in the academic community oppose links between nsep and the defense department and intelligence agencies questions if funding for nsep scholarsh ips and fellowships was expanded significantly would it encourage greater interest in foreign languages and government careers should nsep funds be ppropriated annually is there need to designate additional flagship institutions do the ties between nsep and dod and the intelligence community hinder the reputation of the program within the academic community and hinder the programs effectiveness proficiency pay for government employees including military personnel maintaining foreign lang uage proficiency considered useful but costly in
