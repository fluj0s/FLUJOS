updated as events warrant 1 washington trade daily november 14 2003 p5 crs2 why usaustralia free trade agreement the usafta is one among number of bilateral and regional free trade agreements the bush administration has negotiated in the last few years it has negotiated and entered into free trade agreements with jordan singapore and chile along with the usafta the bush administration completed negotiations and has signed the central american free trade agreement cafta with five countries in the region an agreement with the dominican republic and an agreement with morocco it has also launched or intends to launch fta negotiations with even more trading partners in various regions of the world all as part of its strategy of competitive liberalization that strategy aims to use greater access to us markets as incentive for trading partners to lower their trade and investment barriers us and australian political leaders have also viewed the usafta as mechanism to deepen economic ties beyond the bilateral relationship as they pursue similar goals in the doha development agenda round of the world trade organization wto2 it has also been argued that since the events of september 11 2001 the bush administration has employed trade policy in general and ftas in particular to reward those countries that have allied themselves with the united states in the war on terrorism and the war in iraq australia fits that model3 the usafta builds on the ussingapore fta in establishing an institutionalized us economic presence in the asiapacific region overview of usaustralian trade and investment relations the united states and australia have strong bilateral economic relationship the two countries share similar economic and trade goals both are strong supporters of achieving significant trade liberalization in agriculture and services in the current round of multilateral negotiations in the wto while at the same time both are pursuing market access through regional and bilateral free trade agreements the economic relationship is also built upon increasing flows of trade in goods and services and of capital in various forms of investment in wide range of sectors both countries anticipate that the usafta will facilitate trade and investment flows trade according to us data australia was the 14th largest destination for us exports of goods 131

to form an fta while not completely dismissing the idea the bush administration at first appeared to give it lower priority than other trade matters but on november 13 2002 ustr zoellick notified congressional leaders that the administration would begin negotiations with australia the negotiations proved unexpectedly difficult president bush and australian prime minister howard had committed to completing the negotiations by the end of 2003 but differences over agriculture and other sensitive issues caused the deadline to slip the first of five rounds of negotiations took place in canberra march 1721 2003 the fifth last and longest round took place in washington december 1 2003 and february 8 2004 although the negotiations took longer than expected they were completed in less time than the fta negotiations with chile and singapore the usafta negotiations over manufactured goods proceeded smoothly tariffs on bilateral trade in most manufactured goods are already low the average applied australian mostfavorednation mfn tariff is 43 and its average tariff on agriculture imports is 128 the average applied us mfn tariff is 51 and its average mfn tariff on agricultural products is 1009 issues pertaining to trade in agricultural goods proved the most difficult and forced the negotiations into overtime in the end both countries were determined to complete the agreement to do so each side acceded to very sensitive areas of the other in order to bring the negotiations to conclusion this meant that australia acceded to the us objective not to liberalize trade in sugar and to only gradual opening of dairy and beef it meant that the united states acceded to australias position on preserving its pharmaceutical subsidy program and on maintaining monopolies for the export of wheat barley and rice the united states also largely conceded to australia the right to restrict foreign content of television programs and advertising and to preserve its sanitary and phytosanitary regime the negotiations resulted in an agreement to substantially free manufactured goods trade substantially from duties and to eliminate or reduce tariffs and other barriers on most agricultural products with the notable exception of sugar the agreement commits both countries to remove or at least reduce barriers to trade in services and to foreign investment 7 continued

the agreement also commits the two countries to ensure mutual access in foreign investment and government procurement and to protect the rights of intellectual property owners in each others territory more detailed discussion of the provisions follows market access for goods chapter 2 of the usafta covers bilateral trade in goods one the least controversial areas during the negotiations the usafta will result in immediate dutyfree treatment for 99 of us exports of manufactured goods to australia when the agreement goes into effect among the remaining 1 of us exports australian duties will still be applied to such items as textiles and wearing apparel and some footwear but these duties will be reduced and eventually eliminated over time at the same time 97 of australian exports of manufactured goods to the united states will be dutyfree when the agreement goes into effect australian duties still in place on the date the agreement goes into effect will be phased out over four eight or ten years tariffs and other restrictions on imports of textiles and apparel and some agricultural products will be eliminated under separate schedules discussed below by 2015 tariffs on all manufactured goods trade between the united states and australia will be eliminated10 during the negotiations the united states highlighted the importance of obtaining immediate dutyfree access for us exports of autos and auto parts chemicals plastics and soda ash construction equipment electrical equipment and appliances fabricated metal products furniture and fixtures information technology products medical and scientific equipment nonelectrical machinery and paper and wood products 11 australia highlighted the importance to its exporters of immediate dutyfree access for its exports of autos metals minerals seafood paper and chemicals of particular importance to australia was the immediate removal of the 25 tariff on australian exports to the united states of light commercial vehicles pickup trucks and the 35 tariff on canned tuna12 the usafta permits the dutyfree entry of goods from one party to the agreement into the other for repair for use as commercial samples or in the performance of business activities the agreement will also establish committee on trade in goods consisting of government representatives from australia and the 10 australian department of foreign

that arise on tariffs nontariff barriers rules of origin and customs administration13 exceptions the usafta annex2a contains exceptions to the general national treatment principle notably the united states is allowed to maintain restrictions on the export of logs and on imports of foreignmade vessels under the jones act14 australia will be allowed to retain controls on exports of certain forestry products and restrictions on imports of secondhand cars and to retain the singledesk arrangements for marketing wheat barley rice and sugar and the export arrangements for horticulture and livestock see section below on agriculture products for more details on their treatment under the usafta rules of origin rules of origin chapter 5 are used to determine which goods are originating goods and therefore should qualify for the preferential treatment under the agreement such products are ones that are 1 wholly obtained raw materials or produced in either australia or the united states 2 are produced in either country from materials originating from either country or 3 are produced partially from materials that have originated from nonfta country but pass rules of origin test in general that test is that the final product must have involved sufficient processing in fta country as to be in different tariff classification from the material from the nonftacountry the tariff classification changes that must take place to qualify are productspecific and are listed in annex 5a of the agreement for some products such as automotive products an additional test that will substitute for or help support the tariffclassification test is the regional value content test according to that test the sum of the value of the inputs from either australia or the united states must equal or exceed certain percentage the percentage depending on the product of the total value of the final product special rules of origin criteria apply to textiles and apparel and are discussed below safeguards the usafta chapter 9 provides for safeguard measures for trade in goods between the united states and australia in addition to these safeguard measures the agreement provides for special safeguard measures for textiles and apparel and for specific agricultural products the special measures are discussed in sections devoted to those products15 13 australiaunited states free trade agreement guide to the agreement march 2004 p 9 14 ibid 15 the safeguard measures contained in the usafta are in addition to the safeguard measures sometimes called section 201 referring to section 201 of the trade act of 1974 as amended under section 201 however any safeguard measure must be applied to continued crs8 the fta provides that during the transition period the period during which duties on product are being eliminated an importing country may suspend the elimination of duties or increase the duties on the import of product from the other trading partner if as result of the reduction in duties imports increase in absolute terms or relative to domestic production as to be substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry producing like product16 the increased duty that may be applied will not exceed the lesser of the most favorednation mfn duty rate in effect at the time the safeguard measure was taken or the mfn duty rate in effect preceding the date the usafta entered into force the trade remedy can be applied only after an investigation has been conducted to determine cause and injury the trade remedy measures can only be applied for two years but may be extended for another two years if determination is made that conditions causing serious injury still exist furthermore while safeguards measure is in place the country applying the measure must compensate the other country by making concessions in other sectors that are equivalent in value to the additional duties these measures can be used by either partner on both manufactured and agricultural goods pharmaceuticals the australian pharmaceutical benefits scheme pbs is 55yearold program under which the australian government subsidizes the costs for pharmaceuticals to be eligible for the subsidy the drug must be approved beforehand and appear on list of subsidyeligible drugs if there are two or more brands of the same drug the pbs will subsidize the cheapest brand the united states has asserted that the methods that the australian government uses to determine which brands to subsidize do not take into account the benefits of newer innovative drugs many of which are produced in the united states and that cost more than older drugs these pharmaceuticals are therefore at disadvantage in the australian market during the negotiations the united states pressed australian negotiators to make the procedures for selecting eligible drugs more transparent and to make the benefits of innovative drugs factor in determining which brands will be subsidized under annex2c australia agreed to establish procedures for reviewing product listings and to make more transparent the process by which the amount of reimbursement for pharmaceuticals is set the united states and australia also agreed to establish medicines working group consisting of federal officials from each country who are responsible for federal healthcare programs these officials will work together on emerging health policy issues including the importance of innovative drugs the two countries also agreed to strengthen the cooperation 15 continued imports of the like product from all countries whereas the usafta safeguard measure is applied only to trade between australia or the united states 16 substantial cause is defined as cause which is important and not less than any other cause serious injury is defined as significant overall impairment in the position of domestic industry threat of serious injury is defined as serous injury that on the basis of facts and not merely on allegations conjecture or remote possibility is clearly imminent crs9 between the us food and drug administration and the australian therapeutic goods administration to make innovative drugs available more quickly to nationals in each country in an exchange of letters accompanying the agreement australia agreed to provide us pharmaceutical manufacturers the opportunities to consult with officials of the australian pharmaceuticals benefits advisory committee pbac prior to submitting an application to that body for pbs approval for subsidy to respond to reports and evaluations prepared for technical subcommittees to the pbac regarding the consideration of their products to appear before hearing of the pbac regarding the application and to obtain reasons for the final determination of the pbac in addition australia agreed to expedite the process as much as possible and to provide opportunities for the reimbursement amount to be readjusted next to agriculture the pbs proved to be the most controversial issue in the negotiations the issue exposed fundamental differences between the us and australian healthcare systems and how each treats costs of pharmaceuticals borne by their citizens it is an issue that may be more widely debated when the congress considers the agreement during congressional consideration of the agreement and the implementing legislation some members of congress expressed concerns about the impact of chapter 1794 of the agreement and its potential impact on the reimportation of usbrand pharmaceuticals into the united states chapter 17 pertains to intellectual property rights protection that provision reads as follows each party shall provide that the exclusive right of the patent owner to prevent importation of patented product or product that results from patented process without the consent of the patent owner shall not be limited by the sale or distribution of that product outside its territory at least where the patentee has placed restrictions on importation by contract or other means the concerns centered on whether this provision would prohibit the us congress if it so chooses to pass law that would permit the reimportation of us patented drugs into the united states ustr zoellick argued that the provision provides new legal rights to us patent holders and that such rights as stated the provision are already in us law in addition he argued that trade agreement can prevent the us congress from changing us law by passing another law17 nevertheless the issue may arise as the united states negotiates ftas with other trading partners and implementing legislation for the agreements are considered by the congress agricultural products agricultural issues were the greatest challenge in the bilateral fta negotiations as many trade experts had anticipated agricultural products accounted for only 17 ustr robert zoellick letter to chairman of the ways and means committee honorable william thomas july 13 2004 crs10 47 of us exports to australia but for 345 of us imports from australia in 2003 as major agricultural exporting countries the united states and australia are for the most part allies in multilateral negotiations on agricultural issues they share similar positions in the difficult negotiations now taking place in the doha development agenda dda round in the world trade organization wto to reduce or eliminate barriers to trade in agricultural goods however the movement towards tighter economic relationship under an fta exposed important sensitivities that threatened to undermine the entire negotiations under the usafta chapter 3 and related annexes us tariffs on around 20 of the agriculture imports from australia will be eliminated immediately the united states will also phase out the tariffrate quota trq on beef during the tariff elimination period to begin when us exports of beef reach their 2003 level to allow us beef producers to recover from the effects of the mad cow incident or three years after the agreement goes into effect whichever is earlier18 us tariffs on beef imports within the quota will be eliminated immediately and tariffs on imports above the quota will be eliminated in stages over the 18year period the us trq on dairy product imports from australia will be increased and phased out over an 18year period under the usafta tariffs on withinquota imports will be eliminated immediately while the tariffs on abovequota imports will remain unchanged the us dairy quotas will apply to australian exports of such products as certain cheeses butter milk cream icecream products and whole milk powder us quotas on imports of australian peanuts tobacco cotton and avocados will also be eliminated over time us duties on australian wines will be eliminated over an 11year period among the most controversial issues was the us tariffrate quota on sugar the united states refused to change the sugar quota and it remains unchanged under the usafta australian exports of wheat rice barley and sugar are monopolies of state sanctioned commodity boards or single desk arrangements during the negotiations the united states asserted that these boards distort trade and targeted them as negotiating objectives during the fta negotiations as result of the negotiations however australia will maintain the singledesk arrangements but agreed to work with the united states in the wto to eliminate restrictions on the right of private entities who are apart from the commodity boards to export agricultural products the usafta will provide for special safeguard provisions for us imports of australian beef and horticulture products eg tomatoes pears apricots onions and peaches quantitybased trigger mechanism will apply to imports of australian beef during the first 18years of the agreement and pricebased trigger mechanism will apply beginning in year 19 of the agreement pricetrigger 18 under trqs imports within quota enter at one tariff rate but imports above the quota enter at much higher sometime prohibitive tariff rate crs11 mechanism will apply during the tariff elimination transition period for us imports of australian horticulture products under the usafta australian tariffs on imports of us agricultural products will be eliminated immediately these provisions are expected to benefit particularly us exports of processed foods soybeans fresh and processed fruits vegetables and nuts and exports of alcoholic beverages19 the us government asserted that australias sanitary and phytosanitary sps measures are excessively restrictive the restrictions affect us exports of florida citrus stone fruit chicken pork apples pears and corn20 australia asserted that these requirements are necessary to protect the health of its citizens and to protect australian produce from disease the two partners agreed to compromise under the usafta whereby they will establish mechanisms to resolve bilateral disputes over sps regulations and to develop sciencebased measures to protect health and safety that are traderelated textiles and apparel textiles and apparel represent very small portion of usaustralian bilateral trade in 2003 us exports of these products totaled 1216 million or just under 1 of total us exports to australia and us imports of textiles and apparel totaled 2536 million or about 4 of total us imports from australia the usafta chapter 4 and annex4a provides for special safeguard measures to dampen the adverse effects of surges in textile and apparel imports in usaustralian bilateral trade if either australia or the united states determines that imports of textile or apparel products from the other are increasing at such rate as to be substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry then it can apply trade remedy in the form of higher duty to allow the domestic industry to adjust the safeguard measures are similar to but different from the general safeguard measures described earlier in the usafta one important difference is that compensation to the country that is the target of the safeguard measure must be in the form of concessions on textile and apparel unless the two countries otherwise agree the usafta contains rules of origin that specifically apply to textiles and apparel the agreement applies the yarn forward principle that is fabrics produced for export must be formed entirely from yarns formed in either the united states or australia and apparel for export must be produced entirely from fabrics produced in either australia or the united states from yarns entirely formed in either of the two countries in addition the apparel must be cut or knit to shape or assembled in either australia or the united states there are number of exceptions to this principle that are productspecific and outlined in annex 4a of the agreement 19 for more detailed information on agricultural trade under the usafta see agriculture in the australiaus free trade agreement agriculture policy electronic briefing book ebagr78 20 ustr p12 crs12 in addition to the safeguard measures and rules of origin the usafta provides that tariffs on textiles and apparel are to be eliminated more gradually than tariffs on other manufactured goods for example whereas 100 of us imports of non textile and apparel manufactured goods from australia will become dutyfree immediately when the usafta enters into force only 7 of us imports of textiles and apparel from australia will become dutyfree immediately around 86 of those imports will not become entirely dutyfree until the agreement has been in force 10 years21 trade in nonfinancial services the usafta chapter 10 covers the sale production distribution marketing and delivery of services and also payment for services the obligations under the usafta mirror closely and in some cases exceed those that the united states and australia have undertaken in the wto under the general agreement on trade in services gats the usafta covers service transactions delivered in any of three ways from the territory of one ftacountry to the territory of the other in the territory of one ftacountry by national of that country to national from the second fta country and by national of one ftacountry in the territory of the second the agreement requires the united states and australia to accord nondiscriminatory treatment both mostfavored nation treatment and national treatment to services originating in each others territory the agreement prohibits the australian and us governments from imposing restrictions on the number of service providers the total value of service transactions that can be provided the total number of service operations or the total quantity of services output or the total number of natural persons that can be employed in services operation in addition the two governments could not require service provider from the other ftacountry to have presence in its territory in order to provide services there are exceptions to this coverage that are listed in chapter 10 as is the case with the gats the usafta allows the united states and australia to make exceptions nonconforming measures to the national treatment mfn market access and local presence restrictions the exceptions apply to any existing nonconforming measure at the federal or regional levels of government and that are specifically identified in either annex i or annex ii of the agreement and to all nonconforming measures maintained by local governments the nonconforming measures listed in annex i cannot be made more restrictive and if made less restrictive are then bound those listed in annex ii can be made more restrictive and are not bound if made less restrictive the usafta adopts the negative list approach to the coverage of services that is the countries are obligated to cover all service sectors except those specifically listed in the annexes in contrast under the gats service sector is covered unless specifically identified the usaftas coverage is therefore more comprehensive in terms of usaustralian bilateral services trade 21 department of commerce calculations crs13 the australian government has used the nonconforming measures provisions to preserve local content requirements in audiovisual and broadcasting media the australian government restricts foreign content of programming and advertising on overtheair television broadcasting between 600pm and 12 midnight 55 of the programming must be of australian origin and 80 of the advertising must be australian advertisements the united states wanted the restrictions changed to permit more foreign access to these markets australia insisted that the restrictions are necessary to preserve australian culture and the exception is listed in annex i in addition the australian government has reserved the right as listed in annex ii to impose new requirements regarding multichannel broadcast television programs expenditure requirements for subscription television tax preferences for investment in australian film and television productions among others annex ii also contains an australian exception to allow it to maintain existing coproduction arrangements and to create new ones the united states listed excepted nonconforming measures in its schedules to annex i and annex ii among the most notable was the preservation of many restrictions under section 27 of the merchant marine act of 1920 the jones act among other things that law limits shipping within the united states to vessels owned built and operated by us citizens and registered in the united states the usafta obligates the united states and australia in other aspects of their bilateral trade in services it requires that any procedures that either government employs to authorize the supply of services be transparent that an application for authorization must be handled in timely manner that the applicant be informed of the status of the application and that the eligibility requirements for authorization not constitute unnecessary barriers to trade in services furthermore the fta requires that the regulations that govern trade in services be developed and applied in transparent manner it also addresses the issue of governmentimposed qualifying requirements education experience certification licenses etc for providers of professional services obtained in one country and recognized as valid by the other also the united states and australia agree to at least maintain the current level of market openness in providing express delivery services and to ensure that revenues earned from monopoly postal service for example australia post are not used to provide competitive advantage to its express delivery service financial services usafta chapter 13 specifically addresses bilateral trade and investment in financial services the agreement defines financial services to include all insurance and insurancerelated services and all banking and other financial services as well as services incidental or auxiliary to service of financial nature the obligations that the united states and australia agree to undertake closely mirror those found in nonfinancial services national treatment mfn treatment prohibition on limits to the number of financial institutions the total value of service transactions the quantity of output or the number of natural persons that may be employed in particular firm prohibition on requirements that senior management or board of directors consists of individuals of particular nationality prohibition on requirement that the board of directors consist of majority of nationals from the crs14 country where the financial provider is located and requirement for regulatory transparency as in the case with nonfinancial services the agreement allows each fta country to make exceptions to the coverage of the agreement these exceptions are listed in annex iii existing nonconforming measures that cannot be made more restrictive and annex iv sectors and subsectors on which existing nonconforming measures can be maintained or tightened and on which new nonconforming measures can be applied the united states and australia undertake obligations that are specific to financial services for example the agreement allows financial service providers from one partner country to sell new financial service in the others market without additional legislation if local financial service providers are allowed to provide the same service however the provider of the new service could be required to obtain authorization and to provide the new service in particular institutional or juridical form the usafta permits an ftacountry to recognize as valid the prudential measures of nonfta countries without automatically recognizing the validity of the other partners measures but it must give the other ftapartner the opportunity to show why its prudential measures should be so recognized the usafta also requires the establishment of financial services committee to consider ways that the financial services sectors of the two countries can be more closely integrated telecommunications under the usafta chapter 12 the united states and australia agree to ensure that enterprises from each others territory have nondiscriminatory access to public telecommunications services the chapter specifically does not apply to broadcast or cable distribution of radio or television programming except that enterprises operating broadcast stations and cable systems have access to telecommunications services for example both countries will ensure that suppliers of telecommunications services who dominate the market do not engage in anti competitive practices they also ensure that public telecommunications suppliers provide enterprises based in the other ftapartner with interconnection number portability dialing parity and access to underwater cable systems government procurement the usafta chapter 15 opens up the vast markets of procurement in goods and services by the two governments to suppliers from other country this chapter is closely modeled on the wto government procurement agreement gpa so called plurilateral agreement that the united states has signed but australia has not signed22 the wto agreement requires its signatories to allow goods and services providers from the other signatory countries to bid on contracts valued above 22 wto plurilateral agreement is an agreement that wto members are not obligated to sign in order to be wto member in good standing not signing the agreement means that country is not bound by its provisions but also means that the country does not benefit from those provisions crs15 threshold level on an equal nondiscriminating basis with domestic suppliers thus waiving any buy national requirements for example the us buy america act gives preferential treatment to us domestic suppliers visavis nongpa signatories the usafta will give australian suppliers of goods and services equal status in the us government procurement market with providers from the other countries that have signed the gpa or from other countries with which the united states has similar agreements to ensure nondiscrimination both the gpa and the usafta require participating governments to follow rules that call for transparency and timeliness in tendering bids such as open tendering and publication of tender opportunities coverage of both agreements is limited to those federal and regional entities that the participating countries have listed in annexes and to contracts that are above threshold value foreign investment the usafta chapter 11 covers foreign investment activities on the territories of the two countries by nationals from the other partnercountry the agreement applies to all forms of investment including direct investments controlling investments in enterprises plant and equipment real estate etc and portfolio investments stocks bonds intellectual property rights etc the agreement will require the united states and australia to afford nondiscriminatory treatment mostfavorednation and national treatment to the establishment acquisition expansion management conduct operation and sale or other disposition of an investment the agreement will prohibit with limited exceptions either of the governments from imposing performance requirements on the operation of foreign investment in its territory23 the usafta will prohibit both governments from requiring foreignowned enterprise hire individuals of particular nationality in senior management position it will permit the governments to require that majority or fewer of the board of directors be of nationality or resident of its territory provided that such requirement does not impair the ability of the foreign investor from maintaining control over the investment the agreement will place limits on the right of each government to expropriate the assets of foreign investor who is national of the other fta country as with the case of services the usafta will allow each partner to list exemptions from the provisions on foreign investment and these nonconforming 23 the following performance requirements are specifically prohibited to export given level or percentage of goods or services to achieve given level or percentage of domestic content to purchase use or accord preference to goods produced in its territory or to purchase goods from persons in its territory to relate in any way the volume or value of imports to the volume or value of exports or to the amount of foreign exchange inflows associated with an investment to restrict sales of goods or services in is territory that an investment produces or supplies by relating such sales in any way to the volume or value of its exports or foreign exchange earnings to transfer particular technology production process or other proprietary knowledge to person in its territory or to supply exclusively from its territory the goods that an investment produces or the services it supplies to specific regional market or to the world market crs16 measures are listed in annex i and annex ii the same annexes for services of the agreement australia has used annexes i and ii to preserve its right to screen foreign investments all foreign investments in australia are subject to government screening and approval while this process has apparently not stopped us investors from establishing successful operations in australia representatives of the us business community insisted that the process does not conform to the principle of national treatment that is treating foreign investors less favorably than domestic investors the united states has used its right to exceptions among other things to preserve programs to encourage minorityowned businesses at the outset of the negotiations ustr zoellick stated that he wanted the australian government to eliminate or reduce trade distorting investment measures24 the australian government had indicated that changing the process might be difficult25 however in compromise the united states has allowed australia to maintain its screening process australia agreed to eliminate screening of us investment in new entities greenfield investments it also agreed to increase the threshold value from a50 million to a800 million above which us acquisitions of established entities in australia will have to be screened26 the threshold on us investments in some sensitive sectors such as telecommunications transportation and defenserelated areas will remain at a50million us acquisitions of australian financial institutions will also remain restricted27 during the negotiations the united states insisted that special investorstate dispute mechanism be established under the usafta australia argued that such mechanism will not be necessary because us and australian legal traditions regarding investment were very similar and us investors will receive fair treatment in australian courts the united states agreed to keep the mechanism out of the agreement but the agreement contains provision that will allow the establishment of an investorstate dispute mechanism if changed circumstances warrant it other issues the usafta contains provisions covering other relatively noncontroversial but nevertheless important aspects of usaustralian trade and investment the provisions on labor chapter 18 and environment chapter 19 are structurally similar because the australian and us economies are both modern and industrialized and are at similar levels of development with similar average wage levels and environmental standards labor and environment issues have not been cause of bilateral trade friction nevertheless the usafta commits the two countries to enforce their respective labor rights laws that is those laws that are directly related to the internationally recognized labor principles and rights and to enforce laws to protect the environment if either government ascertains that the 24 text zoellick letter on australia fta reproduced by inside us trade available at httpwwwinsidetradecom 25 ibid 26 the us dollaraustralian dollar exchange rate is

mechanism described below the usafta chapter 8 will also commit australia and the united states to prevent government standards and technical regulations from unnecessarily inhibiting bilateral trade governments use these regulations to ensure that the goods sold in their territory do not impair the health and safety of their residents the agreement will also commit the two countries to work toward mutual recognition of each others technical regulations as equivalent to their own the objective will be to facilitate trade by eliminating duplicative testing and other technical procedures the usafta devotes separate chapter chapter 16 to electronic commerce ecommerce among other things the agreement commits the united states and australia not to impose customs duties on any digital product digital product is defined as the digitized form or encoding of computer programs text video images sound recordings and other products regardless of whether they are fixed on carrier medium eg cd or transmitted electronically online in addition the two countries agree to accord less favorable nondiscriminatory treatment to digital products that originate in the other usaftacountry or in nonfta country than it accords digital products that originate in its territory exceptions to this principle are those that the fta partners have listed under the foreign investment chapter and the services chapter furthermore if government practice action or regulation presents conflict between this principle and the provisions of the usafta pertaining to intellectual property rights protection chapter 17 the latter will prevail under the usafta chapter 17 the united states and australia reaffirm their obligations to number of international treaties on intellectual property rights including the wto agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights trips furthermore the usafta commit the two countries to ratify and accede to the world intellectual property organization wipo treaty on performances and phonograms and the treaty on copyrights the united states has ratified the two treaties while australia has not other key provisions would protect the rights of holders of copyrights including programs carried over encrypted satellite signals protect the rights of patent holders with flexibility to exclude from patent ability the methods of treatment and regulations that re used to protect public order and morality protect the rights of holders of trademarks including geographical designations require australia to extend the duration of copyright protection to coincide with us protection from the life of the author plus 50 years to the life of the author plus 70 years and protect internet domain holders from cybersquatting crs18 the usafta chapter 21 provides for mechanism for the two countries to resolve disputes that arise over interpretation of the agreement the agreement requires the formation of joint committee of representatives from each fta country that will meet annually to review the operation of the agreement to consider and to discuss possible disputes or changes that one or the other country wishes to make to the agreement the agreement places premium on resolving through consultation but if that means fails it provides for the establishment of panel to arbitrate the dispute and assign compensation if warranted reactions to the agreement with some notable exceptions the reactions to the usafta of representatives from affected sectors of the us economy have been positive although the reaction of any specific industry or sector is largely function how it will be affected by the agreement the advisory committee for trade policy and negotiations actpn was established by the congress to provide private sector advice to the president on trade agreements before he signs them the actpns membership cuts across virtually all sectors of the economy including manufacturing agriculture labor services and the environment with the exception of one member see below the actpn has endorsed the usaustralia free trade agreement the vast majority of the committees membership concluded that the agreement fulfills us trade objectives that congress set down in the trade act of 2002 and the membership supports the trade liberalizing measures to which the agreement commits the united states and australia28 although endorsing the agreement the majority of the actpn expressed some concerns that some issues regarding australias sanitary and phytosanitary sps regime still needed to be resolved before us agricultural exporters will be able to take full advantage of the agreement that the agreement does not include an investorstate dispute provision and calls for the us government to ensure that such provision be added if it proves warranted and that the environmental provisions in the agreement are adequate for australia since australia has strong record on environmental protection but they should not be considered model for other us fta agreements where the partners records on the environmental protection is not so strong29 28 the advisory committee for trade policy and negotiations actpn report to the president the congress and the united states trade representative on the usaustralia free trade agreement p 37 29 ibid crs19 the actpn member representing labor james p hoffa jr general president of the international brotherhood of teamsters filed the lone dissenting view against approval of the agreement he argued that the agreements labor provisions only require australia to enforce its labor laws hoffa claims while australia is developed country with relatively high standard of living and vibrant independent labor movement it has an imbalanced inadequate system of labor laws that fail to fully protect workers rights30 the agricultural negotiations were the most difficult and the results somewhat ambiguous the reactions of agricultural and food producers reflect the ambiguity us sugar producers were relieved that the agreement did not include liberalization of sugar imports while sugarusing processors were critical us wheat exporters oppose the agreement because australia will be permitted to retain its singledesk monopoly on wheat exports pork producers have indicated that they will not support the agreement until australia implements final risk assessment on us pork for import into australia and us pork exports to that market begin to increase the reaction of beef producers has been mixed they are disappointed that greater access to the us market for australian exporters was not matched by openings in other foreign markets for us beef exporters through the wto negotiations they are pleased that the us beef market will be opened gradually to australian exporters over an 18year period the american farm bureau supports the usafta as long as the sps issues and other issues that affect us agricultural exports are resolved before the congress votes on the agreement31 us manufacturers strongly support the usafta calling for immediate congressional approval national association of manufacturers nam vice president frank vargo has labeled the usafta the manufacturers agreement32 congress and the usafta united states trade representative robert zoellick and australian trade minister mark vaile signed the agreement on may 18 2004 in washington within 60 days after signing the agreement the president must submit preliminary list of us laws that will have to be changed in order to comply with the agreement after entering into the agreement but within specific time frame the president then can submit draft of the agreement the implementing legislation and statement of administrative action to both houses of congress the three documents must be submitted on days in which both houses are in session the congress then has total of 90 legislative days in which to act the house committees with jurisdiction over the agreement have 45 legislative days during which to review and report out 30 ibid p8 31 these reactions are found in agriculture in the australiaus free trade agreement crs agriculture policy electronic briefing book

followed by 15 legislative days for floor action the senate committees of jurisdiction have an additional 15 legislative days to consider and report out the implementing legislation followed by an additional 15 legislative days for floor action under trade promotion authority the amount of time for debate on the agreement in both houses is limited and the vote is strictly yea or nay amendments33 on june 23 2004 the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee each held mock markup of implementing legislation the ways and means committee approved by voice vote the legislation on june 23 without amendment on largely partyline vote the finance committee approved an amendment that will require the ustr to obtain approval from the ways and means and finance committees before he could waive requirement to implement safeguard measure against imports australian beef on june 24 senate finance reported the legislation out unfavorably 714 the bush administration was expected to submit implementing legislation based on the house ways and means committee version on july 6 2004 the president formally submitted legislation to implement the agreement on july 8 the house ways and means committee favorably reported out the implementing bill hr 4759 by voice vote and the full house approved the measure 314109 on july 15 on july 15 the senate finance committee reported out bill and the full senate approved the measure 8016 on july 16 the bill was sent to the president for his signature president bush signed the usaustralia free trade agreement implementation act on august 3 2004 pl108286 the australian parliament approved implementing legislation on august 13 2004 but with two amendments insisted on the by opposition labour party whose support the government needed in order to get sufficient support to get it passed by the senate the amendments stipulate that pharmaceutical companies that hold drug patents must certify that any legal action they seek to block cheaper generic drugs from entering the australian market must have been done in good faith the companies would be subject to monetary penalties if they violate the certification the ustr must certify to the president that the amendments comply with the fta as signed by the two countries before the agreement goes into effect on november 17 2004 ustr zoellick and trade minister vaile exchanged diplomatic notes certifying acceptance of each others implementing legislation but only after australia assured the united states that the implementing legislation would be changed to address us concerns the fta entered into force on january 1 2005 impact of the usafta the usafta will have implications for the usaustralia economic relationship and possibly for us trade and trade policy as whole because tariffs on most manufactured goods and many agricultural products were already low one 33 for more information on congressional procedures on trade agreements see crs report rl32011 trade agreements procedure for congressional approval and implementation crs21 can conclude that the removal of the tariffs and other restrictions will not result in major shifts in trade patterns in large increases in the total volume of trade or in significant trade diversion an analysis of the potential economic effects of the usafta conducted by the united states international trade commission concluded that the largest percentage increases in us exports to australia will occur in coal oil gas and other mineral products textiles apparel and leather products and other processed food and tobacco products although these increases will occur from small bases the largest value increases in us exports to australia will occur in other machinery and equipment and motor vehicles and parts the largest percentage increases in us imports from australia will occur in textile apparel and leather products meat products and other processed food and tobacco products the greatest increase in value of us imports from australia will occur in meat products the report estimated that us consumers will realize net welfare benefit increase of 438 million to 6394 million if the agreement is fully implemented34 under the usafta the united states and australia addressed the few significant irritants in their bilateral economic relationship accordingly the agreement could further solidify an already strong relationship for australia those irritants include us restrictions on beef and dairy products for the united states they include australian local content requirements in television programming sanitary and phytosanitary sps measures statesanctioned monopolies in exports of wheat and other grains and screening of foreign investments in some cases such as us restrictions on beef and dairy and australian investment screening the two sides agreed to loosen restrictions in the case others such as the australian sps measures and statesanctioned monopolies they agreed to establish mechanisms for further discussion however in the case of some irritants such as us import controls on sugar the two countries agreed change was possible the agreement may have implications for us trade policy and strategy as whole enactment of the agreement will build on the increased us use of ftas especially by the bush administration as trade liberalization tool for some observers ftas act as building blocks to global trade liberalization especially at time when the multilateral negotiations in the wto are proceeding slowly at best others have argued that ftas undermine multilateral trade liberalization efforts and create confusing web of intertwining economic relationships if approved by congress the usafta may also set precedents for other ftas the united states might form for example the steps that australia agreed to take to make the pharmaceutical benefits system more transparent may be model for the united states in future ftas with countries that have similar government subsidized drug programs some observers have also suggested that the exclusion of us sugar import restrictions from the usafta will encourage other trading partners to exclude politicallysensitive products from agreements with the united states or encourage other us importsensitive industries to push for exclusion in future trade agreements 34 united states international trade commission usaustralia free trade agreement potential economywide and selected effects investigation ta210411 may 2004 httpwwwusitcgov for other
