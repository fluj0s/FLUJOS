controvers ial measures is to establish conference committee composed of conferees chosen from each chamber usually from the committees that reported the legislation the conference committees job is to iron out differences when the house and senate pass di ssimilar versions of the same bill because conference committees make significant policy decisions it is little surprise that these bicameral units are sometimes calle d the third house of congress to understand the work of conference committees it is useful to discuss 1 several features common to interchamber negotiati ons 2 how conferences are organized and 3 the authority of conferees worth noting is that many lawmakers anticipate that certain legislation will eventually r each the conference co mmittee stage and they will take purposeful preconference actions to bolster their negotiating leverage with the other body for instance either chamber may adopt floor amendments that may be used as bargaining material in conference common features three features commonly influence conference bargaining first conferences typically operate in an agreementoriented context conferees are accustomed to the give andtake bargains and tradeoffs that ch aracterize interchamber negotiations second the general objectives of the conferees are to uphold their chambers position in conference to the extent practicable to fashion compromise agreement that attracts the support of at least majority of each house s conferees and finally to craft conference report that will pass the house and senate and be signed by the president third the conferees from each chamber function under the unit rule this means that the two houses each have one vote with major ity in each conference delegation deciding how it is to be cast on the various issues in bicam eral disagreement often there is need for formal votes because conferences may opt to make decisions informally by consensus or through straw votes on issues that might be revisited again during the conference to be sure the conference decision that is determinative is when at least majority of the conferees from each chamber agree to sign the conference reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98708crs2 organization of conference there are formal rules that outline how conference meetings are to be organized routinely the principals from each chambe r or their respective staffs conduct pre conference meetings so as to expedite the bargaining process when the conference formally convenes informal practice also determines who will be the overall conference chairman each house has its own leader ro tation is usually the practice when matched pairs of panels the tax or appropriations panels for example convene in conference regularly for standing committees that seldom meet in conference the choice of who will chair the conference is generally re solved by the conference leaders from each chamber the decision on when and where to meet and for how long are few prerogatives of the chair who consults on th matters with his or her counterpart from the other body another organizational featur merits mention the num ber of conferees selected from each chamber usually varies with recent years witnessing an increase in the overall size of conference delegations big conf erences may influence how the work of this bicameral panel is carried out the conference may subdivide into smaller groups called subconferences authority of conferees house rule xxii and senate rules xxviii and xliv as well as the respective precedents of each chamber outline the aut hority and limitations of the conferees from each house few formal rules guide the bargaining process and they only may be invoked through points of order when the conferen ce report the compromise accord is submitted to the house and senate for consideration conferees are not to reconsider provisions agreed to by both houses they are to meet at least once in open session unless specific steps are taken to close sessions for reasons such as national security needless to say much conference bargaining occurs in secret as various conferees discuss in private how to iron out differences conferees too are not to include new matter in their report in brief they are not to exceed the scope of differences committed to them by either chamber scope is technical term that can be illustrated generally as follows provision of provision of contents permitted 1st chamber 2nd chamber in conference report nothing nothing nothing b or b or in between nothing or current law or in between the point to remember is that these few rules can be waived or not be invoked in either chamber as one former senate l eader said conferences are marvelous theyre mystical theyre alchemy its absolutely dazzling what you can do stated another way if conferees have the votes they ve large discretionary authority in making bicameral adjustments
