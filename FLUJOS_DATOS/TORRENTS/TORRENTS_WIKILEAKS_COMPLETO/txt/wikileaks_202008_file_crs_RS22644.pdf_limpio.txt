generally when statute is challenged faci ally plaintiff is arguing that under all circumstances the statute operates unconstitutionally by contrast an asapplied challenge involves plaintiff arguing that statute is unc onstitutional as applied to the facts of particular case or to partythe first amendment however according to the court contributions and expenditures invoke different degrees of first amendment protection8 recognizing contribution limitations as one of the fecas primary w eapons against the reality or appearance of improper influence on candidates by cont ributors the court found that these l imits serve the basic governmental interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process9 on the other hand the court deter mined that fecas expenditure limits on individuals political action committees pacs and candidates impose direct and substantial restraints on the quantity of political sp eech and are not justified by an overriding governmental interest10 colorado i and ii in colorado republican federal campaign committee v federal election commission colorado i 11 the supreme court found that fecas party expenditure provision12 was unconstitutionally enforced against partys funding of radio attack ads directed against lik ely opponent in federa l senatorial election specifically this case concerned the constitutionality of the party expenditure limit as applied to expenditures for radio ads by the colorado republican party crp that attacked the likely democratic party ca ndidate in the 1986 u s senate election13 the courts ruling turned on whether crps ad purchase was an independent expenditure campaign contribution or coordinated expenditure14 the court found that the crps ad purchase was an independent expenditure deserving constitutional protection independent expenditures the court hel d do not raise heightened governmental interests in regulation because the money is deployed to advance political point of view independent of candidates viewpoi nt and therefore cannot be limited15 the courts opinion in colorado i was limited to the constitutionality of the application of fecas party expenditure provision16

unlimited independent expenditures23 recent financial overview and analysis s 1091 corker and hr 3792 wamp introduced in the 110th congress would eliminate existing caps on coordinated party expenditures on april 18 2007 the senate committee on rules and administration held hearing on s 1091 it has not received additional action thus far hr 3792 wa s introduced on october 10 2007 it has not received additional action the two bills are identical except for provision in hr 3792 that specifies an effective date following the 2008 elections s 1091 does not specify an effective date although coordinated expenditures played large role in party financial activity throughout the 1970s nd 1980s r ecent elections suggest that party reliance on coordinated expenditures is changing as table 1 shows although the colorado i decision permitted parties to make unlimited independent expenditures during and after the 1996 cycle those expenditures remained relatively modest through 2002 from 1996 2002 total party coordi nated expenditures outpaced inde pendent expenditures often by large amounts in 2004 and 2006 however pa rty spending shifte d dramatically with far more total independent ex penditures than coordinated ex penditures in 2004 the two major parties made more than four times in independent expenditures what they did in coordinated expenditures th at allocation of resources c ontinued in 2006 with the two parties making more than six times in independent expenditures than they did in coordinated expenditures specifically during the 2006 elec tion cycle both parties made total of more than 2237 million in independe nt expenditures compared with slightly less than 35 million in coordinated expenditures as the table also shows at various points since 1996 each major party has outsp ent the other in party coordinated expenditures for the most part however democrats and republicans have allocated similar amounts to coordina ted party

from the democratic national committee democratic senatorial campaign committee democratic congressional campaign committee and state and local democratic committees and republican national co mmittee national republican senatorial committee national republican congressional committee and stat and local republican committees as reflected in the fec data in terms of overall fundraising the two major parties are now closer to parity than they historically have been as figure 1 below shows local state and national republican party committees have accumulated more receipts than their democratic counterparts since 1990 as has generally ccurred since at least the 1970s although republican party committees still maintain financial advantage democrats fared far better in overall fundraising in 2004 and 2006 than they had during any other period shown in the figure by 2006 democratic party committees raised 80 as much as republicans although that amount fell slightly from the 2004 number 87 on their own these do not suggest particular outcome s if caps on party coor dinated expenditures were lifted but they do indicate that one party may not necessarily have major total financial advantage over th other if the caps are lifted in the near future for those who support lifting the caps on c oordinated party expenditures current limits impinge on parties abilities to communicate with their candidates once parties meet their coordinated spending limits unrestricted coordinated party expenditures could shift party spending away from independent expenditures although each option would retain unique characteristics par ties might continue to choose independent expenditures if they wish to distance campaigns from what many political professionals and some candidates view as necessary but politically unp opular purchases eg for political advertising attacking opponents24 on the other hand c oordinated expenditures would be more attractive for parties wishing to communicate freely with campaigns abouthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22644crs6 25 2 usc 441aa8direct financial support those expenditure s could strengthen arguably weakening ties between parties and campaigns proponents of limits on party c oordinated expenditures cont end that the caps reduce the amount of money in politics they also potentially prevent circumvention of individual contribution limits by donors who ma seek to indirectly support campaigns by making contributions to political partie s however it should be noted that feca already restricts earmarked contributions25 for those who generally support regulating political money lifting the caps on partycoordinated expenditures would likely be objectionable on principle could appear to undercut similar regula tory efforts adopted since the 1970s and could go against public sentiment generally favoring limiting the amount of money in politics note reflects federal account activity ie hard money of political party committees at national state and local levels while soft money represen ted large share of party receipts through the 2002 election cycle after which it was banned by bcra the respective parties raised comparable levels of soft money in most of the election cycles between 1992 and 2002 hence the inclusion of soft money receipts in this figure would not greatly affect the relative overall fundra ising ratios of the two parties on soft money see us federal election commission party committees raise over 1 billion in 20012002 press release mar 20 2003 national comm ittees include the
