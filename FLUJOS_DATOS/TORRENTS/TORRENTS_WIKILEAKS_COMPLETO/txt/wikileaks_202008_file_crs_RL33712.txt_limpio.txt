million persons 374 million aged and 73 million disabled at total cost of 4594 billion federal costs after deduction of beneficiary premiums and other offsetting receipts will total 3899 billion in fy2008 federal medicare spending will represent approximately 13 of the total federal budget and 3 of gdp medicare is an entitlement program which means that it is required to pay for services provided to eligible persons so long as specific criteria are met since medicare was enacted in 1965 it has undergone considerable changes first program coverage was expanded to include the disabled and persons with end stage renal disease esrd over time increasing attention was placed on stemming the rapid increase in program spending which outpaced projections even in the initial years this was typically achieved through tightening rules governing payments to providers of services and stemming the annual updates in such payments the program moved from payments based on reasonable costs and reasonable charges to payment systems under which predetermined payment amount is established for specified unit of service at the same time beneficiaries were given the option to obtain covered services through private managed care arrangements most medicare payment provisions were incorporated into larger budget reconciliation bills designed to control overall federal spending in 2003 congress enacted major medicare bill the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma this legislation placed increasing emphasis on private sector management of benefits it also created new voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit to be administered by private entities further it introduced the concept of means testing into what had previously been strictly social insurance program congress continues to register concern about the rapid rise in medicare spending and the ability of existing funding mechanisms to support the program over the long term combination of factors has contributed to the rapid increase in medicare costs these include increases in overall medical costs advances in health care delivery and medical technology the aging of the population and longer life spans the issues confronting the program are not new nor are the possible solutions likely to get any easier for number of years various options have been suggested however legislative changes have focused on shortterm issues there is consensus on the longterm approach that should be taken this report provides an overview of medicare it begins with brief program history

primer introduction medicare is the nations health insurance program for persons aged 65 and over and certain disabled persons in fy2008 the program will cover an estimated 446 million persons 374 million aged and 73 million disabled1 at total cost of 4594 billion federal costs after deduction of beneficiary premiums and other offsetting receipts will total 3899 billion2 in fy2008 federal medicare spending will represent approximately 13 of the total federal budget and 3 of gdp3 medicare is an entitlement program which means that it is required to pay for services provided to eligible persons so long as specific criteria are met spending under the program except for portion of administrative costs is considered mandatory spending not discretionary spending which is subject to the appropriations process medicare serves approximately one in seven americans and virtually all of the population aged 65 and over in 2006 the first year of the new drug benefit medicare spending accounted for an estimated 57 of federal health spending and 19 of all national health expenditures program spending represented 29 of national spending on hospital services 21 of such spending for physicians and clinical services and 18 of total drug spending compared to 2 in 2005 in 2017 program spending is expected to account for 58 of federal spending and 21 of all national health expenditures spending in that year is expected to account for 31 of national spending on hospital services 20 of such spending for physicians and clinical services and 24 of total drug spending4 the medicare program is generally viewed as achieving its goal of helping aged and disabled persons meet many of their health care needs however the cost of the program and the significant yeartoyear increases in such costs are major concern for the congress and other observers the congressional budget office cbo projects that program spending will double over the next ten years the rapid growth rate reflects number of factors including overall increases in medical care costs which typically exceed the rate of inflation in the economy as whole advances in health care delivery and medical technology and longer life expectancies additional 1 department of health and human services budget in brief 2009 httpwwwhhsgov budget09budget2009budgetinbriefpdf 2 congressional budget office cbo

amount which varies by service category crs5 payments for services payment rules under part and part b differ for each service category and are quite complex generally predetermined payment amount is established for specific unit of service such as hospital stay typically the law establishes annual update rules however they are frequently modified by congress part c medicare advantage ma 20 of beneficiaries get services through ma ma offers coordinated care and certain other private plan options for beneficiaries voluntary for persons enrolled in both part and part b ma enrollees get all their services through the plan medicare makes predetermined monthly capitation payment to the ma plan for each beneficiary capitation payments do not vary by amount of services used federal government caps its liability plans at risk for excess costs part d drug benefit new in 2006 voluntary anyone who has part or part b or enrolled in part c can enroll administered by private entities ma plans and prescription drug plans pdps plans must meet minimum standards plans compete to offer benefits in the region beneficiaries select among plans persons with incomes below 150 of poverty have assistance with premium and costsharing charges crs6 medicare financing part financed primarily by payroll taxes paid by current workers and their employers employees pay 145 on all earnings employers pay 145 on all earnings selfemployed pay 29 on all earnings revenues credited to hospital insurance hi trust fund part b financed by combination of beneficiary premiums and general revenues 25 from monthly premiums 9640 in 2008 paid by current beneficiaries 75 from general revenues high income enrollees in 2008 single beneficiaries with incomes over 82000 and couples with incomes over 164000 pay higher premium revenues credited to supplementary medical insurance smi trust fund part c separate financing mechanism payments to ma plans made in appropriate parts from hi and smi trust funds premiums if any vary by plan part d financed by combination of beneficiary premiums and general revenues beneficiaries pay different premiums depending on the plan they select on average beneficiary premiums represent 255 of costs general revenues finance the remainder revenues credited to separate account in smi trust fund financing key points part financed almost entirely by current workers part b and part d financed by premiums paid by beneficiaries and general revenues tax dollars pending insolvency discussion refers only to part currently estimated to become insolvent in 2019 parts b and d do not become insolvent because of the way they are financed crs7 current concerns medicares overall growth rate not sustainable over time part trust fund becomes insolvent parts b and d cost and premium increases will be substantial easy solutions some approaches focus on placing increasing reliance on private sector to deliver and manage benefits other approaches focus on making changes within the current system medicare trigger enacted in 2003 as part of medicare modernization act mma intended to force consideration of reforms when there is excess general revenue spending the law specifies that excess spending is reached when general revenues represent 45 or more of total program outlays requirement for medicare annual trustees report report required to specify if projected general revenue spending is expected to exceed 45 of outlays within seven years president submits legislative proposal if finding is made for 2 successive years legislative proposal must contain recommendations to reduce percentage of total medicare outlays funded by general revenues congress required to consider proposal on expedited basis proposals to reduce the general revenue percentage can include increases in dedicated funding sources primarily payroll taxes and premiums andor reductions in outlays for any part of the program 2006 report contained finding 2007 report contained finding president submitted legislative proposal in february 2008 proposal would increase part d premiums for higher income persons incorporate valuebased purchasing and modify the medical liability system in july 2008 the house approved resolution specifying that the expedited parliamentary procedures required by mma would not apply in the house for the remainder of the 110th congress 2008 report also contained finding submission of legislative proposal will be required in february 2009 crs8 medicare history medicare was enacted in 1965 pl 8997 in response to the concern that only about half of the nations seniors had health insurance and most of those only had coverage for inpatient hospital costs the new program which became effective july 1 1966 included coverage for hospital and posthospital services under part and doctors and other medical services under part b as was the case for the already existing social security program part was to be financed by payroll taxes levied on current workers and their employers persons had to pay into the system for 40 calendar quarters to become entitled to benefits however persons who turned 65 before 1968 were automatically covered while those who turned 65 between 1967 and 1974 were covered under transitional provisions medicare part b was voluntary beneficiaries who elected to enroll would pay monthly premium over 90 of the eligible population enrolled payments to health care providers under both part and part b were to be based on the most common form of payment at the time namely reasonable costs for hospital and other institutional services or reasonable charges for physicians and other medical services medicare was considered social insurance program similar to social security the 1965 law also established medicaid the federalstate health insurance program for the poor this was an expansion of previous welfarebased assistance programs some lowincome individuals qualified for both programs in the ensuing 40 years the medicare program has undergone considerable changes pl 92603 enacted in 1972 expanded program coverage to disabled individuals and to persons with endstage renal disease esrd this law also began to place limitations on the definitions of reasonable costs and reasonable charges this was in order to gain some control over program spending which even in the initial years was in excess of the original projections during the 1980s and 1990s number of laws were enacted which included provisions designed to further stem the rapid increase in program spending and to postpone the bankruptcy of the medicare part trust fund this was typically achieved through tightening rules governing payments to providers of services and stemming the annual updates in such payments the program moved from payments based on reasonable costs and reasonable charges to payment systems under which predetermined payment amount is established for specified unit of service at the same time beneficiaries were given the option to obtain covered services through private managed care arrangements typically health maintenance organizations most medicare payment provisions were incorporated into larger budget reconciliation bills designed to control overall federal spending this effort culminated in the enactment of the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 this law slowed the rate of growth in payments to providers and established new payment systems for certain categories of providers it also established the medicarechoice program which expanded private plan options for beneficiaries and changed the way most plans were paid bba 97 further expanded preventive services covered by the program crs9 subsequently congress became concerned that the bba 97 cuts in payments to providers were somewhat larger than originally anticipated therefore legislation was enacted in both 1999 balanced budget refinement act of 1999 bbra pl 106113 and 2000 medicare medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa pl 106554 that was designed to mitigate the impact of bba 97 on providers in 2003 congress enacted major medicare bill the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 this legislation included the first major benefit expansion since 1965 and placed increasing emphasis on the private sector to deliver and manage benefits it created new voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit to be administered by private entities it also replaced the existing medicarechoice program with new medicare advantage ma program payments to these plans were increased in order to increase the availability of private plan options for beneficiaries for the first time mma introduced the concept of income testing into medicare lowincome individuals get additional assistance under the new part d drug program while high income persons pay larger part b premiums beginning in 2007 mma also modified some provider payment rules and expanded covered preventive services finally the legislation created specific process for overall program review if general revenue spending exceeds specified threshold during the 109th congress two laws were enacted that incorporated minor modifications to medicares payment rules these were the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 and the tax relief and health care act of 2006 trhca pl 109432 in the 110th congress additional changes were incorporated in the medicare medicaid and schip extension act of 2007 mmsea pl 110173 and the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 mippa pl110275 medicare parts and b original medicare approximately 80 of medicare beneficiaries receive covered services through part and part b the part and b structure which remains to this day reflects the political compromises made at the time of enactment in 1965 together they are known as original medicare however the two programs have different eligibility requirements benefit structures payment rules and financing mechanisms this section provides an overview of the key features of the two programs medicare financing is discussed later in this report eligibility part most persons age 65 or older are automatically entitled to part because they or their spouse paid medicare payroll taxes for at least 10 years on earnings covered by either the social security or the railroad retirement systems persons under age 65 who receive cash disability benefits from social security or the railroad retirement systems for at least 24 months are also entitled to part crs10 since there is fivemonth waiting period for cash payments the medicare waiting period is effectively 29 months the 24month waiting period is waived for persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als lou gehrigs disease the disabled population also includes persons under age 65 with end stage renal disease esrd coverage for these individuals generally begins in the fourth month of dialysis treatments or the month of kidney transplant persons over age 65 who are not automatically entitled to part may obtain coverage by paying premium the 2008 monthly premium is 423 233 for persons with at least 30 quarters of covered employment in addition disabled persons who lose their cash benefits solely because of higher earnings and subsequently lose their extended medicare coverage may continue their medicare enrollment by paying the premium part b part b is voluntary all persons entitled to part and persons over 65 not entitled to part may enroll in part b by paying monthly premium the 2008 monthly premium is 9640 beginning in 2007 some higherincome individuals are paying higher premiums see the section on financing below persons who voluntarily enroll in part because they are not automatically entitled to part must also enroll in part b esrd beneficiaries are also required to enroll in part b benefits and beneficiary costsharing part part provides coverage for inpatient hospital services posthospital skilled nursing facility snf services posthospital home health services and hospice care subject to certain conditions and limitations approximately 20 of part enrollees use part services during year inpatient hospital services coverage is linked to an individuals benefit period or spell of illnessdefined as beginning on the day

unmet deductible when physician agrees to accept assignment on all medicare claims in given year the physician is referred to as participating physician physicians who do not agree to accept assignment on all medicare claims in given year are referred to as nonparticipating physicians nonparticipating physicians may or may not accept assignment for given service if they do not they may charge beneficiaries more than the fee schedule amount on nonassigned claims however these balance billing charges are subject to certain limits for some providers such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants assignment is mandatory these providers can only bill the beneficiary the 20 coinsurance and any unmet deductible for other part b services such as durable medical equipment assignment is optional providers may bill beneficiaries for amounts above medicares recognized payment level and may do so without limit covered part b services include the following physicians

health centers fqhcs services for endstage renal disease beneficiaries individuals with end stage renal disease ie kidney disease are eligible for all services covered under parts and b in addition they are covered for dialysis services and when provided kidney transplants program payments when medicare was first established the program generally made payments on the basis of reasonable costs and reasonable charges however program expenditures quickly began to exceed expectations as result congress sought to rein in expenditures by tightening payment rules at first limitations were placed on the definitions of reasonable costs and reasonable charges subsequently the program moved toward payment systems under which predetermined payment amount is established for specified unit of service such as hospital discharge or payment classification group in 1983 the first prospective payment system pps was established for inpatient hospital services medicares largest spending category under the inpatient pps ipps the payment amounts are intended to represent the average cost for treating patient for the same condition hospitals that are able to keep costs below the fixed payment are able to keep the difference while those with costs exceeding the fixed payment lose money over time prospective payment and other predetermined approaches such as fee schedules were established for number of other service categories the rules for each payment system are quite complex and differ for each system taken together they are sometimes characterized as administered pricing since the price the government sets for the period does not fluctuate by supply or demand the law generally specifies formula for calculating an annual update to the payment amount though congress frequently amends the statutory requirements the following discussion is intended as only brief overview of medicare payment systems for additional information see crs report rl30526 medicare payment policies and other crs reports listed in the appendix inpatient hospital services shortterm general hospitals medicare pays acute care hospitals using prospectively determined payment for each discharge hospitals payment for its operating costs is the product of two components the first component is national standardized amount adjusted by wage index associated with the area where the hospital is located or where it has been reclassified the second component is the diagnosis related group drg weight this reflects the relative hospital resource use associated with the drg to which the patient is assigned drgs are revised periodically with the most recent update effective october 1 2007 in that year cms began twoyear transition to payment system that uses severityadjusted drgs the new system has 335 base drgs most of which are split into two or crs16 three medicare severity ms drgs generally based on the presence of comorbidity or complication there are 743 msdrgs used for payment purposes additional payments are made for cases with extraordinary costs outliers indirect costs incurred by teaching hospitals for graduate medical education and disproportionate share dsh costs for hospitals serving disproportionate share of lowincome patients additional payments may also be made for qualified new technologies that have been approved for special addon payments note that physicians services provided during an inpatient stay are paid under the physician fee schedule discussed below not under the ipps system payments are also made for capital costs medicares capital ipps is structured similarly to its operating ipps for shortterm general hospitals hospitals capital payment is based on prospectively determined federal payment rate depends on the drg to which the patient is assigned and is adjusted by hospitals geographic adjustment factor qualified hospitals will receive indirect medical education and dsh adjustments to their capital payments as well the teaching adjustment to capital payments is discontinued over the next two years medicare makes payments outside the ipps system for direct costs associated with graduate medical education costs for hospital residents subject to certain limits medicare will also reimburse hospitals for 70 of the allowable costs associated with beneficiaries unpaid deductible and copayment amounts hospitals receiving special consideration under medicares ipps special payment considerations may apply for hospitals meeting one of the following designations generally this results in higher payments than would apply under the ipps system sole community hospital sch an sch is facility located in geographically isolated area and deemed to be the sole provider of inpatient acute care hospital services in geographic area based on distance travel time severe weather conditions andor market share as established by specific criteria medicare dependent hospital mdh an mdh is small rural hospital with high proportion of patients who are medicare beneficiaries it cannot be an sch and must have 100 or fewer beds rural referral center rrc an rrc is relatively large hospital generally in rural area that provides broad array of services and treats patients from wide geographic area as established by specific criteria ipps exempt hospitals and distinct part units certain hospitals or distinct hospital

services are paid under pps which is based on per diem urban or rural base payment rate adjusted for case mix and area wages the per diem rate generally covers all services including room and board provided to the patient that day the casemix adjustment is made using the resource utilization groups rugs system the rugs system uses patient assessments to assign beneficiary to one of 53 categories and to determine the crs18 payment for the beneficiarys care patient assessments are done at various times during patients stay and the rug category beneficiary is placed in can change with changes in the beneficiarys condition extra payments are not made for extraordinarily costly cases outliers home health services home health services are paid under home health pps based on 60day episodes of care patient may have an unlimited number of episodes under the pps nationwide base payment amount is adjusted by differences in wages using the hospital wage index this amount is then adjusted for case mix using the applicable home health resource group hhrg to which the beneficiary has been assigned the hhrg applicable to beneficiary is determined following an assessment of the patients condition and care needs using the outcome and assessment information set oasis there are 80 hhrgs further payment adjustments may be made for outlier visits for extremely costly patients significant change in beneficiarys condition partial episode which occurs because beneficiary transfers from one agency to another or low utilization adjustment for beneficiaries receiving four or fewer visits hospice care payment for hospice care is based on one of four prospectively determined rates which correspond to four different levels of care for each day beneficiary is under the care of the hospice the four rate categories are routine home care continuous home care inpatient respite care and general inpatient care payment rates are adjusted to reflect differences in area wage levels using the hospital wage index payments to hospice are subject to an aggregate cap that limits the average per beneficiary cost to cap that is adjusted annually by changes to the medical care expenditure category of the cpiu physician services and other services paid under the physician fee schedule number of part b services are paid under the physician fee schedule these include services of physicians nonphysician practitioners and therapists most services described earlier as preventive services except for laboratory tests paid under the laboratory fee schedule and diagnostic tests are paid under the physician fee schedule there are over 7000 service codes under the fee schedule the fee schedule assigns relative values to each service code these relative values reflect physician work based on time skill and intensity involved practice expenses and malpractice expenses the relative values are adjusted for geographic variations in the costs of practicing medicine these geographically adjusted relative values are converted into dollar payment amount by national conversion factor the conversion factor is updated each year by formula specified in law the update percentage equals the medicare economic index mei which measures inflation subject to an adjustment to match spending under the cumulative sustainable growth rate sgr system which establishes target for total expenditures since 1996 if total expenditures exceed the target the update for future year is reduced application of the sgr formula would have led to negative updates since 2002 however congress has acted several times to avert reductions thereby overriding the statutory formula for the 20032009 period the conversion factor for 2008 is 05 above that for 2007 the conversion factor for 2009 will be 11 above that for 2008 unless congress takes additional action application of the sgr formula is crs19 expected to result in sizeable reduction in the conversion factor in 2010 and continue to lead to annual reductions for the foreseeable future additionally physicians who report on selected quality measures for services for which quality measures are established will receive bonus payment for those services provided from july 2007december 2010 the bonus payments are 15 during the second half of 2007 and 2008 and 20 for 2009 and 2010 additional bonus payments will be made for 20092013 for medicare professionals providing covered services who are successful electronic prescribers clinical diagnostic laboratory services clinical lab services are paid on the basis of areawide fee schedules there is ceiling on payment amounts equal to 74 of the median of all fee schedules for the test fee schedule amounts are frozen through 2008 for the 20092013 the inflation update that would otherwise apply will be reduced by 05 percentage points each year durable medical equipment prosthetics and orthotics dmepos except in competitive bidding areas described below durable medical equipment dme is paid on the basis of fee schedule items are classified into five groups for purposes of determining the fee schedules and making payments 1 inexpensive or other routinely purchased equipment defined as items costing less than 150 or which are purchased at least 75 of the time 2 items requiring frequent and substantial servicing 3 customized items 4 oxygen and oxygen equipment and 5 other items referred to as capped rental items in general fee schedule rates are established locally and are subject to national limits with floors and ceilings the floor is equal to 85 of the weighted average of all local payment amounts and the ceiling is equal to 100 of the weighted average of all local payment amounts prosthetics and orthotics are also paid on the basis of fee schedule in areas that are not competitive bidding areas fee schedule rates for prosthetics and orthotics however are established regionally and are subject to national limits which have floors and ceilings the floor is equal to 90 of the weighted average of all regional payment amounts and the ceiling is equal to 120 of the weighted average of all regional payment amounts the fee schedules are generally updated annually by the cpiu consumer price index but congress has often specified the reduction or elimination of updates in certain years mma required the secretary to establish competitive bidding program for dmepos to replace the fee schedule payments the program is required to be phased in starting in 10 of the largest metropolitan statistical areas expanding to 80 of the largest metropolitan areas and remaining areas the secretary may first phase in items and services with the highest cost and highest volume or those items and services that the secretary determines to have the largest savings potential first the secretary may exclude certain areas from participation in the program the program started on july 1 2008 however mippa terminated the first round of contracts required the secretary to rebid the first round in 2009 and delayed subsequent rounds of the program until 2011 in addition to other changes crs20 the dra reduced the amount of time certain items of dme can be rented before ownership of the item is transferred to the beneficiary for items in the capped rental category such as hospital beds nebulizers and wheelchairs the rental period changed from period not to exceed 15 months to maximum of 13 months ownership of the equipment is then transferred to the beneficiary for oxygen equipment the rental period was limited in dra to maximum of 36 months however mippa eliminated the transferofownership requirement for oxygen equipment after the 36month rental period the supplier retains ownership of the oxygen equipment but allows the beneficiary to continue using it medicare will continue to pay for oxygen refills and will pay for maintenance and servicing not covered by the manufacturers warranty after the 36month rental period hospital outpatient department hopd services under the hopdpps the unit of payment is the individual service or procedure as assigned to an ambulatory payment classification apc to the extent possible integral services and items excluding physicians services paid under the physician fee schedule are bundled within each apc specified new technologies are assigned to new technology apcs until clinical and cost data are available to permit assignment into clinical apc medicares payment for hopd services is calculated by multiplying the relative weight associated with an apc by conversion factor for most apcs 60 of the conversion factor is geographically adjusted by the ipps wage index except for new technology apcs each apc has relative weight that is based on the median cost of services in that apc the hopdpps also includes passthrough payments for new technologies specific drugs biologicals and devices and payments for outliers starting in 2006 rural schs receive an additional 71 in medicare payments special provisions apply for cancer hospitals childrens hospitals small rural hospitals that are not schs with 100 or fewer beds and schs with not more than 100 beds ambulatory surgical center asc services beginning in january 2008 medicare pays for surgeryrelated facility services provided in ascs using payment system based on the hospital opps hopdpps the associated physician fees are paid using the physician fee schedule each of the 3300 procedures approved for payment in an asc is classified into an ambulatory payment classification apc group on the basis of clinical and cost similarity integral items and services are packaged with the primary service into an apc separate payments are made for corneal tissue acquisition brachytherapy sources certain radiology services many drugs and certain implantable devices the asc system uses the same payment groups apcs as the opps the relative weights for most procedures in the asc payment system is the same as the relative weights in the opps the asc system uses conversion factor based on percentage of the opps conversion factor the percentage of this average dollar figure is set to ensure budget neutrality by statute total payments under the new asc payment system should equal total payments under the old asc payment system different payment method is used to set asc payment for new office based procedures separately payable drugs and device intensive procedures new officebased procedures are services that are performed in physician offices at least 50 of the time payment is set at the lower of the asc rate or the practice expense portion of the physician fee schedule payment rate this policy also applies to separably payable radiology services separately payable drugs in an asc are paid the same amount as if provided in hospital outpatient crs21 department different rules apply for device intensive procedures where device that is packaged into an apc accounts for more than half of its total payments in general cms seeks to minimize the financial incentives to shift services from one setting physician office or hospital outpatient department into an asc part b covered drugs and vaccines medicares payment for part b covered drugs equals 106 of the average sales price ambulance services ambulance services are paid on the basis of fee schedule the fee schedule establishes seven categories of ground ambulance services and two categories of air ambulance services the national fee schedule is fully phased in for air ambulance services for ground ambulance services payments through 2009 are equal to the greater of the national fee schedule or blend of the national and regional fee schedule amounts the portion of the blend based on national rates is 80 for 20072009 in 2010 and subsequently the payments in all areas will be based on the national fee schedule amount the payment for service equals base rate for the level of service plus payment for mileage geographic adjustments are made to portion of the base rate additionally the base rate is increased for air ambulance trips originating in rural areas and mileage payments are increased for all trips originating in rural areas there is 25 bonus on the mileage rate for trips of 51 miles and more payments for ground ambulance services originating in rural areas are increased by 3 and payments for such services originating in other areas are increased by 2 for the period july 1 2008december 31 2009 endstage renal disease esrd dialysis and transplant services dialysis services paid for under part b are offered in three outpatient settings hospitalbased facilities independent facilities and the patients home there are two methods for payment under method i facilities are paid prospectively set amount known as the composite rate for each dialysis session patients electing home dialysis may choose to be paid under either method i or under method ii as series of separately billable services under method i the composite rate is derived from audited cost data and adjusted for the national proportion of patients dialyzing at home versus in facility and for area wage differences beginning january 1 2009 the payment rate for dialysis services will be site neutral and in applying the geographic index to providers of services the labor share will be based on the labor share otherwise applied for renal dialysis facilities adjustments will longer be made to the composite rate for hospitalbased dialysis facilities to reflect higher overhead costs beginning january 1 2011 medicare dialysis payments will be bundled phasedin over four years using single payment for medicare renal dialysis services that includes 1 items and services included in the composite rate as of december 31 2010 2 erythropoiesis stimulating agents for the treatment of esrd 3 other drugs and biologicals for which payment was made separately before bundling and 4 diagnostic laboratory tests and other items and services furnished to individuals for the treatment of esrd crs22 beneficiaries electing home dialysis may choose not to be associated with facility and may make independent arrangements with supplier for equipment supplies and support services payment to these suppliers known as method ii is made on the basis of reasonable charges limited to 100 of the median hospital composite rate except for patients on continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis when the limit is 130 of the median hospital composite rate the composite rate is casemixed adjusted kidney transplantation services to the extent they are inpatient hospital services are subject to the ipps however kidney acquisition costs are paid on reasonable cost basis medicare part c medicare advantage ma approximately 20 of medicare beneficiaries receive covered services through part c rather than through original medicare for number of years medicare beneficiaries who are eligible for medicare part and enrolled in part b have had the option of obtaining covered services through private health plans under an agreement with cms plan agrees to provide all services covered under medicare parts and b except for hospice care in return for capitated monthly payment the same monthly payment is made regardless of how many or how few services beneficiary actually uses the plan is atrisk if costs in the aggregate exceed program payments conversely the plan can retain savings if costs are less than payments in contrast under the feeforservice payment methodology used under original medicare payment is made to medical provider for each service eg physician visit or each unit of service eg hospital stay provided background medicares first risk contract program was created in 1982 under that program private entities mostly health maintenance organizations hmos contracted with medicare to provide covered services the bba enacted in 1997 replaced the risk contract program with the medicarechoice mc program the mc program established new payment formula which was designed both to reduce overall spending and to reduce the existing variation in payments to plans across the country following enactment of bba 97 managed care plans began leaving the program citing insufficient medicare payments however other factors also played role for some plans subsequent legislation addressed some of the issues arising from passage of the bba most recently congress made substantial changes to the mc program with the passage of the mma in 2003 the act created the medicare advantage ma program to replace the mc program and introduced several provisions intended to increase the availability of private plans to medicare beneficiaries it provided for immediate payment increases to plans beginning in 2004 beginning in 2006 it changed the payment structure for local plans and provided for the introduction of regional plans that operate like preferred provider organizations popular option in the private health insurance market the legislation also provided financial crs23 incentives for plans to participate in this new regional option additionally ma enrollees have access to the part d drug benefit through their ma plan beginning in 2010 the ma program will offer sixyear program referred to as comparative cost adjustment designed to test competition between local ma plans and feeforservice medicare in limited areas plan types there are several different types of plans that can qualify as ma plans they include coordinated care plans which includes health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations private feeforservice plans medical savings account plans and certain other plan types operating under exceptions or demonstration authority the following are the most common plan types available health maintenance organizations hmos hmo plans offer services to plan members in designated service areas beneficiaries are generally required to obtain services from hospitals and doctors that are in the plans network some plans offer pointofservice option under which an individual may elect to obtain services from nonnetwork provider in such cases the individual pays more for the care if the plan does not have point of service option the individual must pay outofpocket except in emergency cases for services provided by nonnetwork providers local preferred provider organizations ppos persons who enroll in ppos are generally able to see any doctor or other provider that accepts medicare if enrollees use outofnetwork ie non preferred providers they will generally pay more though the amount varies by plan local ppos generally serve individual counties regional ppos rppos beginning in 2006 regional ppos are available regional ppos serve one or more of the 26 regions established by the secretary each region consists of either single state or multistate area ma regional plans cover both in and outofnetwork required services and have both unified part and part b deductible and limit on outofpocket expenses the limit varies by plan this is the only group that has specific limit on out ofpocket spending in connection with part and part b services special needs plans snps snp may be any plan type such as an hmo or ppo however unlike other plans snp may in accordance with regulations restrict enrollment to special needs beneficiaries special needs beneficiaries are defined as ma eligible individuals who reside in longterm care facilities who are eligible for both medicare and medicaid or who meet requirements specified by the secretary that identify people who would benefit from enrollment in snp for specified chronic or disabling conditions snps may restrict enrollment for periods before january 1 2011starting january 1 2010 all new enrollees to snp must crs24 meet the definition of special needs individual for the respective plan private feeforservice pffs plans pffs plan is one that 1 reimburses providers on feeforservice basis 2 does not vary rates for provider based on utilization and 3 does not restrict the selection of providers who are lawfully authorized to provide services and agree to accept the terms and conditions of payment established by the plan starting in 2011 mippa require pffs plans to establish contracted networks of providers in areas where two or more plans with networks such as hmos or local ppos serve medicare beneficiaries starting in 2011 pffs plans sponsored by an employer or union are required to establish contracted provider networks throughout their entire service area starting in 2011 in general ma organizations are required to offer at least one plan with part d drug coverage ma enrollees can only get part d coverage through their ma plan an exception applies for private feeforservice plans unlike most other ma plans they are not required to offer part d drug coverage though they may elect to do so individuals in pffs plans not offering drug coverage may purchase drug coverage through standalone part d drug plan plan enrollment beneficiaries newly eligible for medicare part and enrolled in part b can join an ma plan other persons can generally join an ma plan or switch from one ma plan to another only during the annual open enrollment period which occurs from november 15december 31 each year in addition ma enrollees can generally change enrollment or drop out of their ma plans and return to original medicare during the first three months of each calendar year or for new enrollees the first three months in which they are eligible to be enrolled in an ma plan in certain cases such as when an ma enrollee moves he or she may switch plans at that time payments to plans payments to ma plans are based on comparison of each plans estimated cost of providing medicare covered services bid relative to the maximum amount the federal government is willing to pay for providing those services in the plans service area benchmark if plans bid is less than the benchmark its payment will equal to its bid plus rebate equal to 75 of the difference between the benchmark and the bid the rebate must be returned to the enrollees in the form of either additional benefits reduced cost sharing reduction in the monthly part b premium prescription drug premium or supplemental premium for services beyond required medicare benefits or some combination of these options the remaining 25 of the difference between the bid and the benchmark is retained by the federal government if plans bid is equal to or above the benchmark its payment will be the benchmark amount and each enrollee in that plan will pay an additional premium equal to the amount by which the bid exceeds the benchmark each year plans wishing to participate in the ma program must submit new bids the secretary has the authority to negotiate the bid amounts except for pffs crs25 plans benchmark amounts are increased each year by the greater of either 2 or growth in overall medicare in years specified by the secretary benchmark for an area can be set at per capita spending in original medicare if that amount is greater than the benchmark the area would otherwise receive beginning in 2006 the ma program began to offer ma regional plans like local plans regional plans must submit bids to the secretary that in relation to the benchmark determine the payment the plan receives for each enrollee the regional program is different from the local program in that the plan bids help determine the benchmarks for each region the regional benchmarks include two components 1 statutorily determined amount comparable to benchmarks described above and 2 weighted average of plan bids thus portion of the benchmark is competitively determined similar to local plans plans with bids below the benchmark will be given rebate while plans with bids above the benchmark will require an additional enrollee premium additional financial incentives are provided to encourage regional plan participation during 2006 and 2007 medicare shared risk with an ma regional plan if its costs fell above or below statutorilyspecified risk corridor starting in 2014 stabilization fund is available to provide incentives for regional plans to enter into or to remain in the ma program due to changes in mippa the stabilization fund is financed entirely with portion of the savings from the regional plan bidding process part d outpatient prescription drugs as noted mma added new voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit beginning in 2006 coverage is provided through private prescription drug plans pdps or ma prescription drug mapd plans the program relies on these private plans to provide coverage and to bear some of the financial risk for drug costs federal subsidies covering the bulk of the risk is provided to encourage participation unlike other medicare services the benefits can only be obtained through private plans further while all plans have to meet certain minimum requirements there are significant differences among them in terms of benefit design drugs included on plan formularies ie list of covered drugs and costsharing applicable for particular drugs eligibility and plan enrollment each individual enrolled in part or part b is entitled to obtain qualified prescription drug coverage through enrollment in prescription drug plan beneficiary enrolled in an ma plan providing qualified prescription drug coverage mapd plan obtains coverage through that plan in general ma enrollees can not enroll in standalone prescription drug plan under part d medicare beneficiaries enrolled in part or part b on or before january 31 2006 had to enroll by may 15 2006 those eligible in february 2006 had until may crs26 31 2006 those eligible for medicare beginning march 2006 or later have an initial sevenmonth enrollment period beginning three months before the month of medicare eligibility this initial eligibility period is the same as that applicable for medicare part b an individual who does not enroll during his or her initial enrollment period is only able to enroll during the annual open enrollment period which occurs from november 15december 31 each year coverage begins the following january 1 persons who fail to enroll during their initial enrollment period are subject to penalty if they decide to enroll in the program at later date however they are not subject to the penalty if they have maintained creditable drug coverage through another source one source of possible creditable coverage is retiree health coverage offered by former employer or union special rules apply for persons who qualify for the lowincome subsidy these persons are not subject to the delayed enrollment penalty otherwise applicable to persons who miss the enrollment deadline benefits qualified part d plans are required to offer either standard coverage or alternative coverage with actuarially equivalent benefits in 2008 standard coverage has 275 deductible 25 coinsurance for costs between 276 and 2510 from this point there is coverage until the beneficiary has outofpocket costs of 4050 572625 in total spending this coverage gap has been labeled the doughnut hole once the beneficiary reaches the catastrophic limit the program pays all costs except for nominal costsharing most plans offer actuarially equivalent benefits rather than the standard package number of plans have reduced or eliminated the deductible many plans offer tiered costsharing under which lower costsharing applies for generic drugs higher cost sharing applies for preferred brand name drugs and even higher costsharing applies for nonpreferred brand name drugs some plans provide some coverage in the doughnut hole this is generally limited to generic drugs lowincome provisions major focus of the drug benefit is the enhanced coverage provided to lowincome individuals who enroll in part d lowincome enrollees including persons known as dual eligibles those persons enrolled in both medicare and medicaid who previously received drug benefits under medicaid have their prescription drug costs paid under the new part d persons with incomes below 150 of poverty have assistance with some portion of their premium and cost sharing charges persons with the lowest incomes have the highest level of benefits crs27 drug payments plans determine payments for drugs and are expected to negotiate prices the federal government is prohibited from interfering in the price negotiations between drug manufacturers pharmacies and plans the socalled noninterference clause interaction with retiree plans mma included significant incentives for employers to continue to offer coverage to their retirees specifically special federal subsidy payments are made to employers or unions offering drug coverage at least actuarially equivalent to standard coverage subsidy payments are made on behalf of an individual covered under retiree plan who is eligible to enroll under pdp or mapd plan but elects not to in 2008 subsidy payments equal 28 of the retirees gross drug costs between 275 and 5600 the federal government is not taking the subsidy in behalf of persons enrolled in tricare or the federal employees health benefits fehb program employers or unions may select an alternative option instead of taking the subsidy with respect to part d they may elect to pay portion of the part d premiums they may also elect to provide enhanced coverage though this has some financial consequences for the employer or union enhanced coverage may be provided through supplementary or wrap around benefits alternatively employers or unions may contract with pdp or mapd to offer the coverage finally they may become part d plan sponsor themselves for their retirees medicare administration at the federal level medicare is administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms within the department of health and human services hhs daytoday program operations including processing benefits and paying claims are conducted by private medicare contractors fiscal intermediaries fis perform claims administration functions for part services and part b services performed by part providers such as hospitals and skilled nursing facilities carriers perform claims administration functions for other part b services daytoday program operations for ma plans mapd plans and pdps are handled by the plans themselves under contracting reform mandated by the mma the secretary is authorized to replace fis and carriers with 19 competitivelyselected medicare administrative contractors macs by 2011 fifteen ab macs will perform claims processing operations for part and b medicare providers the four regional carriers dmercs which previously handled all durable medical equipment claims in the country were transitioned to dme macs as of december 2007 1 ab mac and the 4 dme macs were fully operational crs28 cms also contracts with private organizations to conduct other administrative functions such as detecting and collecting improper payments investigating alleged fraud and abuse and ensuring the quality of care provided to medicare beneficiaries medicare financing medicare is financed from three principal sources namely payroll taxes general revenues and premiums paid by beneficiaries different revenue sources are directed to specific parts of the program medicares financial operations are accounted for through two trust funds the hospital insurance hi trust fund and the supplementary medical insurance smi trust fund which are maintained by the department of the treasury the hi and smi trust funds are overseen by board of trustees that makes annual reports to congress the trust funds are an accounting mechanism there is actual transfer of money into and out of fund income to the trust funds is credited to the fund in the form of interestbearing government securities expenditures for services and administrative costs are recorded against the fund the securities represent obligations that the government has issued to itself as long as the trust fund has balance the treasury department is authorized to make payments for it from the us treasury part financing the primary source of funding for part is payroll taxes paid by employees and employers each pays tax of 145 on earnings the selfemployed pay 29 unlike social security there is upper limit on earnings subject to the tax other sources of income include 1 portion of federal income taxes that individuals pay on their social security benefits 2 premiums paid by voluntary enrollees who are not automatically entitled to medicare part through their or their spouses work in covered employment 3 government credits and 4 interest on federal securities held by the trust fund income for part is credited to the hi trust fund part b financing medicare part b is financed through combination of beneficiary premiums and federal general revenues beneficiary premiums equal 25 of estimated program costs for the aged the disabled pay the same premium as the aged federal general revenues account for the remaining 75 income for part b is credited to the smi trust fund the 2008 monthly part b premium is 9640 individuals receiving social security benefits have their part b premium payments automatically deducted from their social security benefit checks an individuals social security check cannot go down from one year to the next as result of the annual part b premium increase except in the case of higher income individuals subject to incomerelated premiums crs29 since the inception of medicare all part b enrollees paid the same part b premium regardless of their income level for many years congress debated whether or not it was appropriate for taxpayers to pay through general revenue financing threequarters of part b costs for higher income persons since low income and middle income working persons might be subsidizing higher income elderly persons in response congress included provision in mma that required higher income enrollees to pay higher premiums beginning in 2007 in 2008 individuals whose modified adjusted gross income agi in 2006 exceeded 82000 and couples whose modified agi exceeded 164000 are subject to higher premium amounts in 2008 they pay total premiums ranging from 317 to 617 of the value of part b when fully phasedin in 2009 higher income individuals will pay total premiums ranging from 35 to 80 of the value of part b cms estimates that 5 of enrollees will pay the higher premiums in 2008 for singles the higher monthly premium amounts are 12220 for beneficiaries with incomes in 2006 over 82000 and less than or equal to 102000 16090 for incomes over 102000 and less than or equal to 153000 19970 for incomes greater than 153000 and less than or equal to 205000 and 23840 for incomes greater than 205000 for couples filing joint tax returns the premium amounts are 12220 for beneficiaries with incomes over 164000 and less than or equal to 204000 16090 for incomes over 204000 and less than or equal to 306000 19970 for incomes greater than 306000 and less than or equal to 410000 and 23840 for incomes greater than 410000 part c financing payments for spending under the medicare advantage program are made in appropriate parts from the hi and smi trust funds there is separate trust fund for part c part d financing medicare part d is financed through combination of beneficiary premiums and federal general revenues in addition certain transfers are made from the states these transfers referred to as clawback payments represent portion of the amounts states could otherwise have been expected to pay for drugs under medicaid if drug coverage for the dual eligible population had not been transferred to part d part d revenues are credited to separate part d account within the smi trust fund beneficiaries pay different premiums depending on the plan they have selected and whether or not they are entitled to lowincome premium subsidies on average beneficiary premiums account for 255 of expected total part d costs for basic coverage part d premium payments may be automatically deducted from social security benefit checks paid directly to the pdp sponsor or mapd organization or made through an electronic funds transfer crs30 medicare solvency when people refer to the pending insolvency of medicare they are actually referring to the pending insolvency of the hi trust fund medicare trustees define insolvency as occurring when trust fund assets at the beginning of the year are insufficient to pay program benefits for the forthcoming year because of the way it is financed the smi fund including the part d account does not face insolvency although its rapid growth rate is drain on federal spending further continued premium increases may place financial burden on some beneficiaries the 2008 trustees report projects that under intermediate assumptions the hi trust fund will become insolvent in 2019 the report further states that beginning in 2004 tax income from payroll taxes and from the taxation of social security benefits began to fall below expenditures expenditures exceed total income each year beginning in 2008 except for 2009 if income falls short of expenditures costs are met by drawing on hi fund assets through transfers from the general fund of the treasury until the fund is depleted 45 trigger the rapid increases in total medicare costs has long been of concern to congress and others the trustees have emphasized the importance of examining the program as whole rather than just the hi trust fund of particular concern is the fact that over time the economy will be unable to support the increasing reliance on general revenues which in large measure come from taxes paid by the under65 population in response mma required the annual trustees report to include an expanded analysis of medicare expenditures and revenues specifically each year the trustees must determine whether general revenue financing will exceed 45 of total medicare outlays within the next seven years general revenue financing is defined as total medicare outlays minus dedicated financing sources ie hi payroll taxes income from taxation of social security benefits state transfers for prescription drug benefits premiums paid under parts b and d and any gifts received by the trust funds if the trustees determine that general revenue financing will exceed 45 of total financing within seven years an finding of excess general revenue funding is made the 2006 report projected that the 45 level would first be exceeded in fy2012 the 2007 report projected that it would first be exceeded in 2013 both findings were within the required sevenyear test period both reports therefore made determination of excess general revenue funding mma requires that if an excess general revenue funding determination is made for two successive years the president is required to submit legislative proposal to respond to the warning the proposal must be submitted within 15 days of submission of the next presidents budget unless during the intervening period legislation is enacted which eliminates such excess general revenue funding since warnings were issued in 2006 and 2007 the proposal was due within 15 days of submission of the presidents fy2009 budget in early 2008 crs31 the president submitted the required proposal in february 2008 it included provisions to increase part d premiums for higher income persons incorporate valuebased purchasing and modify the medical liability system the congress was required to consider the proposal on an expedited basis though passage of legislation within specific time frame was not required on july 24 2008 the house of representatives adopted resolution which provides that the expedited parliamentary procedures contained in mma shall not apply in the house during the remainder of the 110th congress the 2008 trustees report also contained funding warning therefore the president will be required to submit legislative proposal early in 2009 additional insurance coverage medicare provides broad protection against the costs of many primarily acute care services however the program does not cover all services which may be used by its aged and disabled beneficiaries medicare does not cover eyeglasses hearing aids dentures or most longterm care services further unlike most private insurance polices it does not include an annual catastrophic cap on outofpocket spending on costsharing charges for services covered under parts and b except for persons enrolled in regional ppos under mma prior to implementation of the drug benefit in 2006 the program generally covered only about onehalf of beneficiaries total health care expenses more recent data are not available most medicare beneficiaries have some coverage in addition to medicare the following are the main sources of additional coverage for medicare enrollees medicare advantage many ma plans offer services in addition to those covered under original medicare employer coverage coverage may be provided through current or former employer in recent years number of employers have cut back on the scope of retiree coverage some have dropped such coverage entirely particularly for future retirees as noted earlier the mma attempted to stem this trend by offering subsidies to employers who offer drug coverage at least as good as that available under part d see discussion above medigap individual insurance policies which supplement medicare are referred to as medigap policies beneficiaries with medigap insurance typically have coverage for portion of medicares deductibles and coinsurance they may also have coverage for some items and services not covered by medicare individuals generally select one of the standardized plans though not all plans are offered in all states medicaid certain lowincome medicare beneficiaries may also be eligible for full or partial benefits under their states medicaid program persons eligible for the full range of benefits known as crs32 the full dual eligibles generally have the majority of their health care expenses met through combination of coverage under the two programs medicare pays first with medicaid picking up most of the remaining costs certain other individuals are entitled to more limited protection under one of three medicaid savings programs the qualified medicare beneficiary qmb program pays medicare part b premiums and medicare costsharing charges for persons under 100 of poverty the specified lowincome medicare beneficiary slmb program pays part b premium charges for those between 100 and 120 of poverty while the qualified individual qi program pays such premiums for those between 120 and 135 of poverty other public sources individuals may have additional coverage through the department of veterans affairs or tricare for military retirees eligible for medicare and enrolled in part b in the years prior to implementation of the drug benefit close to 90 of beneficiaries had some form of additional coverage some persons may have had more than one type of such coverage more recent information is not available medicare directions the medicare program is likely to be the subject of continuing review for number of years both congress and the medicare trustees continue to register concern about the rapid rise in medicare spending and the ability of existing funding mechanisms to support the program over the longterm only the part fund faces an actual insolvency date however few observers believe that the programs total growth rate is sustainable over time the 2008 trustees report noted that total program expenditures which represented 31 of gdp in 2006 were expected to climb to 70 by 2035 and rise to 107 by 2080 it further noted that the level of program expenditures is expected to exceed that for social security in 2028 and be 85 more than the cost of that program by 2082 combination of factors have contributed to the rapid increase in medicare costs these include increases in overall medical costs advances in health care delivery and medical technology increases in the percentage of the population over 65 and longer life spans the trend is expected to accelerate in 2011 when the baby boom generation persons born between 1946 and 1964 begin to turn 65 and become eligible for medicare the issues confronting the program are not new nor are the possible responses likely to get any easier solutions involve raising taxes cutting benefits raising beneficiaries outofpocket costs or some combination of these approaches members of congress medicare trustees and many other observers continue to warn that the problems need to be addressed at the same time some members and beneficiary advocates express concern about the potential impact of any solution on beneficiaries outofpocket costs or access to needed services it seems likely that in the shortterm congress will focus its attention on specific medicare issues for example physician payment updates it may also crs33 consider medicare spending reductions as part of legislation such as budget reconciliation designed to reduce overall federal spending below specified levels over specific time period at the same time the administration congress and others may also examine broad range of policy options designed to achieve more long term reforms for number of years various options have been suggested however there is consensus on the approach that should be taken one option is placing increasing reliance on the private sector to deliver and manage benefits this is the approach first used for managed care options under part c more recently the new part d drug benefit gave increased flexibility to private entities within federallyestablished parameters individual entities design their benefit packages and determine payment amounts the intention is to encourage competition by allowing beneficiaries to select coverage that best meets their needs proponents claim that this will result in lower overall costs as well as enable the federal government to distance itself from the business of establishing detailed payment rules for each service category some members and other observers oppose the efforts to change the basic structure of medicare they contend that single nationwide benefit structure administered by the federal government has served beneficiaries well and should be retained they contend that any necessary savings for part and b services can be achieved within the context of the existing program and suggest that increased ma payments have actually increased overall program costs additionally some persons also suggest that savings could be achieved under part d if the federal government were allowed to enter into price negotiations with drug manufacturers at one time it was thought that the mma provision relating to an excess general revenue funding determination might have an impact on the medicare discussion this year for the second straight year the medicare trustees report had contained an excess general revenue funding determination under which general revenues are expected to be greater than 45 of outlays within the next seven years see financing section above as result the president was required to submit legislative proposal responding to the warning the president submitted the proposal in february 2008 mma had required expedited congressional action however on july 24 2008 the house of representatives adopted resolution which provides that the expedited parliamentary procedures contained in mma shall not apply in the house during the remainder of the 110th congress the 2008 trustees report also contained funding warning therefore under the mma provisions the president will be required to submit legislative proposal early in 2009 it should be noted that the mma provision defines general revenues as total outlays minus dedicated revenues primarily payroll taxes and premiums under this calculation increases in dedicated revenues andor reductions in outlays in any part of medicare will lower general revenues and can be used to meet the trigger requirements it should be noted that lowering part spending lowers both overall medicare spending and excess general revenue spending however if other changes were made spending under parts b and d and associated general revenue financing would represent larger proportion of total spending crs34 on the other hand legislation directed at general revenue financing under parts b and d will not address the pending insolvency of part which is funded primarily by payroll taxes it is therefore expected that congress will need to examine variety of options in the coming years key medicare statistics tables 13 show cbo estimates from the march 2008 medicare fact sheet which contains information on the various components of program spending cbo
