development block grant ccdbg1 the primary federal grant program funding child care is the ccdbg which was created in 1990 and reauthorized throug h fy2002 and substa ntially expanded in 1996 as part of welfare reform the ccdbg is overdue for reauthorization and the 110th congress has inherited this unf inished task although the 109th congress completed legislation to provide the mandatory funding portion for the ccdbg through fy2010 the ccdbg act itself whic h outlines the rules of program and includes the authorization leve l for discretionary funding awaits reauthorization inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33805crs2 2 for more detailed information on the ccdf fi nancing structure and early spending trends through fy2000 see crs report rl31274 child care funding and spending under federal block grants by melinda gishthe meantime discretionary funding s been provided via the appropriations process the ccdbg is administered by the department of health and human services hhs and provides formula block grants to states which use the grants to subsidize the child care expenses of families with children under age 13 if the parents are working or in school and family income is less than 85 of the state median in practice many states establish income eligibility levels that are lower than this federal threshold child care services are provided on sliding fee scale basis and parents may choose to receive assistance through vouchers or certificates which can be used with provider of the parents choice including religious providers and relatives states receiving ccdbg funds must tablish child care licensing standards although federal law does not dictate what these standards should be or what types of providers must be covered in add ition states must have health and safety requirements applicable to all providers receiving ccdbg subsidies that address prevention and control of infectious diseas building and physical premises safety and health and safety training for care give rs however federa l law does not dictate the specific contents of these requirements the ccdbg is funded through both discretionary and capped entitlement mandatory grants referred to in combination as the child care and development fund ccdf and state maintenanceofe ffort moe and matching requirements apply to part of the entitlement funds2 states must use at least 4 of their total funds to improve the quality and availability of child care and according to statute must target 70 of entitlement funds on we lfare recipients working toward self sufficiency or families at risk of welfare dependency however because all families falling below the 85 of state median income requirement can be categorized as at risk the 70 targeting of the welfar or atrisk population does not necessarily mean welfare families must be served in theory all funds may be used for low income nonwelfare working families ho wever state plans indicate that many states guarantee child care to welfare families more than 5 of state allotments may be used for state administrative costs the fy2006 appropriations act for th departments of labor hhs and education pl 109149 included roughly 21 billion in discretionary funding for the ccdbg an acrosstheboard rescissi on of 1 brought the precise total to 2062 billion the fourth and final cr p l 1105 covering fy2007 maintained discretionary funding at the 21 billion level mandatory or entitlement ccdbg funding beginning in fy2003 throug h fy2005 was provided at the fy2002 rate 2717 billion for the year under series of
