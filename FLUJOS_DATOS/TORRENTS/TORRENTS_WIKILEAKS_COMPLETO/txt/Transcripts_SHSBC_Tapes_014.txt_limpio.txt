subject shsbc 14 date 15 mar 2000 003012 0000 from anonymousremailerseecommentheader fzba organization mail2newsnymaliasnet newsgroups altclearingtechnologyaltreligionscientology seminar withholds lecture given on 14 june 1961 thank you all right this is the 14th of june 1961 i have to be careful with these dates you see i get stuck on cause you see on the prehav scale and i would say it was the 15th of june you see it might become the 15th of june and itd cost everybody days pay you see but for certain fee from some large corporation okay very good im sure that you have lot of very highly integrated questions of one kind or another that are springing fullarmed ready to shed light in all directions in short any questions female voice yes yes female voice what would happen if you are giving security check to preclear and you tell him that you will destroy the paper afterwards with the with his answers on it and does he get benefit solely from having been made free to talk to the auditor all right female voice or are you taking away from him all right here we are youve asked whether or not if we destroyed the paper or told the pc if we destroyed the paper of security check immediately after we gave him the security check we would destroy the value of the security check period we have told him at the same moment and the same instant that we are going to withhold for him and all weve done is just do vague little onestage release you will see difference if you care to make the experiment some time waste some time assure somebody that you will never tell soul that wild horses would never drag any part of these withholds away from you that you will destroy all record of it and get brainwashed immediately after youve given the session and watch the fact that he doesnt even get tone arm reaction got it you see there are eight dynamics and in auditing you are actually only concentrating on the third dynamic auditing is third dynamic activity now the third dynamic is good enough because his withholds are mainly on the third dynamic but someday youre going to run into somebody who is real loop who is busy withholding from god and oddly enough he will tell you about the withholds perhaps in some kind of sotto voce that is designed not to be overheard by the gods lurking in the various chairs and furniture you see or on the naked pedestal or something of that sort or he wont tell you at all because god might overhear him and god as we all know is everyplace including the sewer pipes well its true if god was everywhere hed also be in the sewer pipes andim sorry to make nothing out of this situation but im afraid somebody beat to the draw i think couple of thousand years ago somebody made nothing out of religion in grand way they invented totally invisible religion and its very interesting everybody of course has had trouble with it ever since the general point about security check is the fact that you have not stressed this now you should understand that when you are doing joburg security check you are not doing failed withholdyoure not running failed withhold on the person at all you should understand what the character is as long as youve opened up this whole subject ill give you digression okay ive answered the other question the answer is ixnay the fellow says well i dont dare tell you because you might tell somebody else you say thats so i might uuuuuudududududu well i cant tell you then and you would just instantly see the fact that it is withhold on more than one dynamic all right lets go into this why are you giving security checks what is the exact process you are running in giving security checks it probably occurred to you before now that you were running failed withhold on the pc that would be your first conclusion that you were actually running failed withhold actually these the individual is withholding these things isnt he so making him give them up of course would give him failed withhold right well you could look at it this way that isnt the process youre running at all the process youre running is the old old old native state notknowknow cycle we have achieved as i was telling peter little while ago the level of complexity and the level of simplicity necessary to resolve case now im not telling you its perfect absolutes are unobtainable but i think youll find itll move all cases i dont think youll have any real difficulty with it you wont go home sweating over some pc all night long youll know very well that when you audit him the next morning on whatever youre doing youll get whatever it is that type of confidence and relaxation has already moved in on you see ive been straining for eleven years trying to achieve some sort of asomething that auditors could and would do and we were never short on theory and we were never short on what was wrong with the preclears i brought you up with dull yank the other day i told you we were addressing the reactive mind and you better not go on auditing analytical minds because theres nothing wrong with them nothing wrong with them except they can be influenced by the reactive mind well you say well you can shortcircuit this and fix the guy up so he cant be influenced at all by the reactive mind well thats fine get your pc in state of noeffect and that is how the lamaists and so forth achieve serenity you put the pc in noeffect total noeffect total serenity jam those two levels up and you have lamanot the kind thats bleating back and forth over the andes and causing so much trouble to the authorities down there and the sanitation authorities but the other type now here is youryour plowin on the basis the individual must be able the individual must be ableto get some kind of response he must be able to experience if person cannot experience person cannot live and thats why you look at these abbots of monasteries and they look like dried up mummies this is why when you finally collide with the pope piuses and so forth of this world they have myopia see theyre educated into total analytical effect from the appetites and horrors of the soul huhhuhhuh see now this is the generality it is possible to plow somebody in on level and make them look good dont desert that datum know that datum well it is possible to plow somebody in absolutely fix them on level and make them look good do you understand you could plow some radio announcer in on communication so that he would never do anything but communicate you know narrow the whole prehav scale down to one thing communicate hes got to communicatetalkcommunicate and hed be good radio announcer until he dropped dead which would be in short period of time but thats all right people are expendable thats the way theyve looked at it dont you see its whats known as educationeducation by fixation on the other hand the fellow actually couldnt communicate if you did that why because his communication thereafter would be harmful because its too fixated hes too concentrated on this one thing he has to be able to do everything on the prehav scale youre not trying to fix him up so he can do nothing on the prehav scale youre trying to fix him up so that he could do anything on the prehav scale now the fact that his ethic repairs by reason of processing you of course have done away with the impulses to do very vicious things on the eight dynamics you see and having done away with these vicious things he nevertheless can relax on the whole situation in other words you have restored fluidity and action as result of inspection not action as result of inhibition the whole world right now is running on action as result of inhibition and youve got crime and wars and religion you got all kinds of things going on all right now action as result of inspection by person who is ethical gives you an entirely new viewcompletely entirely new view of human conduct because its longer human conduct its more the conduct of of an able being thats what youre doing when you get up to the level of clear and oddly enough what youre doing with security check does not appear as such anywhere on the prehav scaleexcept want to know but that is the closest shadow to it and it really is not the same thing at all because thats curiosity all right therefore there is some kind of rationale or theory which stands out and beyond the prehav scale and we have run it ragged and we have done everything necessary to resolve the case with it and we have put it in the hands of auditors and they have gotten nowhere with it it is level of simplicity which cannot be achieved in the practical world it is perfect theory theres nothing wrong with the theory of native state there are four stages theres lot of literature on this by the when is it 1958 isnt it fifty male voice two female voice nineteen fiftythree fiftytwo well thats wayfiftytwo fiftythree its back that far male voice yes sir well we were practicing it like mad and did an awful lot of processing with it in 57 and 58 if i remember rightly and we did lot of work with that we ran it on an awful lot of cases and so forth and it was over here in england probably in 57 58 you remember it the native state is total knowingness and the native state deteriorates by the person postulating that he wont know and then this becomes necessity to know in other words he has to know because well hes postulated that he doesnt know you got the idea there are actually about four stages they harmonic forget is part of this harmonic scale see thats dontknow thats cantknow see thats withhold from selfforget is so all and remember by the way is know and now youre down on the harmonics and i think their levelsive forgotten what they are five or six or something like this anyway these are the native state harmonics and we theres terrific simplicity to all this but lookahere we have simplicities that nobody has been able to make work because they were so simple and their generality was so expansive that as long as they were in this terribly simple state they were nonfunctional do you realize all you have to do is run on preclear theoretically tell an intention that failed tell an intention that succeeded thank you tell an intention that failed tell an intention that succeeded thank you and theoretically youd clear him all the way along the line so much for your onebuttons theoretically i told you yesterday there was such thing as onebutton well thats as close as there is to it because its right up there at the top of the axioms see and it is it is if person could run this he runs like startled gazelle but its something like an ot process you see it is too complicated for anybody to plumb the reactive mind with it is something like trying to take wand of light and stir mud pool and you put the wand of light where did it go it takes certain level of complexity to do anything with the case at all now we have been resolving cases since the end of january 1961 with considerable ease but we had to attain necessary level of complexity and i have been trying to attain level of complexity that is acceptable ever since january of 1961 in other words you have to attain the optimum simplicity and the optimum complexity at the same time you see that the complexity is very necessary part of the entire operation so theres sense in going off swinging into the high theory of it all and running on nothing but total high theory because weve been there we have lived there we furnished house there and we sure didnt collect any rent and we didnt pay any and nothing happened why it is level of simplicity which exceeds the difficulties of the individual youll find personthe worse off person is or the more clear they are you know the bottom harmonic or the top seethe more you have to go into the secondary scale and in the middle band you can just run the primary scale person is getting along fine and his needle is pretty loosegood secondary scale the hell with it just take it straight you see but if theyre having bad time in any way about anything you better assess the secondary or if theyre coming clear youd certainly better assess the secondary because these little particularities are still hung up and do you know how many buttons there are well theres all the buttons of beingness which are infinite theres every verb that man has ever used or any being has ever used on the whole trackthats your doingness and thats pretty near an infinity thats lots and then theres anything anybody could have or not have now thats how many buttons there are and if you want to get yourself if i had that calculator id probably be able to rack up enough numbers to represent it by saying that they were binary digits and by saying that they were powers they were this many binary digit powers of 10 or powers of billion or something see and thered be that many buttons now thats lot of buttons in other words theyre in three categories beingness doingness and havingness and each one of those categories has near infinity when an individual gets fixated on one of these things there isnt anything else there isnt anything else anyplace there is nothing else to be inspected so you try to tell him that this is part of generality called intention so therefore you say well you silly fool you say you want to make your wife happy you keep saying this or you want to make your cat eat more cream now youyou just keep saying this all right now were just going to run when has one of your intentions failed to influence your wife when has one of your intentions failed to influence your cat and well just run this up and of course itll straighten up the whole track because youre obviously fixated on it and hell say to you all right seems reasonable trouble with it is its reasonable it isnt it isnt in the reactive mind that way it doesnt stack up that way intention doesnt stack up anyplace in the reactive mind but the cat doesnt even stack up to cream the cat stacks up to gateposts and thats why the mind is reactive all horses sleep in beds you see now youre trying to force an association upon the fellow that he cannot grasp reactively even though he can grasp it intellectually and so it doesnt do anything for the case at all so analytically we can say well thats very easy all i have to do is run intentions on this fellow run failed intentions successful intentions and that sort of thing even run brackets of intention and hed be clear theres nothing to it one button and rons all wrong and thats it blehblehbleh oh man weve been there the trouble with mental research from this point on is sort of this way every time you get to brandnew frontier you find our footprints all over the place its like members of the explorers club have occasionally remarked on this they get in the darkest reaches of borneo you see at the end of most horrendous trek that was surrounded with heroic deeds in all directions and when they finally get to this littleknown hamlet in the middle of the extinct and forbidden volcano where theres headhunters still abound and so forth chinese merchant comes out and offers to sell them some coffee im afraid were now in the category of the chinese merchant because boy we sure covered some ground here in thein the lastwell actually the last thirty years and certainly in the last eleven and this is one of the conclusions about it that there is certain complexity necessary to process and if that complexity doesnt exist in the process it becomes nonfunctional at reactive level even though it might be theoretically feasible at an analytical level understand that so the process must be complicated enough to work on the reactive mind and simple enough to be administered and thatyou can describe the optimum state of necessary routine or regimen and youve got them in routine 1 routine 2 and routine 3 and youve got the whole package there is nothing outstanding from that thats how complicated youve got to get and thats how simple you can become and its just hung right there in space at that level of complexity or that level of simplicity of course it looks terribly simple compared to somebody that had to know thousand processes to only have to know about eight different operations and pooh you can do that and if hes using the right one of the operations to match the case his judgment isnt too much assaulted these days because its done by graph it doesnt even have to be done by emeter you dont even have to judge the case by it you can pick up graph and say well that case has to be run on soandso youll be right and furthermore it leaves margin for error you can use all three routines on all types of cases with only the difference that they some work faster than others so this is quite remarkable piece of complexity that weve achieved here do you see that now do you see why it is that way the cchs we made the cchs much more complex youll find old lists of processes called the cchs and youll findoh i dont know how many there were of them and there were b c d versions of each cch and so forth an unnecessary complexity cchs ceased to work when they got that complicated but the original cchs1 2 3 4with the exact method of application which is by clause 13 of the auditors code dont run process that is not producing change and run process as long as it produces change and as long as youve got that one in and run the cchs like that in sequencei 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4itll always work youll find some cases by the way run this way in the cchs they apparently are flat all of them none of them apparently working because the change is so microscopic youre not getting any change remember the beginning of the process on the tone arm at the beginning of process on the tone arm in case thats stuck up bit sticky on the needle and so on at the beginning of the caseyou get tone arm motion and if you leave the thing saying well its twenty minutes it hasnt moved hadnt moved hell it hadnt started but it started little bit and it started so slightly you dont even notice the difference but it has started slightly and now all of sudden you can expect this case probably somewhere up the line to be terribly unflat and uneven on the cchs you see that theyd go from apparently nothing happening at the beginning of the cchs as you run through the line they run to more happening and more happening and more happening and more happening and then theyyou get up to point where they all bite1 2 3 and 4although they are flattening more rapidly theyre all biting now and theyre biting hard and then gradually theyll start dropping out again and then youll suddenly notice an entirely different aspect in the pc its just like an emeter you see you flatten them they can go from nochange to change to nochange and that is the cycle of motion that you ordinarily run into you see this by the way on every level that you start be moment or two even if its only tenth of second when theres change of the process and then it starts to change you see well that tenth of second could also be ten hours see its the right level and youre running it and you know its the right level and its producing great shift of the tone arm youll notice however that the tone arm is shifts slightly more and more and more even though it apparently isnt really shifting very much at all then all of sudden it shifts more and more and more and more and now youve got really what youd consider good tone arm motion and then that gradually fades out less and less and less and less and less and less and stop now its flat to run it any longer than this produces change on the case all right now im talking about these simplicities im talking about these complexities for the reason that i notice tendency in general in the worldnot necessarilynot with you to chase after an identification which peculiarly fits an individual case they want total identification of everything to one button well look on it as an identification as close as you can get to an identification is axioms 1 and 2 you go to little less dense an identification you get 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 because thats total agreement we all agree on those things so it must be hell of roaring identification you see so we all agree on those things its quite normal you know like gravity gravity gravity is normal well gravity to somebody that didnt have the thing wrong with him called gravity and wasnt having any trouble with gravity and wasnt flying off planets either would think that your ideas of gravity were quite psychotic you can take somebody who is in fairly good shape hed have looked at even einstein and said the man is raving lunatic look at the things this fellow believes in well just look him over he believes water runs downhill its not necessarily true but everybody agrees you see even the water does the most fantastic things happen by the way to mest when you violate its laws im not now talking about find some way where it will do something different water is trying to run downhill and you say whats this you know pthooh the water does the funniest thingit becomes solidly gluey becomes pf lop it looks like big globs of gelatin suddenly you get the idea i mean youve violated any basics on which it was running and it changes the characteristic of the mass because it believes that it is longer it although there is ability to believe in it but the basic intentions that are built into it have been invalidated and the second they are it changes characteristic quite interesting all right now what are we getting at here were still talking about the security even if circuitously but this data is necessary to you very the security check is running the notknow off the case that it has run on everybody and everything for god knows how long and when youre doing security check youre running the native state cycle of sequences youre not running withholds at all youre saying to this character hey bud lets find the overt acts you have committed in inhibiting other peoples knowingness lets look at typical withhold the guy says well i robbed store once he admits to this do you know what lies behind that it isnt that he stole something or disobeyed the law or did something like this has nothing to do with it whatsoever the overt act consists of putting notknow violent and vicious notknow into the third dynamic clank all right he says he robbed the store lets see what happened lets see what really happened lets forget about the pc now lets find out what happened on the third dynamic the next morning the storekeeper comes in and finds his premises knocked apart now he doesnt really know what happened and he tries to scout it out and he looks for the jimmymarks on the door and few things of this character but he cant really make it out because hes expert and he doesnt know whats happened and hes kind of in state of shock about all this furthermore his survival has been threatened and so forth but he doesnt know what has happened thats the thing he doesnt know what has happened to his store and also another thing has been entered in on it he doesnt know when its going to happen again theres the third dynamic overt see all right in addition to that he goes and he calls up the police and he says is this sergeant doakes all right very good sergeant doakes i have robbery downimwhat did you say well yeah oh you were yawning there we have robbery down here and the police say oh god and we have to get up and well lose our swivelchair spread and and they say well the taxpayer and they come down and they dont care anything about it just now theyve been leading perfectly good smooth police existence you know do nothing see nothing you know be ineffective to hell with the crime theyve been doing all right and they get down to the store and now they get notknow run on them instantly they say to the shopkeeper what happened and the shopkeeper says i dont know so the police go tearing around looking all over by rules of evidence for the jimmy marks and measuring the footprints and taking the hired girls plaster casts of her finger marks or whatever they do and they accumulate this vast store of useless bricabrac called evidence and then they dont know either and it goes into the police files that somewhere in the third dynamic in this particular area there is somebody who robs stores but we dont know who it is and an invented notknow you see has occurred in that particular area and these accumulate and they eventually wind up to become the aberration of society which cant trust each other which cant produce which cant do anything and theres where its broken down its broken down on vicious violent and dangerous notknows do you see that all right so you got this pc sitting in the chair and the first time you go over thisyou go over this security checkhell get to all these realizations eventually see and the first time you go over the security check you say well have you ever stolen anything have you ever burgled and entered at first hed stolen anythinghe didnt get anything on it burgled and enteredall of sudden about the third security check you give him this thing goes tick you say well what was that uhrrr i robbed store once all right well now have you ever burgled and entered thats it i robbed store once in some mysterious way he cant account for he feels better why does he feel better hes gotten off an overt known as creating ignorance so as he goes up the line youre not through with that question yet several security checks later if your processing is really biting like mad you hit this thing and you say have you ever burgled and entered anything and you get plong and you say where on earth did this come from now lets see hes told about robbing the store and youso you say well what was that yeah i probably worried those people yeah that probably wasnt so good you know all of sudden whats he finally come up to hes finally coming up to realize that he entered notknow into the society but he expresses it now as worrying somebody well time goes on and in the process of processing other things happen and you come to this question again somewhere up the line in new security check and you say to the individual have you ever burgled and entered anything you say well hes told about robbing the store and hes told about worrying people there certainly can be nothing left on this you know this man is getting to be near clear right about that time you know ive just been preventing people from finding anything out for years they never did catch up on i bet thats still down in those police records yeah i guess they just wouldnt know he will tell you at the same time that his memory is improving isnt that an odd thing you give man security check and his memory improves well naturally it improves because youve got the overts of running dontknow cantknow off and youve run the overts of him making people stupid so eventually he got to be stupid so his iq goes up and his memory gets better because forget is an harmonic of notknow you get how this thing works out all right you say well why dont you just run on the fellow directly what could you not know thank you what could you not know thank you what could you not know we have people by the ton who have been run on this and never got any better see empirically it has actually worked out its matter of record they didnt get any better their graphs didnt shift around enough and yet we run security check and all of sudden the needle loosens up and the person starts feeling better and wham i remember an air force major who all of sudden turned up on my front doorstep and wouldnt tell his name it was very weird i did i went along with this just as gag almost but i processed him every afternoon for an hour and at the end of the hourbecause he couldnt give his name and address you see and it was all notknow anyhow and everybody why hed hand fiftydollar bill which is kind ofvery amusing handing money anyhowbecause i dontnormally will take the money because its curious and wondering what the reactions are with regard to giving and separating the money for instance i charged somebody one time i told somebody id cure his stuttering and he was buggering around boggling and yapping about curing it and so forth so i said well it would cost him five hundred dollars well this made it worthwhile but he couldnt possibly give five hundred dollars you see how this thing works out this washe was incapable of doing this so to cure his stuttering five hundred dollars you see if id cured his stuttering he knew he would feel obligated to pay something even though i didnt ask for anything you got the idea this was the way it added up in his mind anyway so i charged him five hundred dollars but now he couldnt have any processing because the next item on the agenda was that he couldnt separate from five hundred dollars he had five hundred dollars he had lots of fivehundreddollarses but he couldnt separate from this so what i did was process him and i cured his inability to have or give money and then hethen he paid the five hundred dollars and i cured his stammering and then gave him the five hundred dollars back again i never told anybody this whole story and he started to stammer instantly i didnt care about the five hundred dollars you see very amusing same guy i pulled the same gaganother gag on him i hypnotized himthis was early in researchand turned his stuttering off like that hypnotists do this rather well the guy goes around in total fog after this you see but he can talk just fine of course he cant think of anything to say but and i said he would cease to stutter until i said the word boggleboo or something to him it was very funny i called him up on the phone and he was at work he worked in shipyard and i called him up on the phone and he answered the phone and cheerily cheerily he was saying well well well how are you today ron yes oh im getting along fine everything is going along fine i said boggleboo and he said bububububububu whawhat did you ssssssssssssssssasssssssssssay interesting ideas of posthypnotic suggestion and so forth actually he felt much better after he didnt have to not stutter theres telling what he might say if he had to go on talking its very interesting and later on this five hundred dollar gag came up anyway he got along fine he won in the long run but this air force major with his fifty dollars at the end of every sessionnot knowing the mans name not knowing anything about him who had been sent in from someplace or anotherid give him an hours session all of sudden i pulled off this tremendous overt he was talking motivator motivator father motivator and all of sudden i pulled this tremendous fantastic overt he had come in and his old man evidently had had couple of drinks and he had just this had been just few years before he had just rolled up his sleeves and beaten the old guy to pulp just plastered the blood all over the walls and at the moment he did this why it was just phessseew boy the relief just fell off of him and lay in pools in the auditing room you know you could just feel it wow man and that was the end of that id really done something he knew that and he gave this fifty dollar bill i used to throw them in an ash tray along there and i added it to the pile and he disappeared and i never saw him interesting thing that was the first time although wed been working with overts rather continuously that i actually got into case that experienced 100 percent total recovery on having gotten rid of one overt these cases are rare but they happen often enough to make the freuds of the world and the roman catholic church hopeful so anytime you do anything wrong you can always go whisper it into secret confessional which guarantees to destroy the confession you know they have these little private boxes and the priest sits in the middle box actually and the person sits on one box and the other person sits on the other box and they both talk in and they dont know whether the priest is listening or not you get the notknow you get how the church has qedandaed with the notknow of the withhold of the confessional got the idea so its very easy to qanda with the notknow of notknow see its very easy he sayshes right away thinking look at all the notknow ive run on everybody i want everybody to notknow this so hell ask you to destroy it or hold it secret or something hes saying notknow and youre saying all right notknow now he tells you of course you havent run notknow because youve still got notknow thats the end of that there isnt any any argument further but there is your levels of simplicity your levels of complexity and there is your basic purpose and rationale lying behind the johannesburg security check i have found by experience that auditors could not and do not run presession 37 as whole effectively they do not run it they try their hearts are in it but bless them there is one thing they wont do they just wont imagine theres that much evil in the world and you actually have to tailor up the questions and thats all it amounts to so presession 37 is put into the complexity called johannesburg security check or processing check now auditors will run those like dream theyre fine you understand in the first place its much better to run it on list of questions because youre notknowing notknow on yourself all the time youre sitting looking at the pc and youre saying well lets see what do i not know about this person you have to keep creating the notknows that you not know about the person now why do that to everybody give them list of all of the mean nasty vicious notknows that they ever could possibly have run on the world at large and lets go down that list with horrdrdrdr on the idea and leave nothing left to the imagination therefore youre not running notknow on the auditor because he knows what hes going to ask you see now he doesnt immediately know what hes going to find out but he can sure guess but he doesnt have to worry about it dont you see so he can audit then something like presession 37 in its virgin simplicity he can actually audit in more complex form which is far easier for him to do and he will do this and they do good job of this so there is your security check now i dont guarantee that i wont add some questions to this check or change the form of the check i dont guarantee that at all but i also guarantee im not going to change the existence of the check or the type of question in it and youre liable to get short security checks in processing how short they should be for optimum i dont know but itd be something like page and on that page there is sample rundown which would also include each time you see actually its the tenpage joburg in ten pages but each one has few more questions added on to it that gives you the generalitieslike the end questions of the joburg are on every one of these pages dont you see now youve got stack of security check form 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and you could give person one or two of them and if you were covering the lot which you would have to do youd have to cover the lot eventually you nevertheless can give them section of the lot so actually these would be put out in little booklets of all pages and you mark the pcs name on your mimeograph or your booklet and then you could give them page of it at crack and this is very good for cchs see you flatten cch and you give them page of security check and you flatten cch and give them page of the security check and you flatten cch and give them page of the security check you see it speeds up the amount but in not knowing right now what the optimum administering factor isnot knowing exactly what is the optimum of the situationyou havent got the form yet and you probably wont have until ive done enough experimentation with it to find out what is an optimum or average situation between processing and the other you also might eventually get the complexity of different kinds of security checks for different routines so that you might have security check for routine 2 and different security check for routine 3 and security check for routine 1 we are already running into trouble because we havent got them the security check for routine 3 is finding entirely different withholds as the person runs on goals terminal entirely different types of withholds than you will pull off somebody who is running on routine 1 theyre entirely different types and if you dont somewhere halfway up through running sop goals start asking for somebody for full track withholds the case just absolutely goes berserk he just practically goes out of his mind because he remembers clearly mysteriously in his little lonely self going into an enemy town and setting the torch to the whole thing and nobody ever knew who did it he remembers this all of sudden and he cant tell the auditor about it because its withhold so you ask him and then you keep saying well is it in this lifetime all right what withhold have you got in this lifetime in this lifetime have you ever burned anything down in this lifetime he says rather doggedly but there was this town and it was about two or three thousand years ago and we were camped outside this town and i went in and thought itd be good idea and you say now was that in this lifetime and the fellow says nope huuuuuuu so what have you done to him youve made it impossible for him to get off his whole track withholds at time he starts remembering them so his memory on the whole track then becomes occluded and its only the notknow he has run on everybody by picking up bodies and by murder rape arson and sudden death back along the whole track that has got his whole track shut off this is the answer to whole track memory whole track memory depends upon some gradient scale of whole track security checking got it so itd be another kind of security check coming out but itd be administered the same way the directions on it would be what type of security check it was and when you gave it and that sort of thing under what conditions so that youd probably wind up with little battery of tests of one character or another you see that fits the immediate occasion and so you gave the wrong one all right damage is done got the notion now and you see what this security check is all about youre not running failed withhold youre running the notknows off of the case and these are the ones that matter this also should answer the mystery which will come up sooner or later to youthis other mystery why when they give you some withholds they feel better and why when they give you others they dont and what is withhold well withhold is running dontknow or cantknow on others or on oneself see on some dynamic youve run dontknow cantknow mustntknow and those withholds when they come offwhen the overt act has been overtly cantknow or dontknow on anybody else dont you seeboy that thing hangs up like fire drill and when it comes off the case does terrific resurge you see it wasnt that this air force major beat up his father that caused the air force major to be aberrated his father didnt know why he was being beaten up the air force major never informed any of the neighbors or any in the family why the old man was in this kind of condition the old man was so ashamed of the thing that he never told anybody who beat him up you get the idea this thing was sown from one end to the other with cantknow so when it released it released like conger rocket and yet you got this fellow in wartime maiming shooting killing burning having ball getting medals in wartime for what he would have gone to jail for in second in peacetime its so funny its wonder people get confused you know there are times when things are noble and times when the same action is crime and ignoble so you get mixed up in the good and bad of it all and the individual is liable to be so plowed in about the good and bad of all of his actions that when you ask him this youll get this mystery hitting you in the face unless you know the basic answer to it why when they are released do some withholds cause case to improve so markedly and why do other withholds when released dontwhy they dont do thing for the case and the answer is is really not who is he withholding it from the answer is who is he notknowing with it you see its not even really withhold hes doing something quite overt hes making notknow occur in his vicinity and as hes making notknow occur in his vicinity he of course gets damned stupid about it now you get your other phenomenon of new questions appearing all the time of course as the person can take more responsibility for things he is less unwilling to prevent everybody from knowing so as he comes up the line he includes himself in the dynamics so he finds out about the things he has done and you get whole track memory being recovered but as his responsibility comes up then he of course begins to realize something about what notknows hes run on everybody and there is your machinery that whirs and clanks back of the joburg security check which is apparently at first glance merely police interrogation of some kind or another and its very very complex machinery and its based on this terrible simplicity that doesnt workas simplicity that doesnt work audited on people they never fall through on it at all in the first place they never get off their dontknows and cantknows and all that sort of thing they just wont audit that way thats all i know weve tried itno case gains okay so much for that that make any sense to you audience voices yes sure does all right we havent got any time for it but give one more question yes male voice the guy the guy that puts in substitute false knowingness like you know one of the worlds worst liars yeah yeah well that isnt the same breed of cat male voice what happens to him that is only making time mess up youre only messing up time some editor one time said i was professional liar as writer you know perfectly true perfectly true when one is writing fiction stories one is lying if you want to look at it that way but lets take look at this strained situation that editor was rather bad off by the way lets take look at it you werent at all you were creating and that would make all of life lie if it were wrong to tell romanticized episode do you see that male voice i feel better already yeah but all life would instantly be lie because what is it but an invented romanticized episode your whole life is an invented episode youre sitting way back there someplace with some little gears going one kind or another now i will invent the next chapter in the history of george all right now what you do what do you do here yeah thats right male voice well i arrived at that but its small comfort to yeah actually i suppose to some degreeto some degree an individual im sure our aesthetics are ordinarily dismayed because he does such terribly bad job of writing sometimes the script through which he is walking is so soap opera that it just offends our aesthetics and if you looked at auditingif auditing is an overt act it is really just literary criticism of the life this fellow was authoring for himself day by day and hes just going to get worse and worse as writer we know that too so this we cannot contemplate you see so the literary quality of it is whats under the gun of course speaking very very facetiously but you could look at it with this idiotic side panel i looked this over when he toldthis man told i was professional liar i looked this over years afterwards i remembered this one way or the other and i wondered what button here was awry was time being messed up or was what being messed up or was anything being messed up was there anything wrong in other words with writing fiction story well lets get the intentions behind it the intention is to amuse and to inform it doesnt look to like thats very aberrative and it isnt and it isnt and the only thing you could find in it that is slightly awry in writing fiction story is youre preventing the reader to intrigue him from knowing the end of the story throughout itwhereas you do and that is the only notknow that you are running on situation but the intention is so far from being vicious that the aberrative quality of it is zero is there anything wrong then with romanticizing in writing well if theres anything wrong at all its because youre creating and the action of creating sometimes can wind you up bit in the soup you see yourthe effort to create the effort to produce andsometimes can be traced back along the create line to being aberrative just like people apparently cant run step 6 but i call something to your attention i must myself have had idea whatsoever that there was any difficulties with creation on the part of anybody yet you find people who were sitting square at create on the prehav scalethe very few of themmade it necessary to withdraw all of step 6 it is not inevitable that the person goes into the soup because he makes something if it were why would hobby therapy make people so happy you got the idea and why is it that youre so miserable when you arent doing something or making something you see all these things add up to different key but it does mean that people can have the create button on the prehav scale badly out and actually get terrible masses accumulating in their vicinity the second they get the idea of creating you see and this is not necessarily true that this happens to everybody you canthink of the number of people on whom creative processing mockup processingwas run and think of the remarkable results that you can get with the stuff weve cured alcoholism with it and weve done all kinds of weird things with it do you understand but there are enough people around who just go mnuuuuh you know their whole bank gets tough now you can actually make bank pretty up and you can make bank get tough and you can do it wrong and you can give the tests of the thing and you can do various things with it to move it in but it isnt necessarily wrong if you tell lie to obscure your own guilt ahh were talking about something else now now were talking about running one catastrophic notknow not only do we rob the store but we tell people that somebody else did it so notknow is compounded with false knowingness and the individual who has done this particular type of operation eventually winds up with horrible feeling of unreality he feels hes fraud or he feels hes he feels hes in pretense he feels all life is really pretense isnt it and what hes tried to dothe only thing hes tried to dois deny his own responsibility dont you see by first hes run big notknow on everybody so they couldnt find out what it is and then hes compounded this and gone right in on top of it by giving them false knowingness that assigns piece of knowingness that doesnt exist which obscures the other knowingness and boy is he getting complicated by this time and when you pull that on the security check youll get whooooooew wow
