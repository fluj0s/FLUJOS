introduction there is single method that the house must employ in calling up or considering proposed legislation article i secti on 5 of the constitution allows each house of congress to determine for itself the rules of its proceedings and the house has used this freedom to provide itsel f several alternative procedur for raising measures for consideration these procedures allow the h ouse to tailor its cons ideration depending on the circumstances and content of the measure when measure is reported by house committee it is placed on calendar tax authorization and ppropriation measures are placed on the union calendar socalled because such measures must be considered in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union known as the committee of the whole1 other matters go on the house calendar these calendars are essentially lists of measures that committees have recommended for further consideration by the house it would be virtually impossible for the house to consider all of the propos ed legislation on these lists and it would be equally impractical for the house to attempt to consider each of these measures in the order in which they appear on these lists th erefore the house has evolved system for establishing priorities this system is based on concept called privilegehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20067crs2 2 privileged reports by the committee on rules are further specified in rule xiii clause 6the rules and practices of the house provi five methods by which measure may be raised for consideration measure may be brought to the floor as privileged matter under the limited privilege of special calenda r or day under suspension of the rules under the terms of special ru or by unanimous consent privileged measures house rule xiv clause 1 specifies daily order of business for the house to follow in practice that order is not us ually observed because house rules also specify several types of measures that are privileged and therefore may interrupt the order of business these types of measures may be called up on the floor wh enever another matter is not already pending they are then considered only when the house agrees to do so by agreeing to unanimous consent request voting to resolve into committee of the whole in the case of general appropriation bills or raising and voting on the question of consideration in this way the house give s precedence to important classes of business without losing its power to decide by major ity vote to consider any measure it chooses currently privileged measures include bills and resolutions reported under the right of committee to report at any time rule x iii clause 5a this category includes general appropriations bills continuing resolutions after september 15 concurrent resolutions on the

against the government and immigration problems such measures are privileged for consideration on the first and third tuesdays of each month rule xv clause 5 the speaker is required to direct the clerk to call measures on the private calendar on the first tuesday but consideration on the third tuesday is discretionary consideration of measures on the private calendar may also be dispensed with on either the first or th ird tuesday by twothirds vote on days when the private calendar is privileged the speaker directs the clerk to call each bill on the private calendar the measur are then passed by unanimous consent with little or debate if member objects if one member objects the measure is passed over without prejudice fo r later consideration if two or more members object the measure is automatically recommitted to the committee that reported it the rule also allows that on the third tuesday omnibus measures embodying those private bills that have been previously rejecte d may have preference although this procedure is now rarely used each party appoints members curren tly three as official objectors to act as watchdogs over private legislation calendar wednesday the calendar wednesday procedure is rarely used by the house today also known as the call of committees this rule allows committee to overcome what it feels is inaction or indifference by the majority lead ership or the rules committee or both if the house wishes to consider measure rul xv clause 7 the rule allows each committee in turn to call up bills not otherwise privileged that have been reported but that have not reached the house floor through more conventional route under modern practice the call of committees is routinely dispensed with by unanimous consent suspension of the rules

the second and fourth mondays of month and may be called up by any memberby the adoption of special rule there is requirement limiting suspension motions to measures reported from committees suspension motion may be debated fo r 40 minutes equally divided between proponent and opponent may not be amended from the floor although the motion itself may include changes to the measure and must pass by twothirds vote of those present and voting the suspension procedure effectively waives all rules of the house that would prevent consideration of measure so that points of order may be made against the measure on the house floor unlike other special days the suspension procedure is not designed to grant limited privilege to specific class of legislati on or empower the house to circumvent recalcitrant committee or leadership the speak ers authority with regard to suspension motions is not limited by the rules of the hous rules and guidelines adopted by the house party caucuses however theoreti cally place some limits on the use of the procedure the rules of the house democratic caucus for example among other limits direct the democratic leadership not to co nsent
