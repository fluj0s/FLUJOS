samples represent approximately 900 patient records which include procedures that disrupt the function of the fallopian tubes but are not accompanied by the v252 diagnostic code in these cases one needs to examine the accompanying diagnostic and procedure codes to more clearly distinguish pathological treatments from contraceptive sterilization for example the patient in row 2 had live birth and pathology is indicated that would require sterilization through disruption of the fallopian tubes as indicated here 6632 patient in row 3 presented with pathology for which hysterectomy was performed and the fallopian tubes were removed 6651 whether the presenting pathology in row 3 actually required hysterectomy or was means of contraceptive sterilization would require further investigation rows 4 5 these samples represent approximately 50 patient records that include diagnoses for legally induced abortion or procedures for termination of pregnancy again one needs to examine the accompanying codes to better understand the situation for example in row 4 legally induced complete abortion 63592 was accomplished by dilation and curettage explicitly stated to be for termination of pregnancy 6901 in row 5 the patient presented with missed abortion 632 and was diagnosed for legally induced incomplete abortion 63591 through dilation and curettage following delivery or abortion 6902 legally induced abortions complete or incomplete or termination of pregnancy may require further investigation to determine whether live child was killedthis is sample of patient records found in the data file created by researchers studying the practices of us catholic hospital systems active in texas 20002003 the entire study is available at wwwwikileaksorgwikicatholic_hospitals_betray_mission the data is in the excel file tchxls on the websitestudy data sample diagnostic codes procedure codes columns for hospital id name system city diocese row 1 this sample represents 9684 patient records which include the v252 code admission for contraceptive sterilization by interruption of fallopian tubes or vas deferens in these cases the purpose for the accompanying procedures involving the fallopian tubes or vas deferens is explicitly for sterilization in this example 6632 the other diagnostic codes do not affect the purpose of this procedure since v252 is an intention to sterilize for contraceptive purposes regardless of pathology the researchers responsible for tchxls searched for all records which had codes indicating sterilizations highlighted in yellow legally induced abortions and termination of pregnancy both highlighted in red complete listing of all codes used in searching the records is available in tchxlseach row in the table represents single patients recorddiagnostic codes from the international classification of diseases icd 9cm specify the condition of the patient at admittance and during the stayprocedure codes from the international classification of diseases icd 9cm specify the procedures done during the stay
