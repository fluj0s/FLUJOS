the two series and their uncertainties is not the whole story although it is definite improvement over just showing the two reconstructions on top of each other w know assessment of uncertainty however doing the above still only poses the question apple uncertainty in apple orange uncertainty in orange as we discussed in previous email exchange based on the correlations you calculated between instrumental series w the trend removed the two reconstructions should probably only share about 60 or so variance in common in the best case scenario where there is uncertainty at all owing simply to the differing target regionsseason so we need to be very careful w the following statement which you made in your previous email if so this would not mean that the series are not significantly different from each other one cant dismiss the highly systematic differences at multicentennial timescales quite so easily im not sure you can justify that statement based on sound statistical reasoning i agree w your following statement why these differences are there is the crux question howeveri hope the discussion will accurately reflect the fact that the leading hypotheses to be rejected in answering that question are 1 random uncertainty in the two series owing to differing data quality and sampling etc can explain the difference and 2 systematic differences owing to differing target region and seasonality can explain any residual differences after 1 that may be tough standard to beat but it is the approach that tom phil keith and i have all been taking in addressing the issue of whether our different reconstructions are or are not inconsistent and the conclusion has in general been see eg ipcc which was really consensus of many of us though admittedly only i was lead author that despite notable differences in the lowfrequency variability the different reconstructions probably cannot be considered inconsistent given the uncertainties and differences in seasonalityspatial sampling i have hard time understanding why the same standard should not be applied to comparisons w your current reconstruction does your rcs reconstruction really not fall in the mix of all the other reconstructions is it truly an outlier w respect to phils toms mbh and other existing n hem reconstructions that are based on different seasonality and regional sampling weve probably had enough discussion now on this point so ill leave it to you to discuss the results in the way you see most fit but i really hope you take the above points into account in fairness to the previous work i look forward to seeing the final manuscript in one form or another in any case cheers mike at 0810 am 91001 0400 ed cook wrote i do intend to put in new fig 5 that will compare the mean rcs with mbh including each series confidence limits this will be done on lowpass filtered data probably 40 year because of what mike has sent i am sure that there will be significant overlap of confidence limits especially prior to ad 1600 when they are quite wide in mbh if so this would not mean that the series are not significantly different from each other one cant dismiss the highly systematic differences at multicentennial timescales quite so easily why these differences are there is the crux question cheers ed dear ed and jan i have couple of general comments and then some specific little things that may be helpful it is possible that some of the answers to my questions may be in the two manuscripts in review or in press trr and dendrochronologia to which you refer it seems that your results are consistent with the general shape and some of the detail of the mbh99 series apart from departures before 1200 and in the 19th century as the two datasets are largely but not completely independent this is an important result at the time when your replication is weakest there appear to be differences between the linear and nonlinear rcs curves and the mbh series before about 1200 your dataset is dominated by material from four sites i think polar urals mongolia quebec and the taimyr peninsula it therefore seems to that it is important to make the kinds of direct graphical comparisons that mike suggests of both your series and the mbh series superimposed and with their confidence limits shown perhaps the differences you note are not robust and then there would seem to be little reason to seek climatological explanations i suggest that the graphical comparison mike suggests will be important since it should allow some assessment of the extent to which mbh and others have or have not underestimated temperature in the ad 10001400 period if your arguments hold up i think that reasonable reader would have some questions about this particular application of the rcs approach maybe an expansion of the footnote might help how does the determination of the form of the regional standardization curve itself depend on replication within each sampled population do we know that the regional standardization curve does not vary with time or do we know that the regional standardization curve does not vary with climate on multicentennial timescales if so how is it not quite possible that the level of the part of the curve for say trees between ages 100 and 300 is set by climate in the early life of the tree or that it is itself directly determined by contemporaneous temperatures number of these questions occur to because i have been struggling with rcs in the yakutia material i have been working on with gene vaganov we have very good situation for the application of the method with couple of hundred samples for which we have pith estimate needed even so the resulting chronology once calibrated gives impossible temperatures in the early part of the millennium they imply mean early summer temperatures of up to 18 degrees celsius which at 70 degrees north would have led to massive ecological and geomorphological change i can find evidence for this i would not be at all surprised if an examination of the taimyr material you used were to show the same thing i say this because i know mukhtar nuarzbaevs rcs chronology from the taimyr shows these very high levels at precisely the same time as the yakutia material perhaps mukhtar and i are misapplying the rcs method real possibility at least as far as i am concerned alternatively there is some problem with rcs that we have yet to identify we are all stuck with more fundamental problem which is that we have way to calibrate multicentennial variations you have used one method of producing chronologies with greater low frequency variability one that has some very appealing characteristics there are other ways the same objective could be reached but we do not have simple way to choose between them in most cases i do think it would be interesting to compare the rcs for the sierra nevada material you used if it contains enough samples to do that with the great basin upper forest border network as highgraded to only contain samples with minimum segment length of 500 years and very conservatively detrended here are some specific points in the penultimate line on page 2 you refer to 1205 tree ring series from 14 locations some readers will for sure be confused by the word series in this case how about core samples or radii or trees page 3 i need to check this but i think the segment lengths in the relevant series in the mbh99 analyses are much longer than 400 years page 5 the differences of timing in high values between the linear and nonlinear chronologies are actually quite striking i think if you and i were looking at couple of subsamples from single site we would put these differences down to inadequate sample depth page 6 you talk about the two series rcs and mbh disagreeing strongly but at the moment there is basis available to the reader to see how strongly this comes back to mikes suggestion of direct graphical comparison with confidence limits
