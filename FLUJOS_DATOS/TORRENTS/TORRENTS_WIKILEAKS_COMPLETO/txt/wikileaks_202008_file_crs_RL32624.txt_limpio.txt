policy updated november 22 2005 charles hanrahan senior specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry division jeffrey zinn specialist in natural resources policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress green payments in us and european union agricultural policy summary green payments are generally defined as payments made to agricultural producers as compensation for environmental benefits that accrue at levels beyond what producers might otherwise achieve under existing market and regulatory conditions they may support both environmental and farm income objectives modern us agrienvironmental programs began in 1985 by paying farmers to retire land and limiting conversion of wetlands and highly erodible land to cultivation thereby reducing negative environmental effects associated with production agriculture these initial programs focused on single agricultural benefit limiting erosion since then these programs have proliferated in number and overall funding and now pay farmers to provide additional conservation benefits either while maintaining agricultural production on working lands or by retiring land from production these environmental benefits include stemming wetland loss and wildlife habitat deterioration protecting farmland from conversion to other uses and improving water and air quality the conservation security program csp enacted in the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 is the most recent step in the evolution of us agrienvironmental policy csp pays producers to capture environmental benefits across their entire agricultural operation while producing commodities it has been characterized by some as the most comprehensive us green payments program general environmental policy in the european union eu deals with negative externalities from water pollution nitrates and pesticides among other issues and also affects agricultural production eu farm policy since 1985 however has included payments to farmers to compensate for costs incurred or income forgone from undertaking agrienvironmental measures that meet farm policy and rural development objectives such measures include inter alia reducing use of fertilizer and chemical inputs adopting organic production methods maintaining countryside and landscape or managing land for leisure activities or public access successive reforms of the eus common agricultural policy cap have placed greater emphasis on such green payments and increased funding for them as agri environmental measures have been integrated into broad rural development policy congressional interest in green payments today is driven by pressure from international trade negotiations and the anticipated development of the next farm bill which will likely contain the us policy responses to the results of these negotiations these negotiations create considerable uncertainty over future farm program options and green payments in some fashion are widely viewed as an option that could be designed so as to satisfy both international obligations and domestic agriculture constituencies differences between the united states and the eu in how green payments have been defined and translated into policy and programs may make consideration of eu agrienvironmental policy as model or source of ideas

agricultural policy what are green payments green payments generally are defined as payments to agricultural producers for providing environmental services on working farms they are designed to encourage producers to provide more environmental services than they might otherwise provide in the absence of the payments1 and they are not connected to producers level of production in the united states the term green payments refers to agricultural programs with primarily environmental goals although all us green payments programs focus on the environment the types of payments range from costsharing for specific conservation practices to incentives for wholefarm management of environmental resources and rewards for good actors for past environmental stewardship this discussion will review us green payments within the context of modern us agri environmental policy which is evolving from programs focusing primarily on land retirement to programs encouraging sound environmental management on working farms the european union eu views green payments more broadly than does the united states using them to achieve socioeconomic and rural development goals as well as environmental goals the eu makes agrienvironmental green payments to farmers within the framework of its rural development policy which encompasses not only environmental activities but also investments to modernize farms programs to help young farmers get established or promote early retirement assistance with processing and marketing farm products and programs to promote the nonfarm rural economy such as agritourism or preservation of cultural heritage this discussion of eu green payments will focus primarily on agrienvironmental measures that compensate farmers who take measures to enhance the environmental benefits from farming but not other aspects of the eus rural development policy the following review of green payments and agrienvironmental policy in the united states and the european union shows that they have become an important aspect of agricultural policy although green payments are only one tool of agri environmental programs2 forces at work in the global economy could tend to 1 sandra s batie and richard horan green payments policy at httpwwwaecmsu eduageconsmith_endowmentdocumentsoutlaw4pdf visited may 27 2004 2 other methods used in agrienvironmental programs to encourage producers to adopt sound environmental practices include regulating pesticide use targeting program funds to areas of particular environmental need and setting standards for environmental performance as continued crs2 increase the role of green payments as component of agricultural support for example in multilateral agricultural trade negotiations pressures are mounting to curtail trade and productiondistorting support for domestic agriculture3 green payments are thought by many to be less trade and productiondistorting than other forms of domestic support for agriculture4 in the future us producers and policymakers may focus more attention on the role of green payment programs in agricultural policy as vehicle for supporting agriculture and rural areas that would be less susceptible to cuts resulting from multilateral trade negotiations us agrienvironmental policy the united states has implemented agrienvironmental policies since the 1930s when the dust bowl spurred congress to enact laws providing financial technical and educational assistance to farmers to encourage the adoption of soil conservation practices all assistance is provided to voluntary participants as is designed to benefit individual farms today the united states employs two main types of agri environmental policy tools mandatory crosscompliance mechanisms for those producers who receive federal farm program benefits and voluntary incentives voluntary incentives have been dominant in us agrienvironmental policy and are viewed by most agriculture interests as being central to efforts to improve the environmental performance of producers the few regulatory federal laws affecting agriculture include the use of restrictions and bans on certain pesticides but these have been fairly limited in number and are not topic of this report5 2 continued requirement for certain agricultural payments economic research service agri environmental policy at the crossroads ers rept 794 2001 p

tradedistorting domestic support to agriculture 4 the world trade organizations uruguay round agreement on agriculture 1994 exempts from reduction commitments payments under environmental programs that meet the following conditions eligibility for such payments shall be determined as part of clearly defined government environmental or conservation program and be dependent on the fulfillment of specific conditions under the government program including conditions related to production methods or inputs and b the amount of payment shall be limited to the extra costs or loss of income involved in complying with the government program 5 roger claassen et agrienvironmental policy at the crossroads guideposts on changing landscape agricultural economic report number 794 economic research service january 2001 appendix 1 major federal programs include mandates for states to deal with agricultural nonpoint pollution under the coastal zone act reauthorization amendments of 1990 prohibitions against taking member of threatened or endangered species under the endangered species act of 1973 regulation of pesticides under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act of 1947 and regulation of concentrated animal feeding operations under the federal water pollution control act amendments also known as the clean water act crs3 crosscompliance mechanisms in general us agrienvironmental programs include few compulsory environmental requirements when compared to eu programs us crosscompliance programs aim to discourage farmers from converting wetlands into farmland and from farming highly erodible land unless the land is protected by implementing an approved conservation plan from excessive soil erosion producer must comply with these programs to receive federal commodity price and income support to participate in federal voluntary conservation programs and to be eligible for federal agriculture loans or loanrelated guarantees and other agriculturerelated federal benefits6 farmers who do not comply may still farm but are ineligible for these substantial government benefits it is estimated that about 50 of the countrys 2 million farmers currently receive federal farm program benefits those who do not receive these benefits are not affected by cross compliance as currently designed us crosscompliance mechanisms first enacted in the food security act of 1985 pl 99198 include highly erodible land conservation also known as conservation compliance and sodbuster and wetland conservation called swampbuster7 land is defined by the natural resources conservation service as highly erodible when it may erode at or at more than eight times the soil loss tolerance level this is the rate at which soil can erode without losing its productivity over time much of this highly erodible land is located in the great plains states conservation compliance under this program farmers producing agricultural commodities on highly erodible land that was cropped from 1981 to 1985 must implement an approved conservation plan the plan must provide for 75 reduction in erosion as compared to the lands previous erosion rates almost all affected producers are currently considered to be in compliance sodbuster under this program producers who plow erosionprone grasslands that were not cropped from 1981 to 1985 must implement conservation plan that holds erosion to more than the soil loss tolerance level swampbuster under this program producers converting wetland area to cropland may lose eligibility for several federal farm program benefits although there are many exceptions in statute such as wetland conversions that have little effect on wetland functions8 6 economic research service agricultural resources and

subtitles b and c 8 program descriptions modified from crs report 97905 agriculture glossary of terms programs and laws 2005 edition by jasper womach crs4 voluntary agrienvironmental programs the majority of us agrienvironmental programs are voluntary in nature and are funded by mandatory spending through the commodity credit corporation ccc they are known as either farm bill programs or title ii programs because they are authorized by the farm bill multiyear act authorizing federal commodity farm support and agricultural conservation programs as well as other farm sectorrelated provisions and these provisions were in title ii of the most recent farm bill9 us voluntary agrienvironmental programs have evolved from emphasizing land retirement to encouraging the adoption of best management practices on working farmland the following paragraphs describe selected and larger us voluntary agrienvironmental programs in the order they were enacted table 1 below after these short descriptions conveys some sense of the scale of each program for additional basic information on these and the numerous other smaller conservation programs see crs report rl32940 agriculture conservation programs scorecard by jeffrey zinn and tadlock cowan and for additional information on the history of funding for these programs see crs report rs22243 mandatory funding for agriculture conservation programs by jeffrey zinn land retirement programs these programs involve retiring land from crop production under the terms and conditions of the program contract in exchange for annual payments they are precursors to green payments programs in that they are the first modern voluntary agricultural programs to base eligibility in part or in whole on an ability to provide environmental benefits conservation reserve program crp 1985 crp administered by the farm service agency is the largest private land retirement program with an enrollment ceiling of 392 million acres and the largest farm bill agri environmental program in terms of annual spending cbo estimates the program to cost more than 20 billion annually starting in fy200510 farmers may submit bids to enroll land in crp for 1015 years the crps original aim was not only to reduce soil erosion but also to protect soil productivity control surplus production and stabilize land prices which were declining in the mid 1980s crp now has broader environmental focus since 1990 fsa has evaluated bids to enroll land in crp based on an environmental benefits index ebi score which reflects the impact enrollment would have on various environmental measures ground water and 9 the relevant farm bills were enacted in 1985 pl 99198 1990 pl 101624 1996 pl 104127 and 2002 pl 107171 the 1985 law serves as the basis for modern agri environmental policy the other three laws amend the 1985 law 10 crp has its roots in the 1950sera soil bank program which had twin goals of controlling agricultural production and reducing soil erosion by idling up to 30 million acres of land producing surplus commodities this and subsequent program cost estimates are from the congressional budget office january 2005 baseline by way of comparison crp is almost twice as expensive as the next most costly fy2005 conservation program eqip 1017 billion crs5 surface water quality wind erosion wildlife habitat etc11 crp also includes number of subprograms the most visible of which is the conservation reserve enhancement program or crep creps are developed by states who contribute additional funds so that higher payments can be offered to retire additional land in environmentally sensitive watersheds12 wetlands reserve program wrp 1990 wrp administered by the natural resources conservation service nrcs provides longterm protection to agricultural wetlands by requiring participants to implement approved wetland restoration and protection plans most lands enrolled in wrp are floodprone agricultural lands because the goal is longterm wetland restoration most land is enrolled under permanent easement or 30year easement land may also be enrolled for ten years without any easement the 2002 farm bill set an enrollment limit of 2275 million acres with goal of enrolling 250000 acres in any given year working lands programs new programs for working farms were created in part because land retirement programs did not address many of the environmental problems stemming from ongoing agricultural production these programs provide payments to farmers for increased environmental services on working lands green payments below is description of four of the largest working lands programs all administered by nrcs the newest of these the conservation security program targets environmental problems on farms while the others aim to create habitat or preserve especially valuable farmland these programs have been very popular with farmers while they each received substantial funding increases in the 2002 farm bill requests to participate have continued to far outpace available funding resulting in large backlog environmental quality incentives program eqip 1996 eqip has been described as the first major us green payments program specifically designed to pay farmers for environmental benefits while allowing continued agricultural production13 it is also the secondlargest agrienvironmental program in terms of funding 1017 billion in fy2006 eqip provides costsharing and technical assistance for implementing specific conservation measures such as installing buffer strips near streams to remedy environmental problems on farms and may also provide incentive payments all to encourage producers to adopt certain practices so producers can keep lands in production rather than retiring them nrcs distributes funds at the national level based on national environmental priorities including reduction of nonpoint source pollution reduction of air pollution and control of soil erosion each state determines how to allocate the funds it receives based on its own environmental priorities eqip is the only large conservation 11 farm service agency conservation reserve program final environmental

such as waste management14 wildlife habitat incentives program whip 1996 whip provides costsharing to landowners to develop or restore wildlife habitat on their agricultural operations in exchange landowners voluntarily limit incompatible activities on the land whip targets atrisk species declining habitats and conservation practices that are ineligible for other agricultural conservation program funds eg fish passages agreements range from 5 years to 15 years or more in duration funding is distributed to states each state ranks applications from landowners and sets local wildlife habitat priorities state ranking criteria include items such as proximity to protected wildlife habitat projected longevity of habitat created and cost per acre farm and ranch lands protection program frpp 1996 frpp helps farmers keep their land in production by providing matching funds to state tribal local or nongovernmental organizations that have existing farmland protection programs to purchase permanent conservation easements from willing sellers the easements usually restrict nonfarm development and subdivisions on the land although the landowner retains the right to farm the land the landowner must also implement conservation plan to reduce soil erosion on any highly erodible land nrcs state officials decide which applications to fund and each state has an frpp plan detailing the degree of development pressure acreage of land to be protected acreage of land lost and other program indicators grasslands reserve program grp 2002 the grp targets grasslands containing forbs15 or shrubs especially areas that historically have been grasslands and have potential to provide habitat for animal or plant populations of significant ecological value grp also targets grasslands threatened with conversion to other uses grp offers landowners choice of easements lasting 30 years or permanently or rental agreements lasting 10 to 30 years in exchange landowners protect and if necessary restore grasslands in accordance with an nrcs restoration agreement grp has total funding limit of 254 million and total enrollment limit of 2 million acres between fy2003 and fy2007 conservation security program csp 2002 csp rewards producers who proactively conserve environmental resources across their entire agricultural operation and encourages them to integrate wholefarm planning this is in contrast to eqip which helps producers address existing environmental problems this contrast has caused some analysts to characterize csp as the most comprehensive us green payments program the eligibility criteria for csp reward producers historic record of conservation and provide incentives to do more conservation in the future it uses threetiered system that rewards increased levels of conservation on enrolled lands with increased payments for the lowest level protecting one natural resource on part of their operation producers may earn up to 20000 14 for more information on the eqip see crs report rs22040 environmental quality incentives program eqip status and issues by carol canada and jeffrey zinn 15 forbs are also known as weeds or wildflowers they provide important forage and seeds for wildlife as well as cover and protection from predators crs7 annually while for the highest level protecting all natural resources on all of their operation producers may earn up to 45000 annually although csp was designed to be true entitlement and widely available for many types of agricultural operations the bush administration is implementing the program with additional eligibility criteria designed to reward only the highest levels of conservation and only in designated watersheds which change from year to year congress has contributed to the limitations by repeatedly reprogramming funds that had been destined for csp to other purposes such as disaster relief according to the congressional budget office the first signup was held in fy2004 and csp supporters see large potential for this program if adequate funding is made available16 outlook for us financing of agrienvironmental measures the us voluntary agrienvironmental programs noted above the socalled farm bill programs received dramatic increases in funding authority in the 2002 farm bill at the time of enactment the congressional budget office cbo estimated the 2002 farm bill would increase overall spending for conservation and environmental programs by 8017 these increases have not been fully realized however because some of the increases authorized in the 2002 farm bill were subsequently cut in annual appropriations18 additional reductions can be anticipated as congress and the administration respond to budget pressures including the costs of the war in iraq and hurricane katrina at home and projected deficits for more information on the authorized amounts for these programs annually since fy2003 and reductions proposed by the administration or enacted by congress see crs report rs22243 mandatory funding for agriculture conservation programs by jeffrey zinn 16 for more information on the csp see crs report rs21740 implementing the conservation security

environment and development of rural areas has found expression in the concept of multifunctionality farmers are viewed as producing not only food and agricultural products but also positive environmental and other benefits externalities agrienvironmental policy focuses mainly but not exclusively on promoting positive externalities associated with agricultural production these include among others landscape rural amenities and cultural heritage the premise underlying agrienvironmental policy is that these externalities are public goods that are undervalued by the market and therefore require social or public funding to induce farmers to produce them more broadly the eu maintains that support of commodity production and farm incomes that also engenders these positive externalities is also justified critics of the concept argue that multifunctionality is intended to justify substantial income support for farmers and that support for the public goods produced by agriculture should be specifically targeted in addition to meeting desirable social goals eu agricultural policymakers view shifting funds from commodity support to rural development including agrienvironmental programs as being more compatible with multilateral efforts in the world trade organization wto to curb domestic support while maintaining support that is not or is at most minimally tradedistorting19 since 1985 agrienvironmental green payments as defined above have been available to eu farmers successive reforms of the eus common agricultural policy cap in 1992 2000 and 2003 have placed increasing emphasis on green payments to meet farm policy and social objectives in the process agri environmental measures have become more integrally part of the cap general eu environmental policy and agriculture beginning in the 1970s the eu issued number of directives outlining measures to deal with water pollution nitrates pesticides and habitats and wild birds although these initiatives were important to agriculture they were taken as part of the eus general environmental policy outside the framework of the cap these environmental regulations as of january 1 2005 became the basis of so called statutory environmental management requirements with which eu farmers must comply in order to be eligible for direct income support under the recently reformed cap discussed below these general environmental regulations cover the following water protection series of directives enumerate undesirable or dangerous substances and establish standards for protecting water sources andor safeguard water quality20 19 see batie and horan cited above 20 the principal water protection directive is council directive 8068eec december 17 1980 on the protection of groundwater against pollution caused by certain dangerous continued crs10 nitrates the nitrate directive aims to reduce water pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources by requiring member states to implement action programs in areas identified as being vulnerable to pollution among other requirements the directive limits the application of manure to 170 kg of nitrogen per hectare21 pesticides number of directives issued from 1976 to the early 1990s aim to reduce the public health risks associated with the use of plant protection products these directives establish and regulate maximum residue limits mrls of pesticides for various products including fruits and vegetables cereals and livestock products22 other directives deal with harmonization of various national regulations concerning conditions arrangements and procedures related to the classification packaging and labeling of pesticides and with registration and control of sales of pesticides habitats and wild birds the natura network these directives aim to protect natural habitats of wild fauna and flora and to protect wild birds in their habitats23 member states have to take the necessary measures to achieve these aims and to notify protected areas to the european commission most of the designated areas are in agricultural or wooded areas created and maintained by farming or other human activity agrienvironmental programs in the cap environmental objectives initially were omitted from the cap which was conceived primarily as policy to support the operation of agricultural commodity markets for the benefit of farmers and consumers however the cap did include an objective with respect to structural aspects of agriculture eg farm size farm population characteristics farm organizations investment in production or marketing facilities or regional disparities which served subsequently as legal and financial framework for agrienvironmental measures until 1992 see below agrienvironmental measures were financed from separate structural fund the guidance section of the european agricultural guarantee and guidance fund eaggf while commodity support was financed from the guarantee section guidance funds averaged about 10 of the total funding of the cap around eur 4 billion agrienvironmental programs were only small portion of total guidance spending as structural

on 5050 basis by the eu and member states although the percentage of eu financing could be larger for projects in poorer regions these programs which are now incorporated into the eus rural development policy provide compensation to farmers for undertaking specific agrienvironmental measures among the programs are the following the less favored area program lfa24 the lfa targets farmers in mountainous areas areas threatened with abandonment and other areas where agriculture is deemed necessary for the conservation or improvement of the environment management of landscape promotion of tourism or protection of coastlines farmers in these areas can receive payments aimed at compensating the costs and income losses resulting from implementation of environmental or conservation measures member states identify the zones and implement the programs in their national territories lfa payments were fixed at eur 200 per hectare the efficiency regulations25 as indicated by their designation these regulations were aimed at improving the efficient development of the agricultural sector the regulations encouraged for example the creation of agricultural associations and the formation of groups of farmers to promote common use of equipment in farming operations it also introduced the possibility for member states to make payments to farmers for environmentally friendly farming practices such payments were subject to rules intended to prevent them from becoming national subsidies of competitiondistorting nature however financing was by member states only without eu funds the regulations were not attractive to many member states as result only four countries denmark germany the netherlands and the united kingdom implemented agrienvironmental programs under the efficiency regulations organic farming26 these regulations encourage farmers to engage in this type of production which is deemed beneficial and environmentally friendly because of its emphasis on less intensive land use exclusion of chemical inputs and use of conserving practices the eu legislation establishes principles and rules to be followed on production processing labeling and imports of organically produced products they provide for inspection and control of the process at all stages in order to verify that organic methods have been used incentive payments are available to farmers who participate voluntarily in organic farming and participants may receive annual payments for up to five years and up to maximum of eur 3000 per holding per year 24 council directive 75268eec of

were to reduce market surpluses make agricultural products more competitive in world markets secure farmers incomes and conform the cap to anticipated wto rules and disciplines with respect to domestic support the essential element of the reform was to reduce price supports to farmers while making direct payments to farmers to compensate them for loss of income due to price reductions at the same time the reform gave additional emphasis to agrienvironmental measures agrienvironmental measures were dealt with in two ways in the 1992 cap reform first some agrienvironmental measures were included in commodity support programs second specific agrienvironmental measures were introduced as measures accompanying the market reforms examples of the former include compulsory setasides for large farmers primarily to manage supplies but also to foster the rotational release and recovery of arable land limits on stocking density per holding or per hectare in order to qualify for payments extensification premiums for further reducing stocking density per hectare and payments to fruit and vegetable producers made contingent on the adoption of environmentally sound production practices the three accompanying measures in the 1992 cap reform were agricultural production methods compatible with the requirements of the protection of the environment and the maintenance of the countryside27 early retirement from farming28 and afforestation of agricultural land29 for the agrienvironmental accompanying measures assistance in the form of payments would be made to farmers or herders who voluntarily participated in measures to reduce the use of fertilizers and chemical inputs introduce or continue with organic farming methods change production methods toward or maintain extensification of production reduce the number of animals per forage unit maintain the countryside and landscape and generally promote bio diversity ensure the upkeep of abandoned farmland or

for nature reserves or parks or to protect hydrological systems and manage land for leisure activities and public access payments were made to farmers to cover the costs andor loss of income from adopting the agrienvironmental measures in addition assistance included measures to improve the training of farmers with regard to farming or forestry practices compatible with environmental protection the two other accompanying measures though not principally agri environmental also had environmental aspects the principal aim of the early retirement scheme was to encourage replacement of elderly farmers by younger ones or to reallocate the land to nonagricultural uses in both cases member states were to operate the programs in harmony with the requirements of environmental protection or assure that the land is used in manner compatible with protection or improvement of the quality of the environment and of the countryside reg eec 207992 similarly the eu afforestation program aimed to encourage farmers to withdraw their land from crop or livestock production for up to 20 years permanent setaside and dedicate it to afforestation implementation of the program was supposed to contribute to forms of countryside management more compatible with environmental balance and to combat the effects of greenhouse gasses by absorbing carbon dioxide through an eventual improvement in forest resources eec 208092 each member state could decide on its participation in the accompanying environmental measures programs were funded from the guarantee section of the eaggf not the guidance section on matching basis 50 of the costs of the programs were funded by the eu 50 by member states eu cofinancing for such projects in poorer regions was 75 farmers who voluntarily agreed to implement agrienvironmental measures for minimum period of five years received annual payments calculated on the basis of additional costs and income forgone and the financial incentive needed to spur adoption payments were limited to eur 450900 per hectare30 payments were also made to livestock producers on per animal unit basis eur 210 for each sheep or cattle unit by which herd is reduced eur 100 for each livestock unit of an endangered breed reared that these agrienvironmental programs were funded from the guarantee section of the eaggf rather than the guidance section was an important change this is the first time that guarantee funds were allocated to anything other than commodity support but whereas commodity support was totally financed by the guarantee section the guidance section approach of cofinancing structural programs on matching basis was used to allocate the guarantee funds to the agri environmental and other rural development programs 30 one hectare is equivalent to 247 acres 1 eur is about 121 as of the date of this report consequently 450900 eur per hectare is about 220440 per acre crs14 agrienvironmental programs in agenda 200031 the process of agricultural policy reform and of integrating agrienvironmental measures into agricultural policy was continued with the agenda 2000 reforms the primary rationale for further reforming the cap was to adapt it to the enlargement of the eu by another 10 member states within existing budgetary and other limits second rationale was to prepare the eu for new wto agricultural trade negotiations that were to have been launched in seattle in 1999 but were launched subsequently at doha qatar in 2001 agenda 2000 established adoption of agrienvironmental measures as the only compulsory element of eu rural development policy member states have to include agrienvironmental measures such as those identified in the 1992 regulations in their rural development programs to tap funding available from the guarantee section of the eaggf agenda 2000 also established rural development including the agri environmental accompanying measures and the other environmental programs as the second pillar of the cap the first pillar being the commodity support programs and direct income support payments to farmers all of the rural development measures are cofinanced by the eaggf guarantee section in all member states this fund has an annual average ceiling of eur 43 billion for rural development which includes agrienvironmental measures for the budget period 2000 to 2006 about 10 of annual guarantee funds under agenda 2000 the eaggf guarantee section as rule cofinances 50 of the cost of the rural developmentagri environmental measures undertaken by member states poorer regions could qualify for higher percentage of eu cofinancing 2003 cap reforms and agrienvironmental programs32 midterm review of agenda 2000 undertaken by the eu resulted in further significant reforms of the cap in 2003 the major reform was the establishment of single farm payment decoupled from production with some exceptions for certain crops to replace the myriad commodity payments made to eu farmers receiving the single payment is contingent on farmers compliance with environmental and other requirements food safety occupational safety animal welfare set at the eu and national levels crosscompliance crosscompliance is now compulsory and all farmers receiving direct payments will be subject to it farmers will be sanctioned for nonobservance of these standards through cuts in direct payments these policy changes took effect on january 1 2005 member states still benefit from co financing of agrienvironmental and other rural development measurers out of guarantee funds the 2003 reform makes additional funds available for rural development by reducing the guarantee funds available for commodity price and income support and transferring them to rural development process referred to as modulation 31 council regulation ec 125799 of may 17 1999 oj l 160 2661999 p 80 32 council regulation ec 17822003 l 2701 21102003 p 1 ff crs15 crosscompliance with agrienvironmental measures in order to qualify for the single farm payment eu farmers must observe statutory mandatory requirements related to the environment as well as good agricultural and environmental farming practices crosscompliance also entails meeting standards for food safety and animal welfare additional compensation is available to farmers for meeting these minimum standards the statutory mandatory requirements include the regulation established in the water protection nitrate pesticide and habitats and wild birds directives discussed above good farming practices are spelled out in the regulation implementing the 2003 reforms see table 2 table 2 good agricultural and environmental practices issue standards soil erosion minimum soil cover protect soil through appropriate measures

vegetation on agricultural land source annex iv of council directive ec 17822003 farmers who do not comply with the statutory management requirements or good agricultural and environmental practices as result of action or omission directly attributable to the individual farmer will be subject to reduction or cancellation of their single farm payment if noncompliance results from negligence the farmers payment is reduced by minimum of 5 or in the case of repeated non compliance 15 if noncompliance is intentional the percentage reduction will be not less than 20 and may go as high as the total payment for one or more calendar years member states get to keep 25 of any amounts derived from noncompliance member states are responsible for carrying out spot checks to verify that farmers are complying with the requirements the european commission is responsible for ensuring that the member states are enforcing crosscompliance and providing them with technical assistance if needed assistance to farmers in meeting standards the 2003 reforms added two measures that assist farmers in meeting the new more demanding standards crs16 temporary and degressive support will be payable to farmers to help them adapt to the introduction of the new standards assistance will be on flatrate basis and degressive for maximum period of five years and subject to ceiling of eur 10000 per holding in any year support will also be available to help farmers with the costs of using farm advisory services to assess the performance of their farm business against the new crosscompliance standards being introduced farmers may receive up to maximum of 80 of the cost of such services subject to ceiling of eur 1500 per service support for implementing natura 2000 the 2003 cap reforms also made some changes in the natura 2000 program see page 7 per hectare funding for areas covered by the habitats and wild birds directives will be increased assistance can start at eur 500 per hectare declining to eur 200 per hectare over five years higher payments initially are intended to reflect higher initial costs associated with adjustment of farming practices when land is designated under the natura 2000 program the total area eligible for natura 2000 funding is longer restricted to maximum of 10 of the area of member state increased eu cofinancing for agrienvironment and animal welfare eu cofinancing for these measures increases to maximum of 85 in poorer regions and 60 in other areas previous cofinancing of rural development measures was 75 for poorer regions and 50 for all others increased support for lfas compensatory allowances for lfas are increased to maximum of eur 250hectare on average at member state levels previously per hectare payments in lfas were set at eur 200 additional financing for rural development policy modulation the 2003 cap reforms also introduced new system for financing rural development including agrienvironmental policy called compulsory modulation under compulsory modulation funds from commodity support will be transferred to rural development support member states may then use the additional funds to finance new rural development measures or to increase financing of existing measures under the system farms receiving over eur 5000 year in direct payments will have those payments reduced ie modulated by 3 in 2005 4 in 2006 and 5 from 2007 onward the additional funds become available in 2006 when the modulation rate reaches 5 estimates are that it will result in additional eu rural development funds inflationadjusted of eur 12 billion per year over the 43 billion previously allocated currently eu agrienvironmental programs account for 52 of rural development spending from both eu and member states financing within the rural development spending category agrienvironmental programs compete with rural restructuring eg investment aids and nonfarm rural economy programs eg agritourism or village renewal despite these competing programs within the rural development program spending on agrienvironmental measures appears likely to crs17 continue as substantial component of total rural development spending over the

single fund the european agriculture fund for rural development eafrd the regulation establishes that minimum of 25 of rural development spending will focus on environmental stewardship in land management34 eu spending on agrienvironmental measures it is difficult to get an estimate of eu and member states total spending on agri environmental programs particularly since funding of such activities is shared 33 proposed budget commitments for the cap in agrafacts june 30 2004 published for agraeurope age bonn german federal republic by agra 84 boulevard sebastopol 75003 paris france 34 the rural development regulation is discussed at httpwwwfasusdagovscriptsw attacherepattache_loutasp crs18 responsibility between the eu and the member states nevertheless an idea of how much is spent on this category of programs is included in the eus notification to the wto of domestic support for agriculture in 20002001 marketing year the most recent year available35 the eu reports spending by the eu and its member states of eur 57 billion for protection of the environment and preservation of the countryside control of soil erosion extensification aid for environmentally sensitive areas support and protection of organic production by creating conditions for fair competition aid for forestry measures in agriculture and conservation of genetic resources in agriculture in contrast the united states in its wto notification reports spending of 27 billion for various environmental programs in its 20002001 notification36 some concluding observations this review of us and eu current agrienvironmental policies reveals both similarities and differences see table 4 following this section many of the major environmental topics dealt with by us and eu policy and programs are much the same soil and water quality wildlife habitat farmland preservation and protection and wetlands protection and restoration but how they are addressed is different in many significant ways one major difference is the extent to which crosscompliance measures are used in relation to receipt of commodity support payments although us agrienvironmental policy has emphasized voluntary participation farmers or ranchers with erodible lands or wetlands must comply with crosscompliance measures as condition for receiving commodity payments in the eu on the other hand all farms as of january 1 2005 are required to meet certain statutory environmental management requirements and observe good agricultural and environmental practices in order to receive support payments provided as single farm payment37 in the united states the federal government is primarily responsible for program administration and funding it provides technical assistance and financial or costsharing assistance developing and implementing conservation plans in contrast eu member states are primarily responsible for administering agri environmental programs which are cofinanced generously by the european commission farmers receive technical assistance to enable them to meet the compulsory agrienvironmental standards and financial aid as they implement activities to meet the standards in the united states integrating agrienvironmental programs with rural development policy and shifting funds from commodity to agrienvironmental efforts 35 the eu notification of domestic support for agriculture for my2000my2001 is available at httpdocsonlinewtoorgddfdocumentstgagneec49doc 36 the us notification of domestic support for agriculture for my2000my2001 is available at httpdocsonlinewtoorgddfdocumentstgagnusa51doc 37 discussion and evaluation of the eus recent policy reforms is analysis of the 2003 cap reform prepared by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd paris france 2004 crs19 are at issue to date united states policy makers have not chosen to make this linkage or to transfer funds eu policymakers seem to have made decision to integrate agrienvironmental programs into broad rural development policy the eu as part of its most recent reform of the cap has also made policy decision to shift increasing amounts of funds from commodity to agrienvironmental support part of the difference between the united states and the eu with respect to funding derives from different approaches to budgeting for agricultural programs in the eu and the united states while the eu operates on sevenyear fixed budget for agriculture with inflation factors built in the united states operates with budgets decided in annual appropriations legislation although programs are authorized for multiyear periods further developments in agrienvironmental policy in both the united states and the eu will likely depend at least in part on outcomes from ongoing multilateral agricultural trade negotiations if these negotiations result in further restrictions on tradedistorting domestic commodity support farmers ranchers and policymakers may view increased funding for green payments as an attractive alternative for providing support to agriculture if further restrictions are required it seems more likely that the united states and the eu will look at the others policies and experiences more closely if such an examination demonstrates that historic and current differences are extensive and difficult to overcome it may be that broad and imprecise definition of green payments will serve the interests of diverse parties who participate in farm policy debates for us policy the status of these negotiations in early 2007 when crafting the next farm bill is likely to start in earnest will be particularly important because designers of this legislation and interest groups will likely give the status and direction of these negotiations strong consideration as they contemplate farm bill options if the outcome of the negotiations is uncertain while the farm bill is being debated this uncertainty will compound the intensity of the debate and possibly result in the inclusion of language in legislation giving the department greater flexibility in implementation congressional discussion of green payments may become contentious for other reasons as well one source of that contention may be the translation of the concept into policies and programs most interests involved in farm policy who have expressed an opinion support the general concept of green payments but as the discussions become more specific participants may find that they have different views about program design funding allocations administrative responsibilities and similar questions making it difficult to hold together coalitions of supporters among the most difficult of these questions may be deciding whether such program should include significant income support component and contribute to the bottom line of each participant or should it be limited to covering costs to install and maintain conservation practices related question may be deciding what is to be accomplished through green payment approach some may view it as meeting international obligations and seek minimal program with limited impact to current domestic efforts while others may view it is major new and positive direction in farm policy and seek to make it large and farreaching one aspect of discussing these options may be over whether payments should be based on costsharing for individual practices which has long history in agrienvironmental policies or on crs20 the level of improved environmental performance that results from installing practices consideration of green payments may also include debate over questions of scale to this point all conservation programs are implemented at the scale of an individual farm green payments could include additional incentives for coordinated and collective action that have much larger cumulative benefits than actions on individual farms are likely to result in such programs could be designed around the magnitude of the benefits that the group provides and grow or shrink for all members of the group as the participation and therefore the benefits change differences between the united states and the eu in how green payments have been defined and translated into policy and programs may make consideration of eu agrienvironmental policy as model or source of ideas problematic some aspects of eu policy eg compulsory crosscompliance with agrienvironmental measures as condition for receiving price and income support differ substantially from historical us practice in which crosscompliance has been far more sparingly applied spending on agrienvironmental programs in the united states has been relatively less than in the eu both as portion of total federal spending for agriculture and as an amount spent identifying sources of increased funding for agri environmental programs even in the context of possible new wto restrictions on other forms of farm support might still be difficult given projected budget deficits even with new multilateral restrictions on farm subsidies agrienvironmental programs might compete unfavorably with the more conventional forms of farm support or with other wtocompatible programs apart from funding considerations consensus for linking agrienvironment and rural development with more traditional farm program measures has not emerged in the united states as it apparently has in the eu so the extent to which eu agrienvironmental policy could serve as model or source of ideas for us agrienvironmental policy remains to be seen table 4 comparison of current
