summary the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 bapcpa pl 1098 included the most significant amendments to consumer bankruptcy procedures since the 1970s the 110th congress continues to monitor the impact of the new law on debtors and creditors bankruptcy reform was enacted in response to the high number of consumer bankruptcy filings which in 2005 and 2006 reached five times the level of the early 1980s why did filings increase so dramatically during period that included two of the longest economic expansions in us history because bankruptcy is by definition condition of excessive debt many would expect to see corresponding increase in the debt burden of us households over the same period however while household debt has indeed grown debt costs as percentage of income have risen only moderately what aggregate statistics do not show is that the debt burden does not fall equally on all families financial distress is common among lowerincome households in 2004 27 of families in the bottom fifth of the income distribution spent more than 40 of their income to repay debt this report presents statistics on bankruptcy filings household debt and families in financial distress and it will be updated as new statistics become available this report presents data on bankruptcy filings household debt and families in financial distress table 1 shows filings since 1980 business filings peaked in 1987 and have since declined but the number of consumer filings continued to grow through 2005 in 2005 the number of filings surpassed 2 million there was rush to the courthouse before the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 bapcpa took effect in october 2005 in 2006 filings dropped sharply suggesting that the new law caused many to accelerate their filings and that many petitions that would have been filed in 2006 or later were pushed forward by bankruptcy reform whether or how much bapcpa will reduce filings in the long run is still unclear filings have risen steadily from the 2006 lows and in the second quarter of 2008 reached 266667 or over 1 million at an annual rate weakening credit market and macroeconomic conditions in could produce further increases crs2 table 1 bankruptcy filings in the united states 19802008 nonbusiness or consumer filings total filings business filings year change

household debt service obligation ratios dsr 2 bureau of economic analysis personal income outlays table 2 figures for 2008 are for the end of the second quarter table 2 shows figures on household debt the major categories of household debt are mortgage debt and consumer credit which together comprise about 97 of all household indebtedness consumer credit consists of 1 revolving credit or credit card debt and 2 nonrevolving debt which is dominated by auto loans though it also includes loans for boats mobile homes vacations and so on mortgage debt is borrowing secured by real estate subcategory within mortgage debt home equity lending is broken out in the table because it may substitute for consumer credit in many cases table 2 also includes federal reserve estimates of the burden of debt service that is the percentage of household disposable income that goes to repay loans over the past decade the rise in this measure has been steady but not dramatic the debt burden figures in table 2 fluctuate within fairly narrow range from 1080 to 1442 during the crs4 1980s the range was similar from 106 to125 although the burden of debt has risen since the 1980s particularly since 2001 the increase has been gradual and would not appear to explain much of the fivefold increase in personal bankruptcy filings over the past two decades interest rates paid by consumers particularly mortgage rates declined in recent years to the lowest levels since the 1950s and they remain low the relative stability of the debt burden in the face of falling and historically low interest rates implies that the ratio of debt outstanding to income has been rising this ratio the sum of consumer and mortgage debt shown in the table expressed as percentage of disposable personal income is shown in the far right column of table 2 the increases in this figure which since 1990 has risen more than twice as fast as the debt burden suggest that further increases in bankruptcy filings and perhaps problems for lenders may lie ahead if interest rates should rise suddenly or unexpectedly many homeowners face resets on their adjustablerate mortgages with possible increases in their mortgage payments but the prevalence of fixedrate mortgages may mitigate this effect at the national level1 for the present however historically low interest rates have permitted households to take on more debt without major increase in the debt burden table 3 percentage of families in financial distress by income level 19952004 percentile of income 1995 1998 2001 2004 distribution all

federal reserve bulletin february 2006 note families in financial distress are those devoting over 40 of their incomes to debt repayment the aggregate household debt numbers mask important differences among families some have done very well in the long booms of the 1980s and 1990s while others have taken on debt that they have difficulty repaying table 3 above based on the federal 1 since 1990 about threequarters of mortgages have been fixedrate loans for information on the recent increase in mortgage foreclosures see crs report rl34232 understanding mortgage foreclosure recent events the process and costs by darryl getter crs5 reserves survey of consumer finances shows the percentage of families at various income levels who devote more than 40 of their incomes to debt service for selected years from 1995 through 2004 two noteworthy facts emerge from the data in table 3 first is the high rate of distress among lowerincome families who are the most likely to file for bankruptcy2 second like the debt burden figures shown in table 2 there is sharply rising trend that would explain the dramatic increase in personal bankruptcy filings the percentage of all families in distress in 2004 is little changed from the 1995 level consumer bankruptcies in 2004 on the other hand were up 79 over the 1995 figure the question remains why so many families at or below the national median income take on high levels of debt and end up in bankruptcy court some explanations focus on particularly vulnerable populations the sick and uninsured or underinsured the divorced or residents of states without mandatory uninsured motorist coverage supporters of the bankruptcy reform measure finally enacted in 2005 argued that the bankruptcy code was too debtorfriendly and created an incentive to borrow beyond the ability to repay or in some cases without the intention of repaying opponents of reform claimed that financial distress is often byproduct of the marketing strategies of credit card issuers and other consumer lenders lack of consensus explanation for the rise in consumer bankruptcy filings ensures that the issue will remain controversial the argument that consumer behavior is affected by the legal regime was given some dramatic support by the rush to file before the new law took effect on october 17 20053 although the number of filings during 2006 was the lowest in decades it remains to be seen whether this decline represents the frontloading of filings that would otherwise have taken place in 2006 into the period before the new laws effective date the steady increase in bankruptcy filings since the initial postbapcpa drop in 2006 raises questions about how much the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act will significantly reduce the number of consumer bankruptcy filings in the long run 2 in 2007 the median annual income reported by chapter 7 bankruptcy petitioners based on average monthly income for the six months prior to filing was 25800 just over half of the median household income as reported by the census see administrative office of the us courts 2007 report of statistics required by bapcpa table 2a 3 timothy egan newly
