limit so2 nox and hg emissions on timeframe similar to that proposed by the clear skies legislation crs reexamines epas data producing co st and benefit estimates for each bill incremental to the costs and benefits of current law and prom ulgated regulations the reanalysis finds that clear skies would have negligible incremental costs and added benefits of 6 billion in 2010 and 3 billion in 2020 for the same years s 843 would have annual ne t benefits 8 and 5 times as gr eat as clear skies at annual costs of 42 billion and 3 billion and s 150 would have annual ne t benefits 10 and 16 times those of clear skies at nnual costs of 236 billion and 181 billion epa conducted limited sensitivity analyses to examine the effect on cost of select combinations of assumptions incl uding 1 the responsiveness of electricity demand to changes in price 2 the availability of skilled labor to install control equipment and 3 the growth of electric ity demand and natural gas prices however some potentially useful combinations of assumptions were not examined for example if epa had combined relaxed skilled labor constraint with some responsiveness of electricity demand to chan ges in price the co st of s 150 and s 843 would be substantially re duced crs also concluded that the hg control costs used in the analysis may be substantially overstated because of dated assumptions numerous benefits were not estima ted by epa partly because of methodological difficulties benefits not estimated include the environmental as opposed to health benefits of controlling the pollutants the health effects of mercury control and any benefits from controlling co2 emissions thus even though benefits exceeded costs for each of the options in both epas and our analysis one should perhaps view the bene fit estimates as floor rath er than best estimate particularly for s 150 and s 843 wh ich include significant hg and co2 reductionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33165contents introduction 1 w h t

the environmental protection agency epa released longawaited analysis comparing the costs and benefits of lternative approaches to cont rolling this pollution called multipollutant proposals th alternative schemes focu s on using marketoriented mechanisms to achieve health and environmental goals in simpler more cost effective ways epas new analysis compares four versions of the administration based clear skies proposal to bills introduced by senator jeffords s 150 and senator carper s 843 of the 108th congress which would impose more stringent requirements the administration has been reluctant to conduct such study citing the cost and difficulty of doing so but it relented after the senate nvironment and public works committee on tie vote failed to report the clear skies bill s 131 in march 2005 one reason the bill failed to advance according to its opponents was the concern that an analysis comparing its provisions to those of senator jeffords and senator carpers bills had not been conducted the issue was raised again in april 2005 during confirmation hearings for ste phen johnson who was sworn in as epa administrator may 2 as one of his first fficial acts he promised to conduct cost benefit analysis of clear skies and the other senate bills the results of which have now been released why the focus on power plants electric utility genera ting fac ilities

pollution controls over time and the growing scientific understanding of health and environmental impacts of power plant emissions have led to multilayered and interlocking patchwork of controls moreover additional controls are now underway par ticularly with respect to nox as precursor to ozone to both nox and so2 as contributors to pm25 and to hg as toxic air pollutant also under the united nations framewor k convention on climate change the united states agreed to voluntary limits on co2 emissions the current bush administration has rejected the kyoto protocol which would impose mandatory limits in favor of voluntary reduction program in contrast to the administrations position in june 2005 the senate passed sense of the nate resolution calling for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases that would not impose significant harm to the economy3 for many years the complexity of the air quality control regime has caused some observers to call for simplified approach one focus of this effort is the multi pollutant or fourpollutant approach th is approach involves mix of regulatory and economic mechanisms that would apply to utility emissions of up to four pollutants in various proposals so2 nox hg and co2 the objective would be to balance the environmental goal of eff ective controls across the pollutants covered with the industry goal of stable re gulatory regime for period of years4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33165crs3 4 continued by larry parker and john blodgett 5 for detailed comparison see crs report rl32755 air quality multipollutant legislation in the 109th congress by larry parker and john blodgettto some degree this new approach already has been incorporated into existing law with three recently finalized rules 1 the clean air interstate rule cair promulgated may 12 2005 that caps emissions of so2 and nox in the eastern us 2 the clean air mercury rule cam r promulgated may 18 2005 that caps emissions of hg from coalfired powerplants and 3 the clean air visibility rule cavr promulgated july 6 2005 that focuses on so2 and nox emissions that impair visibility surrounding nati onal parks and wilderness areas more so2 and nox reductions are in the pipeline with new ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particles taking effect nationwide in 2005 emissions of nox which contributes to the formation of ozone and so2 which is among the sources of fine particles n eed to be reduced further mercury emissions are also focus of concern 44 states have issued fish consumption advisories for mercury covering 13 million acres of lakes 765000 rive r miles and the coastal waters of 12 entire states mercury enters water bodi from air emissions that are either deposited directly in them or are deposited on land nd end up in water through precipitation run off proposed legislation many in industry environmental gr oups congress and the administration agree that legislation that addresses power plant pollution in comprehensive multi pollutant fashion could achieve health and environmental goals in simpler more costeffective ways in the 109th congress six bills have been introduced that would impose multipollutant controls on utilities5 such legislation the administration version of which is dubbed cl ear skies would address so2 nox and hg from electric generating facilities on coordinated schedule and would rely to large extent on system like that used in the aci d rain program wher national or regional caps on emissions are implemented through system of tradeable allowances some of the legislative proposals include co2 caps as well key questions in the ensuing congressiona l debate have been how stringent the caps should be how quickly reductions should be mandated and whether carbon dioxide should be among the emissions subj ect to cap regarding the stringency issue all bills would eventually require 70 to 80 reduction of both nox and so2 emissions from 1998 levels regarding mercury the bills eventually would require reductions of 7090 the clear skies bill s 131 would impos the least stringent standards and would be phased in over the longest period of time for all three pollutants the final clear skies deadlines would be 2018 but the actual 70 reduction targets might not be met for as long as decade after that the reason for the delay is the use of what are called banking provisions in the regulatory scheme because the deadlines are far in the future utilities would be likely to overcomply in the early years of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33165crs4 6 rather than single document the agency actually released group of 45 documents an 18page comparison briefing 4page ta ble comparing the options separate analyses of each of the six options and 37 background documents we refer to this group of 45 documents as the agencys costbenefit analysis the full package is available at httpwwwepagovairmarketsmp 7 by regulatory counterparts we mean thre rules promulgated by the agency in 2005 that have emission reduction and capandtrade provis ions almost identical to those of clear skies these are the clean air interstate rule cair promulgated may 12 2005 the clean air mercury rule camr promulgated may 18 2005 and the clean air visibility rule cavr promulgated july 6 2005 8 the managers mark was chosen primarily because it was the most recent legislative version when fully implemented it also would ve slightly greater benefits than the other three clear skies alternatives according to epas analysisprogram building up credits that could be used in place of further emission reductions in later years the administration uses the projected overcompliance as selling point for its approach arguing that it will achieve reductions sooner than would traditional regulatory approach with similar deadlines but overcompliance in the early years would lead to large hol dings of banked emissi on allowances to be used in place of actual reductions in later years delaying achievement of emissions caps in its analysis of the clear skies bill epa does not expect to see the full 70 emission reductions until 2026 or later the jeffords and carper bills also allow banking and trading of allowances but with earlier and more stringent caps on emissions utilities would be unable to bank so many allowances and thus would reach full compliance at least decade sooner than under clear skies with respect to carbon dioxide clear skies would not impose controls on it whereas the jeffords and carper bills would the absence of co2 from the mix might lead to different stra tegies for achieving compliance preserving more of market for coal and lessening the degr ee to which power producers might switch to natural gas or renewable fuel s as compliance strategy options examined in epas analysis the costbenefit analysis released by epa october 276 examined six options four of the six were variants of the admin istrations clear skies bill or its regulatory counterparts7 the other two options were senato r carpers clean air planning act s 843 in the 108th congress but as of the date of the analysis not yet introduced in the 109th and senator jeffords clean power act s 150 the results of the analysis show very little difference between the four clear skies options so it may be best to thi nk of them as one for most purposes and simplify the discussion to three principal choices clear skies carper and jeffords of the four clear skies options that epa examined we have c hosen the version most recently drafted the managers mark ve rsion which was offered at the senate environment and public works co mmittee markup of s 131 on march 9 20058httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33165crs5 9 those are cair the clean air interstate rule camr the clean air mercury rule and cavr the clean air visibility rule 10 one explanation might be that while final these rules have not yet been implemented and are being challenged in court in this respect however they are not materially different from some pre2004 rules epas baseline modeling includes finalized but not implemented state rules and negotiated settleme nts along with finalized epa rules for which serious disputes still exist with respec t to implementation such as the heavy duty diesel rule second possibility is that time constraints prevented epa from updating its baseline assumption from 2003 adjusting the mode l to incorporate more recent data and assumptions would have required substantial commitment of time delaying completion of the analysis as discussed later the groundi ng of the analysis in 2003 eg hg control costs and natural gas supply assumptions may be leading to unrealistic projections 11 cair the clean air interstate rule camr the clean air mercury rule and cavr the clean air visibility rulediscussion and crs reanalysis choice of baseline assumptions epas multipollutant regulatory analysis assumes as baseline that in the absence of new legislation epa and the states will take additional action to control so2 nox hg or co2 emissions beyond those rules regulations or agreements finalized by mid2004 this ba seline is put forth despite three rules recently finalized by epa that directly bear on so2 nox and hg9 why epa chose not to include three finalized rules that clearly delineate epas current approach to addressing so2 nox and hg control is unclear10 instead epa included the three regulations as sixth proposal for controlling these pollutants curious designation for finalized rule s this report uses that analysis the caircamrcavr11 case for its baseline because it most accurately portrays the status of current and future clean air regulation with respect to these pollutants arguably the uncertainty with respect to those rules and others is more than the uncertainty about the specific provisions and implementation of any multipollutant legislation for example s 843 was introduced in the 108th congress there is guarantee that 109th congress or later version would maintain the deadlines contained in the 2003 proposal likewise th managers mark almost by definition was an evolving proposal and could ch ange again if the committee resumes consideration of it finally the regula tions supporting any passe d legislation would be subject to some of the same uncertainties and delays as the finalized regulations that were not included in epas baseline controlling air pollution is moving target and we believe it is impor tant that any analysis work from updated baseline projections and assumptions when possible choice of benchmark analysis epas cost analysis places special emphasis on three basic parametershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33165crs6 12 eia is the division of the department of energy responsible for official projections of energy supply demand prices etcelectric demand price elastic ity demand response epa analyzes two scenarios 1 zero price elasticity ie demand response to increasing electricity prices and 2 very inelastic shortterm price elasticity ie very limited demand response to increasing electricity prices assumed shortterm construction constraints feasibility epa analyzes two scenarios 1 an assumed shortage in boilermaker labor that limits the amount of so2 and nox emissions control equipment that can be built by 2010 and 2 an assumption that the market will respond to the demand for new equi pment in timely fashion ie constraint on short term construction assumed electricity demand growth and natural gas supply epa analyzes two scenarios 1 epas baseline assumption of 155 annual electricity demand growth nd baseline natural gas prices of 334 per mmbtu in 2010 1999 dollars and 2 the energy information administration12 eia baseline assumption of 183 annual electricity demand growth nd baseline natural gas prices of 362 per mmbtu in 2010 1999 dollars under epa model these prices rise under the impact of proposed legislation based on these parameters epa developed four scenar ios that include different combinations of these assumpti ons as shown in figure 1 epas base case scenario assumes zero price demand elasticity shortterm constructi on constraints and epa electricity demand growth and natural gas supply assumptions construction constraint scenario assumes zero price elasticity shortterm constructi on constraints and epas electricity growth and natural gas supply assumptions epa demand response scenario assumes very inelastic shortterm price elasticity shortterm cons truction constraints and epas electricity growth and natu ral gas supply assumptions higher electricity growth and natural gas scenario assumes zero price elasticity shortterm construction constraints and eias higher electricity growth and natu ral gas supply assumptions this report uses epas demand response scenario as the benchmark analysis this choice is compromise based on the three factors and lack of alternative combinations each of the scenarios rais questions however the strongest case can be made for including shortterm demand response function in the modelinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33165crs7 13 the classic survey of electricity price elasticities is

but not zeroyes epa assumptions higher electricity growth and natural gas priceszero yes higher eia assumptions into their demand response scenario the only scenario to contain the demand function are well within the range suggested by the literature why epa did not choose to include this refinement in all of the scenarios is unclear however epa only included it in the one so crs chose it this is not to suggest that the other assumptions incorporated in the demand response scenario are not batable particularly epa s assumption with respect to boilermaker labor epa assumes in three of the four scenarios above that there will be limited boilermaker labor for constructing so2 and nox control equipment until 2010 following which unlimited bor would be available14 this is an assumption epa incorporated into its regulatory rulemaking on the clean air interstate rule cair also called the interstate air quality rule iaqr this constraint has been questioned by some including the institute of clean air companies icac the trade association that repres ents the air pollution control industry during the rulemaking on cair icac conducted thei r own analysis of boilermaker laborhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33165crs8 15 institute of clean air companies iaqr projected 2015 control technology can be installed by 2010 p 10 16 indeed not including demand response would compound the effects of the feasibility constraint discussed here with the feasibility constraint and zero price elasticity the model continues to build new generation capacity despite price increases bumping into the feasibility constraints that further bump up pr ices that are not responded to not including demand response function affects only the two nonclear skies bills including proper demand response function into the analysis mitigates this effect to some degreeavailability and found cons traint on construction even if the 2015 deadline of cair was moved to 2010 as stated by icac in summary the air pollution control industry has demonstrated that they are able to install significant amount s of air pollution control equipment in short periods of time this has b een demonstrated more recently with the installation of scrs selective catalytic reduction controls for the nox sip call as well as for control installations in both germany and japan the resources required for th projected installations under the iaqr will also require significant number of air pollution control installations but the resources required to complete them are not expected to be limiting factors such as th use of modular construction methods and nonunion craft labor will reduce the demand for union boilermakers this reduction in boilermaker demand combined with the six month increase in compliance time wi ndow will further reduce the demand on boilermaker labor in the event of shortage additiona l boilermaker labor is available through the canadian boilermaker union as well as from ship builders and iron workers labor pool s in conclusion there will be more than sufficient boilermaker capacity to carry out the projected iaqr and control installation for 2010 and 2015 even more significantly it will be possible to complete the 2015 re quirements in the 2010 timeframe15 the assumption of limited boilernaker availability which only affects the two most stringent alternatives s 843 and s 150 is included in three of the four scenarios used by epa in its analysis the one scenario that removes this constraint simultaneously assumes zero price elastic ity for electricity demand thus despite questions with respect to this assumption one is forced to choose whether to address it or to address the demand elasticity assumption crs be lieves that given the lack of an epa alternative that includes both demand elasticity and boilermaker constraint it is more important to include demand elasticity function in the benchmark analysis than to remove the questionable feasibility constraint16 thus we chose epas demand response scen ario as our base case finally there is the important issue of future natural gas supply there are facts about the future and therefore nsitivity analysis is very important to understand the robustness of co st estimates the natural gas supply curves developed for the epas model generally project more natural gas availability at lower prices than the natural gas supply curves deve loped by eia epa provides one scenario with the steeper eia supply curves higher electricity growth and natural gas scenario along with the shortterm feasib ility constraint and zero shortterm pricehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33165crs9 17 for additional discussion of these points see crs report rl32782 clear skies and the clean air act whats the difference by larry parker and james mccarthyelasticity in the current market climate it is difficult not to argue that the eia curves may be more representative of future supplies than epas estimates however natural gas supply has long history of volatility and the 15year time frame of the analysis leaves plenty of room for debate recognizing serious ques tions about epa s feasibility constraints and the historic volatility of the natu ral gas market this analysis uses the demand response scenario as the basis of its discussion including shortte rm demand function is fully justified based on the literature results of the analysis clear skies clear skies would cost substantially less than the other two bills both in the short and longterm as indicated by tables 2 and 3 clear skies costs and benefits are minimal compared with the reconstructed baseline case that clear skies has the lowest cost should not be surp rising compared to the other bills it has less stringent requirements and later deadlines so particularly in the early years there is vast difference in the annual costs of the three approaches in particular the provisions with respect to hg are weak compared with the other two bills and there are provisions for co2 more importantly as discu ssed in previous crs report clear skies is principally an attempt to revamp the clean air acts existing structure with something more costeffective17 clear skies benefits would also be substantially less than the carper and jeffords bills which were designed to reduce pollution faster than existing requirements in 2010 the clear skies bill would provide 6 billion in annual benefits according to epa compared to benefits of 51 billion carper and 83 billion jeffords the benefits of clear skies almost merge with the baseline increase in later years and continue to lag the two other bills which have benefits of 19 billion and 66 billion annually in 2020 the higher benefits for the carper and jeffords bills reflect the fact that clear skies required pollution caps are less stringent and the implementa tion schedule is more relaxed as noted epa compares the three bills effects to baseline that does not include current clean air ac t requirements if one adjusts the baseline to reflect current clean air act requirements incl uding the cair camr and cavr rules promulgated earlier this year clear skies has essentially incremental cost its benefits are also relatively small equal to an additional 10 of the benefits of the newly promulgated rules in 2010 and only 2 of the benefits in 2020 this result suggests the success epa has had in incorporating the marketbased regulatory scheme of clear skies into its new regulations at the same time the analysis may bolster the arguments of clear skies oppone nts who maintain that the requirements of current law are at least as g ood as the clear skies requirements s 150 jeffords as indicated by tables 2 and 3 senator jeffords bill would have the greatest benefits in 2010 its benefits would be 83 billion annuallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33165crs10 32 billion more than those of the carper b ill and bout 14 times the benefits of clear skies in 2020 its bene fits continue to exceed thos of the other bills at an estimated 66 billion annually they are thr eeandahalf times t hose of the carper bill and 22 times those of clear skies table 2 epa

benefit estimates presented represent th midpoint of the range provided by epa s 150 would also be the most costly bill as discussed later more than the other bills the jeffords bill suffers from the shortterm construction constraints epa imposed on the analysis epa maintains that shortage of skilled labor will limit the number of scrubbers that can be installe d by 2010 lacking scrubbers coalfired power plants are forced to shut down in the agencys analysis of the bill the jeffords bill would reduce coal production and coal fired electric generation by about 40 according to epa vast numbers of natura lgasfired and renewable fuel generators would be required in their place at great cost the jeffords bill would lead to anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33165crs11 additional 65 gigawatts of generation from renewable sources about 6 times the amount projected under either of the ot her options and nearly 100 gigawatts of additional oil and gasfired capacity by contrast coal use would increase under either clear skies or the carper bill while the cost of s 150 may lead clear skies proponents to characterize it as too costly the net benefits of s 150 ie benefits minus costs far exceed those of clear skies and s 843 s 843 carper as indicated by tables 2 and 3 both the benefits and costs of s 843 are lower than those of s 150 but higher than those of clear skies this is by design as s 843 attempts to ach ieve substantial emi ssion reductions beyond those currently incorporated in the clean air act but allow sufficient time to avoid serious shortterm price incr eases as discussed later the more phasedin schedule of the bill helps mitigate but does not liminate the shortterm constraints epa imposes on the analysis in addition as discussed later s 843 develops limited and flexible co2 requirement that achieves some reduction in the increase in carbon dioxide emissions at nominal cost sensitivity analysis epa conducted number of sensitivity anal yses on the various bills as noted earlier three variables highlighted by the an alyses were 1 price elasticity 2 short term construction constr aints and 3 higher electricity growth and more constrained natural gas supply unfortunately these va riables were not isol ated from each other but examined in selected combinations as noted earlier the benchmark analysis used for this report assumes limited s hortterm price elasticity shortterm construction constraints and epas electricity growth and natural gas supply curves the other three combinations that epa analyzed were construction constraint scenario which assumes zero price elasticity shortterm constraint s and epas electricity growth and natural gas supply curves epa base case scenario which assumes zero price elasticity short term constraints and epa electricity growth and natural gas supply curves and higher electricity growth and natural gas scenario which assumes zero price elasticity shortterm constraints and eias higher electricity growth and natural gas supply curves the first alternative the construc tion constraint scen ario removes epas assumed shortterm c onstruction constraint assumpti on contained in the benchmark analysis but includes zero demand pri ce elasticity assumption as indicated in table 4 this swap of assumptions is pretty much wash for s 843 and the managers mark indeed in the case of s 843 the analysis indicates that the short term construction assumptions are slightly more important to the cost analysis than the removal of any price elasticity howe ver the assumption of zero demand price elasticity in this scenario has substan tial impact on the cost of s 150 both shorthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33165crs12 36 increase and longterm 157 increas as the removal of any price elasticity exceeds the saving gained by removing epa shortterm construction constraint assumptions this is not surprising given the significant compliance cost of s 150 cost that with zero elasticity assu med results in

elasticity estimate of our benchmark an alysis with an assumption of zero price elasticity the shortterm construction constraint assumptions are maintained this case confirms the dramatic effect that removal of any shortterm price elasticity has on the costs of s 150 with increases of 63 in 2010 and 147 in 2020 over the benchmark analysis and indicat the relative size of the effect on s 843 for s 843 removal of any price elasticity results in cost estimate 86 higher than our benchmark estimate for 2010 along with th first sensitivity analysis this result suggests that demand response and shortte rm construction cons traint assumptions heavily influence epas 2010 cost estima tes for s 843 in contrast epas assumptions have little effect on s 843 cost estimates in the longterm or for the managers mark the third alternative the higher electricity growth and natural gas scenario essentially takes the zero price elasticity estimate and shortterm construction constraint assumptions of the epa base case scenario and adds eias higher electricity growth assumptions and steeper natural gas supply curves compared with the benchmark analysis this case maintain s the shortterm c onstruction constraint assumption removes any demand price elas ticity and employs eia assumptions for electricity growth and natural gas supply not surprisingly the combination of zero demand response greater demand for elect ricity and tighter natural gas supply results in higher costs particularly for s 150 compared with the assumptions of the epa base case the effect of higher grow th and natural gas costs in the context of zero demand response is most pronounced in the case of s 150 and puts even morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33165crs13 pressure on epas assumption of zero mand price elasticity particularly for 2020 the impact on s 843 is considerably ss dramatic and is nonexistent for the managers mark however the sensitivity analysis here is pretty limited and more comprehensive analysis of future natural gas availability could be valuable in determining appropria targets and timetables for any multipollutant legislation cost analysis summary points epas assumption of zero demand price elasticity has dramatic impact on the s 150 short and longt erm cost estimates this effect is accentuated when eia higher electricity growth and natural gas assumption are employed particular ly over the long term removal of epas assumed shor tterm construction c onstraints reduces the effect some in the short term but does not overcome it epas assumption of zero dema nd price elasticity and assumed shortterm construction constraints appear to have significant and about equal effects on s 843 in the short term both effects decrease substantially over the long term even if eias higher cost assumptions are employed because of s 843s ss aggressive time frame epas assumptions have little effect on the managers mark cost estimates either short or longterm this is not surprising as the basis of the managers mark and much of newlyfinalized regulations clear skies was veloped using epas model that the managers mark has only an incremental impact on the cost and benefits of existing law and regulations ensures that its economic impact is minimal under any conditions compared with those of existing laws and regulations specific issues highlighted carbon dioxide control costs two of the bills analyzed by epa sena tor jeffords s 150 and senator carpers s 843 contain provisions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions the s 150 provision sets an emissions cap of 205 billion t ons annually beginning in 2010 about 7 below 1990 levels s 843 would set an emissions cap of about 2655 billion tons estimated 2006 emissions in 2009 decreas ing to 2454 billion tons 2001 emissions level beginning in 2013 as indicated in table 5 the more modest reduction requirement combined with slower re duction schedule results in an order of magnitude lower costs for co2 allowances under s 843 compared to s 150 the s 150 reduction requireme nt and schedule are more representative of the requirements of the kyoto protocol than s 843 as indicated in table 5 adjusting s 150s carbon dioxide reduction costs for 2005 dollars and metric tons results in costs of 19 metric ton in 2010 and 33 metric ton in 2020 this estimate rangehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33165crs14 18 as of november 4 2005 according to

control technologies instead relying on assumptions used in conducting analyses of the cair and camr rules promulgated early in 2005 those anal yses used cost and costeffectiveness data collected in 2003 as noted in an earlier crs report the effectiveness of mercury control technology has advanced ra pidly since 2003 thus we conclude that the present analysis may overstate the cost of emission controls for mercury by substantial margin the air pollution cont rol industry maintains that the cost of activated carbon injection aci contro ls which the model assumes would be imposed on about 40 of coalfired plants under the carper bill is now only one fourth what the cost would have been in 200319 epas hg control cost assumptions have less of distorting effect in its analysis of s 150 simply because its other assump tions discussed earlier lead it to conclude that 40 of coalfired plants woul d be shut down by 2010 under the bill benefits estimates epas analysis and crss reanalysis of the data show benefits substantially outweighing costs for both s 150 and s 843 the benefits represent the monetized human health effects principally reduced mortality from reducing emissions of so2 and fine particles some of these benefits are summarized in table 6 belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33165crs15 20 for additional discussion of the benefits of controlling mercury emissions and epas varied

effects are incremental to the effects of the cair camr and cavr rules three other sets of likely be nefits were not estimated at least in part because of the methodological difficulty of doing so first the analysis makes attempt to monetize environmental benefits which are significant in the case of sulfur dioxide and mercury controls so2 emissions are the primary cause of acid deposition which harms aquatic life and affects forest growth as well as damaging building materials reductions in so2 emissions could have significan t environmental benefits which are not estimated in the analysis the emissions are also significant factor in the formation of regional haze th effects of which were so not monetized mercury deposition as noted earlier has led to wide spread fish consumption advisories with attendant economic impacts the omission of environmental benef its has its greatest effect on s 150 and s 843 whic h have more aggressive so2 nox and hg control schemes second the analysis does not model mercur heath effects agency analyses of the economic benefits of reducing hg health effects have ranged from few million dollars per year to several billion dollars per year20 the impact of omitting these benefits would be significant if one accepts the latter estimate once again this omission has its greatest effect on s 150 nd s 843 which have more aggressive hg control schemes finally the analysis did not attempt to estimate the possible benefits of controlling co2 emissions there is accepted methodology for making such an estimate still the absence of such factor in the analysis may be significant omission which understates the potential benefits of the jeffords and carper bills the jeffords bill is the most aggressive of the three in regard to controlling co2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33165crs16 whereas clear skies does not cap co2 emissions at all thus the jeffords bill may be most disadvantaged as result of this factor conclusion in reexamining epas analysis several points stand out in thinking about multi pollutant legislation epa has been very successful in incorporating the caps of clear skies in now promulgated rules as result after adjusting for those rules epas analysis finds little cost and small benefit associated with passage of clear skies legislation the jeffords and carper bills however set more stringent standards than the promulgated rules for both bills the analysis shows benefits far outweighing additional costs carbon dioxide costs depend on the amount and schedule of any proposed reductions the modest re duction requirement and relaxed implementation schedule of s 843 results in nominal carbon dioxide reduction costs as reducti on requirements increase and implementation schedules tighten costs rise mercury control costs are dependent on the timeliness of the data the epa analysis does not reflect current data on costs of hg controls epas benefit analysis is limited and incomplete which works to the disadvantage of alternatives to clear skies that include more stringent standards although it represents step toward unde rstanding the impacts of the legislative options epas analysis is not as usef ul as one could hope the combination of assumptions used in the analysis works in favor of the various clear skies alternatives by overstating the hg control costs of the alternatives and through its assumption of constraints on labor availa bility heavily penalizing shortterm pollution reduction schedules in addition th analysis does not adequately analyze the effect that natural gas price volatility may have on implementation strategies and costs the analysis suffers from bein g based on 2003 assumptions both in terms of natural gas markets and hg control costs the result is an analysis that some will argue is longer sufficiently uptodate to contribute substantively to congressional debate
