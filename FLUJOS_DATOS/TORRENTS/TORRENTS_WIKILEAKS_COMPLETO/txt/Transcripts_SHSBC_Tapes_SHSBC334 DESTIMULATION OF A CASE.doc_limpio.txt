destimulation of case lecture given on 10 september 1963 thank you well autumn has come and you may arrive too someday all right this is the what audience september the 10th ten september ad 13 saint hill special briefing course the lecture today concerns service facsimiles scientology iiicapital i capital i capital i dont go spelling it capital arabic three because its not arabic itsuse arabic numerals to apply to routines when youre talking about body of data use roman numeral i will clarify this little bit better ive been evenclarificationshow you im getting around to chip into the odd corners of things the clarification ive been hitting for recently has been as low level as fixing up some sample auditor reports so that everythings in proper place on an auditor report i mean things are getting awfully buttoned up around here im going to tell you about service facsimiles and how to find one on pc and im going to tell you something about the zones of restimulation in auditing otherwise youre gonna be sitting there in the auditors chair one of these fine days and finds yourself with mo restimulation on your hands than you could possibly imagine existed now you dont think youre handling an arc breaky subject when youre handling scientology iii but let assure you when you go in for service facsimiles you are handling stuff which can bypass more charge than any other single item there is for two reasons one pc gives you the service facsimile you refuse the service facsimile you bypass the most vital charge on his case and of course he blows his skull off and you pick bits of bone off the ceiling for weeks see thats all thats necessary i dont mean to frighten you i just mean to terrorize you now i learned most of this stuff the hard way and you could probably learn it too the hard way but i dont think we ought to expend one pc to train one auditor or something like that its too high cost lets try to lead you along the line little more gently we expect certain amount of auditing casualty but we dont expect that casualty to be permanent and when you are dealing with service facsimile youre handling what makes aberration permanent quote unquote nobodys ever been able to do anything with this before but its funny that lot of boys have nibbled around the edges youll see freudian teeth marks around on the edges of the service facsimile hadnt been dented any but youll see his teeth marks for instance its very interesting how many preclears have second dynamic service facsimiles well the reason for this has nothing to do with life but it merely has to do with your situation on this planet at this particular time i know that sounds absolutely goofy but the sickness incidence of illness and so forth on this planet is unusually high for planets in this universe for the excellent reason that the way to make everybody wrong of course is obviously to produce nothing that makes everybody wrong makes the government wrong makes the betweenlives boys wrong makes everybody wrong you see because they count on guys going ahead and making bodies and keeping the civilization wheeling to keep thetan interested enough so that hell keep reporting back through theyou know the whole system is based on this but thats why the industrialist is in trouble on this particular planet at this particular time is because hes producing and going on whole track basis we find that thetan is in trouble simply because of mest thats the way he looks at it you see hes in trouble because of mest and if he could just have arranged at the outset of all this never to have created anything then he wouldnt have anything now to be in or be in trouble with dont you see the reasoning quite obvious reasoning probably quite valid so any creative activity is doomed to attack youll find the artists and musicians of this particular planet always have some schnook alongside of them to cave them in they always marry the wrong girl you know and get the wrong agent and because theyre creating the industrialist the manufacturer that sort of thing these boys its not because of any deepseated communist plot its just they are in trouble thats all they havent got enough force to protect their own creativeness and as result why people attack them elementary basic answer on the whole track if you had never had anybody create anything you would have trouble nothing had ever been created why of course you wouldnt have any universe to be in trouble in this is all very elementary and therefore you find lot of service facsimiles that have to do with the second dynamic and herein lies the difficulty you take it as service facsimile you dust it off as service facsimile you operate as service facsimile and you very harshly and tightly keep the itsa line in this lifetime you preface any question youre asking in an assessment preface any question you are asking in any list of any kind preface any question you are asking as an auditing question with in this lifetime but severely and you will get into minimum amount of trouble so long as you do one other thing now you see that isnt something thats nice to do that is something that you will be blowing your brains out one of these days if you didnt do you understand youll say oh my god you know oohhhh why did i get up this morning you know because you just didnt use that see you didnt circumscribe the pcs attention line to this lifetime so that is the first thing we must know about the service facsimile were engaged upon keyout we are not engaged upon bank erasure thats the next thing to know and of course that is contingent upon the other fact if youre engaged upon keyout youd better damn well stay in this lifetime and if youre engaged upon bank erasure of scientology iv well thats another horse of another hue and you certainly had better keep scientology iv and iii together and thats the next thing you ought to know first preface everything with in this lifetime dont let the pcs attention skip outside of this lifetime see just keep it there man because its going to go it goes with the greatest of ease and this is befraught with many many liabilities because when youre circumscribing his attention that tightly and you refuse to let him put his itsa line on something hes just put his itsa line on of course you bypass all that charge well i leave you to worry about that one its keyout thats your next thing ive just given you its key out procedure its not bank erasure procedure youre engaged upon key out and i can tell you why and your activities are all guided by the fact that one little step beyond what youre doing leads you into the bank this is thinice activity if you recognize it as anything but thinice activity sooner or later youre going to get into trouble thinice activity the pc unbeknownst to him is walking across thin crust of ice and hes liable to go through it any minute which is to say go on to the whole track swish now the moment you combine scientology iii with scientology iv youre going to lose right now youre going to lose youve had it why simple elementary youre doing scientology iii and you find goal yeah well we found this goal we might as well run it out might as well go back on the track and run it out youre now doing scientology iv youre erasing the bank youre not keying out youll be sorry you can get away with it you can get away with it but recognize youre longer making clear and recognize you probably have not handled the restimulative factors of the pc you started out to handle and recognize that your backtrack is just throwing in more restimulation on the case all right so how do we get around that you word every question as far as possible since its not always possible so that you wont get goalword your questions if you can so that you wont get goal as an answer on your list and you avoid all rocket reading items as answers to your assessments if it rocket reads leave it alone because only gpm rocket reads i know this is horrible this puts you in terrible situation youve now taken the wrong item off the list havent you you go down you null this list of whats safe assumption for coonbats good you get nice long list safe assumption for coonbats and you get tear gas bombs see you get this and you get that and you get the other thing and you get to be old and youre going down the list youre nulling this thing tear gas bombs goes tick and to be old rocket reads oh look at that service facsimile man hoho what wonderful service facsimile oh look at it rocket read oh hell youthe more you monkey with it the more youre going to go sliding into the bank actually you could get away with running it in this lifetime you could get away with it and you could key it out as long as you dont oppose it or you dont do anything to it or dont run any 3m2 or dont list on it any further and handle it very gingerly and do your prepcheck very neatly with in this lifetime on every prepcheck question see you probably could park it back on the backtrack and you might be able to do the pc lot of good and i dont say you cant do it but you are already running pc who was walking on thin ice you see and now you have turned heat ray loose on the lake the moment that youre using this rocket reading item see i dont say its impossible because youve got two liabilities now you can take wrong item off the list tear gas bombs and run that with great occasional dissatisfaction of the pc or you can take this other thing and just act as though you were prepchecking goal but only in this lifetime see so you can get around this you can get around this the moment you do anything else with it youre running scientology iv and youre away and youre longer doing scientology iii and youre not going to make clear and your ambitions for present time restimulation are not going to be reached and you havent destimulated the pc you have restimulated the pc and the probable reason that youre doing scientology iii in the first place is overrestimulation on the part of the pc you see this you see that as distinct liability now what do you do what do you do what is the absolute textbook answer you use your judgment but by god dont go back and run that goal if youre going to stay with it you can mark it down as goal that you have now found for later reference you can probably do lot of things but youreyoure in trouble so the best answer is to ask questions that dont give you goals see they dont give you goals the question cant be answered to be safe question has to be answered in some other way like safety get the idea you take ayou take solution tell solution to that item see that part of existence or item or whatever it is see tell solution the guys going to say to bip and to bap and to bee and to bot and to bot and to buk and to bow bowt and uh well you cant do anything about it except sit there nervously but the point im making is is it doesnt produce actually the best service facsimile assessment you want safe assumption about it or safe assumption for it or you want stable datum that you would have in regard to it youre liable to get goals but you wont get them with the same frequency you say youve got theyouve got the service facsimile spotted that has something to do with the law see and youve got something like what is safe assumption about the law you normally get that it will dont you see that it will that it does dont you see that everybody is crooked see that cops are good you know stuff of this particular character you say give safe solution to the law to run like hell to move to get out see oh boy guys coming right up with goals list see you dont want it see service facsimiles are almost never to almost never to but they could be expressed that way but the moment theyre expressed that way youre much more likely to key in goal so youre in trouble object of auditing is to get as much done as you can without getting anyinto any more trouble than you have to auditing is not an activity inwhere the auditor is always out of trouble there is such thing as perfect session there is such thing as perfect intensives where at time does the auditor ever get into more hot water than he might otherwise have done you see therestheresno pc has ever run over long period of time without an arc break just make up your mind to this see first place its almost impossible to bypass charge now youll find that skilled scientology iii bypasses much less charge than unskilled or semiskilled scientology iv you have more gorgeous opportunity of colliding with charges to bypass with scientology iv than you do with iii so the thing to do the obvious solution is to run iii in such way as to keep it out of iv now you should have very clearcut idea of what youre trying to do with scientology iii very clearcut destimulation is its keynote it is the technology of destimulation and therefore the more that you restimulate the wronger you will be it is possible to be wronger than wrong the aristotelian absolute can be exceeded the individual who is being destimulated is having very worthwhile activity performed possibly you might not have too clearcut an idea why because i myself just few weeks ago did not really consider it worthwhile until i took apart all of its elements and looked it over very carefully now i see that it is very worthwhile it became necessary to do this in the search for tone arm action tone arm action is very necessary in auditing great many pcs on the whole track do not get tone arm action you can run out gpms with rocket reads and so forth but you dont get tone arm action and therefore this is very vicious proposition youre going to practically kill somebody if you run him three sessions without tone arm action you take pc in queasy state and run him two hours without tone arm action youll wish you hadnt i mean its that critical you want tone arm action well tone arm action ceases in the presence of overrestimulation so the whole track is too restimulative to the pc obviously if it locks up his tone arm elementary when tone armshe stop moving when tone arm stop moving pcs in overrestimulation if confucius had said it he would be very wise man thats stable datum about tone arm action if you havent got tone arm action on the pc pc is in state of overrestimulation there is another state that i can point out to you of tone arm action which is simply auditing nothing on the pc you can put pc on the cans and walk off to the other side of the room and sit down on the chair and its very probable that the ta will not move for hours on end i just want to call this to your attention too but actually thats quite rare since just the mechanics of auditing shift charge around controlling the pcs attention upon himself or his environment will shift charge so to all intents and purposes were left with just one reasonproviding any auditing is being done at allwere left with just one reason why the tone arm isnt moving and the tone arm isnt moving for the excellent reason the pcs in overrestimulation lets take an example of room call tone arm action moving person we have moving person in this room tone arm action see now we fill the room half full of cotton bales we call these cotton bales charge notice that this person moving around in the room can only move half as much because its half full of cotton bales now lets put the remaining half of the room half full of cotton bales now this moving person of course can only move quarter as much as he could in the first place and only half as much as he could just few minutes ago got the idea all right call these cotton bales charge still and lets fill up the room with cotton bales our moving person doesnt move and very green inexperienced auditor who doesnt know any of this tries thereafter just to get more cotton bales in the room thats the hallmark of an inexperienced auditor tone arm action is reduced move more cotton bales in the room lets get some more engrams going lets get some more gpms in there lets restimulate few more present time problems lets really shove it to this guy well get tone arm action sooner or later yes you will too down well i finally made clear there he sits 30needle doesnt move at all hes very calm hes very calm as matter of fact he never says anything to anybody must be clear he went through period of low tone arm but i cured him of that well of course the symptom of all those disorders arenaturally are just the theory that if you put more charge in restimulation on the case youll eventually get tone arm action and i think this is the way the psychiatrist works medical psychiatrist by the way did you notice that the medico is getting an awful beating on the subject did you notice in the times medical doctors want nothing to do with mental healing they only had six lectures on the subject and didnt understand those the medical doctor is not competent in the field of the mind and moving out of the field of the mind interesting isnt it round and round the little ball goes and where it stops god help us did you notice this propaganda line thats going on well keep an eye on it because we got it going now were reducing false data out of the societythat they know what theyre doing scientology 0 is at work weve just developed new one scientology 0 the illumination of unknown areas and false data as prelude to the introduction to stable data scientology 0 interesting well i bring that up at this time really because its interesting but i could use it as an example of what youre doing with clearing youre getting all of the chronic restimulation off of case before you walk ahead with the case now what youre doing there is removing lot of false nonsense off the case service facsimiles and that sort of thing youre destimulating this lifetime and if youre very slippy and youre very clever youll get the wildest tone arm action youve ever seen on pc in scientology iii youll never see tone arm like it tone arm action like it in scientology iv you start hitting in close to that thing called service facsimile even close to it sit out on border of it someplace and just start moving in man that needle starts loosening up and that tone arm starts moving and its wham wham wham an auditor really has to work to prevent tone arm action in scientology iii he has to sit there with both feet braced against the tone arm to keep it from moving its almost impossible not to get tone arm action providing you follow its very basic rules very difficult you dont even have to have the service facsimile and you can get tone arm action its quite remarkable lets look at this thing then called restimulation since thats very important to scientology iii since every case you will approach is in state of overrestimulation thats all cases you have anything to do with theyre all overrestimulated they walk in off the street they come in from government agencies they come in anyplace and everyplace they leak out of the walls from the fda you know out of the woodwork come out from underneath the rocks from the american medical association all these guys are in state of overrestimulation all of them thoroughly overrestimulated thats the hallmark and the keynote to their activities and conduct this is why they act the way they do whatever the screwball activities that theyre exhibiting however all this hangs up or why or anything else they can be said to be overrestimulated and that would be very accurate statement because the way you keep somebody trapped and the way you keep somebody sucked into it is never let him go sit down on rock and think it over youve got to keep kicking him around see youve got to have economic pressures you know youve got to have this youve got to have that youve got to have familial complications youve got to have problems man youve got to have trouble youve got to have finance youve got to have banks youve got to have currency control youve got to have things like income tax youve got to have rising and lowering costs of living youve got to have booms and depressions things have got to be hectic you understand this guys got to be kept worried if hes kept worried long enough and gets his attention extroverted hard enough and so forth he will remain trapped the basic mechanism of entrapment of course is not just being on pole someplace and trapped you understand or just being in body the complications of entrapment are little more broad and little more complex than that they have to do with professor utgat at the local spinbini mean universitywho is saying the economic situation is far too complex for normal understanding but if you merely keep everybody in want you will have economics uhthe idea then is to increase demand now if you sufficiently increase demand everybody will be afraid of starving to death and uhthey will end up in actual want and this will keep them from ever thinking sensible thought they will too bebe too busy with the ideas of survival and the worries and problems of life and so forth actually hed be very wise man if he spoke exactly like that so actually his speech in essence is shortened to this strive confuse and thats economics now were going to take up the principle of government uhartistic harassment is our first subject youreyou get into large protest against this particular planet not understanding some of it you start moving up scale you begin to understand some of this you begin to understand it as simply an extended act of entrapment the thetan wants something out of it and he thinks theres some pay in other words the trap wouldnt run at all dont you see unless the thetan was so busy in it that he never had time to look at it you see so the idea is that you chase him hard enough and you harass him hard enough you worry him hard enough why he never has an opportunity to sit down and take look at anything so if he never has an opportunity to do that hell make lot of foolish decisions and these foolish decisions you see are made to hold back foolish confusions and the net result of that of course is hes now in more trouble than he was before and if hed made decision at all he would have been better off dont you see so it goes from one entrapment to another type of entrapment and so forth in economics just think just think of being without money for two weeks supposing you had money of any kind for two weeks well its quite fascinating i mean as principle because theres really reason in the world why you should have any money for two hundred years whats money money is course in economies at the local university i guess its an idea and fixation some kind of representation of something for something to begin with its bum itsa see thewhat is it doesnt even have metal behind it now see some kind of an idea is afloat that its exchanging from zub to zub and here guys are going off skyscrapers half mile tall and everything else to get quick buck you see absolutely fascinating as matter of fact you can take handful of money out and buy most anybody on this planet why well i dont know but it sure is confusing that you can be absolutely sure of see thatsits pretty doggone confusing he got the idea that if he gets enough of this stuff you see somehow or another hell be free well what the hell was he while he was getting enough of this stuff you know thats silly look this over you look over socialism and you recognize its far more complex than old capitalism was capitalism was complex enough theres hardly anything left of it but it was plenty complex but capitalism there was some time when you could buy off your debt to the local money lender you see there was time you could at least look forward to time you see hopefully that there would be time when you came out of it there was possibility that good luck and steady application and so forth would eventually cut this thing off and youd longer owe this debt there was some hope involved well in socialism you havent got prayer see actually the end product of socialism is youre not permitted to save any money so insomehow or another youre trying to buy yourself off in some way but of course you never do get bought off in any way shape or form so theres end to the amount of involvement in which you are mixed up you see what i mean so youwhat you see is perfecting system of attentionshifting all of these things are theyre attentionfixation attentiondispersal attentionshifting all of these various things are all part and parcel of keeping somebody tied down now that isnt just snide comment that isnt just cynical comment on our modern society this is an actualthis isif you dont have bars on the trap you can have principles of one kind or another you see you can have political solutions of some kind or another each one little more cockeyed than the last you see now you look around and youre in terrible protest about some things done on this planet when as matter of sober fact that is what youreprobably what youre supposed to do protest they are not there in the final analysis because somebody is stupid they are there because somebody has been very clever and they have provided piece of randomity of sufficient magnitude to keep somebody consistently enturbulated thus overrestimulation continuously occurs you have to keep somebody overrestimulated by keying him in and doing various things to him in life you see that all right your pc walks into your session subject to all these mechanisms of restimulation there he is see and we call this environmental restimulation this is all very elementary actually these are sources of overrestimulation now your first area here is his pt environment see and we call this environmental restimulation thats source of restimulation here is your pc insession see hes abouthes right here coming into session see one pc and were looking now at the restimulation were looking at the restimulation to which he is subject and theres this environmental restimulation thats the old lady the old lady just flew another snit you know and thats odds and ends of this particular character you see there was note on his desk that morning which has begun dear jakes in view of the fact that we are making less money than we were before and then nobody finished the note see theres story in the newspaper you see all workers beyond forty years of age will hereinafter be reconstituted see he wonders what the hell that is shoes are wearing out and the shoe store longer sells that design of shoes you know in other words life is hell but its just continuous little barbed arrows you see of restimulation you see heres restimulation we call it r s not r r is reality so this is all the lightning bolts dont you see this is all the lightning bolts that you run out when you say since the last time i audited you has anything been youre trying to flatten that off see so that you can audit him well you know that is necessary but these things can get so continuous that your auditing can become very very difficult see and then theres this zone this zone here see thats all part of the lightning hitting him here then theres this zone of action and that is restimulated bank by reason of service facsimile so well just call this service fac restim thats hung up here and actually theres an interdependency between this first one environmental restimulation and service fac restimulation are interrelated so we actually can draw circle around the two of them he wouldnt have pt problems if he didnt have service facs thats the discovery see nevertheless well call this service fac restimulation because theres another type of bank restimulation which he is subject to and thatthat he is battling along with hereis what has already been restimulated in auditing see see so this is past auditing restimulation see thats whats already been restimulated in auditing and not erased see weve got to take that into account now here is your current auditing restimulation this is what youre going to restimulate in session you see this is what youre going to restimulate in session you understand in the way of engrams and that sort of thing see thats what youre going to restimulate in the session those two things we can group together as pair see thats whats been restimulated and what youre going to restimulate or in the process of restimulation theres another one that you might not have paid too much attention to but which youre fighting with all the time and id better identify it and this is called session restimulation session restimulation is just restimulation by reason of being audited see high high restimulation is attendant upon an auditor who is rough rough rough see you know every time you open your mouth to talk the auditor says i meant something else keeps the itsa line cut and stuff like this dont you see little accidentals the better auditor hell just get an occasionally accidental flub you see but whatever that auditing skill is it still adds up to see session restimulation now thats not bank restimulation see thatthats just whats happening in the session to kick somebody around you got that now lets look at another one here and this is the bank now you see that anything coming from this of course has to come up here to current auditing restim may kick in past auditing restim is being kicked around by session restim got that hooks up on this restim got that and actually only can operate from service fac you look over that thats sources and zones of restimulation now just put it this way theres obviously several places from which you get restimulation theres more ways of throwing cotton bales in that room now lets go over these ways of throwing cotton bales in the room now there isnt just scientology iv methods of restimulate gpm see all right thats throwing cotton bale in the room but theres also asome bits and pieces and sometimes some mighty big cotton bales thrown in the room by rough auditing see so thats source of restimulation see and then we look at what youre auditing on the pc here as past auditing restimulation which is made up of bank which has been restimulated and not erased in past session and that has two divisions and what you are currently restimulating you see thats your other zone and then theres the present time environment that hes living in and this of course is added to the other restimulation and then that however is kicked in crossrestimulation occurs you see hes worried and hes nervy so therefore he has more arc breaks in the session dont you see so it keeps beefing up the session now all that stuff is interactive all of those sources of restimulation are interactive and the only core on which it sits in actual fact that can be touched short of knocking out the bank is the service fac the service facsimile is what keeps environmental restimulation restimulated it also has great bearing you would be surprised but it has great bearing on the amount of session restimulation which occurs it has an enormous bearing up here on past auditing restimulation which hasnt been picked up because of course it was blocking the discharge you see the full discharge of everything its going to prevent you from discharging current auditing restimulation even though you restimulate it some of it is braked dont you see by the service fac and actually his environment is in shambles all the time because of his service facsimiles see and so therefore it comes back to the service fac now the most notable thing which you missed by the way in the quiz last friday that was pointed out to you again but the most notable thing about the service facsimile is the thetan is doing ithaha well of course in the final analysis hes mocking up his bank and hes the effect of his bank too and you could say that very circuitously and at some long drawn point yes he is responsible for everything that is happening to him you see but this is intimate direct and now he doing it hes doing it right now right now hes involved in making something and somebody wrong and himself right and he is doing it all off his own little hatchet and it is just about as influenced by gpms seeits him keeping that particular gpm in restimulation see he sayshe says to crack walnuts man thats the way this lifes got to go ooh thatll fix em you know hoho and theres some gpm sitting back there to crack walnuts you know well of course he keeps that in restimulation too but that isnt really whats making him crack walnuts you understand hes cracking walnuts because hes decided that cracking walnuts is the thing to do youll find out that before he got the gpm to crack walnuts he was also cracking walnuts you understand so weve got two different problems here weve got the thetan doing it and weve got the accumulation of experience knocking his head off see so we have two sources of lightning now to be very plain here about this drawing you can see here you can see here that all of this stuff see all of this stuff in combination makes very messedup pc charge hes got charge here in fact youre not really auditing pc youre auditing live bomb live bomb liberally garnished with firecrackers and the bomb may not go off but you sure get lot of fire crackers exploding now i dont want to leave you in the dark about what restimulation is how does the auditor restimulate something i want to get this in passing here because maybe if you live long enough youll learn this how does an auditor restimulate something by putting or letting the pcs attention go on it by putting the pcs attention on it by letting the pcs attention go onto it whats it actually any charge heretofore inert which can be rekindled or if it has been restimulated already then rerestimulated or increased in restimulation now thats very technical and that sounds very esoteric and im afraid that has the terrible simplicity of mud pie dropping on sidewalk its just about that complicated im very sure that you at some time or another in session have rather wished that you had just cut your throat rather than come in to audit this particular pc because you dont seem to be able to do anything right at all everything is going wrong and you say therefore it is the pcs trouble the pc is causing this trouble well actually the pc is totally incapable of causing trouble in session the auditor can sit there like total knucklehead and let the pcs attention wander all over the bank you know pick up engram engram b engram c engram d engram waaa so on baaaw baaaw brrbrrbrrbrrbrr whooo whooo and the auditor isnt doing thing hes just sitting there being good listener see he was doing everything right and all of sudden the pc exploded in his face see well thats just accidental restimulation you just let the pc wander actually the pc is wandering under the command of his service facsimile thats whats commanding he wants to make certain zones and areas wrong and one of the ways to make them wrong is to get awful restimulated and collapse i mean thats usual you wouldnt have any such thing as psychosomatic medicine unless every thetan had the computationthey all do have the computationthat well the best way to handle it is get sick in the final analysis otherwise psychosomatic trauma would never make anybody sick and it makes everybody sick so then everybody must have the service facsimile that the way to handle the situation is to get sick you see that i mean its just open and shut because its the definition of it so everybody has the service facsimile of sickness you try to run the service facsimile of sickness ordinarily oh go ahead and run it but you limit it to this lifetime otherwise youre going to wind up there trillionstwenty ago you see because he had that for long time see thats old thatwhat comes under the heading of too much service facsimile thats almost pc dont you see theres some of these things are so confoundedly standard that you sometimes wish you hadnt started auditing them you know they go backtrack too quick too fast too upsetting all right now this business of restimulation lets get back on what this business of restimulation is this is very interesting very easy and theres nothing much to it if you want the pcs attention on cow you either let his attention wander to the cow or you say cow i mean that is how elementary it is very many auditors dont ever get the idea of how youhow they could possibly restimulate anything because they overlook the idea of the simplicity of the mechanism of restimulation if you dont want the engram about cow restimulated then you dont say cow you got the idea i mean its that elementary my dear watson you dont want the pc on gpm so you dont say anything about the gpm and thats all you want his attention on the gpm you dont mentionyou mention the gpm that is all thats the basic thing its how many times you mention it with what complexity that fixes the restimulation and increases it but to start in all you have to do is say gpm pcs going on and on and youre going to be very agreeable you see and the pcs going on and on about this service facsimile in scientology iii and hes saying welland so onanduhto be goofy thatthat seems oh that must be the goal oh i know yeah the goal we ran the other day on you the auditor doesnt look on this for what it is thats getting out this twentyfoot pointer neonlighted putting the pc squarely in front of the bank taking the pointer and putting it directly on says put your attention on that gpm there square now right there thats it right there look at it now get it all restimulated and get sparks flying off it i mean thatthats all very fancy but actually the whole operation is complete oh that goal we ran the other day yeah i know thats all thats allthats all the auditor has to do and hes restimulated the goal dont you see its too elementary just had an occasion of an auditor trying to find the time limiter and innocently asking for four engrams on an overrestimulated pc you understand he just said well whats the first time you ever had any trouble with that talking about physical injury you see four engrams bang bang bang bang boom overrestimulation bang arc break boom simple i mean this is how easy it is to restimulate somebody but you shouldnt be afraid of restimulating somebody because thats part of the auditors trade but just know what youre doing for the love of pete know what youre doing youve had four rough sessions with this pc see yousay because you want to get on the good side of the pc well im sorry weve had such rough sessions lately there goes four rough sessions pc says whawhawhawhat who who where where whats the matter who shot you understand oh but you said im sorry we had these rough sessions lately so your intention was not to restimulate the mechanism of restimulate is simply name thats the whole of restimulation name and the more often you name it the more itll restimulate and thats all now ill tell you the perfect way to produce an arc break name it and not permit it to be itsaed thats all you got to do see you say engram itsa engram itsa engram itsa arc break itits terribly fantastically elementary and thats actually all there is to rough session its the auditor naming things or preventing itsas of things which are named and thats all thats going on thats all thats going on in rough session the pc is very nervous on the subject of instructors or supervisors or something like that hes itim just talking about student now and hes gothes got twenty infraction sheets to make up before sunday or he doesnt go up to the next unit see and so forth and heeventually youve got him calmed down in the session dont you see pcs there and hes finally starting to look at his own bank and interested in his own case and youre going along just fine dont you see and then you say uhill have to ask the instructor and you say this is an arc breaky pc this is just blabbermouthed auditor you getyou get how it is see so you come back to the thing all auditors talk too much but the sources of arc break becomecome from this that is justjust naming naming and then not picking upsee in some fashion or another naming and then not picking up the itsa see and then weve ensealed in what restimulation is there if youre not going to pick up the itsa dont name it and youll have theyoull have sessions that are absolutely glass smooth youll just be absolutely fascinated youll never see such cheerful happy appreciative pcs see if youre not going to pick up the itsa dont name it man elementary my dear student theres the whole of smooth auditing now theres another way to do this another way to do this is let the session and the activities of the session bar the discharge of materials already restimulated see the auditor didnt name it but its been named from some source or another its been named and the pc the pcs sitting therethe pcs sitting there and its been named and the pc is saying itsaitsaitsaitsaitsa well is it all right with you if i start the sessuhsession now all right is it all right in the room rooms all rightuhso forth the uhuhuhsqueeze the cans uhyes yes uhpardon squeeze the cans again hmm i didnt quite get that squeeze the cans againall right now now uhall right with you if i uhstartstart the session now huh is it all right with you okay all right all right gives him session start i wont start session for you andwhat goals would you like to set for this session and is absolutely horrified to have well i dont really care to set any goals for the session as matter of fact and the auditor says what could i possibly have done its just elementary what hes done dont you see theres source of restimulation now auditors very often ask silly questions to be sociable right before they start the session and they get an itsa line going and then stop the itsa line by starting the session you can actually sit down in any session youve had that was rough one and if you hadparticularly if you had tape of it you could say oh my god you say howve you been pc says uhwell all right all right is it all right with you if we start the session now the rooms okay uhchairs all right is it all right if we audit in the room we get down to goals see what goals would you like to set for the session well huh dont care to set any goals well to live through the session this whole thing then is completely mysterious to the auditor and the mystery is complete he didnt do anything hell he didnt he put an itsa line inor he put whatsit in throw the pc whatsit i know an auditor who has rough time all the time ending sessions always puts whatsit in at the end of the session then never lets it be itsaed and then gets an explosion do you understand this see this isthis is elementary this is all there is to an arc breaky session well lets take look at this now and we see then that the auditor is in control to very marked degree of whats restimulated but on an uncleared pc the service fac is interacting with the existing restimulation so the pc is actually putting in continuous restimulative factor in sessions and you get restimulation trouble as long as the pc has prominent service facsimile now if you add then to this bank we go back to this oneif you add now if you add in restimulationall this is in place see and you add in some restimulation from down here to here see mathematics of the situation theres fifty ergs of energy in overrestimulation on the case right now so you pull in gpm from the bank which contains another fifty ergs of restimulation you now have hundred ergscapacity of the pc for easy handling is probably ten ergs to begin with so youre now auditing on an overrestimulation factor of about ten to one and you sit around and you say well why doesnt the tone arm action move whywhy dont we get tone arm action here whyyou know whats the matter with the tone arm well maybe were running the wrong gpm uhdo you suppose were running the wrong gpm here pc uhh whats the pc going to do hes going to look at each gpm that hes had anywhere around see hes just picking up them cotton bales you know and shoving them into that room and that tone arm just locks up harder and harder freezes more and more and drifts lower and so forth you see the exact mechanism in progress so its actually very very much to your benefit to get rid of the service facsimile at least out of this lifetime and the auditing environment because then we can possibly get rid of this service facsimile hangs up thatpast auditing restimulation youre not restimulating anything very much on current auditing restimulation if youre being very clever in handling the service facs so we maybe cut out half of that we cut session restimulation down to very small thing because we can be incautious with our speech without restimulating all this stuff thats already live do you see the benefits of all this all right well see that and see as well that its pretty adroit business finding service fac without kicking everything else in do you see what youre trying to do audit smoothly of course thats the solution to your session restimulation restimulate more in your current auditing dont start naming bunch of things see dont start pulling up bunch of things as far as past auditing give the pc frequent prepchecks you know on auditing prepchecks every fifth sixth session you can keep that cut back you see present time environment dont audit the guy one hour every three weeks and expect him to hold his own actually do you know that two and half hours week is really not quite enough to hold down environmental restimulation on most cases which is interesting so we can cut these various things down we can get the pc in less restimulative environmentthe way you would by the way handle the insane or the severely neurotic youd simply put him in an unrestimulative environment and be very very careful that the sessions you gave him were totally lacking in restimulation all the restimulation thats necessary to the auditing of this case has been done for long time you dont have toyou actually dont have to restimulate much else its all in restimulation you can do these various tricks to cut down the restimulation on your pc you actually should remember this graph here these zones of restimulation are things that can restimulate the pc because you could sit own wit the pc and you could simply say were going to audit this bird and hes having hard time well now what would be practical to cut out normally the auditors responsibility simply goes into trying to reduce the auditing restimulation because theyre trying to reduce it they very often goof i mean they overdo the job you know get nervous and wont interrupt the pc and theyre afraid to cut the pcs itsa line and let the pc wander into all kinds of things you know they dont provide good specific small targets in auditing to center the pcs attention on them and clean them up theyre always taking bit bigger target than the pc can grab hold of and that sort of thing in other words theres various things you can monitor and thats mostly what we study the various things you can do in auditing but look look thats one out of one two three foursee thats one out of five and you could actually sit down with this little chart and subdivide it you could subdivide that present time environment restimulation over there into about at least eight different categories you could just break them down into the dynamics you sometimes have to do this we had somebody one time that used to go home every night after the auditing session and go through bunch of voodoo exercises i think it was voodoo or some such practice and i think he was repeating over the words of half dozen gpms simultaneously or something like that actually the way we took the case apart was simply the auditing superviwell mary sue just told him hey youre doing soandso and soandso you quit that and he quit that and we made some case progress see thats just reducing that you could take his present time environment in other words and you could compartment it into various sections and zones of restimulation dont you see you know his job and his family and so forth while im auditing you we notice that he always has present time problem about the wife and he has present time problem about this and present time problem about that take weeks vacation and dont live at home see youve actually reduced that much current restimulation maybe you can get some progress with the case see thatsthats the crux of lot of these things but you could actually take that chart and find out what you are going to cut down now of course the responsible agency here thats going to give you the most trouble is the service facsimile because thats what he is holding in restimulation to make people wrong and hes liable to make you wrong its very interesting occasionally im trying to make some student right with auditing trying to give some auditor win and the auditor will go bzzzz in some fashion or another try to make wrong on an auditing instruction or something like this by just not applying it or crossing it up wrong dont you see therefore trying to create rightness is debarred by theby somebodys service fac getting in the road now you see that even comes true then on the supervision of auditors thats rare but occasional dont you see it just doesnt work somehow it doesnt happen very often its usually inadvertent and its always easily explained like they didnt quite receive the despatch or they didnt understand the despatch or they told the pc all about the direction before it was done or something wild happened with regard to this auditing direction you see or it all turned off too quickly so that we couldnt go on auditing it or something you see little goofy point its all explainable but you recognize if you look through it and you were to rehearse the service facsimile of that particular auditor and so forth if this was consistent occurrence if that occurrence was very consistent what wed have to do of course is find out the mechanism hes using to try to make somebody wrong now that would therewould therefore bring about kickback now he apparently consciously doesnt know what hes doing you understand and theres several ways of handling that you can simply bring it sharply to his attention that something is operating here that is preventing something from happening and usually why hell take look at it and laugh and straighten it out thats normally what would normally happen you can engage upon some duress or something like that as ive said ive been known to put head on pike just to make everybody follow my instructions for little while just did it as matter of fact and their heads are still on their shoulders it wasnt very vicious but it was to their attention that little more attention could be put on this particular point now what are you going to get out of something like this well youll get less restimulation for the pc one of the things thats going to happen theyll be little bit more careful you get less restimulation for the pc of course youre liable to get more restimulation on the part of the auditor so he doesnt follow the instructions any better and all of this randomity simply occurs because of service facsimile now one of the reasons why the auditor goofs and the four guys i just shot down in flames will be rehabilitated in short whilewere shot down actually had this as part of its element they were auditing toward the service fac therefore the pc was trying to make them wrong you understand so you can count on this occurring as you move toward the service fac if you do anything inadvertentno inthe tiniest little goofs that dont amount to hill of beans and youre just approaching service facsimile then the pc targets you as the one to be made wrong you get this and id say in allthese four students i was just snarling atthat that had occurred you see to some degree in other words the auditor was already enturbulated by this situation all right now an enturbulated auditor an enturbulated auditor has to be given new stable datum to some degree so just do itdo itdo it is the best stable datum that you can give him offhand let him get win let him see the breadth and understanding of this particular zone exactly how this thing is operating and let him sit back and take look at it because obviously that pc must be very restimulative to the auditor or he wouldnt be asso adventurous as not to follow one of my instructions get the idea so one of the ways you can do it one of the ways you can do it is shift auditors see you get new pattern of makewrongness from the pc dont you see and the auditors wits can settle down on the situation dont you see and then you apprise the auditor one way or the other something for him to look at with regard to all this see itll straighten out well now thats method of handling it but its all handled on the basis of restimulation now if you make practice of handling all of your auditing actions on basis of restimulation your adjudications and judgment with regard to your auditing sessions and your pcs and so forth on the basis of restimulation you will seldom be very wrong even poor solution based on lessening restimulation is better than some heroic solution like shoot the pc you know like they do in the medical profession see any solution that reduces restimulation even if badly put into effect very often delivers the goods any pc that is running badly thennow get this one because this is pretty sweeping and ill be lecturing again on the service facsimile of course we will take it up exactly how you do this but all this is very necessary prelude to this sort of thing any pc and anything wrong with that pc is there because of overrestimulation and any resolution of the auditing situation or the case has to take into account reduction of restimulation whether by discharge or destimulation one or the other you key it out to destimulate and you just blow it of course to discharge it now of course youve got room full of cotton bales youre not going to get anybody moving around in there ittheres so many cotton bales in the room dont you see the guy cant move around to throw the cotton bales out so thats it youre not going to get anyyoure never going to empty the room but you can still look in other directions to reduce the restimulation ive just given you map of them you could actually audit particularly amongst the neurotic and so forth simply on basis of giving advice against that little chart i just drew for you just destimulate the persons life somewhat and the person will recover from some of the most amazing things it isnt esoteric at all see something in his vicinity is naming things that go into restimulation thats all what is restimulation restimulative environment simply contains things in it which put his attention on things which are in the bank and restimulative i mean its as easy as that hes got ahes got naming environment and remember that with his service facsimile hes doing some naming too so the service facsimile is naming bunch of things to go into restimulation see so if you reduced the other sources of restimulation of which you have five there and if you reducedif you reduced the session restimulation your current auditing restimulation what youre auditing your past auditing restimulation you reduced your environmental restimulation on the pc reduced all those things you seein thethe various ways you have of reducing these things you see and then audited out the guys service faceven though this took quite while to accomplish on reducing thesewell reducing environmental restimulation lets have the guy go live in the hills for year before we audit him you get the idea you know simple as that have the guy get asome kind of very calm job of some kind or another itno matter how bad his case was dont you see weits all solved on the basis of reducing restimulation and now we take his service fac and we approach it headon and we audit out the service facsimiles which he is in for one lifetime and get ourselves nice free swinging needle and we give ourselves nice behaving tone arm and then we go at veryweve gotaccomplished all thatwe of course have now set up practically an unrestimulative environment auditing situation bank and so forth so we can naturally then reach into the bank at this point and pick up the string of almost anything in the bank because youve just got basic map of the bank i mean you gotsay all right lets get the goal to be dead you know first goal of the helatrobus implants and for the next month or so why just audit out the helatrobus implants you can audit them all out with good ta particularly if you give an occasional prepcheck that cuts down the past auditing restimulation and cuts down your accumulated session restimulation see the guys going to make it and thats any case see thats any case that makes any case an easy running case now case is as hard to run as it is restimulated its as hard to run as it comes to you restimulated and as hard as you have restimulated it improperly see thatthats as hardthats how hard is case to run the case is harder than that to run case is as difficult as it is restimulated and you get some guy walking in his hairs wild and he says the world is coming to an end tomorrow night you know and watch out ive got to get rid of these bugs you know aw dont payno reason to put any attention on the case what do you know something right away you know case is overrestimulated naturally hes gonna sit in that auditing chair and pick up the cans and answer sensible questions about his service facsimile in his life well i dont know you might be able to get him into session get him to tell you about worlds coming to an endif you kept him in this lifetime carefully controlled his itsa line you might surprise yourself you might get lot of tone arm action he might be quite auditable but the chances are he wouldnt be the chances are youre not even going to get him near an auditing session and if you did the auditing would produce tone arm action actually you know about it that hes got stuck tone arm in he walked whats his tone arm condition must be the same as for any overrestimulated case stuck so how can you approach or attack the case well of course youre validly auditing the case to the degree that you reduce restimulation on the case so theres probably lot of ways looking at this little chart up here that you reduce the restimulation on the case see lot of odds and ends he knowshe knows psychotherapy hes had electric shocks and that sort of thing see you can develop whole bag of tricks just out of that fact see you destimulate psychotherapy see you sit there you dont say anything you dont do anything see dont do anything when he leaves you say all right thank you thank you joe hell finally get pretty calm around you well that isntdoesnt look like auditing to you but actually its destimulation compare this with prepare number 62 for electric shock and prefrontal lobotomy in the morning hrrmph hrrmph weve got to cure him ah haha get the wet packs the cold packs the green packs the purple packs and the ice packs oh yes weve got to fix him rouse him up rouse him up yep yep yep looks to like these characters are adding more environmental restimulation than they can pick up so of course they have lousy record of cure in fact they all carefully explain to you how insanity is incurable it may or may not be incurable but is it thats the main thing is insanity and the answer of course is thethere is however an overrestimulated pc there is an overrestimulated being so if you look into all this very carefully youll see that you can cut back restimulation all over the place and you get all hepped up on the subject of all youve got to do is get your emeter and put the guy on it and find the service facsimile and run right and wrong on it and that sort of thing and so forth youre going to lose thatthats fine thats fine develop confidence in this particular direction but you realize there are going to be lot of people who cant sit in chair and cant pick up an emeter people that are unconscious well you can bring them conscious by running touch assist sort of thing on the sheets but he cant talk to you hes afraid of you he cant sit down in the chair he this he that see all these other things well actually its the same problems you have in auditing its problem in destimulation or discharge of existing restimulation its one or the other and normally youd select out destimulation by simply decreasing the restimulation of the various zones from which he can get restimulation youd select those out very carefully measure them up and give somebody some advice on the subject of it and his restimulation would reduce the next thing you know miracle worker in the field of the mind you know and people will say he doesnt do anything we dont understand we dont understand how doctor jones gets results because all he does is sit there and nod and the patients come in and nod when they leave and they seem to get well must be some tremendous personality that he has you see weve reduced treatment restimulation you see he didnt even pick up pad and issue any orders see now if you can digest all that that ive just been talking to you about and youve got all of that taped and youve got everything ive been talking to you about absolutely taped we can approach the subject of service facsimile which we will do in later lecture thank you very much
