congress the senate had to address fundamental organizational questions first the 2000 natorial elections pr oduced tied senate necessitating the negotiation of powersharing agreement to govern many aspects of committee and floor activities then the decision of senator james jeffords of vermont to change his party affiliation fro m republican to inde pendent gave senate democrats numerical control of the body th shift in party strength caused second round of negotiations about the organization and operation of the nate this report reviews these events and the agreements made by the senate on organizational and procedural issues1 107th congress opening day actions the november 2000 elections caused the nate to be tied with 50 republicans and 50 democrats only once before in 1881 had the two major parties been equally represented in the senate due to significant changes in senate procedures 1881 precedents had little relevance to the contemporary senate the issue of senate organization was further complicated by the election of richard b cheney as vice president when the 107th congress convened on january 3 2001 the incumbent vice president albert gore jr presided until vice presidentelect cheney was sworn in on january 20 although titular democratic majority existed because vice president gore was available to break tie votes that could have tried to organize the senate any such orga nizational proposals might well have been blocked and even if adopted could have b een reversed under republican auspices once vice president cheney was in the chair to break ties

record vol 147 june 29 2001 p 12588 making public the names of senators objecting to nominees under the informal blue slip process is in many re spects development similar to the wider notification process now required for the senate s informal hold process see crs report 98712 holds in the senate 3 of the resolution expressly provided that regardless of any future shifts in party strength in the senate during the 107th congress existing agreements about the allocation of committee staff and funds made by committee chairs and ranking minority members would remain in effect unless modified by them disclosing bluesli pped nominations the tradition of senatorial courtesy has long history under this practice the senate often declined to confirm presidential nominee for an office in the state of senator of the presidents party unless that senator approved the practice is purely customary one and not always followed by the senate the term blue slip derives from the blue buckslip that the senate judiciary committee uses to solicit senators comments on the suitability of nominees in their states customarily senators have been able to block such nominees without thei r objections being made publicly known this largely private cust om became more formal nd more public under terms of dear colleague letter announced by nators patrick leahy dvt and orrin hatch the chair and ranking minority member of the senate judiciary committee the blue slips that the judiciary committee has traditionally sent to home state senators to ask their views on nominees to be us attorneys us marshalls and federal judges will be treated as public information we both believe that such openness in the confirmation process will benefit the judiciary committee and the senate as whole furt her it is our intention that this policy of openness with regard to blue slips nd the blue slip process continue in the future regardless of who is chairman or which party is in the majority in the senate therefore we write to inform you that the chairman of the judiciary committee with the full support of the former chairman and ranking republican member is exercising his au thority to declare that the blue slip process shall longer be designated or treated as committee confidential18 due to the fact that the dear colleague letter related only to nominees considered by the judiciary committee the secrecy of senatorial courtesy requests on appropriate nominations that might be considered by other senate committees was not changed consideration of supreme court nominees discussions between the parties focused on possible ways to guaran tee senate floor votes on nominations to fill any future vacancies on the supreme c ourt senate democrats opposed any such formal guarantee and

judiciary committees traditional practic has been to report supreme court nominees to the senate once the committee has completed its consideration this has been true even in cases where supreme court nominees were opposed by majority of the judiciary committee we both recognize and have every intention of following the practices and precedents of the committee and the senate when considering supreme court nominees19 during his remarks on sres 120 senato r daschle referred to the discussions about senate action on future supreme court nominations in the course of our negotiations number of our republican colleagues also raised concerns about how democrats w ould deal with potential supreme court nominations should that need arise second letter to which senators leahy and hatch agreed says clearly that all nominees to the supreme court will receive full and fair consideration this is the same position i stated publicly many times during our negotiations and i intend to see that the senate lives up to this commitment it has been th traditional practice of the judiciary committee to report supreme court nominees to the senate floor once the committee has completed its consideration this has been true even for number of nominees that were defeated in the judiciary committee now senators leahy and hatch have put in writing their intention that consideration of supreme court nominees will follow the practices and precedents of the judiciary committee and the senate in reaching this agreement we have avoided an unwise and unwarranted change to the standing rules of the senate and sweeping revision to the senates constitutional responsibility to review supreme court nominees20 space allocations with the shift in political control of the senate

and administration committee over space allocation in senate office buildings but left to committee chairs the duty to implement any space allocation decisions regarding their panels in the allocation of office space to senate committees pursuant to rule xxv of the standing rules of the senate it is the practice of the committee on rules and administration to assign all such spac to the chairman of each committee further the rules committee does not tr aditionally intervene in the internal space allocation decisions of the committees and therefore is not party to any agreements between the chair
