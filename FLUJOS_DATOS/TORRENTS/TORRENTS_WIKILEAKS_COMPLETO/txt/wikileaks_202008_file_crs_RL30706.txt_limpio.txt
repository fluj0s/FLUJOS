procedural assessment summary the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 established payasyougo paygo requirement for direct spending and revenue legislation as part of an underlying law the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 under this procedure legislation proposing new direct spending or decreasing revenues for fiscal year must not result in net cost for that year the paygo requirement is intended to keep the onbudget surplus from being reduced or the on budget deficit from being increased this requirement which has been revised and extended over the years presently applies to legislation enacted through fy2002 and covers the effects of such legislation through fy2006 direct spending which is expected to amount to more than 1 trillion in fy2001excluding net interest is controlled by the legislative committees of the house and senate through substantive law and funds entitlement and other mandatory programs such as medicare federal military and civilian retirement and unemployment compensation direct spending is distinguished from discretionary spending which is controlled by the house and senate appropriations committees total direct spending includes more than 400 billion in spending for social security which is not subject to the paygo requirement revenues which are expected to amount to more than 2 trillion in fy2001 including more than 500 billion for social security are under the jurisdiction of the house ways and means and senate finance committees the budget resolution for fy2001 hconres 290 adopted on april 13 2000assumed significant revenue reductions over five years fy20022006 as well as some net increases in direct spending revenue reductions amounting to 116 billion for fy2001 and 150 billion over five year were expected to be achieved through the reconciliation process as the 2000 session unfolded the house and senate were stymied in their efforts to enact reconciliation legislation in particular president clinton vetoed the marriage tax relief reconciliation act of 2000 hr 4810 on august 5 and the house sustained his veto on september 13 at the end of the session congress and the president wrapped up business by enacting the consolidated appropriations act for fy2001 pl 106554 december 21 2000 which enacted regular appropriations as well as significant direct spending and revenue legislation by cross reference according to the omb directors final sequestration report for fy2001 issued on january 16 2001 the enactment of the consolidated appropriations act for fy2001 and other measures involving direct spending and revenues incurred net cost for fy2001 of 10542 billion paygo sequester was avoided however because section 2b of the consolidated appropriations act instructed

for direct spending and revenue legislation as part of an underlying law the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 19851 under this procedure legislation proposing new direct spending or decreasing revenues for fiscal year must not result in net cost for that year the paygo requirement is intended to keep the onbudget surplus from being reduced or the on budget deficit from being increased this requirement which has been revised and extended over the years presently applies to legislation enacted through fy2002 and covers the effects of such legislation through fy2006 direct spending which is expected to amount to more than 1 trillion in fy2001excluding net interest is controlled by the legislative committees of the house and senate through substantive law and funds entitlement and other mandatory programs such as medicare federal military and civilian retirement and unemployment compensation this amount includes more than 400 billion in spending for social security which is not subject to the paygo requirement revenues which are expected to amount to more than 2 trillion in fy2001 including more than 500 billion for social security are under the jurisdiction of the house ways and means and senate finance committees direct spending is distinguished from discretionary spending which is expected to amount to about 650 billion in fy2001 discretionary spending falls under the control of the house and senate appropriations committees and is provided in annual appropriations acts for the most part discretionary spending funds the routine operations of the federal government including the salaries and expenses accounts of most agencies the bea of 1990 subjects discretionary spending to different enforcement mechanism adjustable limits on budget authority and outlays rather than to the paygo process2 direct spending and discretionary spending together make up total federal spending 1 the bea of 1990 is title xiii of pl 101508 november 5 1990 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 see 104 stat 1388573 through 628 the 1985 act is title ii of pl 99177 december 12 1985 measure increasing the public debt limit see 99 stat 10371101 2 for more information on this topic see us library of congress congressional research service discretionary spending limits for fy2001 procedural assessment by robert keith crs report rl30696 washington august 31 2001 9 pages crs2 the paygo requirement as originally set forth in the bea of 1990 covered fy19911995 it was extended by the omnibus budget reconciliation act obra of 1993 through fy1998 and the budget enforcement act bea of 1997 through fy20023 as mentioned previously the paygo requirement applies to legislation enacted through fy2002 but it covers the effects of such legislation through fy2006 with regard to direct spending the paygo requirement applies to outlay levels rather than levels of budget authority budget authority represents the legal authority for agencies to incur obligations annual appropriations are perhaps the most well known form of budget authority outlays represent the liquidation of the obligation usually in the form of an electronic funds transfer or the issuance of check by the treasury department outlays rather than budget authority are compared to revenue levels to determine the amount of the surplus or deficit the paygo balances for each fiscal year are maintained on rolling paygo scorecard that accumulates the budgetary effects of laws enacted during the session and in prior years beginning with fy19914 the threshold test for paygo sequester deals with how legislation affects the net cost for fiscal year on the paygo scorecard not how it changes the surplus or deficit for that fiscal year in the federal budget generally as the budget moved from an overall deficit to an overall surplus in recent years and as an onbudget surplus emerged there was some confusion regarding whether the paygo requirement would continue to apply the concern arose from the fact that the stated purpose of the paygo requirement in section 252a of the 1985 balanced budget act refers only to legislation that increases the deficit in the report accompanying the fy2000 budget resolution for example the house budget committee stated the law is somewhat unclear whether paygo lapses when there is an onbudget surplus omb has hinted that paygo would indeed lapse if the budget was in balance without counting excess social security receipts5 in response to this concern jacob lew director of the office of management and budget omb issued statement indicating that such position was not correct stating we believe that paygo does apply when there is an onbudget 3 obra of 1993 is pl 10366 august 10 1993 see title xiv at 107 stat 683685 the bea of 1997 is title x of pl 10533 august 5 1997 see 111 stat 677712 4 on several occasions paygo balances have been reset to zero or otherwise modified pursuant to law primarily to prevent the sizeable savings from reconciliation legislation from being used as offsets to subsequent direct spending increases 5 see the report of the house budget committee to accompany hconres 68 hrept 106 73 march 23 1999 at page 87 crs3 surplus6 the controlling factor as stated previously is how legislation changes the balance on the paygo scorecard enforcement by sequestration the sequestration process established by the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 and used to enforce annual deficit targets was retained by the bea of 1990 and later laws as the means of enforcing the paygo requirement as well as the discretionary spending limits7 under current sequestration procedures the omb director issues sequestration report at the time the presidents budget is submitted to congress the preview report midway through the congressional session the update report and within 15 days after the end of the session the final report the congressional budget office cbo issues sequestration reports in advance of the omb reports but they are advisory only if the omb directors final sequestration report indicates that enacted direct spending and revenue levels have incurred net cost for the fiscal year on the paygo scorecard then the president must immediately issue sequestration order to remedy the violation through automatic acrosstheboard spending reductions if sequester under this process is required it must occur within 15 calendar days after congress adjourns at the end of session and on the same day as any sequestration tied to enforcement of the discretionary spending limits the sequester would eliminate any net positive balance on the paygo scorecard for that fiscal year and the prior fiscal year combined caused by the enactment of legislation during the session and in prior years any required reductions would be made in nonexempt direct spending programs emergency direct spending and revenue legislation so designated by the president and in statute is not covered by the paygo sequestration process as mentioned previously spending for the social security program except for administrative expenses is exempt from sequestration as are many other direct spending programs any reductions in medicare spending are limited to 4 enforcement in the congressional budget process the congressional budget process established by the congressional budget act of 1974 contains several mechanisms to enforce decisions regarding the recommended levels of direct spending and revenues first under section 311 of the act the aggregate levels in the budget resolution serve as ceiling on total spending and floor under total revenues second under section 302 of the act the total 6 letter of april 6 1999

spending in the budget resolution is allocated among the various legislative committees of jurisdiction third section 310 provides for reconciliation process under which the budget resolution may contain instructions to the legislative committees to develop changes to direct spending or revenue laws to bring them into conformity with budget resolution policies the resultant legislation is considered under expedited procedures in the house and senate usually in the form of an omnibus bill finally the socalled elastic clause in section 301b4 authorizes the budget resolution to set forth such other matters and require such other procedures relating to the budget as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this act pursuant to the elastic clause authority the house and senate sometimes include special procedural features in the budget resolution the senate for example established payasyougo point of order several years ago which remains in effect this provision most recently set forth in section 207 of the fy2000 budget resolution hconres 68 bars the consideration of any legislation that would increase or cause an onbudget deficit for any one of three applicable time periods 1 the first year covered by the budget resolution 2 the first five years covered by the budget resolution and 3 the five fiscal years following the first five years covered by the budget resolution although the senates paygo point of order is comparable in purpose to the statutory paygo requirement it differs in that it takes effect during the consideration of legislation rather than after the session ends and it applies to much longer time frame the policies in the budget resolution regarding direct spending and revenue levels may be at odds with the statutory paygo requirement during the past few years as the deficit changed to growing surplus the budget resolution has recommended substantial reductions in revenues coupled with increases in direct spending that would incur substantial nets costs on the paygo scorecard the firewall between the paygo process and procedures to enforce the discretionary spending limits does not permit savings from constraints on the growth of discretionary spending to offset or pay for revenue reductions accordingly congress has had to resort to procedural devices to prevent sequester from occurring while pursuing revenuereduction legislation fy2001 policy regarding the paygo requirement at the beginning of 2000 as congress and the president prepared to establish budgetary policy for fy2001 the paygo balance for that fiscal year and the ensuing fiscal years as well was zero legislation enacted at the end of the first session of the 106th congress the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 pl 106113 november 29 1999 had instructed the omb director to reset the paygo balances to zero on january 3 20008 the presidents budget president clinton submitted his budget for fy2001 on february 7 2000 recommending that congress pass legislation extending 8 see section 1001c of the act 113 stat 1537 crs5 the paygo requirement and discretionary spending limits through fy20109 his budget included recommendations for changes in direct spending programsparticularly for medicare medicaid and the states childrens health insurance program schipas well as various revenue proposals including reductions tied to alleviation of the marriage penalty and partiallyoffsetting increase in the tobacco tax according to an analysis of president clintons proposals made by the congressional budget office cbo the direct spending changes would have amounted to net increase of 1 billion in outlays for fy2001 and the revenue changes would have yielded net increase of 10 billion for that fiscal year thereby avoiding paygo sequester for the year10 the impact of these proposals would have been much more pronounced in the ensuing fiscal years however amounting to net increase in direct spending outlays of 218 over ten years fy20012010 and net reduction in revenues of 146 billion over the same period the congressional budget resolution on april 13 the house and senate reached final agreement on the budget resolution for fy2001 hconres 29011 the budget resolution assumed revenue reductions of 150 billion over five years beginning with 116 billion for fy2001 and rising to 443 billion for fy2005 additionally the budget resolution assumed total surplus for fy2001 of 170 billion and some net increases for fy2001 and later years in direct spending procedures were included in the budget resolution whereby the amounts of revenue reduction could be adjusted depending on later estimates of the surplus and other factors consequently congressional budget policy for fy2001 implied action on procedural device later in the session to prevent paygo sequester for that year reconciliation instructions to the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee were included in the budget resolution in sections 103 and 104 respectively the instructions were intended to enforce the policy calling for revenue reduction of 150 billion over five years in addition the ways and means committee but not the finance committee was instructed to reduce the publiclyheld debt by 75 billion or more for fy2001 the reconciliation instructions provided for four reconciliation billstwo revenue reconciliation bills one to be reported in july and one in september as well as two debt reconciliation bills to be reported on the same schedulein order to give the house and senate greater flexibility in fashioning legislation the second revenue reconciliation bill was intended to afford the house and senate an opportunity to split potentially contentious matters between the two bills or to have second chance at enacting reconciliation legislation should the president veto the 9 us executive office of the president office of management and budget budget of the united states

as fallback should the 116 billion in revenue reductions for fy2001 not be enacted it was meant to ensure that any amounts not used to reduce revenues would be applied to reduction of the debt held by the public rather than being used to increase spending additionally the budget resolution provided some flexibility for further reconciliation actions the republican leadership of the house and senate modified its budgetary goals in midseptember focusing on the policy for fy2001 rather than the full five years in the aftermath of the presidents veto of reconciliation legislation see discussion below and facing an electionshortened session and the prospect of demands by the president for substantial increases in discretionary spending the leadership enunciated policy of devoting 90 of the fy2001 surplus to debt reduction the remaining 10 of the funds would have been applied to spending increases and revenue reductions12 in its july update report cbo had revised its estimate of the total budget surplus for fy2001 substantially upward to 268 billion comprising an onbudget surplus of 102 billion and an offbudget ie social security surplus of 165 billion about 90 of the total budget surplusamounting to 240 billion and consisting of the social security surplus the medicare surplus and 42 billion of the onbudget surpluswould have been applied to debt reduction under the plan13 of the remaining 27 billion or so about half would have been available for discretionary spending and about half would have been available for revenue reductions implementation of the fy2001 policy congressional action on paygo legislation following adoption of the fy2001 budget resolution the house and senate considered various paygo measures that is measures affecting direct spending revenues or both most of the legislative effort was focused on reconciliation legislation developed in response to the budget resolution as well as the omnibus appropriations bill that was used to wrap up the session see discussion below in addition to these measures the following paygo legislation with fiveyear impact greater than 1 billion according to omb estimates was enacted into law during the 2000 session trade and development act of 2000 pl 106200 31 billion agricultural risk protection act of 2000 pl 106224 68 billion 12 see bureau of national affairs daily report for

instructions the marriage tax relief reconciliation act of 2000 hr 4810 was passed by the congress but vetoed by the president on august 5 2000 the house sustained his veto on september 1315 the house also passed pension reform bill hr 1102 which the senate finance committee transformed into reconciliation bill during markup although the finance committee reported the bill the senate did not consider it before the session ended finally the house passed three other reconciliation measures dealing with reduction of the publiclyheld debt hr 4601 hr 4866 and hr 5173 as well as another reconciliation bill that joined together revenue reduction and debt reduction hr 5203 none of these measures were considered by the senate as the 106th congress drew to conclusion the house and senate leadership sought to complete action on various revenue and debt reduction initiatives within the framework of the 9010 plan mentioned earlier in addition to pension reform and savings legislation congressional leaders discussed community renewal proposals business tax cuts coupled with an increase in the minimum wage tax credits to underwrite bonds for school construction and amtrak financing legislation dealing with the foreign sales corporation system and other issues in addition to encouraging contending parties to reach agreement on policy matters the leadership had to decide on legislative strategies for advancing possible agreements the three basic choices with regard to revenue and debt reduction provisions were to attach them to other must pass legislation particularly annual appropriations acts to consider them as freestanding revenue bills under regular procedures or to consider them as reconciliation legislation in the end the leadership decided to use the first two options and to not use reconciliation procedures any further16 14 dozens of other paygo measures with relatively small effects on the budget were enacted into law for complete listing of these measures see us executive office of the president office of management and budget omb final sequestration report to the president and congress for fiscal year 2001 washington january 16 2001 tables 6 and 7 on pages 1421 15 for further information on the reconciliation measures considered in 2000 for fy2001 see us library of congress congressional research service congressional action on revenue and debt reconciliation measures in 2000 by robert keith crs report rl30714 washington february 15 2001 11 pages 16 one factor affecting the decision not to use reconciliation may have been the senates byrd rule which is found in section 313 of the 1974 congressional budget act it bars the consideration of extraneous matter in reconciliation legislation the time needed to dispose of potentially dozens or more of points of order under the byrd rule could have been crs8 at first the congressional leadership attempted to use housepassed bill amending the small business investment act hr 2614 as vehicle for wide ranging issues including significant revenue reductions under the conference agreement on hr 2614 the bill would have enacted five other measures by cross reference including hr 5542 the taxpayer relief act of 2000 as introduced on october 25 2000 section 731a of hr 5542 included provision that would have prevented paygo sequester for fy200117 final congressional action on the measure faltered at the end of october as the session moved closer to completion the annual appropriations process became the chief venue for advancing the revenuereduction and debtreduction agenda18 some efforts had been made under this approach earlier in the session for example key revenue proposal the repeal of the telephone excise tax first imposed during the spanishamerican war century ago had been incorporated into the conference report on the legislative branch appropriations act for fy2001 hr 4516 which also included treasurypostal service appropriations19 the conference report cleared congress on october 12 but president clinton vetoed the bill on october 30 another prominent revenuereduction proposal tax credits to underwrite bonds for school construction had been considered as an addition to the laborhhseducation appropriations act for fy2001 hr 4577 ultimately the consideration of the regular appropriations bills for fy2001 was brought to close with the incorporation of three remaining bills into the consolidated appropriations act for fy2001 pl 106554 december 21 200020 in addition to incorporating appropriations for the laborhhseducation legislative branch and treasurypostal service appropriations acts the bill enacted by cross reference several other measures including the small business reauthorization that had been used as an omnibus vehicle earlier these other crossreferenced bills had significant revenue and direct spending impact according to omb estimates the bill reduced revenues in the net by 07 billion for fy2001 and 73 billion over five years and increased direct spending by even greater amounts21 most of the revenue loss was attributed to community renewal tax relief provisions 16 continued considerable 17 see hrept 1061004 october 26 2000 pages 185 and 394 18 the rules of the house and senate usually prohibit the inclusion of revenue provisions in annual appropriations acts

prevent the revenue losses and direct spending increases in the bill as well as revenue losses and direct spending increases in other bills enacted during the session from triggering paygo sequester section 2b of the consolidated appropriations act for fy2001 114 stat 27632764 instructed the omb director to change the balance for fy2001 on the paygo scorecard to zero in addition section 2a of the act required that the direct spending and revenues in the act for fy2002 and beyond be recorded on the paygo scorecard under conventional scoring rules changes in direct spending and revenues made in an annual appropriations act are scored under the discretionary spending limits instead of on the paygo scorecard annual appropriations acts also were used as vehicles for the implementation of further debt reduction for example title x of the interior appropriations act for fy2001 pl 106291 october 11 2000 provided 5 billion payment into the account that receives gifts to reduce the public debt22 similar approach was used in several of the other regular appropriations acts for fy2001 the congressional leadership also employed the second option the consideration of freestanding revenue measures under regular procedures as indicated earlier legislation dealing with the foreign sales corporation fsc system pl 106519 and installment tax correction pl 106573 was enacted as freestanding measures according to omb estimates they reduced revenues over five years by 19 billion and 23 billion respectively23 issuance of the final sequestration reports for fy2001 the 106th congress adjourned sine die on december 15 2000 on january 16 2001 omb director jacob j lew submitted to the president and congress the final sequestration report for fy200124 according to the omb report legislation enacted during 2000 yielded balance of 42 million for fy2000 and 105 billion for fy2001 on the paygo scorecard combining the two balances as required the sequester amount would have been 10542 billion however as required by section 2b of the consolidated appropriations act for fy2001 the omb director removed the combined balance of 10542 billion leaving balance of zero and avoiding paygo sequester section 2b of the act as mentioned previously did not authorize the adjustment of paygo balances for future years these balances according to the omb report accounted for nearly 75 billion over four years rising from 16053 billion for fy2002 to 20673 billion for fy2005 22 see page 110 of the conference report hrept 106914 september 29 2000 23 see omb cost estimate for payasyougo

fy2000 and 6791 billion for fy2001 yielding combined balance of 6833 billion the major differences between cbo and omb in paygo scoring were attributed to three actsthe transportation appropriations
