research service the library of congress public diplomacy review of past recommendations summary public diplomacy has been officially acknowledged as tool in the foreign policy arsenal since world war i later during world war ii it became part of the us government structure when in 1942 the president issued an executive order to create the office of war information owi owi aired the first voice of america program on february 24 1942 in europe these activities were carried out without any authority or formal recognition by congress more recently during the postcold war era of the 1990s public diplomacy was viewed as low priority and was often seen by lawmakers as source of funds to tap for other programs this culminated in 1999 when congress abolished the agency primarily concerned with public diplomacy the us information agency usia and merged its public diplomacy functions into the department of state following the elimination of the usia and after the september 11 2001 attacks us government officials foreign policy experts and academicians began to assess the direction of and the increased need for public diplomacy this report looks at 29 articles and studies on public diplomacy that have been identified by the department of state as being credible reports with valuable suggestions various recommendations from these studies are similar this report organizes the

the promotion of americas interests culture and policies by informing and influencing foreign populations from 1977 to the 1990s all functions of states bureau of educational and cultural affairs and the usias international information and broadcasting activities merged to become the international communication agency ica subsequently in 1982 section 303b of pl 97241 renamed ica to be the us information agency usia in 1994 the international broadcasting activities were consolidated by title iii pl 103236 and administered by new entity referred to as the broadcasting board of governors as of october 1 1999 usia was abolished and its functions were merged back into the department of state currently public diplomacy primarily consists of three categories of activities 1 international information programs 2 educational and cultural exchange programs and 3 international nonmilitary broadcasting the under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs administers the bureau for international information programs and the bureau for educational and cultural affairs while the broadcasting board of governors manages and oversees international broadcasting other public diplomacy efforts involve the white house the us agency for international development usaid and the department of defense dod after the abolishment of the united states information agency usia in 1999 and the terrorist attacks two years later the us government expedited implementation of public diplomacy to help win its war on terrorism some observers noted as evidence that the administration was new at conducting public diplomacy when immediately after 911 it referred to the us response as operation enduring crusade name that experts pointed out could be viewed by muslims as inflammatory1 over the past four years the bush administration has taken numerous actions to improve the effectiveness of its public diplomacy for example in november 2001 two months after the terrorist attacks the bush administration created the 1 bin laden referred to the crusades undertaken by the christians of europe in the 11th 12th and 13th centuries to recover the holy land from the muslims as one of the historical issues for which he was trying to retaliate crs2 coalition information center cic headquartered in the old executive office building the cic which was touted by the administration as public diplomacy coordinated us government agency press conferences and talking points dispersing them rapidly and aroundtheclock worldwide soon thereafter the president created by executive order the office of global communications ogc which replaced the cic with primary mission to coordinate strategic communications with global audiences2 also thennational security advisor condoleeza rice established strategic communication policy coordinating committee pcc in september 2002 the pcc mission was to coordinate interagency activities develop the white house message and disseminate it abroad more recently the president created the muslim world outreach policy coordinating committee in july 2004 which replaced the strategic communications policy coordinating committee the state department also established an office of policy planning and resources in the office of the under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs informally in 2002 and officially in 2003 the pentagon created the office of strategic influence osi to oversee military propaganda and other information related to the war on terrorism the secretary of defense dissolved osi after press coverage claimed the office was to place disinformation deliberately in foreign media in october 2003 the department of defense issued information operations roadmap which involves the direction that dod wants to take in public diplomacy and other information operations dod has appointed its under secretary of defense for policy as the defense point person for public diplomacy and will be continuing to define dods role in public diplomacy usaid became more involved in public diplomacy after the 911 commission reported to congress that some of the largest recipients of us foreign aid had very strong antiamerican sentiment among its population since 2004 usaid has acted to more prominently inform us aid recipients that the aid they have received was gift from american taxpayers also by establishing stateusaid policy council and public diplomacy working group it has established closer ties with the department of state and embassies around the world to publicize americas humanitarian and development aid initiatives the public diplomacy matrix since 1999 us public diplomacy has been rigorously examined to determine whether improved methods structure and goals could help the united states win the war on terrorism this report reviews 29 articles and studies on public diplomacy that have been identified by the department of state as being credible reports with valuable suggestions and compares the recommendations these 29 documents listed in reverse chronological order from 2005 to 1999 in appendix vary in scope depth and purpose some focus on public diplomacy 2 new white house office coordinates global communications white house press release january 21 2003 crs3 and include numerous specific recommendations others are more general in nature and deal with public diplomacy in the context of broader foreign policy issues some reports represent the consensus of group of authors others state the views of series of individuals for the purposes of this review each document has been given an abbreviation for example pdc for the public diplomacy council to make it easier to identify appendix b provides each reports specific recommendations following in table 1 is matrix indicating

numerous reports articles studies and oped pieces have been written touting the importance of public diplomacy as foreign policy tool and focusing on how the united states government can improve its public diplomacy operations to help win the war on terrorism among the many writings are the 29 considered here see appendix for reverse chronological list of the reports included in this crs review define overall strategy several reports suggest that the administration has not sufficiently defined or verbalized an overall strategy for the use of public diplomacy to both improve the us image around the world but also counter the threat of terrorism against americans the 911 commission report states that the united states should identify what it stands for and communicate that message clearly of the ten reports that recommend defining an overall strategy the government accountability office gao reports that the united states needs to do better job of defining its public diplomacy message and that while the broadcasting board of governors bbg does have strategy for its broadcasting activities the department of state dos does not have an integrated strategy for its public diplomacy operations gao states that the absence of an interagency strategy complicates the task of conveying consistent messages furthermore gao offers that the administration needs to define public diplomacy success and determine how it can be measured the advisory group on public diplomacy for the arab and muslim world report recommends that the white house establish strategic goals and oversee the implementation of programs that meet those goals the us advisory commission on public diplomacy study claims that the state department lacks authority to implement an overall strategy for the various agencies engaged in public diplomacy and recommends that the dos policy planning and resources office coordinate all public diplomacy efforts the heritage foundation recommends that the us government view public diplomacy as longterm effort saying that public diplomacy should be enshrined in doctrine that emphasizes consistent efforts the more recent council on foreign relations report recommends rethinking how the united states formulates strategizes and communicates its foreign policy and should move public diplomacy from the margins to the center of foreign policy making the national war college report notes lack of strategic planning and the earlier council on foreign relations study says there is an absence of an overall strategy and recommends the administration develop coherent strategic and coordinating framework for public diplomacy activities presidential directivereorganize public diplomacy at the white house ten of the studies discuss the white house taking more proactive role in promoting public diplomacy coordinating public diplomacy activities throughout the executive branch agencies and reorganizing or initiating public diplomacy task forces or coordinating committees at the white house for example reports by the crs8 defense science board task force and the council on foreign relations urge the president to issue directive to strengthen the importance of communication and public diplomacy and coordinate all activities through the white house the heritage foundation also recommends that interagency coordination of public diplomacy activities be carried out through the white house the advisory group on public diplomacy for the arab and muslim world report recommends the president appoint cabinetlevel special counselor to the president for public diplomacy this person would in consultation with the president and other agencies establish strategic goals and messages and oversee the implementation of programs that meet those stated goals the report suggests similar ideas are offered by the public diplomacy council which suggests that cabinet level interagency committee on public diplomacy should be established by presidential directive cochaired by the deputy national security advisor for communication and the director of new us agency for public diplomacy usapd create new agency several of the studies suggest that the existing public diplomacy structure at the department of state is not working the washington post oped piece by marks wick gelb and catto states that shutting down the usia was major mistake sentiment that has been expressed by others in recent years3 the oped piece goes on to say that public diplomacy is not very effective under dos and the recreation of an effective instrument of public diplomacy has been urged by many other reports propose establishing an entirely new agency to have primary responsibility for us public diplomacy activities and coordination with other government entities the council on foreign relations recommends establishing corporation for public diplomacy to be modeled after the corporation for public broadcasting the public diplomacy council suggests establishing an agency the us agency for public diplomacy usapd within the department of state and the national security process the defense science board reports that the president should establish permanent strategic communications structure within the national security council nsc that report goes on to state that the president should work with congress to establish and fund nonprofit nonpartisan center for strategic communication to support the nsc departments and organizations represented on newly recommended strategic communication committee reorganize public diplomacy at the department of state since the 1999 elimination of the usia numerous experts and observers have critiqued how the department of state has conducted public diplomacy according to the gao public diplomacy activities at state are fragmented among various organizational entities within the department with insufficient direction from the top many of the studies here agree that public diplomacy in the department of state could be working better but there are differing views as to how dos should improve it 3 for example congressman frank wolf chairman of the commerce justice state subcommittee of the house appropriations committee expressed this view at hearing on public diplomacy february 4 2004 crs9 the 2002 us advisory commission on public diplomacy report says there should be review of the 1999 consolidation of usia into state with the secretary of state making recommendations on new training location and reporting structure of public diplomacy personnel at the department the defense science boards 2004 report recommends redefining the role of the under secretary of state for public diplomacy to be policy advisor and manager furthermore it suggests raising the public diplomacy office directors to the level of deputy assistant secretary or senior advisor to the assistant secretary the report urges dos to strengthen the bureau of international information programs iip with an assistant secretary and modernize and diversify its products the heritage foundation suggests restoring the independent reporting and budget channels that public diplomacy lost during the usia merger and recreating public diplomacy hierarchy within the department of state as previously existed at usia another suggestion by author william kiehl proposes creating new public diplomacy organization within the state department including new bureau of public diplomacy operations also he writes regional bureaus must include senior public diplomacy officers at least at the deputy assistant secretary level the hartrudman commission recommends repealing laws that establish an under secretary for public diplomacy and having some of those functions migrate to an assistant secretary level official reporting directly to the secretary of state other functions could be folded into the assistant secretary for economic and transnational affairs according to the commission overhauling the foreign service system including ending the oral exams policy so that applicants could be better matched to particular cones like public diplomacy would be beneficial the commission asserts beyond reorganizing public diplomacy at state several of the reports refer to the need for new culture at state seeking to change the perception that public diplomacy personnel are second class citizens in the department recruiting and hiring practices that would encourage public diplomacy skills to be highly valued and much more open approach in which innovation trumps the caution according to the national war college report redefine the role of the under secretary of state for public diplomacy six of the studies refer to the need for redefining the role of the under secretary of state for public diplomacy most call for strengthening the role the chain of authority leading to the under secretary and the authority to make decisions regarding public diplomacy funding policy personnel and direction in contrast the hartrudman commission recommends repealing the laws establishing an under secretary for public diplomacy and having some of those functions migrate to an assistant secretarylevel officer reporting directly to the secretary of state other public diplomacy functions should become the responsibility of the assistant secretary for economic and transnational affairs the commission said crs10 increase embassy involvement several reports speak of need to increase embassy involvement in public diplomacy activities suggestions include expanding us diplomats personal contacts in the host country sending the message from the top tiers of the administration and the department of state that public diplomacy is central to us foreign policy and requiring at least one tour in public diplomacy assignment for foreign service officers to be promoted to senior foreign service officers or chief of mission another suggestion involves embassies maintaining networks of individuals such as former peace corps volunteers exchange students and retired foreign service officers who could be tapped to help portray america in the best light coordination several studies suggest lack of coordination of us government public diplomacy activities by the white house and within the department of state the us advisory commission on public diplomacy notes that there have been attempts to improve coordination citing the january 2003 creation of the office of global communications within the white house as well as the september 2002 formation of the strategic communication policy coordination committee and the december 2002 interagency strategic communications fusion team nevertheless coordination is still inadequate according to several of the reports recommendations on improving government coordination of public diplomacy entities and programs include 1 the advisory commission on public diplomacy suggests assigning the state departments office of policy planning and resources with the responsibility for overseeing the strategic planning of all public diplomacy programming and resources 2 the heritage foundation seeks better coordination through the white house specifically through the office of global communications 3 the public diplomacy council recommends that new us agency for public diplomacy be responsible for coordinating all us government public diplomacy efforts and establish an interagency committee on pd at the cabinet level to coordinate and direct the national pd strategy 4 the council on foreign relations recommends that coherent strategic and coordinating framework for public diplomacy be developed including presidential directive on public diplomacy and public diplomacy coordinating structure led by the presidents personal designee 5 the advisory group on public diplomacy for the arab and muslim world advises strengthening of the role of the under secretary for public diplomacy to coordinate governmentwide public diplomacy activities review country program plans with respect to public diplomacy allocate human and financial resources and play role crs11 in performance evaluations the group asserts that strengthening the under secretarys role is essential increase financial and human resources about half of the reports state that public diplomacy resources are inadequate and call for increased monetary and human resources the council on foreign relations said that funding should be increased to significantly higher levels to be more in line with public diplomacys role as vital component of us foreign policy and national security the council put forth the idea of establishing public diplomacy reserve corps patterned after femas disasterrelief model the public diplomacy council specifically recommends 300 increase in public diplomacy overseas staffing and fourfold budget increase over five years some such as the advisory group on public diplomacy for the arab and muslim world state that additional professional staff dedicated only to arab and muslim issues would be valuable increase public diplomacy andor language training coupled with the view since 911 that public diplomacy is an essential tool in us foreign policy and national security is the belief that all personnel involved with conducting us foreign policy should be trained about the importance of public diplomacy and given skills needed to fully utilize public diplomacy effectively the council on foreign relations states that there is deficit of trained professionals regarding public diplomacy gao suggests expanding public diplomacy and foreign language training of foreign service officers the council on foreign relations offers the idea of establishing an independent public diplomacy training institute and the advisory group on public diplomacy for the arab and muslim world recommends that all state department personnel receive public diplomacy training taking that step further the foreign policy association argues that public affairs diplomacy officers should be encouraged to develop language fluency and country and regional expertise and should not be rotated among regions like other fsos foreign service officers increase technology use most of the eight reports that speak about increased more effective and creative uses of technology referred to use of the internet for example the national war college report states that there are deficiencies in information technologies and the mindsets needed to integrate new technologies into the conduct of diplomacy state department needs to learn how to leverage the internets capabilities and potential in the conduct of diplomacy in addition some reports promote increased satellite broadcasting and more creative use of all available information technologies increase private sector involvement some studies make the observation that the private sector has many advantages in getting things done quickly being highly effective and efficient in influencing people by incorporating the best practices of the private sector in us government crs12 public diplomacy activities it is believed that public diplomacy can become more valuable foreign policy tool rand suggested that outsourcing public diplomacy would put some distance between favorable message and an unfavorable messenger and that identifying private sector talents could be motivated through competitive bidding process another idea comes from the public diplomacy council to create publicprivate partnership foundation for the global future to provide permanent offbudget funding for international exchanges conducted by civilian and military federal agencies the us advisory commission on public diplomacy agrees with the council on foreign relations about creating an independent corporation for public diplomacy additionally the commission would encourage overseas posts to explore local publicprivate partnerships find ways for visitor exchanges to take advantage of private sector generosity and develop internet and media programming that would utilize publicprivate partnerships the advisory commission also proposes that private sector communication consultants could become more involved in public diplomacy efforts with advertising as well as entertainment programs and that the academic community could offer public diplomacy majors at american colleges and universities gao adds that the us government could collaborate with the private sector to develop optimal methods for measuring effectiveness of public diplomacy efforts improve communication improved and increased communication between the united states and foreign particularly arab and muslim populations was cited by few of the studies the defense science boards 2004 report asserts that nothing shapes us policies and global perceptions of us foreign and national security objectives more powerfully than the presidents statements and actions and those of senior officials the board suggests that the president communicate directly with overseas audiences the 911 commission report recommends that the united states should identify what it stands for and communicate that message clearly the 911 commission observed that many foreign populations receive large amounts of aid from us citizens and never know from where it came the council on foreign relations proposes more customized twoway dialogue as contrasted to conventional oneway pushdown mass communication including an engagement approach that involves listening dialogue and debate that increases the amount and the effectiveness of public opinion research furthermore communication should foster increasingly meaningful relationships between us government foreign publics and foreign journalists the council says the us government should support voices of moderation especially among the young identify and develop indigenous talent and craft messages highlighting cultural overlaps between american values and those of the rest of the world the rand study encourages finding different ways of promoting twoway communication such as callin talk shows live interaction among different elements of an audience and broadcasting debates rather than offering monologues the advisory group on public diplomacy for the arab and muslim world proposes establishing an arab and muslim countries public communications unit under the crs13 direction of the under secretary for public diplomacy to work closely with the office of global communications and coordinate us government media outreach to arab and muslim populations and promote rapid response team to react and correct inaccuracies and distortions in foreign media increase exchanges and libraries more than half of the 29 reports recommend expanding us exchange programs andor us libraries overseas making it the most common proposal among this group of reports some ideas for exchanges include expanding the us speaker and specialist program expanding shorter duration exchange programs creating american studies programs in local universities in arab and muslim populations creating publicprivate partnership foundation for the global future to provide permanent offbudget funding for international exchanges conducted by civilian and military federal agencies significantly broadening middle eastus exchange programs and expanding exchanges to government officials and business professionals several studies echoed recommendations to expand american overseas libraries as well as the american corners program4 in addition the advisory group on public diplomacy for the arab and muslim world proposes implementing new american knowledge library to translate the best american books and make them available to local libraries and universities increase oversight few of the studies recommend greater and continuous oversight of public diplomacy activities one suggestion was for congress to provide legislative authority for quadrennial review of public diplomacy another would create new congressional committee structure with sustained oversight of all us government public diplomacy programs and activities 4 the american corners is program that was initiated in october 2000 whereby library in host country provides space staff and overhead expenses for the united states to offer publicallyaccessible research facilities and information on us culture crs14 table 2 key recommendations for international broadcasting special bring bbgb define overall

recommendations specifically for us government international broadcasting recommendations range from having strategic objectives to reorganizing the broadcasting entities to increasing resources and using more technologies to focusing on combating jamming see table 2 define overall objectives gao the public diplomacy council pdc and the pbs news hour broadcast suggest the need for the broadcasting board of governors bbg to better define its overall objectives and strategy of obtaining the objectives the 2002 pbs broadcast states that there is grand strategy or coordinated approach of us broadcasting with other public diplomacy activities gaos 2004 report states that while the bbg does have strategic plan and has made progress in some measuring of its progress the bbg has not defined plan to adequately measure audience size or its programming credibility overseas the pdcs january 2005 report urges the administration and congress to take hard look at how international broadcasting is managed to serve broad us public diplomacy goals and the american taxpayer and integrate broadcasting more closely with other public diplomacy tools the pdc believes that international broadcasting should be more closely integrated with other elements of strategic communication reorganize broadcasting although the us government international broadcasting structure was reorganized in 1994 some reports recommend reorganizing us international broadcasting again the us institute of peace states that the current array of us government broadcasting services is duplicative expensive and even counterproductive the heritage foundations may 2003 report asserts that international broadcasting has lapsed into jumble of duplicative efforts led by part time board of governors reorganizing broadcasting would make it more streamlined and more efficient the report claims furthermore according to heritage revitalizing the voice of americas resources and program content is in order as voa has been neglected while middle east programing has proliferated in confusing array the council on foreign relations july 30 2002 supports an independent and wellqualified broadcasting board with fulltime topcaliber chief executive officer who would report to the current bbg and be empowered to direct and supervise all us nonmilitary international broadcasting activities furthermore the department of state and the bbg should strengthen the secretary of states role in providing information and guidance on foreign policy to the bbg by clarifying and specifying the secretarys role in making decisions on broadcast languages and other foreign policy matters crs16 develop rapid response to antiamerican messages the advisory group for the arab and muslim world proposes that us government media should reach out to arab and muslim populations and promote rapid response team to react and correct inaccuracies and distortions in foreign media bring broadcasting board of governors under white house the advisory group for the arab and muslim world states that about half of the fund for public diplomacy goes for international broadcasting the group believes that us government international broadcasting should be brought under the strategic direction of their proposed new special counselor to the president saying broadcasting must be part of the public diplomacy process not marching to its own drummer with its own goals and strategy sources of funding and board special attention to arabmuslim populations five reports provide various proposals regarding additional broadcasting to arab and muslim populations as previously mentioned the heritage foundation argues that the various middle east surrogate broadcasting entities such as radio sawa and hurra tv have distracted the bbg from properly maintaining voa resources and programming the advisory group for the arab and muslim world recommends thorough independent review of the middle east television network saying that there is high level of skepticism in the middle east region about stateowned television of any sort the group suggests that paring up with private sector programming might be more effective the us advisory commission on public diplomacy recommends expanding communication with arab press by creating network of 24hour message dissemination and monitoring centers the public diplomacy forum february 2004 held panel discussion on middle east broadcasting one panelist referred to radio and hurra tv as being staterun and therefore less successful with middle east audiences the panelist said that the arab public is interested in american programming but they are not necessarily interested in programming that is under tight us government direction another panelist said that there is market waiting for hurras message the third panelist strongly disagreed and said that the united states should have started radio sawa and hurra long time ago other reports generally support ongoing middle east broadcasting or think more resources and expanded programming to muslim and arab populations should be forthcoming more resources as with public diplomacy most reports that addressed resources urged greater longterm monetary commitment for international broadcasting reaching larger audiences and improving the ability to measure impact are two primary needs for additional broadcast funding crs17 new technologies international broadcasting is one area of foreign policy that can make use of new technologies to become more effective the advisory commission on public diplomacy encourages the bbg to look for better software to improve broadcastings reach to foreign audiences over the internet the commission suggests the educational programs teaching the english language or american culture might be useful also the commission recommends that satellite television programs can be further developed to increase local language programming available via satellite tv the public diplomacy council recommends more innovative broadcasting internet programs for youth and interactive radio programming combat jamming the advisory commission on public diplomacy notes that there are some areas of the world such as north korea china and cuba where the united states has difficulty reaching audiences because of local government jamming the commission notes that technologies such as the internet and direct broadcast satellite have made it more difficult but not impossible for governments to block american programming from their citizens the commission urges the bbg to continue to develop new methods to combat jamming crs18 appendix reports wp leonard h marks charles z wick bruce gelb and henry catto america needs voice abroad washington post february 26
