during the george w bush adminis tration us and peoples republic of china prc foreign policy calculations have undergone several changes president bush assumed office in january 2001 viewing china as us strategic competitor the white house faced an early test in april 2001 when prc naval aviation jet collided with us navy reconnaissance pl ane over the south china sea but after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 us officials came to see beijing as potentially helpful ally in the fight against global terrorism while prc officials saw the antiterrorism campaign as chance to improve relations with washington and perhaps gain policy concessions on issues important to beijing such as on us arms sales to taiwan at the same time the prc was undergoi ng substantial leadership transition to new generation of younger offi cials this plus the us antiterrorism agenda helped lead to new sense of optimism and stability in the uschina relationship that continued to prevail throughout the 108th congress despite this new stability sensitivities remained over longstanding bilateral issues us officials remained supportive of taiwans security and its quest for international recognition and prc official s remained firm about reunifying taiwan under the one china policy the prc rema ined suspicious about what it sees as an encircling us presence in asia and wa ry of us technolog ical advantages and global influence while the bush admin istration periodically announced sanctions against prc companies for violations of nonproliferation co mmitments the prcs early bungling of the sars health crisis in 2003 posed new challenges for bilateral relations and was an early test for chinas new leadership the prcs first manned space flight on october 15 2003 raised ne w questions about the aspirations of chinas space program and its implications for us security against this backdrop of renewed bilateral stability and longstanding sensitivities the 108th congress passed legislation requiring the united states annually to present plan in the world health organization for taiwans observer status hr 2092 pl 108235 and c onsidered other nonbinding measures expressing strong us support for hconres 98 on free trade agreement hconres 117 expressing us commitment to the taiwan relations act and hconres 340 on support for referenda in ta iwan when massive

kong freedom sjres 33 hres 667 the attention of congress and other us officials also focused noticeably on economic and trade disagreements with the prc beginning in the second half of 2003 particularly on criticisms that the prc was undervaluing its currency by maintaining an artificial peg to the us dollar policy some charged was undermining the competitiveness of us products and

chinaus relations during the 108th congress most recent developments on december 29 2004 chinas official news agency xinhua announced that the standing committee of the national peoples congress npc had voted unanimously to consider an antisecessi on law aimed at ta iwan independence advocates to the full npc at its march 2005 legislative session state media also reported that former party secretary jiang zemin in march 2005 will ask the npc to accept his resignation as chair of the st ate central military commission largely symbolic position jiang stepped down from the powerwielding party central military commission in september 2004 on december 27 2004 the prc published its fifth white paper on national security chinas national defense in 2004 the paper said that the taiwan independence movement was the biggest thr eat to chinas sovereignty and regional peace and it vowed to prevent taiwan indepe ndence at all costs the paper also said that strengthening chinas naval warfare and air capabilities were military priorities on december 11 2004 in elections for ta iwans legislature voters returned the opposition the nationalist party kmt to majority despite strong push by president chen shuibians party the proindependence demo cratic progressive party dpp observers believe that the dpps failure to gain legislative control lessens the nearterm chance of confrontation with beijing on december 3 2004 in its biannual report on global foreign exchange the us treasury department did not find th at china met the technical definition of currency manipulation on october 25 2004 in television interv iew in beijing secretary of state colin powell said taiwan was not sove reign nation and the united states favored taiwans peaceful reunification with the prc critics

united states the term mostfavorednation mfn status has been replaced by the term normal trading relations ntr status background and overview introduction for much of the 1990s number of factors combined to ensure that us congressional interest in the peoples re public of china prc increased year by year in the years after the 1989 tianan men square crackdown members often felt that they were neither consulted nor liste ned to by the executive branch concerning the appropriate direction for us china policy without the overriding strategic imperative that the soviet union had on ce provided for comprehensive uschina relations individual members began to push for their own more parochial concerns in china policy such as efforts on behalf of taiwan in favor of human rights or against forced sterilization and abortion in the later years of the clinton administration when us officials were pursuing strategic partnership with china some members became increasingly concerned that the us government was not thinking seriously enough about the prc as longerterm threat to us interests given the prcs missile buildup opposite taiwan and be ijings growing nationalism and economic strength among other thin gs congress in these years enacted more provisions to accommodate taiwans interests engaged in repeated and protracted efforts to further condition or even wit hdraw the prcs mostfavorednation mfn status held hearings and considered gislation targeting the prcs human rights violations created two commissions to monitor prc activities and imposed host of requirements on the us government to monitor report on and restrict certain prc activities1 from 2001 on however uschina relations improved markedly and congress as whole became less vocal and less legisl atively active on issues involving china key questions for american policymakers and foreign policy observers during the 108th congress included what factors were contributing to improved uschina relations were these developments the be ginning of longterm trend toward period of stability and normalcy in the relationship what potential policy developments could once again highlight underlying complications in uschina relations and what were the policy implica tions of ongoing and new developments both domestically and in the broader foreig n policy environment that could affect us interests this paper addresses these questions disc usses key legislation in the 108th congress and provides chronology of developments and highlevel exchanges from january 2003 to december 2004 this report will not be updated after december 2004 for thorough discussion of uschina relations during the 107th congress 20012002 see crs report rl31729 chinaus relations in the 107th congress policy developments 2001 2002

faced an early test of its policies on april 1 2001 when chinese jet fighter collided with us navy ep3 reconnai ssance plane over the south china sea forcing the us plane to make an emergency landing at military base on chinas hainan island several crs reports provide details of this crisis see for instance crs report rl31729 chinaus relations in the 107th congress policy developments 20012002 by kerry dumbaugh factors contributing to improved uschina relations by the beginning of the 108th congress us relations with the peoples republic of china prc had been experi encing period of unusual stability the reasons for this cannot be attributed to an resolution of entren ched bilateral policy differences such as those long held ove r human rights or on taiwans status for these differences still exist and are likely to plague the relationship for the foreseeable future rather number of other factors and policy trends in recent years have combined to make usprc relations arguably the smoothest they have been since the aftermath of the tiananmen s quare crackdown in 1989 these trends and factors include the current bush administrations more assertive approach toward china and more supportive views on taiwan than those followed by previous us administrations dramatic changes in global and in national prior ities brought about by the antiterrorism and antiiraq campaigns new demands on and trends in the us congress that have taken precedence over ongoing concerns about the prc the prcs own wholesale transiti on since 2001 to new generation of leaders bringing their own approach to policy decisions the prcs growing economic clout and increasingly modulated political influence on the international stage changed us policy the george w bush administration came to office in january 2001 promising tougher approach toward the prc than that of any of its predecessors seeking to distance themselves from the policies of engagement with china favored by american pres idents since 1979 bush administration officials promised to broaden the focus of american policy in asia concentrate more on japan and other us allies deemphasize the importance of sinous relations in american foreign policy and look more favor ably on issues affecting taiwans status and security even while appearing less solicitous of beijings views administration officials have remained open to substantively and symbolically meaningful dialogue with china at the seniormost levels president bush for example met more often with his prc counterpart during his firs t two years in office than other us presidents did in their entire administra tions this twin approach continues to characterize much of administration policy toward both the prc and taiwan today2 some observers have suggested that this approach has helped reduce beijingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31815crs4 3 at its 16th party congress nov 814 2002 the p rcs communist party selected new party general secretary hu jintao name d new 24member politburo and new nine member standing committee and made substantive changes to the party constitution further changes in government positions were made during the 10th meeting of the national peoples congress in march 2003 for more on the leadership transition see crs report rl31661 chinas new leadership lineup implications for us policy by kerry dumbaugh leverage over the us policy process forcing onto the prc the greater burden in seeking productive uschina relations antiterrorism and changing global priorities according to some accounts the bush policy apparatus entere d office in 2000 with new foreign policy agenda in mind still the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks against the united states the subsequent and ongoing campaig n in iraq and rene wed nuclear ambitions by north korea have contribut ed to the changing international priorities of the united states and much of the world number of us internationa l relationships have been affected accordingly including re lations with the prc and with countries important to prc interests such as pakistan the united states has established cooperation with and military presence in central asian countries with whom the prc had formed the shanghai cooperation or ganization in the 1990s us officials welcomed prc support for antiterrorism in itiatives particularly in measures put before the united nations security c ouncil in which the prc is permanent member and has veto power but the bush white house also showed itself willing to take unilateral us ac tion and maintained that onl limited sinous cooperation would be possible thus it is not clear to what extent us antiterrorism goals may have affected the administrations prc policy other than to reinforce the lower profile it had already assigned to uschina relations despite the capture of saddam hussein and the decapitation of the iraqi government ongoing and increasing us government difficulties in iraq have continued to be the major foreign polic preoccupation for american policymakers prc cooperation or at least acquiescence in us iraq initiatives thus has become collateral us objective the bush administrations commitments in iraq have also contributed to number of fissures in the north atlantic treaty organization nato alliance whose eu member count ries the prc has assiduously courted in recent years finally north koreas nucl ear weapons activities have created crisis on the korean peninsula that administration officials believe enhances the need for prc cooperation on initiatives involving th north these new tensions in and possible reshuffling of international relati onships have created fluid and complex international atmosphe re although the implications fo r future uschina relations remain uncertain some observers have suggested that the uncertainty itself has favored more stable usc hina relations by ensuring degree of caution and non provocation in how bilateral policies are crafted constraints on prc policy some believe that number of developments in the prc are also factors contributing to smoother uschina relations since late 2002 the prc has undergone significant tran sition to new generation of leaders that many believe are bringing more ope n rulebased reformist and internationally engaged approach to prc policies3 the new leadership also remains preoccupiedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31815crs5 4 in the initial days after the september 11 rrorist attacks prc president jiang zemin offered condolences promised unconditional support in fighting terrorism and on september 25 sent group of prc c ounterterrorism experts for consultations in washington in security council meeting on september 12 the prc voted in favor of both resolution 1368 to combat terrori sm and resolution 1441 on iraqi compliance 5 some have suggested that regular annual reports from the two us china commissions and other entities could serve as catalysts for debate on the prcwith thorny domestic economic and political problems including growing fears about the bubble effects of an overheated economy in ternal social unrest greater social and economic demands by labor growing unemployment and more assertive public disaffection with official corruption to name few both the antiterrorism campaign and initiatives on iraq also appear to have affected the prcs view of uschina relations in the early months of the campaign prc leaders seemed to see antite rrorism initiatives as an opportunity for closer cooperation with the united st ates and way to improve uschina relations4 in addition the prc government has found the us antiterror campaign convenience in its own crackdown on dissident muslim populations in the xinjianguighur autonomous region crac kdowns which it has couched in terms of antiterrorist activities new priorities for the us congress for the reasons cited above and more the us congressional agenda in the bush administration has shifted in ways that have had an effect on congresss consideration of ch ina issues for one thing the september 11 attacks themselves drama tically preempted serious congressional debate that had been going on for decade over whether the prc represented the next serious threat to us security since the september 11 attacks the list of priority items on the congressional agenda have encompassed host of initiatives relating to us security issues and the antiterrorism campaign these have included reorganization of the us government to create department of homeland security us troop deployments in af ghanistan and iraq and the potential implications of nuclear north korea to name few related foreign policy issues have had problems competing with these issues so with the disappearance of the annual rancorous congressiona l debate over renewing the prcs normal trade relations ntr status congress now lacks legislative vehicle for regularly reexamining the totality of us policy toward china5 moreover the nature of the white hous approach toward the prc and taiwan has cooled what previously had been heated congressional po licy debate over the direction of us china policy the ad ministrations early willingness to take dramatic steps to ensure taiwans secur ity and support taiwans interests appeared to satisfy the sizeable segment in congre ss that has long championed stronger us relations with taiwan at the same time the white house has resumed regular us china summitry and cultivated cooperative di plomatic and inves tment climate with china satisfying the american business community and members who are responsive to that communitys concer ns finally the release of the final report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 9 11 commission report began to demand si gnificant congressional attention afterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31815crs6 its release on july 23 2004 the commi ssions report and its 41 recommendations became the focus of several dozen rare august recess hearings to draft implementing legislation factors that could increase bilateral tensions despite the smooth usprc relationship of recent years any number of circumstances and events could reenergize tensions in uschi na relations and once again alter the bilateral landscape at the top of everyones list of potential problems is the question of taiwans political status question that in light of tensions over taiwans presidential election in march 2004 and its legislative elections on december 11 20 04 has the real potential to lead to usprc conflict american concerns also are likely to dwell on economic issues especially while the us trade deficit with china soars and criticism continues to focus on the competitive advantages china gains by linking its currency to the us dollar and by failing adequately to pay and protect its labor force the dyna mics of uschina relations also could change if events led beijing to conclude that the united states had lost significant economic military andor political power in the world leading prc leaders to seek to exploit any perceive d us weaknesses for their own national advantage such events could include protracted conflict or uncertain outcome in iraq partial collapse or realignment in the nato alliance south korean demand that us troop strength be cut an act of north korean aggression or serious us economic decline among other options even absent any of the above problems strong argument can be made that along with its rapidly growing economy the prcs increasing need for energy resources greater international assertiveness and ongoing military modernization means that one day its interests and appetites will conflict with those of the united states therefore despite the current stability in uschina relations too many variables remain to be certain of whether this represents longerterm trend toward new relationship or is simply the function of series of tem porary distractions in uschina policy major developments c ontinue to occur regularly on issues that traditionally have affected the overall rela tionship monitoring and assessing these developments and how they are handled by washington and beijing could offer foreign policy watchers impor tant clues about the direc tion of uschina relations over the longer term key issues during the 108th congress taiwan taiwan remained the most sensitive and complex issue in sinous relations as in the recent past the political nvironment in taiwan remained fluid unpredictable and intricatel linked with issues involvi ng taiwans international status and relationship with the p rc in 2000 and 2001 unexpected and unprecedented victories in presidential nd legislative elections by taiwans opposition democratic progressi ve party dpp had nearly decimated the nationalist party the kmt for 50 years the dominant and for much of that time the onlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31815crs7 political party in taiwan as result the balance of power in taiwan continued to teeter precipitously between contending political parties and views on one side president chen shuibians dpp and its lly the smaller taiwan solidarity union tsu espoused policies that pushed the edge of the envelop on the independence question on the other tenuous politic coalition cobbled together from the remnants of the kmt the remaining kmt and the people first party pfp battled to regain dominance in large part by rejecting the dpps political path as too inflammatory and at least theoretically holding out the prospects for taiwans eventual reunification with the prc many observers saw 2004 as critical year for taiwans future and for us taiwanprc relations among other policy challenges on march 20 2004 taiwan held presidential elections and contr oversial unprecedented referendum on several issues relating to the prc although th referendum was defeated the incumbent president chen shuibian was reelected by reedthin margin of 02 leaders from the prc have strongly objected to the proindependence dpp and to chens reelection believing that the incumbents u ltimate aim is to declare taiwan independence in defiance of longstanding p rc claims that taiwan is part of china as taiwans election campaign waxed on prc leaders at one point stated they would pay any price including ta king military action to prevent taiwan independence official us views fu lly supportive of demo cratic processes in taiwan and elsewhere were tempered by american military commitments to help taiwan defend itself us officials re mained deeply concerned about provocative actions by either side that might result in us armed conflict with the prc taiwans march 20 2004 election also was accompanied by several unusual lastminute circumstances including an assassination attempt on the incumbent the previous day and resulting stateofemergency declaration that reportedly kept some voters from the polls these circumstances and the elections narrow margin of victory prompted the opposition nationalist party kmt to demand recount and file court challenge on th elections validity thus although the incumbent was sworn into office for second term on may 20 2004 questions continue to be raised about his political legitimacy finally on december 11 2004 taiwan held elections for its national legislature where th kmt opposition coalition succeeded in holding onto its slender majority despite strong push by the dpp to gain legislative control the prospect of this divided taiwan gove rnment continuing for four more years suggests ongoing policy gridlock with the kmtcontrolled legislature likely to continue to block or greatly amend th dpp administrations policy initiatives faced with this political environment in taiwan prc military and civil leaders throughout the 108th congress used increasingly heat ed rhetoric about the possibility of using military force against taiwan until late 2003 us officials had voiced evenhanded concerns about the need to maintain stability in the taiwan straits saying that neither side should take provocative actions but on december 9 2003 after meeting with visiting prc premier wen jiabao president bush used unprecedentedly blunt language which sing led out taiwan for special criticism appearing with premier wen president bu sh said that the united states opposed any unilateral decision by either china or taiwan to change the status quothe comments and actions made by the leader of taiwan indicate he may be willing to make decisions unilaterally that change the status quo which we oppose shortlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31815crs8 6 wu tiffany taiwan says vote still on despite bush warning reuters online dec 10 2003

1998 president clinton made controversial statement know n as the three noes statement that some interpreted as change in us policy resulting in resolutions in the 105th congress hconres 301 and sconr

referendum issue section of this report on october 25 2004 during visit to beijin g secretary of state colin powell was quoted in another tough statement sa ying that taiwan was not sovereign nation and that the united states favored taiwans peaceful reunification with the prc some interpreted the statement as an attempt to issue further warning to taiwan to avoid provocative actions while critics charged that the statement violated longstanding us policy of avoiding any references in favor of reunification us state department officials later said that there had been change in us policy on the taiwan question beijing has long maintained that it has the option to use force should taiwan declare independence from china on december 27 2004 the prc emphasized this point again in its fifth white paper on national security entitled chinas national defense in 2004 the paper called the taiwan independence movement the biggest threat to chinas sovereignty and to regional peace and it vowed to prevent taiwan independence at all costs in addition p rc officials repeatedly sought to block taiwans efforts to gain greater intern ational recognition at the same time that officials in taiwan were maneuvering for more international st ature and independent access to multilateral institutions since the 1970s when the united states broke relations with taiwan in order to normalize relations with beijing us policy toward taiwan has been shaped by the three uschina communiques the taiwan relations act pl 96 8 and the socalled six assurances7 us taiwan policy and us arms sales apart from secretary powells october 25 2004 statement and the presid ents blunt warning to taiwan on december 9 2003 the bush white house to notable degree eschewed the traditional us policy of strategic ambi guity on taiwan in favor of policy clarity that placed more emphasis on taiwans in terests and less on p rc concerns the foundation for this emphasis was laid on april 25 2001 when in an abc television interview president bush responded to question about the possible us response if taiwan were attacked by saying that the united states would dowhatever it took to help taiwan defend itself since the united states has defense alliance with taiwan and has never pledged use of american military forces in the islands defense the presidents answer caused considerable controversy over whether the united states had changed its policy toward taiwans security or was moving awayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31815crs9 8 on february 16 2 003 for instance deputy assistant s ecretary of state for east asian affairs randall schriver told taiwanus defense industry conference in texas that our policy toward taiwan has been consistent for more than 20 years it has not changed it will not

suspend issuing visas to residents of china hong kong singapore and canada for two weeks and would quarantine returning taiwan residents for 10 days from its onechina statements althou gh state department and white house officials continue to maintain that there has been change in us policy toward taiwan and that us policy is consistent with us commitments in the taiwan relations act subsequent st atements and actions by bu sh administration officials have been judged to be more solicitous and supportive of taiwan than those of previous us administrations8 in part this reflects ongoing administration assessments that the potential for military conflict over taiwan is high in report submitted to congress late in 2001 for instance the pentagon identified military conflict with china over taiwan as one of the immediate contingencies for which the united states should size its nuclear strike capabilities9 in other aspects of its more supportive taiwan policy the bu sh administration has undertaken the following steps approved more robust arms sales to taiwan including kiddclass destroyers diesel submarines and p3c orion aircraft10 enhanced militarytomilitary

to the negotiating table and holding out the possibility for postponing certain political disputes in order to resume talks20 but such accommodations are worrisome to the dpps pro independence political base in taiwan who believe that further economic ties to the mainland will erode taiwans autonomy and lead to hollowing out of taiwans industrial base21 thus each decision that president chen makes on taiwans economic links with the prc represents an uneasy compromise between the concerns of his own political base and the requirements of improving taiwans international economic

the right direction that is the prc is becoming more economically interdependent with the international community and therefore will have greater stake in pursuing stab international ec onomic relationships they contrast this behavior favorably with that of disruptive states such as iraq or north korea those who are not part of the international system and who may support the kind of global terrorism that struck the united states on september 11 2001 some also believe that growing wea lth in the prc will push chinese society in directions that will develop materially betteroff more educated and cosmopolitan populace that will over time pre ss its government for greater political pluralism and democracy therefore accord ing to this view us policy should seek to work more closely with the prc in order to encourage these positive longterm trends some proponents of the engagement approach f ear that viewing the prc as threat is selffulfilling prophecy that could promote number of potentially disastrous policy consequences for us interests these include possible breakdown in prc governance fragmentation of the country itself or the creation of greater chinese nationalism with strong antiamerican bias caution american proponents of what might be called cautious policy toward the prc stress that beijing officials still view the world as statecenteredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31815crs23 competitive environment where power is re spected and interdependence counts for little this group sees prc leaders as deter mined to use all means at their disposal to increase their nations wealth and power they suggest that prc leaders may be biding their time and conforming to many international norms as strategy until china builds its economic strength and can take more unilateral action once it succeeds with economic modernization this argument holds beijing may be less likely to curb its narrow nationalistic or other ambitions because of international constraints or sensitivities according to this approach the united states should strengthen its regional allia nces and maintain robust military presence in asia as counterweight to the prc threat third and more frontational american pproach has been based on the premise that the prc under its current form of government is inherently threat to us interests and that the chinese political system needs to change dramatically before the unite d states has any real hope of reaching constructive relationship with the prc according to this approach beijings communist leaders are inherently incapable of longterm positive ties with the united states rather beijing seeks to erode us power and arm us enemies in the region despite the statements of support for the us antite rrorism campaign according to this view the prcs repeated violations of its nonproliferation comm itments have actually contributed to strengthening and arming nati ons that harbor global terrorists
