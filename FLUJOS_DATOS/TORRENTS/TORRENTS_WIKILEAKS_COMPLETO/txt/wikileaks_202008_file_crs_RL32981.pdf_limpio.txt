number of dependents children plus the elderly most exceeds persons in the workingage populationis already in the past having reached its height in 1965 when there were 947 dependents per 100 persons of working age while the dependency ratio has generally been decreasing since that time two trends are evident first the ratio of dependents to workers will again reverse course beginning around year 2013 with the retirement of large number of baby boomers second the composition of the dependency ratio is changing the number of children per worker has been falling since 1965 most of the anticipated increase in the dependency ratio in the coming decades reflects growing proportion of older persons ages 65 and older agespecific trends in the age dependency ratios are not offsetting in terms of their federal budget implications programs administered by the federal government especially social security and medicare focus much more heavily on assisting the elderly population whereas state and local governments have historically provided substantial support for families with children through spending on elementary and secondary education and other programs next the united states

united states is the 8 th member in addition china and india the two most populous countries globally are included to highlight that population aging is occurring even in nations that are less industrialized and have younger current age structures population aging which largely results from declining fertility rates and increasing survival is global phenomenon today the united states is the youngest of the industrialized g8 nations while the proportion of the us population that is aged 65 and older will continue to increase aging in the united states is still projected to be considerably

financing problems are very large and serious people are living longer the first babyboomers are nearing retirement and the birth rate is low the result is that the workertobeneficiary ratio has fallen from 165to1 in 1950 to 33to1 today within 40 years it will be 2to1 at this ratio there will not be enough workers to pay scheduled benefits at current tax rates 1 as highlighted by the social security administ ration ssa the aging of the united states population hastened by the impending retirement of the huge babyboom generation2 has caused policymakers to question whether the us social

considered later in this report figure 2 as seen in figure 1 there were 725 dependents per 100 persons of working age in 1950 of these 587 dependents were children while 138 were older persons the total dependency ratio reached its height in 1965 just after the last of the baby boom generation was born in 1965 there were 947 of which 765 were children and 182 were older persons dependents per 100 persons of working age there have been divergent trends for the child and oldage dependency ratios in recent decades with the child ratio generally falling and that of older persons increasing children continue to outnumber older persons in their contribution to the total dependency ratio in 2006 by sizable margin there are 459 child and 203 older dependents per 100 persons of working age

generally been increasing since 1950 the babyboom generation persons born between 1946 and 1964 will accelerate the rate at which the oldage dependency ratio changes baby boomers will begin to attain age 65 beginning in 2011 for those born in 1946 and continuing through 2029 for those born in 1964 as highlighted in figure 1 the older age dependency ratio will quickly increase as result of the aging of the babyboom generation from about 212 to 343 older dependents per 100 persons of working age between 2011 and 2029 population aging 9 however will continue to be one of the most important defining demographic characteristics of the us population even after the youngest of the baby boom generation passes away10 the number of older dependents per 100 persons of working age will continue to increase albeit at slower pace than will be experienced during the years in which the baby boomers retire based on the ssa trustees current assumptions there will for instance be 421 older dependents per 100 workers in 2080 9 as measured by increases in the median age of the population and increases in the proportion of the population aged 65 and older 10 see crs report rl32701 the

the older ages and continuing low fertility rates11 increasing rates of survival mean greater number of older dependents the numerator of the ratio which in turn increases the oldage dependency ratio fewer than current births will mean fewer young dependents in the shortrun but will translate into fewer future workers in about two decades at that time the net effect will be that the oldage dependency ratio will be increasing as the number of dependents will be increasing in the numerator while the number of working age persons to support them will be falling in the denominator from the perspective of the social security program the oldage dependency ratio is the most critical of the dependency measures as it relates the number of potential social security beneficiaries outlays to the number of projected payroll tax payers income thus the lower the oldage dependency ratio the lower the dollars paid out versus received and the better the finances of the social security program outlook g5g145g146g149g141g561g6g142g153g142g151g141g142g151g157g156g561 referring again to figure 1 and table a1 the child dependency ratio increased from 587 to 765 child dependents per 100 working age adults between 1950 and 1965 largely reflecting the birth of the babyboom generation since 1965 the child dependency ratio has experienced mostly steady decline due to falling fertility rate s in the united states nonetheless in 2006 the number of child dependents is more than double the number of older dependents459 and 203 per 100 working age adults respectively the ssa trustees current projections assume that child dependency ratios will slowly decline through year 2080 but that the rate of decline will be very slow child dependency ratios will stay in the narrow range of 439 to 459 child dependents per 100 working age adults throughout this 75year time span note that even with the pending retirement of the babyboom generation the number of child dependents has and will continue to be greater than the number of older dependents in each of the years of the time frame considered here 11 note that improved population survival and decreased fertility are the root causes of the aging boom though immigration also contributes to trends in dependency ratios over time immigration is currently and is projected to remain overshadowed by the trends in mortality and fe rtility in the dependency ratios see crs report rl32701 the changing demographic profile of the united states by laura b shrestha ho w useful ar dependency ratios the standard definition of pp ort ratio is

correct then the greatest demographic burdenwhen the number of dependents children plus the elderly relative to the workingage populationis already in the past having reached its height in 1965 when there were 947 dependents per 100 persons of working age the total number of dependents per 100 persons of working age has generally been decreasing since 1965 but is expected to reverse course beginning around year 2013 the change coincides with the retirement of some early cohorts of the babyboom generation the composition of the dependency ratio is changing the number of children per worker has been falling since 1965 most of the anticipated increase in the dependency ratio in the coming decades reflects growing proportion of older persons ages 65 and older these agespecific trends in the age dependency ratios are not however offsetting in terms of their federal budget implications programs carried out by the federal government focus much more heavily on assisting the elderly population based on estimates from the congressional budget office cbo the federal government spent little over onethird of its budgetabout 615 billionon transfer payments and services with the social security and medicare entitlement programs being the biggest expenditures for people age 65 and older in fy2000 federal spending on children was about 148 billion or 175 billion if payments to the childrens parents were included 12 state and local governments have historically provided substantial support for families with children through spending on elementary and secondary education and other programs nevertheless because federal spending dwarfs state and local figures total government spending for the average person 65 years or older is still much greater than for the average child 13 age dependency ratios while providing glimpse at how the age structure of the population is changing are nonetheless crude measures that do not take into consideration whether persons of working age are actually working and supporting the economy nor whether dependents are truly economically dependent and receiving transfers from workingage persons furthermore as noted by friedland and summer 14 societys future is not determined solely by demographic changes focusing on the anticipated growth in population by age 12 congressional budget office cbo federal spending on the elderly and children july 2000 at httpwwwcbogov accessed june 17 2005 hereafter cited as cbo federal spending on the elderly and children see also 1 crs report rs22008 federal spending for older americans by april grady and william klunk hereafter cited as crs report rs22008 and 2 c eugene steuerle the incredible shrinking budget for working families and children national budget issues 1 dec 2003 13 cbo federal spending on the elderly and children note however that the increase in the ratio of older persons to people under 65 also has important implications for state budgets because of the growth in medicaid spending as share of total state government expenditures medicaid is the largest public source of spending on longterm care ltc and this will strain state budgets because substant ial

united states from the other g8 nations they have small effect on the median age of us residents and on the total dependency ratio as immigrants are mostly young people who have children and also higher fertility rates than the usborn population immigration nudges the workerelderly ratio little higher meaning that there are more people of working age per person age 65 or older the more dramatic effect however is at the younger ages immigration after 2000 is projected to add about 15 million more children under age 18 than there would be without any post2000 immigration continued

population can be covered relatively easily the benefits can serve as social insurance against the income risks associated with oldage and disability benefits can be immediately vested and are fully portable an important feature for mobile work force administrative costs are usually very low given these advantages paygo systems looked very attractive in the immediate postworld war ii years projections of labor force growth coupled with forecasts of real wage growth implied potential total annual return near 5 for fully mature paygo system in contrast the common view of funded system involved investing contri butions in government securities with return of 1 or less in the aftermath of the great depression the market for equities seemed far too risky and many countries lacked private bond markets furthermore most countries instituting new pension system were unwilling to delay initial benefit payments for several decades as would have been required under funded system there was desire to address the immediate problem of high poverty among the elderly and most countries provided benefits to an older generation of workers which had not contributed fully to the system 29 also to many at that time high rate of population growth and subsequent work force growth seemed inevitable in which case payasyougo seemed good way to finance an old age pension program30

favorable oldage dependency ratios as shown in figures 1 and 2 while the oldage dependency ratio had already been increasing since 1950 the upcoming retirement of the babyboom generation will accelerate the rate at which it grows however even after the youngest of the babyboom generation has passed away the number of older dependents per 100 persons of working age will still continue to

social security spending is due in part to the demographics of an aging society cbo estimates that approximately 55 of the higher spending is due to the expected increase in the number of beneficiaries as the number of new claimants grows and as life expectancy rises the remaining 45 of the rise is due to projected increase in the real value of social security benefit checks specifically they note that under rules put into effect in 1979 benefits of newly eligible recipients are based on formula and earnings records that are adjusted for wage growth those adjustments referred to as wage indexing are designed to keep the ratio of initial benefits to preretirement earningsthat is replacement ratesapproximately the same from one generation of new recipients to the next wages tend to rise along with productivity in the economy at faster pace than prices and over the long run system pegged to wage growth will gradually afford greater purchasing power 32 as both cbo and the government accountability office gao are warning current spending policies are likely to be unsustainable33 the policy implication is that unless there are large offsetting productivity gains in the us economy contribution rates by current workers eg tax rates must markedly rise or benefit levels must fall under social securitys paygo system alternatively the structure of the underlying paygo system could be modified such that part or all of the scheme is fully funded this however raises the same issues that caused most countries to originally select paygo systems reduction of investment risk and the need to pay benefits for the current generation of beneficiaries 31 congressional budget office the future growth of social security its not just societys aging an
