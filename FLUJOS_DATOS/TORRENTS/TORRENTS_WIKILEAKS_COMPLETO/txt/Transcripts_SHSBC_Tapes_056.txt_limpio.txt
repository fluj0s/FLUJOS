shsbc 56 clearing breakthrough lecture given on 12 september 1961 thank you well whats the date audience september 12th this is the 12th audience yes twelve sept 61 ad 11 more properly called well its very nice to be able to come down have quiet cigarette and talk to you about nonessentials and to discuss few things with you i have actually complete new plan of clearing which makes this rather interesting day practically everything that has been done or known in the last eleven years perfectly valid but an integration of alll this material is periodically necessary because new discoveries are made and these lead to new simplifications they dont lead to new complexities as you look over the history of dianetics and scientology youll see cycle is in operation we get more and more complicated more and more complicated more and more complicated and then suddenly we get to new higher level of simplicity and then this simplicity gets complicated and more complicated and more complicated and then we get to new higher level of simplicity thats just history of outguessing you probably the only games condition which exists in scientology is along those exact direct lines auditors can find more things to do wrong that arent explained and you lay down new rules for these things you see and these new rules all become much more complicated and then they find new things which they consider vagaries or differences and then these become much more complicated and then all of sudden why common denominator of all these things is arrived at and you have new plateau of simplicity so weve been climbing mountain which consists of number of tables stacked up each table higher than the next and we have arrived at such table i can give you new plan of clearing which will probably be the title of this lecture its very elementary extremely elementary its routine 3 just as you have learned it or as you havent and it is only possible because there is shadow of doubt now of any kind as to why people could not find goals readily and smoothly in preclears the rudiments are out thats all i mean that just the rudiments are so wildly out that the goals submerge in their readings that means its very rough auditing has been the history it means this auditing must be awful damned rough now new simplicity has been found in that particular line why is auditing rough auditing is not rough because your tr 0 is out auditing is rough because you havent clue what bank looks like where your auditing is bad i can make that just as didactic horrible statement the remedy for it is to give an auditor reality on the bank as soon as an auditor has reality on the bank ten thousand seven hundred and sixtyfive million rules all disappear and he said oh he says thats the way it is he doesnt have time to think of rules when hes handling somebodys bank he just doesnt have time thats all hes got to know and hes got to be able to understand what is going on and if he understands what is going on he does the right thing and if he doesnt understand what is going on all the rules in the world will not make him understand what is going on well thats rather tough beef that you are suddenly assigned in scientology and throughout the world because it means that the initial and basic auditing will have to be done by possibly the bulk of auditors with reality on bank so that means thats going to be rough spot overcoming that in any given area of the world youve got bunch of people theyre perfectly willing and they fumble around and finally one of them manages by some mystery and at vast torture of the pc to get the pc actually through an incident with good reality on the bank after that that pc will be able to audit now that pc can turn around of course and audit somebody else and give them reality on the bank but what have you got now thats an easy progress what is the first hump the first hump would then be with reality on the bank giving somebody reality on the bank great all right but that one has to be overcome now theres probably thousand ways that can be overcome but it is the main point and that is the hump that is the one where the wheels slide thats the one where its all grease clay as the jeep tries to go up do you understand once that one is overcome the rest of it becomes very easy i think we will get lot of reality on that in very short order all right so much for that routine 3 in essence remains unchanged but that of course routine 3 simply consists of finding the goal finding the terminal and giving the person security checks now to that old routine 3 we add this one that we run some incidents when when the pc has been run long enough on the prehav scale that hes found himself in valence in several incidents and skipped handily and neatly out of them and the way we handle that is very easy ill give you that again in very very brief review and this time i will give it to you exactly as it would be done in an hgc exactly as it would be done pc comes in we give him the pc assessment sheet we tie into them at once on goals assessment we have him bring in list of goals all right we start goals check at the same time during different period of the day we do security check only we do an ordinary routine security check on an oldtime scientologist we do hco ww form 6 oldtime auditor security check on staff member we do some of these staff member checks youre going to see them more of them theres more security checks coming out theres even an executive check but we do that kind of security check what are we trying to do why are we doing this kind of thing were just trying to get the fellows withholds off so he wont blow ill tell you the liability of doing bad security check or not doing security check recently girl in johannesburg sat down in the hgc and the auditor read his ashtray and missed withhold all youve got to do is miss one withhold as you go by and youve had it doing security check its just good from there on the pc knows now that you cant find out and youve had it you must get every withhold off of every question that is available at the time of the security check normally case improves and more withholds start to appear thats the way you tell whether or not case is improving is whether or not you do the same security check again and find out hes now got more withholds that doesnt mean that it wasnt clean the first time you did it it merely means the case has improved in terms of responsibility and now has more withholds all right this auditor sat down there and he asked something on the second dynamic and the girl said oh nothing like that so he read his ashtray and he went on to the next question and she went around telling everybody there was such thing as clears and it was terrible and she wrote lots of letters to people and she got very excited she got very upset and there were all these rumors were floating around for day or two or three and finally our detective corps got into action ran it down found her made her sit down in chair went back over the same security check pulled the second dynamic withhold and that was that interesting flurry isnt it well your pc will blow all kinds of weird things will happen the pc will arc break youll get all kinds of upsets and so forth because youre not doing security check so its necessary to do security check thats the point im trying to make here and its necessary to do the security check well and its necessary to get all the withholds available at the time the security check is being done without going on to the next question now this means with the routine im giving you now that were just returning to the oldtime security check its just straight security check have you ever raped anybody and thats it you get the idea asking it any way you can to get the thing reading and clearing up and getting off any of the material dont bother with notknow dont bother with anything on that security check its just straight security check you got that because i find out auditors can do that very very easily and because the notknow version has now moved over into tremendous difference importance and i will tell you about that in moment all right we go right on and every session that we run this person in the hgc we just beat the rudiments to death as of today youve got whole new set of rudiments they have come out in bulletin and theres reason for to go over them right now ive given you more satisfactory rudiments having told you few weeks ago that they were necessary why i got them in line and theyre very good rudiments they will clean up arc breaks and they will do various things all right theres only one difficulty one of those rudiments will walk the person right straight into the engram necessary to resolve his case that is what would you be and what would you rather not be it its rather gruesome so if theres something wrong with the auditor and you run that till the tone arm ceases you will actually find the pc sitting in the engram necessary to resolve his case anyway thats beside the point its just point in passing the rest of them have great liability to them at all and i have done the anatomy of an arc break and i find out exactly what an arc break is an arc break is the inability to tell an auditor i dont care whether it was withhold or otherwise and it isnt necessarily the auditor who is running the session its an inability to tell an auditor something inability not unwillingness inability you pick up arc breaks that go back for years with this exact process and the pc feels that the auditor has done something or has not done something actually the way it is given is what has an auditor failed to do is the other side of the question what have you been unable to tell an auditor what has an auditor failed to do actually there is third question that can come up which isnt mentioned in the original bulletins and that is what did an auditor do you see it isnt necessarily only what an auditor failed to do it is also what an auditor did so you ask these two questions it doesnt sound like dichotomy but it is to the pc from the viewpoint of an arc break in other words what have you been unable to tell an auditor and what has an auditor failed to do that is the way it is given and that can also be what did an auditor do all right now that will cure up arc breaks in other words you can get the rudiments in and as far as present time problems is concerned well theres new process for that and we wont bother to go into it because its all in the bulletins all right now there is new set of rudiments you can get the rudiments in there is excuse now for not getting the rudiments in and it is very important while doing goals assessment to get the rudiments in and keep them in keep them in keep them in now theres such thing as middle rudiments not only end rudiments and beginning rudiments but you have middle rudiments middle rudiments however dont get articulated as middle rudiments because what you actually do is end the session and give the pc end rudiments and then give him break and then start the session by giving him beginning rudiments and so forth but those two sessions are only five minutes apart and what it consists of is two cracks at the rudiments in the middle of the session you get the idea its really middle rudiments but its end rudiments beginning rudiments you see that all right while keeping these rudiments in gorgeously you take that first list of 150 goals and you find the pcs goal in that list and dont monkey with it lets not go to 5782 goals eighteen weeks rarrrarr to hell with this racket that goal was in the first 150 goals the pc gave it to you youve got it now what can get in the road of these things rudiments pcs got present time problem ill give you one right here person is present but i dont care pc was being audited on the second deck for the benefit of americans thats the third floor and thats right they have ground floor first floor and second floor in england and thats because i suppose at one time or another there was floor tax but anyway its actually the third floor and it was fairly high and the pc could look sideways out onto the terrace and the terrace was long way down and the pc was so afraid of height that during the entirety of the goals assessment only this goal would come up something to do with not falling whatever it was some oddball goal that had to do with not falling on her ead or something thats the only one that would come up well why do i have to furnish all the genius see you have some latent quantity of genius back on the track someplace dig it up man so i suddenly said well this is odd that i got the report that had nothing to do with this but the goal was something to do with falling and every time the pc was checked out on the goal the goal wouldnt stay in so i said well where is the pc being audited well the pcs being audited on the second floor wheres the pc being checked out the pc is being checked out in the basement so i said well audit the pc in the basement so they did and they found the pcs goal which wasnt falling had nothing to do with falling female voice it was the first one on the list you see how this thing would mess up well theres all kinds of screwball things but do you realize that should have showed up as present time problem every session it should have shown up on the room is it all right to be audited in this room well every time if anybody had been looking at the meter he should have been able to read pang its not all right to be audited in this room this room is several feet above the height where i like to be see should have shown up present time problem should have shown up do you have present time problem yes im scared ill fall out the window were already ten feet from the window but im liable to pitch out of it at any minute had absolutely nothing to do with the pcs assessment it just had to do with the pcs case see assessments different than case all right now lets take look at this it means that any pc goal can be found in the first 150 and it takes an hour and fortyfive minutes so you shouldnt take more than fifteen or twenty or thirty hundred hours sarcastic huh but thats only in revenge because all summer long i havent been able to figure out whats all this see whats all this whats all this why this long long long goals assessment well it just boiled down to just one thing rudiments were out every pc on goals assessment being run with the rudiments so badly out that the goal disappeared now goal is very easily invalidated very easily knocked in the head and so is terminal very easily invalidated and knocked in the head so youve got to have these rudiments clean as whistle in order for the thing to emerge and keep on reacting thats as simple as that pcs are delicate on the subject of goals and terminals but you can find it providing you dont knock the rudiments out and providing you keep them in so all right this pc is put immediately into goals assessment and we find the pcs goal and then we put him into terminals assessment and we find the pcs terminal this is hgc auditing im still talking about anything odd that is coming up about this it all centers around the rudiments the rudiments there arent there arent more rudiments that you should get in there are just those rudiments which already exist in model session even though they have new processes to run them nobody has changed the number of the rudiments the last addition was withholds and it looks like thats static from there on out all right this means then that pc would not be audited on 1a or any other breed of process which is preparatory or anything else you just audit them into the goal and the terminal when you have the pcs goal and the pcs terminal and when these have been proven up totally checked by another competent person always have your goal and terminal checked by some other auditor matter whether youre in an hgc or otherwise and the other auditor should simply check the rudiments and if the rudiments are out go further the way you do check like this you just check the rudiments you dont run them or get them in on yourself see if youre checking some other auditors you then pass the thing back to the original auditor and say your rudiments are out and when you get them in i will check the goal and terminal and he says oh well they werent out for you can always always depend on him making that remark they werent out for well maybe they werent out for him but they were out for you doing the checking and when the rudiments are then put in the pc is turned back for the goals and terminal checkout okay okay if theres something odd about it and theyre going out and theyre going in and the auditor hasnt been sure and hes sent the pc to you with two goals you say there are two goals reacting end of check when you have one goal reacting i will check it out same way with terminals if he turns pc over to you with two terminals reacting and doesnt know which one you say well after youve got them flat i will check this out simple thats the way you do one of these crosschecks you dont audit the pc you find out what should be done with the pc in order to check it out dont you see and then you get the other auditor to do it whose pc is that otherwise you get crosstransferences and all kinds of oddball phenomena all right when youve got the pcs goal and terminal and when the pc has successfully completed the hco ww form 3 security check you will have release on your hands and that is all there is to it so redefine the definition of release you cannot have release who has not found his goal and terminal and who has not completely passed through the most vigorous of the security checks that is not the basic definition of release and that is not in its original intent release that is just meanness on my part so just assign it to that because you cannot guarantee any stability on pc whose goal and terminal have not been found so therefore you cannot say that the pc will hold that state at all you see but if the pcs goal and terminal had been found even though runs have been made on it one way or the other you have already changed the living daylights out of this person this person now knows they are going in some direction or another and you can say safely well the persons release got it so it doesnt take very long to make release does it remember form 3 security check totally completed and the pcs goal and terminal found now youll find out that along about this state and along about this stage they dont want to pause long enough to get checked out for release and other oddball things of this character they will go right straight on along the line so were not going to worry about this particularly but supposing somebody was in the hgc and they could only be there fifty hours and the d of p had been careless with auditor training and the assoc sec had been careless with auditor training and the hco sec had been interested in the congress or something like this and it took fifty hours to find the goal and terminal and complete the security check well and the person has to go now or something like that well you can at least give him release certificate if these things have obtained if they are correct so that gives you something you can do there but mind you everybody would have to be sort of asleep at the switch in order for this kind of condition to obtain dont make any mistakes about that or settle for the fact that fifty hours to finish one security check do goals assessment and terminal assessment is anything like good fast technical auditing it isnt but at this time its acceptable its acceptable as of this time why because we have an awful lot of people around with great reality on the bank dont you see and we have lot of people around who are studying at the same time theyre doing and all this kind of thing is going on so you can expect this sort of thing to happen okay all right now weve gotten this fellow this far now weve got security check and by the way the security check doesnt have to have been completed by the time we start running the goals terminal the security check is just something we do as industriously as we can do and devoting as much time to it as seems natural but devoting never any more than fifty percent of ones auditing time to the security check you see thats the maximum and the minimum would be one hour and five so youve got maximum and minimum for how much to security check the pc now if theres hell of hangup in this case one way or the other and the case has been around for long time you of course do more security checks the way to solve case that is obviously hanging up on the goalsterminal setup is more security checks done better you understand dont just keep slogging at them with goals and slogging at them with terminals or something like that lets get down and get smart with security checks lets find out the actual conditions where this person ran into scientology lets find out the actual circumstances of this persons association with whats happening and then lets security check accordingly got the idea well lets say we found out this person had been around an aunt who was interested in scientology for five years and herself was never interested and then all of sudden one day came in for some auditing oh this sounds awfully interesting what was going on during those five years and were liable to get all kinds of upsets resentments negative postulates with regard to scientology you see and the whole thing is holding up its all holdup from here on see all kinds of things like this can occur so if theres holdup look in the area of withholds via security checks even if you have to tailor up some kind of special check for processing you understand person youll get cases like this you will get cases like this person has been an assistant instructor in psychology for the last eleven years and suddenly has come in for some processing youll get cases like this every time ship is going to sink why just look at those hawsepipes you know and those mooring lines and youll see shadows on them but eleven years hey wait minute hes heard of dianetics hes heard of scientology hes heard it lambasted he himself has engaged in some of it or he has been in well i dont know i keep an open mind they do they do keep open minds drafts go through them and well look at this look at this the guys actually hung up on his own overts of some kind or another but i wouldnt bother too much with this just except in the normal course of auditing it suddenly looks like this person is hanging up badly with goals and terminal well the rudiments are out and let point out something to you that withhold is part of the rudiments so to get that one in you sometimes have to be little bit extraordinary if the case is hanging up badly and you have to actually look over the circumstances and conditions of the case in order to find out what kind of withholds the person might possibly have had during period of time hm you see that is that very evident to you yeah the person isnt coming into session because somehow theyve forgotten all about it but at one time you know something was going on and so on i saw case held up on this instance this was very interesting instance fellow and his father and dianetics modern science of mental health had come out so they both read it you know read it read couple of chapters and decided to try some auditing so one audited the other and then the other audited the one and then they both agreed it didnt work then the person went on and read the book completely and came in and got to be not too bad an auditor and went on for years and years and years but his case never moved it was the weirdest thing and then one day an auditor very very smart got the earliest overts on dianetics and that was it both he and his father both agreed that it was just bunkum and it didnt work that was enough and it had actually held him up in processing something on the order of thousand or fifteen hundred hours worth how do you like that and all of it was being done across that basic postulate on the subject and of course it never worked either grim huh i get letter from somebody every once in while that is lambasting hco and screaming about things being returned and all kinds of wild things occurring and im saying well i wonder who that persons auditor is because this person has just fixed himself up but good i get them in every once in while has nothing to do with us particularly but theres person chattering around madly lambasting everything in all directions and of course its usually totally uninformed lambaste oh we do lots of things that could be criticized there is doubt about that whatsoever you handle this much volume you certainly are going to make some mistakes but theyre very seldom intentional mistakes now here heres just bunch of overts now somebodys going to get that person and theyre going to be in session theyre going to be trying to find their goal and remember its the goal thats submerged ordinary auditing on chronic somatic or something like that or present time problem this will all work you see but the goal is delicate and it can actually submerge or disappear on this kind of background of overts and withholds see thats all it takes interesting huh and unless you get that straightened out youre not going to find the goal and terminal okay all right youve gotten up to this stage now youve got security check done or in progress youve got the goal youve got the terminal of the pc now what do you do you assess it now lets enter into another very factual part of this particular rundown you assess it on the prehav scale just as always doing your good assessment running from the bottom the lowest point of the prehav on up to the top and then marking those points that reacted on the needle and then going back only over those points which reacted and marking again that they reacted on the way back and now taking up only those that have reacted twice now got two dots after them and separate those out and well wind up rather rapidly with the proper level thats very easy and we run him just as before fiveway legs and so forth and we run this pc now i dont care how long we run the pc it hasnt been established yet how long you should run the pc but this must be very very very clearly understood when we run the pc on the process we must include in that statement that the pc is doing that process and not something else or something also you see when we talk about run on the process we include in that that the pc is doing the process and not something else you got it in other words we actually process this pc now at this stage of the game we dont care whether hes in valence or out of valence or anything else were not worried about that or interested in that but we go on and we audit him very happily and cheerfully and time goes on we might run him this way for heh ten fifteen twenty twentyfive hours hes making progress the whole way dont think about that for minute because he is but at some time the exact method of determining same cannot be laid down at this moment i suppose itll emerge one of these days with whole new series of complications at some stage why we assume that hes been through some pictures he couldnt have helped it not with the prehav scale and so forth and we probably will have run an emotional level and we will have run some odds and ends i mean just on your ordinary assessment flattening your levels and now were going to ask this pc burning question and if we ourselves have not had an engram run and have reality on the track and never been through one from hell to halifax and dont know it were now in trouble were now entering the land of nevernever now we can make more goddamned mistakes and upset more pcs and get more arc breaks and so forth in this exact stage i am talking to you about if the auditor hasnt got tremendous reality on the situation than i would care to list in long encyclopedia runonica the only solution for it is as soon as possible yourself get some reality on this thing im talking about and after that you wont be going into the theory theory of it all see because it just is what it is thats all and with notknow versions and the forget notknow unknown types of commands we chock him into it now this is the exact way we do this we ask him if hes had any pictures where he himself was in himself looking at the things that were going on around him and we check these over very carefully and we ask him very searchingly about all these things and we actually determine that there probably have been by now two three four five or maybe just one picture in which the pc was in himself and something was going on and that answered the prehav level command and so he answered the command out of that picture maybe once maybe twice and that was it but that picture existed and he was in himself now were going to count those up find out how many of them there were and were going to assess them on the meter and were going to take that picture which produces the greatest needle reaction because that is the picture which can be run and then we are going to roll up our sleeves and getting the rudiments in very nicely and finding out if all is wonderful in all directions and we are going to run that picture with unknown notknow shouldntbeknown all the rest of the categories and youre going to come along and ask what are the commands that you should use for this and im going to respond i hope my patience holds outim going to say goddamn it get one run and then you wont be asking how many repetitive commands of this that or the other thing its the number necessary to resolve that particular phase of what its all about do you understand and youre going to get that picture run from beginning to end and all of it complete and all resolved and that is going to be that and then youre going to find the next picture and if there is next picture if hes only had one youre going to have to give him another five or ten hours of prehav run got it and then youre now going to have another assortment of pictures and youre going to take them apart like just like i said got it and then youll find all of sudden the case starts to accelerate and the terminal blows and youre going to have to find new terminal but you cant find the new terminal because its gone and then youre going to have to find new goal and then the new goal goes and then the pc is going to be hung up in another picture and youre going to have to remember that and run that thoroughly and then try to do another goals assessment and then you cant find the goal because they keep blowing and then you cant find the goals and they blow and you cant find any more goals and meantime youre trying to do security checks and the pc is doing them on whole track basis and youre in mess next thing you know the meters broken wont operate wont operate you could ask him questions and the needle just floats and you keep this up actually for long time and you try to locate any residual pictures and so forth keep on trying to audit the pc you got the idea the end product of all auditing is fruitlessly trying to audit the pc pc is cheerful the rudiments stay in everything is going along gorgeously the pc stays well insession and the meters busted once in blue moon the needle reacts and yet when it reacts now you generally will have an incident of some character and you run it just the same way that you ran the other incident youre locating odd bits of track that are still extant now the length of time necessary to stabilize clear has not been established but id say the only safe figure is after the person goes clear at least another twentyfive hours of auditing and preferably another fifty youve got it made then audit the twentyfive or fifty hours with your broken meter that wont work got it because they will run into things and they will run into incidents all right now there is new plan of clearing now youll find that is much more rapid much more factual plan of clearing and it comes up and confronts for the first time the fact that an auditor must handle incidents and that the prehav scale will not handle incidents except on run of such tremendous length as to make it unprofitable to shorten up clearing youve got to handle the pictures theyre stuck in okay now that is the setup and that will clear and that will clear fairly rapidly the goal will be found as rapidly as the rudiments are in the terminal will be found as rapidly as the rudiments are in and the pc will run as smoothly as hes got his withholds off particularly in the zone of dianetics and scientology and then in running it there is point where running generally on the prehav scale ceases to produce much of result and that is because the pc has been in and out of one two three four five good solid 3d pictures of one character or another and he actually is now hung up in every one of them he feels much better maybe but he really is hung up in every one of those pictures and the easy way to get out of it is to run them and if you yourself have never seen picture and youre trying to run somebody who has picture youre going to be sitting there trying to run tr 0 and thinking about giving the proper acknowledgment and how do you get in bridge and youre going to be thinking about all these things and hells bells you shouldnt be putting in any bridges you shouldnt be doing thing but just in there pitching with the pc you see and taking his attention and shifting his attention around and running the various phases of it all now thats what you ought to be doing and youll see at once the folly of putting in bridge because youre going to run different command youve been running what is not known about that incident and youre going to shift to what is not known to others about that incident and you go and the wheels creak and if you have never yourself been through one of these things why youre liable to put in bridge and yank the pcs attention out of it all and fiddle with the emeter leads and worry about lot of things when all you ought to be doing is just simply say well heres another version of this command now and what shouldnt be known about this to others ah well thats soandso and soandso and the pcs right in there pitching see its just smooth as glass and then eventually when you get to be an oldtime expert you will be able to do such things as we have learned over the many years as you find out theres hell of fall in this thing and you know at once that the way to resolve the fall is to put the pc at the bottom of the fall and make him fall to the top and after youve done this four or five times then he can complete the fall down but until you do this he very often cannot fall why because his resistance is against falling and his resistance against falling is run out by making him fall in reverse sounds weird but thats very good pc is going around in circle counterclockwise why make him spin the engram reversewise and youll find out the engram will spin ten times as fast reversewise and this will be very very funny the pc wont comment on its being funny but youve got all the resistance of going forward on the spin dont you see and you cant slow up that resistance and after that why the spin runs out its very simple and then there will come time in the engram when you will say to yourself well now ron said you had to run notknow on this and thats all youre supposed to run and the pc will tell you there isnt anything else unknown about this whole ruddy cottonpicking engram and youll keep on saying well what isnt known about the engram and of course hell come right out of session and youll have had it now is the time youve got to run the knows out of it and run through it few times just let him talk to you about it and the engram will just discharge from certain point and it just discharges from that point there on out providing you keep the pcs attention on it keep asking him questions about it and letting him tell you all about it and adding it all up and how it got that way and so forth now that is the running of engrams in clearing now why is this all of sudden so important why do we make this shift it isnt much of shift actually its simplification of what were doing why well id better give you this why now so that you wont be asking again you can if you want to well ive learned something new ive learned that somatic cannot be unburdened hmmmm somatic is where it is at the tension and velocity that it is and it is nowhere else and is totally independent of all other incidents i finally got the gen on it somatic is where it is on the track and is what it is and discharges only as what it is and not as any lock or any other additive and somatic matter how thoroughly it has been unburdened will come on with the same intensity when you find it where it is and that all the pcs hidden problems and present time problems of long duration stem from the first engram that you will be able to contact and run after the assessment all the pcs chronic somatics and difficulties are in the first one that you will contact contacting it just as i gave you just moment ago and sorting it out youll find all those all those somatics and everything else and so on nothing under the sun generalized process has ever made them less theyve put them out of the way and theyve kept the pc living but when you finally contact them again in the actual incident where they reside they are just as tough as they were the first time and they are there and they are rough and youve got to run them through and when you discharge that engram the pcs present time problem of long duration will vanish and that is the only way that thing can be solved and i know thats very adventurous for to say so but in actual fact its true the isness of the situation is in the time and place of the situation and nowhere else of course one could have concluded that years ago but we do have success in unburdening we do have success in doing those other things and isnt it interesting that after weve done all these things we go back and find the exact incident from which it all came and find it just as rough in that incident as it ever was and then the whole thing blows up and thats it its still the engram necessary to resolve the case all right let give you another datum here the engram necessary to resolve the case didnt resolve in 1950 for one very excellent reason the only reason an engram never reduced when run was because it was not on the goalterminal line of the pc it wasnt an earlier incident earlier incidents supported it and so forth and you could undercut it but the engram necessary to resolve the case is on the goalterminal line of the pc and unless youve found the goalterminal line of the pc the engrams arent going to reduce rapidly and if you find the goalsterminal line of the pc youre in for an hours run and if youre not on the goalsterminal line of the pc and hes not in valence youre in for seventyfive hours to reduction now thats something to know isnt it so of course the engrams that come up by running the prehav scale are the engrams that will resolve within an hour and theyre very resolvable theyre not dependent on anything else the somatics in them blow and everything else goes and the motion in them runs and all the difficulty youve ever had running engrams disappear because youve got the engram on the goalsterminal line of the pc youve got the pc in the terminal valence that was the destructive valence of his case and of course youre running him in that valence because its on his goalsterminal line and what youve solved in essence what has been solved here is how do you get pc in valence on an engram and also how do you find an engram on the case that will run and also what is the engram necessary to resolve the case you got those things those are all very important things now the reason you have trouble with engrams in the past in auditing and have difficulty with them is they didnt lie on the goalsterminal line the pc was not in valence in them and they would not resolve independently because they were associated with some other chain but on the goalsterminal chain they resolve bang and they are the engram that is producing the present time problem of the pc so this is terrific solution here this is big jump see and its quite cute anybody now can keep the rudiments in and run the find the goal and find the terminal and run the terminal prehav level find it and run it thats very mechanical auditing job but now something else is needed when we take off from that point and that is reality on what bank looks like youll never ask the right questions unless you know i could just sit here and tell you by the hour what bank looks like and all that kind of thing and maybe should because it might help you out in the first stages but at the same time one hours reality on going through an engram with all the screaming fits in the engram and after that youll never ask any silly questions about well should i put in bridge you see or silly question like well maybe the pc wasnt getting my acknowledgments hell hes not interested in your acknowledgments and youd know that then nor would you be sitting back in your chair comfortably and somewhat pompously going off like woundup doll youd say that would be about the cruellest thing you could do to anybody while he was running an engram you realize that because the only reason you can get through the engram is because you have an idea that the auditor is right there with you helping you out and so you can confront it thats it and you can go through it and you know that hell go ask you questions and youll be feeling snappy toward the auditor probably the whole time or youll be feeling something toward the auditor the whole time itll all be kind of misemotional right up to the time when you find the misemotion is in the engram and then when youve located that then the old line which suzie just dug up in the old book one the auditor shouldnt pay much attention rough paraphrase to the emotion of the pc because whatever emotion the pc is expressing while hes running an engram is to be found in the engram it hasnt anything to do with the auditor if theres antagonism in the engram the pcs going to be antagonistic right up to the point when he asises the antagonism if the engram is full of apathy the pc will be apathetic right straight through not anything the auditors doing but the auditor can compound it you see and snap the apathy in on himself or snap the antipathy in on himself by of course just not knowing what the hell hes doing and the only way he can not know what hes doing of course is to have reality on what the pc is doing when hes got reality on the thing himself why thats it i can tell you something else about this there are people around who tell you all about their engrams this isnt true of everybody who tells you about his engram but some of these people are telling you glibly that during prehav run they ran into this situation and soandso and suchandsuch and soandso and soandso was the case now they didnt run the incident and its an engram hotter than firecracker and they havent been near it and they havent been in it and they tell you thats an engram oh if youve run real one youll know thats youll know thats not true because real engram is only an engram because one doesnt know and cant seem to find out damn thing about it now of course after its been run expertly by somebody else and the person has gone through it and knows all about it now naturally he can give you the story but the story of an engram is never quite like that oh yes person can give you sequences off the backtrack that arent engramic but the engrams necessary to resolve the case are not in this kind of condition theyre complete notknow hodgepodge theyre mess person just hasnt clue and thats the first thing that the auditor contacts about the engram that theres just nothing known about it and then youll get some kind of silly interchange like this if you havent got good reality on that well what is unknown about that engram now you see youve got it this person with the stilts theres pair of stilts and they seem to be sitting out in the middle of this plain and snake very freudian you see and snake seems to be between the two stilts well now papa freud or some of the boys in psychiatry run into this sort of thing and they would build mountain of pretended knowingness on top of this it happens to be pair of stilts out on the plain and there happens to be snake between them and what this is all about and why the person doesnt know anymore about it is this doesnt make any sense at all so the psychiatrist has been busily pretending all sorts of knowingness about all this well youll also find pcs who wont go near an engram telling you all about it hahahaha theyre better you see theyre better theyve still got this burning right ear you see and they still go like this all the time yes i was running this engram the other day in which i sunk britain i destroyed it utterly oh man how the hell could they run any engram at all unless they ran the engram necessary to resolve the case and if he ran the engram necessary to resolve the case they wouldnt be doing that got the idea so it totallyit totally disproves itself and you get this silly situation just to continue with what i was sayingyou get this kind of an oddball silly situation and the auditor who has reality on engrams at all you see says well all right what is unknown about that and the pc says i dont know anything about it and the auditor says well come on now certainly you must know something about it well of course the oddball thing is is the pc answered the auditing question which is perfectly true he didnt know anything about it and the auditor takes this literally you see and says well we couldnt possibly run the engram because he doesnt know anything about it you got theyou got the kind of cross play that can go on here thatbecause the auditor wouldnt understand that when you really enter one of these bitch kitties on the time track that that is about your first reaction what the hell you know pair of stilts and snake how freudian you know what is that all about i dont know i dont know anything about it oh come on now the auditor you know you should have yahyahyahyah what he could say is well all right what else dont you know about it well i just nothing nothing at all it is just total blank all right good what dont you know about it nothing not single thing and the pc isnt arc breaking or anything else hes just answering the auditing question this has got him totally baffled he has never looked at anything in which there was information of any kind before that could be extracted from it and pc could go on this way for half an hour perfectly happy hes looking at it hes getting his head kicked off of course there are somatics in the thing and hes being bisected and trisected and few other things but the nice part of it is if hes running the engram that is found in the fashion that i just told you on the goalsterminal line if hes running that one when he contacts one they go and they dont come back isnt that nice now what weve really done with goalsterminal routine 3 is find the direct route to find the engram necessary to resolve the case and find the engram in sufficient condition that it will resolve and its only an hours run its nothing its nothing its agony but if the auditors got some idea of what an engram is the pcs perfectly willing to go through the agony you just never saw anybody so anxious to go through the agony he also never saw anybody quite so upset as an auditor who doesnt want him to go through any agony hm oh well the poor fellow hes uhi dont know he seems to be in trouble are you in trouble well for christs sakes what do you think well i dont know auditor says to himself how can he be in trouble hes sitting there in the auditing chair and this room is perfectly quiet room and he has idea whatsoever that the pc is in thenness which is more real than nowness but actually to the pc it appears to be now and the pc is in the middle of this thing which might be torture chamber it might be safeway store and on the other hand it might be the cockpit of an airplane who knows lord knows he doesnt and then you say to him something on the order of well i dont think really that uh seems to be too rough for you you know and uh you ought to really uh come out of it somehow and you realize that weve only got few minutes left till the end of session this would speak you see with absolutely reality on the auditors part what the hell the pcs going through thats the hill thats got to be climbed because in lot of places and lot of times these things will have to be run by somebody with damn fool reality on them of any kind whatsoever and somehow or other theyll have to muck through and get the thing run theyll have arc breaks by the ton and snapping the guy out of session and snapping him into present time and collapsing the bank on him and getting him twice as confused as he should have been and turning somatics up five times as high as they ought to be but somehow or another itll get run you understand but in the bulk of cases weve just taken off maybe oh i dont know thousand hours of running to clear this is why people arent going to clear they go into an engram on prehav run and they say well that answered the auditing question its perfectly all right for now not to have anything more to do with that good they dont notice its all their chronic somatics or anything like that theyre too glad you see to just hide the thing under the chair seat and skip it and they run into another one and theres bunch of harquebus men standing on the palisade and they say well when have you failed to endure well i failed to endure right there in front of that palisade yeah there they go pluzoom you see and boom and so on i sure failed to endure yeah well thats the end of that engram okay lets see lets have another one another command i answered the command thats it nothing to do with because of course the keynote of these things is total irresponsibility nothing to do with and then he goes on and he goes through another one by the time hes hit about five of these things why man its about time somebody threw him lifeline because he will now hang up from there on out and ordinary prehav runs will not do thing for him on any kind of progress line that you would consider fast progress line so they could just actually be audited for weeks why well theyll see these things again and then they say well i ran that once and so on you get what happens theyre running an escape mechanism of some kind or another on these incidents now you sort them out on an emeter find the engram necessary to resolve this out of these five the person has contacted and you just have to start talking to him about the incident you dont have to do anything fancy about going into it well hell hes in it hes got all the somatics of it where else would he be how could he have the somatics of it if he wasnt in the incident well theres trick in putting him in the incident and of course the keynote of all engrams is notknow and you ask him all the notknows out of the incident and what shouldnt be known and what isnt known and what he doesnt know and all of sudden it starts to run it starts making story and he builds it up more and he can tell you more about it and does and then you run more notknow and get some more stuff off of it and then you find out that he just seems to be stuck in one particular place and he isnt going anywhere now and matter how much notknow he seems to run and you say well what is happening there what is going on and well im sitting at the wheel of this car and it just doesnt seem to be going anyplace well where is the car well i dont know well what dont you know about it well i dont know i dont know where this embankment leads to cars halfway up this embankment all right run the car backwards onto the track huh i can do that good run the car backwards onto the track thank you well good run the car backwards onto the track again do that few times back on the track back on the track back on the track back on the track back on the all right now what dont you know about this oh god what youve done is run the resistance the tremendous resistance toward going over an embankment into crowd dont you see and the resistance is such that youve got to run it backwards youve got to get the pcs effort not to go into the crowd off and the engram will now start running again and all of sudden the car does go up over the embankment and turns over eight times and comes down squash on the head of fifteen spectators the pc very cheerfully will do that then got the idea and you just have to keep it moving keep these points of hangup resolved and you have to know what youre doing thats all theres substitute for it and we know all the tricks there are to run engrams and there arent very many and youve got the common denominator of engrams you know how to find the engram necessary to resolve the case the engram that will run and the engram where the somatics are all residual that isnt dependent on any other engram for its somatics youve got all those things what the hell more do you want well what more do you want is actually subjective reality on what they look like and how they go and where they go now it hasnt anything to do with the occlusion of case this is another piece of news case is occluded smuted to hell with it what is an occluded case stuck in an engram which is an occlusion engram youve got this fellow down in the engine room of spaceship and the lights go out and he doesnt know what happens three seconds later his engines blow up and theyve never blown up before there he is of course he doesnt ever move forward into the blowup of the engines he sticks there at the point where the lights went out he has black field what dont you know about this well i just dont know anything about it well what are you looking at im looking at nothing whats the nothing look like well it looks black like any other nothingness idiotic type of questioning that goes on you see if youve got subjective reality on it you know what questions to ask you say well all right what happened just before this because the auditor can always move to the somatic strip faster than the pc can what happened just before this whew what happened before this oh oh thats another thought what dont you know about it i dont know why the lights went out oh you got lights on there just before that yeah all right well move back into that area there all right now what dont you know about that well i dont know where the ship is going and of course weve got an engram running right there bang ityba ngbang and this was an occluded case or the case with the little rockets that keep going across the line the little rockets that keep going across the line its just section out of an engram there is condition here of pretended knowingness which can get in our road and this must be looked on by you simply as an escape factor to end all escape factors when the knowingness is too horrible and the notknowingness is too thick and then the person feels too stupid about it theyre liable to dream it up and these dreamedup ones all go off like hot butter theres nothing unknown about any part of them thats an engram hahahahaha the hell it is this is dubin of book one now youre not going to find any of it running this way because youre going to get the guy into the engram necessary to resolve the case youre going to ask him if there were any of these pictures that he was in in himself and what he was looking at at the time youre going to get it located on the meter youre going to hold him in that instant of time and so on your prehav scale normally discharges obsessive change and other things of this character so that these things are to some degree taken care of but you are going to run into people that are pretty hard to settle down into that one just the second you say well which one were you actually in and looking at the scenery and the scenery was in 3d during this prehav run oh youre talking about that one i ran into long time ago the last couple of weeks ago oh yeah well that one thats nothing to that actually that was time when i was young subaltern and we were over in france and uh i uh was i know what i was responsible for there you see i was uh well just look at it what is this this is defense defense defense defense defense he doesnt know thing about it or it wouldnt be an engram it wouldnt be acting on your meter when you asked for an engram you say well now just as you where whered how did you pick up this picture just whats what did the picture itself look like well i was there and there was well there was trench in front of parapet periscope thats the picture oh is that the picture yes and i know what it was because you see i made mistake in the firing parapet and i telephoned it all back wrong you see and then the whole regiment was wiped out and so forth i feel very guilty about the whole all right good thank you thank you very much well what dont you know about that parapet oh know everything about it uh except uh where it is now you know you are getting somewhere where is it what else dont you know about it well what its made out of is it concrete or something what else dont you know about it well why its so fuzzy well what else dont you know about it well what im supposed to be looking at well what else dont you know about it well where i was what else dont you know about it what i was what else dont you know about it who i was where i was what this is what am i doing here you know and we find out it is not trench it was not world war i he was not subaltern it was not on this planet its an atomic power plant observation parapet he was guilty of something he did get the right angle there but that was about it see thats as far as the data was factual get the idea the keynote of an engram is the pc knows nothing about it pretended knowingness is going to get in your road and youre going to buy garbage and then some day youre going to invalidate some pcs straight dope youll be sorry it wasnt garbage see it was an implant script something weird you see this kind of thing but you can find these things and you can run them and you can run them with great reality on them providing you dont keep jerking the pcs attention out of it with bunch of technical nonsense like all right is it all right with you if i give you two more commands of this unknown process dadumdadum is there anything you would care to say now before i end this process youre goddamn rights theres something i would care to say here i was here in the middle of this whirlpool minding my own business and where are you the pc can get pretty revengeful all youve done is painful shift of attention when you start running an engram youll run an engram well you can ask all kinds of oddball auditing questions and youll actually use repetitive questions in streams or bursts like you fire machine gun what isnt known about that what isnt known about that you know thank you what isnt known about that what else isnt known about that well what isnt known about that all right is there anything else around there that isnt known about that is there anything else that isnt known about that thank you very much there isnt anything else known about that and he seems to be kind of slowing down on this now and we say well is there something there that others dont know about that all right thank you thats good anything else others dont know about that all right anything else others dont know about that anything else others dont know about that now we seem to have that kind of cleaned up and we say well is there any effort to forget anything in here oh there isnt all right thank you very much well what isnt known about that good what isnt known about that good what isnt known about that good what isnt known about that now all right is anything known about it do you know anything about it now all right oh soandso and soandso all right what are you looking at there all right good enough is there any spot there thats consistent that just stays there or anything else like that yeah well this rock projection on the wall that seems to be something well what dont you know about that okay good what dont you know about that all right whats unknown about that rock projection thank you whats unknown about that rock projection thank you whats unknown about that rock projection thank you oh oh oh oh thats where you hit your head ooohhh okay its pointless to ask any further because the pc of course has got the unknownness off it you say all right now whats unknown about that incident good whats unknown about that incident whats unknown about that incident whats unknown about that incident what shouldnt be known about the incidents good what shouldnt be known about it good oh all right well what shouldnt be known about it all right well what else shouldnt be known about it oh thank you all right what else shouldnt be whats you doing what do you run into whats happening oh what are you looking at whats it look like oh all right well what shouldnt be known about that okay all right now what shouldnt be known about this incident all right what shouldnt be known about that incident good all right whats unknown about the incident oh you say everythings known about it now all right well what happened all right he tells you you know soandso and soandso and soandso all right are there any other unknowns in there that you can spot one place or another yeah well and of course listening to him you know damn well he knows nothing whatsoever about certain sequence of it because he hasnt noticed that at one time he is standing on cliff and another time he is standing on the top of spaceship he never noticed that he has never transited between these two places so it doesnt make sense you can ask him something blunt you know dont be unreal about it well how did you get on the cliff what cliff oh the cliff the cliff youre standing on every once in while oh thats right i was on the cliff standing on the top of spaceship theyre two different places haha i didnt know they were two different places all right what else dont you know about that well how i got from one place to the other what else dont you know about that well the condition im in on the cliff okay what else dont you know ouch what happened then well i dont know gee whiz theres whole other sequence up here on the cliff i didnt know i got up here on the cliff for heavens sakes i must have gotten blown out of the spaceship and i didnt get blown out of the spaceship i walked i didnt walk there was another space theres space oh i see theres the space lifeboat down there wrecked at the bottom of the ci i get it oh i see well what do you see well i dont you see you idiot you know i i i thought id get away in space lifeboat and i didnt make it but actually i teetered on top of the cliff and then just as i got out of the thing i was hit with this withering blast of fire thats what that is all about see simple thats why i got all these face somatics ive got right now well what dont you know about those face somatics well i dont know where they came from okay what else dont you know there good thank you what else dont you know what else is unknown good what else is unknown about the top of the cliff there good what else is unknown about the top of the cliff good what else is known about the top of the cliff what else is unknown about well i guess ive got it now well what have you got oh well there are bunch of natives up there bunch of wogs and so forth armed with electronic cannon wogs armed with electronic cannon doesnt makes sense but you say well all right what dont you know about those wogs well i dont know if theyre wogs see youll see his impulses to write script and then all of sudden youll see he does find out what happened and youll see the gradual asising of the situation and the gradual integration of it pretty soon all the somatics will be gone and the whole thing will be clear from beginning to end ask him to run through it few times just just running an engram as offhandedly as this this is of course the thing is all cleared up theres pieces left in it that you can detect and you say all right why dont you start in at the beginning of this engram and run on through to the end few times see if you can pick up anything else he does you dont say go to the beginning of the engram and run through the engram to the end of the engram now give the phrases necessary to resolve the case see just go on run through it few times he does he does he does oh there is something here what well i dont know why this ship was only equipped with one lifeboat oh well what else about that well theres two lifeboat hatches you see and one is empty oh well is there anything happened before this incident that you have omitted oh i get what this is about the pilot of the ship had already deserted the ship and left and i didnt know anything about running the ship now it makes sense and bong he gets the rest of the somatics and you say all right now is there anything else thats unknown about that incident ive got it all taped now got it all taped well run through it few more times and see if you can get anything out of it that you might have missed ive got it well just run through it anyhow and he does and he says well its all gone theres nothing else there and you say ill check over these various points now how about the top of the cliff oh yeah i got that how about the wogs well they werent wogs you know it was the other part of the army we were mutineers you see i thought i told you and so on and the guy got that and we got this all straight all fine its all running okay its fine well you got any somatics nope nope dont got any somatics got any sensations good sensations any places where you dont feel anything at all well come to think about it i dont have any sensation from the waist down all right is that in this incident oh yeah yeah yeah yeah as matter of fact yeah yeah thats when we first crashed yeah oh i got that thats very early in the incident yeah well how are your legs now well they feel all right well what did you pick up there oh i just picked up crashing all right is that okay now yeah well what are you looking at oh the ground down there about five feet well is the ship on the ground its about five feet up from the ground well it hasnt hit yet is that right all right good crash backwards half dozen times how do you mean well justjust go backwards from the crash spot all right okay move move move oh i see i see what you i was stuck he had big big cognition see all right now how are your legs well theyre all right now tell about the crash oh went down and so and so oh theres the last of it now thats it how are your legs now got sensation in your legs yeah well are there any more somatics in this thing anyhow look it over carefully and tell if there are any more somatics in it nope there are more somatics any more dead feelings any more sensations anything else in this incident at all good well do you have sonic in the incident i havent heard anything leave it alone dont bother to turn on the perceptions any higher than theyre turned up just mark it down in your book that after youve run two or three more incidents off this particular case youre going to go back and find the sonic in this incident okay perceptions are the last things to turn on there will be sense of smell in there someplace and so on you just careful auditor makes sure that he just gets all the perceptions out of it eventually so he should keep it in his auditing record that he didnt get the perceptions out of this such as smell got what im talking about he didnt get the sound out of it sometimes pcs will really flash back at you if you start asking them for smells or sounds or something like that youre turning it up too real on them thats just turning up too damn real and actually can be suppressed one incident to the next at the time they had this crash on the plane their sonic had been off for the last eight or nine trillennia see their sonic isnt off in this is off in this incident but didnt turn off in this incident got the idea because perception is something that declines gradually over long period of time but somatics are something which are right now see how that would be its very funny when the pcs sonic starts coming on of course he hears everything all played backwards and upside down in one hell of jumble so he his natural impulse is to turn it off promptly youll get somatic impulses turned off during auditing and if youre eventually smoothing the case out and giving him sonic and all the rest of this thing youll have to pick up the turnoffs in the auditing too you know there was this awful crash and they decided they didnt want to hear any part of it and the sonic went off sonic is very easy for pc to turn off okay now running an incident is your fast way out and that shortens this down considerably and we continue on with our efforts to shorten clearing as much as possible and i think when you see this thing in action you will really know youve gotten someplace the first thing that youve got to learn however is how to do good security check and how to do good keep the rudiments in how do you keep the rudiments in in session and then how to do good goals assessment how to do good terminal assessment how to do good prehav assessment if youve got these things why youve got the thing taped right up to that point where you have to know how to run an engram and the one thing thats going to teach you that is running one yourselfinside you with somebody else auditing and that will teach you everything you want to know about it and then you will be telling all the knuckleheaded stunts auditors can pull well thats fine as long as you get through it and as long as you push pcs through engrams shouldnt take more than an hour two hours something like that to run one of these incidents if its taking longer than that your rudiments are so wildly out you shouldnt have been running it in the first place ill give you an example i was doing this last night and before i started the session i took up for the fifteen or twenty minutes with the pc this was auditing but it was not in session why the pc did or did not deserve auditing i just wondered if the pc deserved auditing or not and so we discussed this for fifteen or twenty minutes in oblique ways and got lot of locks off and did lot of little straightwire stunts and so forth cleaned this sort of thing up and then started the session because i was going to run an engram in that session i didnt want anybody running an engram in session who didnt think they deserved any auditing okay do you see this is finite package of skills it is finite package of skills it is not very many of course we assume that you can do your trs we assume that you can do model session we assume you know emeter essentials we assume these things and im almost of mind to just go on assuming them and kicking peoples heads in who dont know them because ill tell you for all of these things persons got to know how to run an emeter persons got to know to do model session before they can do any auditing at all and their trs have got to be in before they can do any of these things at all but these you can look on as elementary skills now youre looking at another level of skill the level of skill of keeping rudiments in the level of skill of actually finding somebodys goal rather rapidly its easy to do just to the degree that theyre not arc broke with sessions finding somebodys terminal very rapidly assessing the person and then first and foremost of course after that comes the ability to run an engram these are finite but of course that whole thing falls down if you cant do security check i think that whole package there sort of rounds it up if you can do these things you can make the grade if you cant do these things you cant make the grade clearing consists of that there is what clearing consists of because every case i find now that is hanging up in clearing has contacted incidents and these incidents are now blooeyyou know theyre unrun and should be runor the pc has not done any of the auditing commands thats part of the basic skill of auditing is making sure that the pc does the auditing command isnt it but in this one lecture ive actually discussed all of the elements of auditing i may not have given you all the details ive given you an awful lot of the engram running and actually the engram running is not really more complicated than i have given you it is more complicated than that using these materials you should be able to clear clearing is overdue overdue in lot of your hands and so on and now i have an announcement to make that anybody who makes clear from scratch automatically gets dscn and theres other way to get one thank you okay
