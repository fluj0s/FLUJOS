and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32333steel price and policy issues summary the rapid growth of steel production and demand in china is widely considered as major cause of continued high steel prices and prices of steelmaking inputs steel companies have achieved much great er pricing power in part through an ongoing consolidation of the industry high prices persist despite the revocation in 2003 of president bushs broa d safeguard order on imports us steel production in 2006 was 108 million t ons the integrated side of the industry continues to lose share domes tically to the minimills imports rebounded in 2006 to reach the highest tonnage level ever though they declined in 2007 input prices especially ferrous scrap and iron ore remain high meaning higher costs which have been largely passed along to industrial consumers china now produces 40 of the worlds steel and is the worlds largest steelmaker and steel consumer this contributed to large global increase in demand for both steel and steelmaking inputs chin has become large net exporter as well in 2006 its steel exports to the us market more than doubled and it became the secondlargest import source congress became increasingly concerned over allegedly unfair trade competition from china and has considered many proposal s to deal with these issues in the 110th congress bills were introduced to allo w penalty tariffs to offset countrys manipulation of its currency exchange rate for trade advantage the commerce department undertook count ervailing duty case against china and the us government also brought case in the wo rld trade organization against china over subsidies including subsidization of steel exports the us steel industry sponsored in 2007 report that detailed alleged government subsidie s to the chinese industry the us international trade commission itc has terminated some trade remedy cases and orders against imported steel products but in other cases orders have been upheld and new cases are proceedin g president bush decided in china safeguard case not to provide relief for dom estic producers of steel pipe despite positive itc determinati on the byrd amendment under which domestic steel producers receive distributions of trade remedy duties was repealed by pl 109171 and is longer in effect from october 1 2007 internationally the organization for economic

policy issues introduction with growing demand at home and abroa d the domestic steel industry is strong and profitable but also more subject to globalized ownershi p and international competitive pressures many american businesses are concerned by longterm increase in the price of steel that has resulted from these trends some members of congress were once concerned that the st eel safeguard tariffs imposed in 2002 by president bush under the terms of section 201 of us trade law could have been keeping steel prices artificially high before those tariffs were terminated on december 4 2003 the costs of raw materials and other inputs in steelmaking rose thus creating costdriven increase in the price of steel after the tariffs were removed the price increase nevertheless accel erated on the other hand after decades of implementing efficiency improvements while struggling to be profitable many steel companies in 2004 found themselves ma king more money than in many years higher steel prices for consuming industr ies since then have been exacerbated by global economic growth which increased demand for steel in 2005 the rate of growth of us i ndustrial output modera ted and the price of steel domestic steel output and steel mill companies earnings all declined but the growth of china contributed to large increase in global demand for both steel and steelmaking inputs thus keeping the cost of domestic steel high china has become both the worlds largest steelmaker and steel consumer china also became net exporter of steel including such large increase of exports to the us market that it became the secondlargest na tional import supplier in 2006 since 2005 number of policy decisions ve adversely affected the interests of domestic steel producers the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd abandoned its efforts to ne gotiate an agreement among all major steelproducing countries to ban domestic subsidies for steel mills congress approved and president bush signed into law federal deficit reduction bill repealed the continued dumping and subsidy offset act byrd amendment under which many domestic steel producers received distributions of antidumping and countervailing duties charged on imports the us international trade commission itc in two fiveyear sunset reviews of existing trade remedy tariffs on widely traded products decided in december 2006 that the threat of material injuryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32333crs2 to domestic producers longer existed from imports of cutto length steel plate or from imports of corrosionresistant coldrolled steel from most countries and thereby eliminated the subject remedy duties the itc decided in late 2006 that domestic steel wire rod producers were not materially injured and thereby terminated an antidumping case brought by domestic steel companies against imports from china turkey and germany president bush decided in special trade safeguard case not to provide trade relief for domestic producers of steel pipe against imports from china the world trade organization wto appellate body in april 2006 ruled that the socalled zeroing methodology used by the us commerce department in calculating dumping margins violates wto rules when used in administrative reviews the commerce department has modified its assessments in way that led to lower dumping margins in steel industry cases but in decisions that were more positive for the steel industry in sunset reviews of andtidumping and counter vailing duty adcvd orders the itc decided to keep most penalty duties on hotrolled line pipe and reinforcing bar imports though it eliminated ad duties on many steel produc ts used by the domestic petroleum industry furthermore the bush adminis tration announced in february 2007 that it was taking case against china to the wto under the organizations rules on prohibited subsidies the us domes tic steel industry has complained about pervasive and continuing government s ubsidies of chinese producers in its announcement the us government explicitly included steel among the chinese industries that had benef itted from subsidies both steel producers and steel consuming industries have co mplained that china manipulates its exchange rate to enhance its trade competitiveness and number of bills have been introduced in congress that would define chinas exchange rate policy as distortion of trade and subject to us retaliatory measures whatever the net impact of these policy developments the price of steel is generally double or triple the price when steel safeguards were introduced in 2002 although costs of steelmaking inputs have so increased as this report describes in detail the steel industry as whole has beco highly profitable in direct contrast to its condition just few years earlier profitability may be partly the result of global i ndustry consolidation two of the four largest us steelmakers are now foreignowned as opposed to none of the top 10 steelmakers being fore ignowned less than 15 years ago there is also only one significant canadianowned steelmaker left and it is in the process of being acquired by us steel most of the indus try in mexico is now owned by companies from outside north america arcelormittal the worlds largest steelmaker with operations on virtually every continent is now also the largest steel producer in

more profitable than at any time in the last generation the steel industr in the united states and north america is also far more internationalized in its ownership moreover while the sustained high price of steel has encouraged spate of plans and actual new construction of steel mills in virtually all cases the mills are being financed and controlled by foreign interests current state of the steel industry us production and employment the sharp rise in demand for steel plus the consolidation of the industry led to higher steel prices and profits almost acr oss the board in the industry in 2004 but in 2005 production prices and apparent domestic consumpt ion all declined the resurgence of supply in 2004 coincided with dramatic rise in dom estic steel prices as production declined with demand in 2005 prices also declined but they remained historically str ong and fell nowhere near th levels seen before the imposition of trade safeguard remedies in 2002 in 2006 overall prices remained high even as domestic production increased significantly and im ports set an alltime record despite the volatility in steel prices ove r the past decade domestic steel output has remained surprisingly constant since 1997 us domestic raw steel production has only been more than 110 million net tons in one year 2000 and less than 100 million tons also in just one year 2001 in 2004 output increased from 103 million tons to nearly 110 million tons as us mills benefitted from worldwide recovery in demand and prices then output fell b ack little to less than 105 million tons in 2005 before recovering again to more than 108 million tons in 2006 capacity utilization defined in the industry as capability utilization declined from 946 in 2004 to stabilize at 875 in 2005061 as prices have now remained strong for an extended peri od several new us mills or expansions of existing mills are being completed or are on the drawing board2 it remains to be seen if this leads to an extended period of longterm growth in domestic capacity the restructuring and consolidation of the steel industry which is detailed below has according to many analysts led to greater control over production this has led to high er prices as demand increased3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32333crs4 3 continued rest of the world needs to join steel monthly report november 2006 pp 12 4 data from

offset by higher prices in some other products total shipments of steel mill pr oducts were down by 4 through august 2007 and capacity utilization slipped to 861 but the industry has continued to be highly profitable both domestically and globally4 though production has been stable in recen t years the relationship between the two steelmaking technologies used in the ited states has drama tically reversed in terms of market shares figure 1 illustrates the changing patterns of us steel supply integrated mills produce steel from iron ore using coke and other inputs they are characterized by unionized wo rkforces and in competing with both minimills and imports have been absorbing high levels of employee and retiree benefit costs5 the production of the large in tegrated mills using basic oxygen furnace bof technology the last us open hearth plant closed in 1991 hovered around 60 million tons per year in the 1990s th fell substantially below that figure after 2000 the integrated side of the i ndustry has consolidated by closing older operations and increasing productivity in 2004 production from integrated m ills increased 4 to 526 million tons but in 2005 it decreased to 471 million tons the lowest level from this type of furnace since 1982 in 2006 bof output fell again to 464 m illion tons integrat ed mills remain the sole source of certain highvolume products such as external sheet for auto mobiles and us motor vehicle production has been on down trend for the past two years minimills employ electricar c furnaces eafs newer technology they have overtaken integrated mills as the leading source of steel by tonnage in the united states and are now virtually the only dom estic source of long products such as concrete reinforcing bars st eel wire rod and construction beams although they may use various forms of iron ore input most minimills rely primar ily on steel scrap which they remelt the minimill sector is largely nonunion and by contrast with the integrated mills provides definedcontribution employee pension packages instead of benefits fined by union contract6 minimills steadily increased production after the recession of 1991 and gained market share figure 1 shows that their production topped 50 million tons for the first time in 2000 when it reached 47 of domestic raw steel production up from 37 at the beginning of the 1990s minimill output fell significantly in 2001 then recovered steadily in 2006 nnual minimill production ex ceeded 60 million tons for the first time and accounted for 57 of us output compared to 43 for the integrated mills almost exactly the reverse of the situation 10 years earlierhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32333crs5 7 aisi 2006 annual statistical report table 14source american iron steel institute annual statistical reports figure 1 also shows the level of imports which has been somewhat erratic but on an upward trend and reached an alltime record in 2006 they increased steadily in the 1990s then surged in 1998 to more than 40 million tons the movement of imports has been up and down since that pea k during the application of safeguard tariffs imports fell in 2003 to 231 million t ons the lowest level since 1993 once the safeguards were rem oved and given strong domes tic demand imports increased more than 50 in 2004 to 358 million tons imports in 2005 fell back to 32 million tons but they increased again to ne w record of 451 million tons in 2006 part of the reason as is observed later in the discussi on of prices is the shift in the structure of demand toward products used in energy and industrial produc tion even as demand for flat steel in the auto nd appliance industries softened another major shift in the 2006 was in the sources of us imports as is discussed below through august 2007 imports declined about quarter by tonnage according to the american iron and steel institute this figure does not show the rising si gnificance of steel exports as share of total us steel production this has become increasingly significant as the decline in the exchange rate of the us dollar against most foreign currencies while exports of steel mill products were around 56 million tons between 1997 and 2002 the export trend began to strengthen in 2003 and reached 97 million tons in 20067 while imports declined subs tantially through early 2007 exports increased by

the industry the only difference had been slower decline in the mid1990s as oppos ed to faster decline during and after the late 1990s when the industry was under heavy pressure from imports or low

saw the annual employ ment level decline to about 60000 north american and global steel industry consolidation one of the stated purposes of the pres idential action of 2002 on steel safeguards was to effect restructuring of the domestic steel industry11 to great extent that restructuring has been achieved there are now two dominant players among integrated steel mill companies in the united states and north america and two clear market leaders among the minimill pr oducers moreover the leading north american and global producer mittal st eel in 2006 acquired the global numbertwo producer arcelor12 the recovery of pricing power in the domestic industry may be attributable to industry cons olidation as well as to ri sing global demand spurred by china but ironically the establishment of industry pricing power plus the rise of global demand and steel prices and the falling exchange rate of the dollar have also made establishment of new production facilities in the ited states an

mill inland steel he also acquired major mexican producer the integrated steel works on the pacific coast at lazaro cardenas but his major coup in becoming the leading north american steelmaker was the acquisition of the in ternational steel group isg this occurred after the north american steel industry had nearly collapsed with more than three dozen bankruptcies after 1998 about onethird of the companies on earlier lists of leading us and canadian steel mill operators in 20022003 disappeared from independent existence either having gone out of business or merged into other companies the first bankruptcy that started conso lidation process was that of ltv steel which became the foundation for isg in 2002 when financier wilbur l ross led group that bought the company out of liqui

costs of the acquired companies the underfunded pension funds of bankrupt steel producers were taken over by the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc an entity chartered by congress while retirees lost their companysponsored health care be nefits ross also negotiated new labor contracts with the united steelworkers u swa and other unions representing the integrated mills these agreements conflated the number of job descriptions within integrated mills and otherwise streamlined the organization of labor within plants14 but isgs own days as an indepe ndent operator were shortlived in 2004 ross reached an agreement with mittal under which the latters global holdings were first consolidated as mittal steel then merged with the holdings of isg in april 2005 for payment of about 45 billion to ross and other isg shareholders thus mittal steel became the largest domestic us steel producer considering both the isg acquisition nd its previously owned inland steel

prices in the united states falling compared to thos of other global producers when lead time risks and the explosion in seaborne freight rates are incorporated the advantage in steel imports is minimized or even negated this source notes that investment in ocean shipping iron ore mines and coke ovens globally should eventually reduce such domestic price advantages but all this will take time to come on stream93 the impact of the growth of china while us domestic demand and input co st factors have helped account for an overall increase in the price of steel in the domestic market chinas emergence as major marketoriented economic power is having more of an impact on steel markets and prices than anything else today chinese steel mainly goes to its domestic market what has concerned the u s steel industry is that as china adds new and modernized steel capacity it will be used increasingly to export surplus steel as domestic demand is ade quately met moreover the steel industry and its customers have alleged that chinese st eel and steel product exports are unfairly subsidized on february 2 2007 the office of the us trade representative ustr filed complaint at the wto against china regarding this general issue the chinese government has responded by some reductions of measures that encourage steel exports more broadly it has also taken limited steps to allow its currency to rise against the dollar on fo reign exchange markets which makes chinese products less competitive against u sproduced goods but the steps taken to date have not been sufficient to satisfy the domestic us steel industry the bush administration nor critics of china in congress china as steel producer consumer and exporter china has become the worlds largest steel producer as discussed in

its demand dr ove the global price of steel higher notably in 2004 chinas rapidly growing appetite for steel also drew in high levels of imports from other major asian producers such as japa n korea and taiwan probably diverting them from the us market the conseque nces were higher prices for steelmaking inputs in the united states and lower availability of imported finished steel at competitive prices meanwhile us steel consuming industries increasingly must compete with fabricated steel products from chinese suppliers the chinese government in 2004 sought to restrain growth by curtailing

states these exports fell off to 582000 mt in 2003 as us demand declined and trade safeguards were implemented but chinese imports in the united states almost tripled to more than 14 million mt in 2004 increased again by third to 19 million mt in 2005 and more than doubled again in 2006 as discussed above data for 2006 seem to i ndicate that while steel demand in china is continuing to increase it is not keeping pace with the building of new modern steelmaking capacity and chinese exports are likely to grow104 while the chinese central government may be committed to eliminating old capacity consolidated internationally competitive chinese producers may be even more of problem for the us industry in an open market environment chinas proposed steel industry restructuring in july 2005 the chinese government released the china iron and steel industry development policy prepared by the national developm ent and reform commission ndrc according to official sources this policy is to

indicated plans to shut 100 million mt of excess capacity particularly among mo re than 200 smaller mills in two northern interior provinces111 in 2007 after many months of delay the ndrc drew up an expanded list of 682 steel facilities located at 334 sites which were to be closed by 2010 at the latest although the operations affected number in the hundreds the total steelmaking capacity would be about 3540 million mt or less than 5 of chinas capacity according to independent analysis ndrc is quoted as saying that there will be further announcements of closures however the analysis notes the government cannot stop mills veloping larger more effi cient facilities that comply with ndrc guidelines while increasing capacity112 money for metal does not maintain that there is monolithic chinese steel policy controlled by single government entity but rather that industry ownership and control is in the hands of different government entities with different agendas the chinese industry it describes is not r eally controlled by government as much as it is controlled by governments in communist state that is in process of transitioning itself to more marketori ented economy the report seems to project future in which the us steel industry ma confront either more consolidated and efficient chinese industry able to export whenever it has excess capacity for domestic demand or rampantly expanding industry which can always cut price to export excess output or both existing simu ltaneously and subsid ized by all levels of government in china113 cisa has rejected this analysis of highly subsidized domestic industry it reportedly stated in response to the re port that dominance of the industry by group of leading governmentcontrolled companies was false image and the

apply to significant portion of chinas steel exports122 the us government has stated its pr eference for marketbased policy reforms including the elimination of systemic subsidies rather than administrative actions on foreign trade as solution to the question of unfair competition from china but the breadth of the us wto case on chinese subsidies throughout its economy indicates how deeprooted such policies are and how difficult they may be to eliminate consequently shortterm measures may be necessary to address the problem of overheated steel exports but in implementing this approach piecemeal and with border measures aimed at specific products the chinese government may also give the impression that it is manipulating or gaming the trading system product by product123 moreover the discouragement of steel exports may well just push the problem downstream as us steel consu ming industries find increased competition from chinese producers using cheap domestic steel124 such interpretations could be drawn fro m quick review of how the chinese policy has moved forward since an initial policy circular of september 2006 first the government marginally reduced from 11 to

subsidizing new steelmaking capacity as the global market for steel boomed the oecd members present did agree to continue the operations of the steel committee143 to further preparations for this m eeting oecd staff drafted proposed blueprint for steel subsidies agreement it was generally designed to ban broad range of steel industry subsidies across th board in commentaries on the blueprint oecd officials stated that 90 or more of historical subsidies would be prohibited the details of the document proposed seri of solutions to outstanding issues major issue was actionability eg subjection of subsidies to trade remedy laws if proposed subsidy were notifie d to the review committee that was to be formed under the proposal and this we re duly approved by that committee by consensus unanimity then subsidies should not be countervailable under trade laws of participating countries the oecd staff claime d that all subsidies that are actionable remain actiona ble and that proposed minimis standards in the blueprint actually reduced the levels that are allowed anyway under us trade law144 representatives of the american steel industry reacted negatively to the blueprint most discussion focused on exceptions that would be permitted and types of payments that would constitute allowable subsidies an executive of us steel for example was especially cerned about the ques tion of actionability that is subsidies allowed under the agreem ent could not be subject to us trade remedy laws the general view of the indus try as reported in trade journal articles was that an agreement designed to ban subsidies should not instead focus on carving out exceptions to subsidy discipline145 by october 2005 the responses to the oecd staff blueprint did not indicate that the

the president decided that relief was not in the national economic interest179 as might be expected the domestic steel industry was critical of the presidential decision not to take any action at least one pipe mill has closed since the decision was announced reportedly because of the pr essures of increasing domestic costs and direct competition with imports from china180 on the other hand the american institute for international steel representing importers and the chinese government both voiced support for the decision an offi cial statement of the chinese ministry of commerce noted

stified that although the industry had recovered significantly in terms of profita bility much of the price increase recorded since the termination of br oad safeguards in 2003 was dr iven by higher costs of inputs as this crs report s detailed above they ave rred that elimination of the remedy duties could lead to flood of impor ts in the future particularly if the chinese markets growth slowed and subject countries redirected product to the us market uswa president leo gerard argued in addition that current high steel prices were needed to support contributions negotiated by the union to

representatives of the six largest comp anies producing motor vehicles in the united states countered the steel companie s testimony the companies testifying were the socalled detroit three general motors ford and daimlerchrysler and the three leading japaneseowned produ cers toyota honda and nissan they argued that after up to 15 years it was time to sunset these remedy tariffs especially in view of the current prof itability of the steel industry in its determination the itc in 42 vot generally agreed with the automotive companies the majority maintained in part that in justintime motor vehicle manufacturing environment long steel supply lines were questionable economic practice and therefore threat of massive imports was unlikely to recur in the canadian case the majority felt that given the high level of integration within the auto industry on both sides of the border and the existence of longterm supply contracts big increase in imports from that source was also unlikely in all but two cases the tariffs were lifted however the majority kept the remedy duties in place on imports from korea and germany because the major companies in question posco korea and thyssenkrupp ger many maintained us domestic steelmaking operations had c ontinued to import and would be likely to increase imports substantially if duties were lifted the two commissioners who voted to retain the remedy duties said that all subject imports s hould be cumulated they felt therefore that revoking duties on some corrosionresistant steel imports would encourage shifts in the world market and general rise in us imports of the subject products to the detriment of domestic producers there was such split on the itc regarding cuttolength plate imports by unanimous vote the itc revoked these tari ffs in view of the continuing high prices of steel plate the itc did not accept the producers argument that new increase in plate imports was foreseeably likely the itc did not believe that in

mathematical technique applied to imported products being i nvestigated in original ad cases annual administrative reviews and fiveyear sunset cases in calculating ad duties which by wto rules must be
