and related issues summary the increasing popularity of breastfeeding has focused attention on how the law facilitates or discourages the practice one issue that has arisen involves breastfeeding mothers and jury duty and whether breastfeeding mother may receive an excuse or deferral from compulsory jury duty at the present time there is federa l legislation on the subject although congress has considered and adopted other legislation concerning certain breastfeeding issues by contrast several states have enacted legislation to excuse or defer jury duty for breastfeeding mothers either speci fically or more ge nerally under family friendly jury duty legislation family frie ndly jury legislation varies in scope but it generally though not always is suffi ciently expansive to cover breastfeeding mothers court rules concerning breastfeeding mothers and jury duty vary widely california has adopted uniform statewide rule however fede ral district courts have not adopted standard ru or practices likewise state and local courts may have specific rules or very different rules on breastfeeding mothers and jury duty the fact that state court system or single court does not have law rule or formally written procedure does not nece ssarily mean that breastfeeding mother will be compelled to serve on jury it appears that general medical exception from jury duty may be applicable to breastfeeding mothers in some instances and local practice and custom may influence an excuse or deferral from jury duty it appears that many of the decisions concerni ng nursing mothers excuse or deferral from jury duty are handled on caseby case basis by the individual courtshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32928contents state laws permitting breastfeeding mothers to have jury duty excused or

the current time one states legislature is considering bill which if enacted would impact breastfeeding mothers and thei r jury duty responsibilities the bill is cited and summarized below however it should be consider ed as it is early in the state legislative sessions that additiona l bills may be subsequently introduced wyoming wy hb 105 2007 is comprehensive legislative initiative dealing with

provision in their jury plan to excuse or defer jury duty for persons caring for child or children under the age of ten it ppears that the rules vary among the federal district courts including even among those located within the same state for example the us district court fo r the central district of california has rule concerning individual requests for ex cuse or deferment from jury duty this rule provides an excuse for httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32928crs6 9 general order number 998 random selection of grand and petit jurors 2c individual request for excuse or deferment oct 1 1999 10 plan

2 excuses on individual requestpersons having active care and custody of child or children under 14 years of age whose health andor safety would be jeopardized by their absence for jury service or person who is essential to the care of an aged or infirm person9 in contrast the us district court for th northern district of california provides an excuse upon the request of sole caretaker of preschool child or of an aged or disabled person and not otherwise employed10 in further contrast is the rule of the us district court for the southern district of califor nia which provides an excuse for 2 any person having active care and custody of child or children under 10 years of age whose health andor safety would be jeopardized by absence of such person for jury service or person who is essential to the care of aged or infirm persons11 these variations illustrate how different district courts in the same state handle the family care issue under different rules while it appears that breastfeeding mother might be excused from jury duty in these federal district courts the term breastfeeding is not used and the language of the rules is different it is possible that the rules could be interpreted differe ntly in various breastfeeding circumstances chart comparison of the ways in which different state jurisdictions deal with breastfeeding mothers and jury duty the following chart compares the ways in which states currently deal with the issue of breastfeeding and jury duty some states have enacted legislation which provides specific excuse or deferral from jury duty for breastfeeding mother other states have enacted more general family friendly legislation that excuses prospective juror from duty when faced with various family responsibilities depending upon the language of the statute and its implementation such legislation may or may not excuse or defer breastfeeding mothers from jury duty legislation is currently pending in wyoming to legislatively respond to the i ssue of breastfeeding and jury duty california has specific statewide court rule which deals with the issue of breastfeeding mothers and jury duty it is likely that local and state courts where there is uniform rule may have varied and not nece ssarily implemented consistent policies in dealing with breastfeeding mothers and jury duty responsibilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32928crs7
