iran classified by richard olson ambassador reason 14b d 1 snf summary in february 17 meeting uae foreign minister sheikh abdullah bin zayed nahyan abz discussed iran with fourmember congressional delegation led by chairwoman nita lowey of the house appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations abz told the codel the nuclear issue is only one aspect of the iran problem and that irans regional meddling was serious concern he pledged the uaes backing as the us rallies support for new sanctions but questioned whether they would achieve the desired effect abz noted the uaes growing concern that gulf allies were being shut out of iran sanctions planning end summary irans reactors and reach 2 snf abz began by expressing pride in the usuae 123 agreement and the bilateral relationship generally according to abz the 123 is powerful example for the region and provides transparent alternative to irans nuclear model the uae views iran as huge problem that goes far beyond nuclear capabilities iranian support for terrorism is broader than just hamas and hizballah iran has influence in afghanistan yemen kuwait bahrain the eastern province of ksa and africa abz mentioned nigeria specifically iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and venezuelan president hugo chavez have close cooperative ties if iran acquires nuclear weapons the expeditionary aspect of its foreign policy will become ever more challenging for neighboring states possibility and futility of sanctions 3 snf lowey asked what abz thought about tougher sanctions against iran and how the uae can help with china abz said the us and its allies have to decide how to stop iran and that the uae was surprised at the chinese attitude abz noted the emiratis and the saudis have spoken to the chinese and the uae expressed willingness to expand its energy ties note abz seemed to be indicating that this was intended as carrot but he acknowledged the difficulty of supplanting an iranchina trade relationship that reached 50 billion last year end note 4 snf abz urged quick action on tough new sanctions the uae is conscientious in its efforts to enforce existing unsc sanctions but the iranians have been able to find other routes bypassing uae ports to import what they need abz predicted that smart and swift implementation of new sanctions could still be ineffective but said that we must try gulf neighbors feeling left out 5 snf abz highlighted growing belief the uae and the gcc are being left out of our iran sanctions consultations abz told chairwoman lowey that the p51 negotiations with iran should be expanded to included the gcc abz said there is trust barrier to full gcc support for us policy as there is deep suspicion that the us is proceeding without consulting gulf allies 6 snf abz raised as he likes to do regularly the 2005 eu package offer to iran that was briefed to the uae by the iranians not the us or another ally things have improved since then but we still need some serious trust building between the us the eu and the gcc on this issue the dcm reminded abz and the codel that there are extensive and privileged communications between the uae and the usg on policy towards iran and on sanctions planning abz acknowledged there was trust from the uae but the rest of the gcc had continuing concerns your problem today is to fix your relations with the gcc quickly few countries in the region are already dealing with iran as if they had the bomb 7 snf abz said gcc states are left wondering what will happen to them in any deal the us and iran reach through back channel conversations he compared the current multilateral conversations over irans nuclear program with negotiations over north koreas nuclear program asking why north koreas neighbors are part of the six party negotiations but the gcc is not equally involved in similar conversations about and with iran what if scenarios 8 snf in response to questions from members of congress abz said that if iran goes nuclear others in the region will move forward on the same track and the nuclear nonproliferation treaty will completely break down he said crisis or confrontation in the region would create oil supply problems worldwide 14 million barrels day pass through the strait of hormuz that said he noted that the us and uae militaries have plans to keep hormuz clear 9 s abz concluded the meeting with soliloquy on the importance of successful peace process between israel and its neighbors as perhaps the most effective way of reducing irans regional influence 10 sbu members of congress in
