of 1997 discussion paper 1 introduction the purpose of this discussion paper is to review briefly the assumptions on sulfur emissions in the is92 ipcc scenarios advances in knowledge and modeling of future sulfur emission scenarios since is92 as well as to initiate discussion on how to incorporate future sulfur emissions trends into the new ipcc emissions scenarios the present draft will be revised based on feedback received within the members of the ipcc writing team as well as additional outside experts 2 sulfur emissions in is92 the treatment of sulfur emissions in the is92 scenarios was comprehensive in addition to the dominant energy sector emissions also sulfur emissions from industrial processes and landuse changes biomass burning and constant flow of natural sources were included in the scenarios 1990 base year values in is92 were as follows in mts million tons or tg elemental sulfur to obtain weight as so2 multiply by 2 energy sector 65 mts other industry 8 mts biomass burning 2 mts natural 22 mts total 98 mts these global base year values are well within the range given by global sulfur emission inventories of 4 to 45 mts natural sources and 65 to 90 mts anthropogenic sources in 1990 ipcc 1995135141 comparison of 1990 base year sulfur emission values from number of scenarios and integrated assessment models is enclosed as attachment however as observed in the evaluation of the is92 scenarios alcamo et 1995 regional sulfur emissions assumed in is92 eg for china are much more uncertain there is for instance up to factor two difference between regionalized estimated of global inventories and aggregates of national and regional emissions inventories thus the good agreement of base year values of is92 at the global level masks important differences and uncertainties at the regional level first important task for the new ipcc scenarios is therefore to update the regional sulfur emissions baseline values with the results of latest regional sulfur emissions inventories such inventories are available for europe through emep and corinair north america napap and more recently also for asia eg the worldbank sulfur project foell et 1995 improved modeling of regional sulfur emissions and deposition ie impacts patterns would also require redefinition of the world regions as used in the is92 scenario series for instance canada is included in the region oecdeurope and the is92 region south asia includes both the indian subcontinent as well as indonesia their important differences in resource endowments lead to different patterns of sulfur emissions their differing predominant weather patterns and distinct ecosystems lead to differing acidic deposition patterns and impacts both factors preclude their aggregation into one single regional model active inputs from representatives of all respective modeling communities regional acidification impacts regional climate modelers energy systems analysts will be sought on this issue and lessons learned within emf activities m schlesinger on appropriate sulfur regionalization 6 world regions will be extremely valuable concerning future emissions of sulfur the is92 scenarios project global anthropogenic emissions of between 150 to 200 mts by 2050 and between 140 to 230 mts by 2100 in the high growth cases and of around 8090 and 60 mts in the two low scenarios is92c and is92d by 2050 and 2100 respectively the is92 scenario evaluation alcamo et 1995281282 concluded that the is92 scenario series only partially reflect recent legislation to reduce sulfur emissions eg the amendments to the clean air act in the us or the second european sulfur protocol hence particularly regional sulfur emissions in oecd countries projected in is92 are much higher than more recent scenarios taking account these legislative changes as also discussed by ipcc 1995155156 for instance the recent scenarios of the commission of the european communities ec 1996 indicate that sulfur emissions by 2020 will be between 64 to 77 percent below 1990 emissions levels or between less than 2 to 3 mts compared to 8 in 1990 for comparison the is92 scenarios project for oecd europe including canada sulfur emissions between 84 is92a and is92b and 117 all other scenarios mts by 2020 ie between 2 to 30 percent lower than in 1990 12 mts in addition integrated assessment models are increasingly able to model in greater detail driving forces of sulfur emissions as well as acidification impacts cf discussion below these model simulations suggest that particularly in asia acidification impacts would require substantial sulfur emission control measures already much earlier than 2050 the resulting global sulfur emissions are substantially lower than suggested in the is92 series typically in the range between 20 to 80 mts by 2050 and between 20 to 120 mts by 2100 comparison of global sulfur emissions scenarios with and without specific sulfur control assumptions in enclosed as attachment 3 whats new since is92 scientific front the importance of aerosols including those from sulfur emissions is by now widely recognized and considerable progress has been made to quantify their effect on regional climate both in large gcm simulations as well as in more simplified integrated assessment models eg magiccs scengen module needs checking for details with mike hulme or michael schlesingers work within the emf current status uncertain the importance of sulfur emissions as input to climate models is therefore larger than ever as result of major world bank study on acid rain in asia also improved national and regional sulfur emissions inventories have become available foell et 1995 improved emissions inventories outside north america europe including the european part of the former ussr and asia excluding oceania for which only sparse data seems to be available have not been made available since publication of is92 as result models and scenarios continue to rely on estimates largely based on approximate mass and sulfur balance approaches in the world regions for the middle east southern africa and latin america cf discussion of data availability below similarly acidification impact models are increasingly being refined for regions outside oecd in particular for asia acidification impact studies for unabated sulfur emissions of coal intensive business as usual scenarios indicate exceedance of critical loads of up to factor 10 already within the next three to four decades amann et 1995 with enormous impacts on natural ecosystems as well as important foodcrops fischer et 1996 increasingly also energy sector and integrated assessment models link regional acidification models with simplified climate models enabling joint analysis of sulfur and climate policies and impacts examples include the image model posch et 1996 and the iiasa integrated assessment model rogner and nakicenovic 1996 that are linked with the acidification model rains for europe and asia the aim morita et 1994 model for asia or for north america these models extend earlier energy sector models that dealt with comparative costs assessment of isolated sulfur and carbon reductions and joint mitigation respectively such as the oecd green model complainville and martins 1994 the state of knowledge of joint benefits of sulfur and carbon emission reductions was reviewed in the 1995 ipcc wg iii report ipcc 1996 215218 and is expanding rapidly 4 data requirements the most obvious data requirements concern of course comprehensiveness of sulfur emissions by major source category anthropogenic and natural energy sector and other industrial sources here the data model of the is92 scenarios appears appropriate and would only require reassessment in view of most recent data concerning regional emissions particularly in china where data uncertainties seem largest more difficult question concerns spatial disaggregation independent from the question of which formal models are being used to check for scenario consistency the outmost spatial detail currently in driving force models with global coverage available is at the level of world regions typically around 10 but going up to around 20 world regions both climate as well as acidification models require inputs at finer spatial resolution it is unclear at present what would constitute minimum or desirable level of spatial disaggregation for the variety of user communities of new ipcc scenarios existing model links like with the rains model could be used in some regions like europe and asia to generate spatially highly disaggregated sulfur emission and deposition maps as inputs for climate models and for impact assessment studies eg for agricultural crop yield models in their most advanced versions the model links even incorporate regionalized differential growth trends and thus improve on the standard practice of renormalizing base year spatial emission and deposition patterns linearly with particular sulfur emissions scenario for regions where similar links are unavailable more simplified procedures will need to be devised keeping in mind the overall tight time frame of the scenario exercise two data sets are there more appear available for regionalized sulfur emission patterns the oak ridge gaia data set spatial resolution and the spiro et 1992 data set spatial resolution one degree by one degree an open but extremely critical issue remaining to be resolved is to identify mechanisms and responsible groups that could provide the link between the spatial resolution of the new ipcc scenarios sulfur emissions to whatever final geographical scales required by impact assessment and climate models 5 scenarios and sulfur policies there are two major sets of driving force variable that influence future sulfur emissions 1 level and structure of energy supply and end use and 2 degree of sulfur control policies assumed because of the dominance of energy related sulfur emissions they should receive particular attention in the new scenarios industrial sources could be included in the scenarios with much simpler driving force model eg coupling to industrial output ceteris paribus highest sulfur emissions occur in scenarios of high demand growth rapid resource depletion limited technological change and absence of sulfur control policies outside oecd countries in terms of energy supply structures such scenarios imply massive use of coal including synfuel production typical examples would include the is92e and is92f scenarios up to ca 2050 sulfur emissions in such scenarios roughly grow in line with fossil fuel use and resulting carbon emissions ie roughly constant sulfur to carbon emissions ratio post 2050 still in absence of sulfur control policies growth rates of sulfur emissions start to fall short of growth in fossil fuel use due to the internal technology logic of synfuel production synfuel production requires prior coal conversion eg gasification and removal of sulfur prior to further conversion eg to synliquids ceteris paribus therefore sulfur emissions relative to those of carbon decline sulfur emissions are lower in scenarios with 1 lower demand 2 more ample resource availability especially for natural gas 3 higher rates of technological change especially for nonfossil energy technologies and 4 extent and timing of direct sulfur control policies especially outside oecd countries itself function of projected impacts like acidification and finally 5 level of other environmental control measures and valuation of environmental goods eg sulfur emissions are also lower in scenarios imposing limits on ghg emissions next to environmental impacts and policies there are also other key relationships that need to be considered for the formulation of future sulfur scenarios for instance the literature on environmental kuznets curves cf eg world bank 1992 or iiasawec 1995 argues that with increasing affluence and valuation of environmental goods sulfur emissions decline this hypothesis is corroborated by both longitudinal and crosssectional empirical data thus in the process of industrialization and economic development emissions rise initially pass through maximum say at income levels around 2000 capita and decline thereafter with rising per capita incomes and the resulting preference of cleaner enduse fuels valuation of clean environments etc scenario taxonomy along the dimensions of demand resource availability and technological change in any case is necessary to respond to the critique on the is92 series that these important driving forces were not varied appropriately to reflect both uncertainty as well as new scientific knowledge and empirical evidence they form part of the overall scenario design process and the scenario storylines and need not to be addressed specifically in the work on sulfur emissions separate sulfur stories could be developed in addition based on various relationships between sulfur emissions and levels of affluence industrial structure etc within the overall framework of the scenario storylines here sulfur emissions would be part of other environmental policies eg on water quality urban traffic related pollutants etc that form integral part of particular scenario storylines key variable remains the timing and extent of sulfur control policies to be assumed for the new scenarios first of all the scenarios need to reflect changes in actual policies implemented as noted above is92 did not take full account of recent environmental legislation in both north america and the second european sulfur protocol secondly the sulfur policies to be assumed need to reflect recent scientific findings in particular the very large local and regional impacts on agricultural crops and ecosystems of unabated high sulfur emission scenarios particularly in asia therefore all scenarios should assume faster and deeper reductions in sulfur emissions outside oecd countries than were assumed for is92 in light of this recent scientific evidence the exact timing and extent of such sulfur reduction measures could then be scenario dependent also specific reference to individual policy measures would need to be made to avoid normative policy elements or recommendations in the scenarios as reduction profiles could be adopted from existing sulfur reduction scenarios in the scientific literaursement by ue action cost for the lecturer but for this i hope to have an answer as soon as possible thank you for your answer best regards im
