considered the decision more proof that one country two systems model would not work for taiwan details of the decision in part the differences in the response to the npcscs decision may be attributed to the perceived ambiguity of its wording which allows for differing interpretations of its content however the apparent ambiguity of the decisions wording might also be the result of the npcscs

more ope n to interpretation regarding both the chief executive and legco elections of 2012 the decision states that appropriate amendments may be emphasis added made to the specific method of selection however the original chinese keyi zuo chu shidang xiugai could be construed either as the npcsc granting hong kong permission to make ppropriate amendments or that hong kong may propose appropriat amendments without implying that the amendments would be necessarily accepted by the npcsc similarly regarding the chief executive election of 2017 and subsequent legco elections the decision states it may be implemented by the method of universal suffrage keyi shixing you puxuan chansheng banfa but the language is subject to the same ambiguity of interpretation between the

decision hong kongs advancement towards democracy faces three critical issu first the status of legco s functional constituencies will need to be resolved some hong kong politicians and analysts maintain that the functional constituencies are incompatible with the c oncept of universal suffrage and they will eventually have to be eliminated other hong kong politicians and analysts as well as the npcsc hold that functional constituencies are not irreconcilable with universal suffrage and that they represent sectors of the community which are considered

unavailable under pl 110161 congress has appropriated 15 million for democracy and rule of law programs in th peoples republic of china hong kong and taiwan specific amount was allocated to hong kongto hong kongs economic stability and deve lopment wide range of proposals have already been offered on how to handle the functional constituencies including changing the number of functional constituencies and altering their voter eligibility requirements so that every hong kong voter could vote for at least one functional constituency legco member but finding suitable co mpromise may prove to be difficult second the composition of the nominatin g committee for the chief executive and the requirements necessary to officially be nominated are possibly the greatest challenges facing the direct election of the chief executive currently to be nominated person must receive the support of at least 100 of the 800 members of the largely appointed election committee there have been calls to increase the number of members on the committee by including more people and in particular the elected members of hong kongs district councils however addi ng more people to the committee would either increase the possible number of nominees ssuming the 100 votes requirement was kept or would necessitate changing the numbe r of votes required to be nominated third possibly the greatest challenge will be finding proposed set of amendments for the elections in 2012 and 2017 that will recei ve the support of at least twothirds of legco proposal in 2005 to amend the election process for the 2007 chief executive election and the 2008 legco election failed when coalition of the various pro democracy parties and the liberal party vot ed against the proposed amendments because they were seen as being too modest22 in 2008 and beyond the hong kong government will need to develop proposed legislation that provides enough democracy to obtain support from sufficient number of legco mbers associated with the parties that opposed the 2005 pr oposal wit hout losing too many legco members associated with parties such as dab that supported the 2005 proposal implications for congress support for the democratization of hong kong has been an element of us foreign policy for over 15 years the hong kong policy act of 1992 p l 102383 states support for democratization is fundamental principle of united states foreign policy as such it naturally applies to united states policy toward hong kong this will remain equally true af ter june 30 1997 congress might act to assist hong kongs progress towards universal suffrage and democracy by closely monitoring the devel opment of appropriate amendments to the 2012 election process for both the chief executive and legco congress might also encourage the state department to provide greater assistance to its democracypromotion efforts in hong kong in fy2006 the stat departments human rights and democracy fund allocated 450000 to project in hong kong designed to strengthen political parties and civil society organizations23 in addition congress could opt to pursue greater contact with legco via provisions set out in section 105 of the ushong kong policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22787crs7 act finally congress could include language in suitable legislation to reactivate the section 301 provision of the ushong kong policy
