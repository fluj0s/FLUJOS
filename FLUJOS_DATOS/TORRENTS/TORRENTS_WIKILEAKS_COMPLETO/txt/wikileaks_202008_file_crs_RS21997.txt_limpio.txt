tankers jonathan medalia foreign affairs defense and trade division december 19 2006 abstract while much attention has been focused on threats to maritime security posed by cargo container ships terrorists could also attempt to use oil tankers to stage an attack if they were able to place an atomic bomb in tanker and detonate it in us port they would cause massive destruction and might halt crude oil shipments worldwide for some time detecting bomb in tanker would be difficult congress may consider various options to address this threat s 12 targeting terrorists more effectively act of 2005 included tanker security initiative sec 325 order code rs21997 updated december 19 2006 port and maritime security potential for terrorist nuclear attack using oil tankers jonathan medalia specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division summary while much attention has been focused on threats to maritime security posed by httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21997 cargo container ships terrorists could also attempt to use oil tankers to stage an attack if they were able to place an atomic bomb in tanker and detonate it in us port they would cause massive destruction and might halt crude oil shipments worldwide for some time detecting bomb in tanker would be difficult congress may consider various options to address this threat s 12 targeting terrorists more effectively act of 2005 included tanker security initiative sec 325 this report will be updated as needed introduction the attacks of september 11 2001 heightened interest in port and maritime security much of this interest has focused on cargo container ships because of concern that terrorists could use containers to transport weapons into the united states yet only small fraction of the millions of cargo containers entering the country each year is inspected some fear that containerborne atomic bomb detonated in us port could wreak economic as well as physical havoc robert bonner former head of customs and border protection cbp in the department of homeland security dhs has argued that such an attack would lead to halt to container traffic worldwide for some time bringing the world economy to its knees stephen flynn retired coast guard commander and an expert on maritime security at the council on foreign relations holds similar view1 while container ships accounted for 304 of vessel calls to us ports in 2005 other ships carried crude oil 129 dry bulk cargo 187 and vehicles 60 among 1 us department of the treasury us customs commissioner robert bonner speech before the center for strategic and international studies washington dc january 17 2002 and stephen flynn america the vulnerable how our government is failing to protect us from terrorism new york harpercollins 2004 p 83 crs2 other things2 these ships merit attention as well because terrorists will look for the weak link the 911 commission stressed the importance of balanced approach to maritime security3 to this end this report focuses on the threat of terrorist nuclear attack using oil tanker ships this threat is of particular interest because the middle east is the chief source of antius terrorism background oil shipments from the middle east crude oil and other petroleum products account for almost all export earnings of many middle eastern nations4 in turn 288 of net us crude oil imports in september 2006 came from the middle east5 crude oil from the middle east went to 30 us ports in 2003 those handling the most oil were blaine wa segundo long beach angeles and richmond ca corpus christi freeport galveston houston port arthur and texas city tx baton rouge gramercy lake charles morgan city and new orleans pascagoula ms mobile wilmington and paulsboro nj6 crude oil from the middle east is typically shipped to the united states in httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21997 supertankers very large crude carriers vlccs and ultra large crude carriers ulccs their size is measured in deadweight tons dwt the weight of the stores fuel and cargo they can carry one dwt is 2240 lb while definitions vary slightly vlccs can carry about 200000 to 300000 dwt and ulccs can carry more than 300000 dwt crude oil accounts for almost all of the deadweight tonnage of such ships representative ulcc was 60 meters wide and 350 meters long and had draft depth below the waterline of 22 meters they are the largest ships ever built the interior of tanker is divided into multiple storage tanks both the coast guard and the navy stated that they do not have responsibility for or authority over security of foreignflagged vessels at foreign ports7 nor do other american forces security of foreign ports rests with foreign governments 2 us department of transportation maritime

the port and monthly data from these tables for crs 7 source discussions with navy and coast guard officers november 2004 crs3 staging terrorist nuclear attack using tankers the simplest type of atomic bomb and by far the easiest to fabricate is gunassembly bomb in which one mass of uranium highly enriched in the fissile isotope 235 highly enriched uranium or heu is shot down tube into another mass of heu forming critical mass and causing nuclear explosion the hiroshima bomb was of this type its designers had such confidence in the design that it was not tested before use this bomb had an explosive yield of 15 kilotons equivalent to 15000 tons of tnt excluding the bombs outer casing fins and fuses this device was 6 feet long and about 6 inches in diameter and weighed about 1000 pounds8 some items loaded onto large cargo ships are of similar or greater size and weight it might be possible to make lighter gunassembly bomb to stage nuclear attack using tanker terrorists would need to acquire nuclear device9 and smuggle it or key components onto ship their ability to accomplish this latter task would likely depend on their ability to circumvent local security on the reliability of security personnel in oilexporting countries such as saudi arabia kuwait and algeria and on the reliability of the ships officers and crew terrorists might seek to place nuclear device inside one of tankers oil tanks which would require sealing and cushioning the bomb and possibly attaching it to the tank wall or in dry space on httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21997 the ship or in blister attached to the ship underwater remotely detonating bomb inside an oil tank or underwater might be difficult it might not be possible to attach wires leading out to dry spaces or to send an electromagnetic signal eg cell phone call through water or oil to the bomb detonating the bomb with timer would run the risk of the ship not being at the target at the specified time overcoming these challenges might be within the ability of terrorist group resourceful enough to acquire an atomic bomb terrorists might also smuggle bomb onto ship at sea as discussed later potential targets terrorists could be expected to select as their target port that handled large volume of oil and other goods and that had denselypopulated area that tankers passed on their way through harbor to an unloading terminal various cities worldwide meet these criteria if terrorists sought major economic damage while minimizing loss of life they might target the louisiana offshore oil port or loop the only us deepwater oil port that can handle fully loaded supertankers loop 18 miles off the louisiana coast handles about 10 of us crude oil imports the panama canal might be another potential economic target detecting an atomic bomb in tanker some means of detecting atomic bombs in tanker would fail especially for bomb inside an oil tank gamma rays essentially highenergy xrays are used to create xraytype pictures of the contents of cargo containers but tankers huge mass of oil and steel would prevent gamma rays from traveling the width of tanker neutrons may be used to detect fissile material neutrons of the appropriate energy level cause such material to fission producing neutrons and gamma rays that can be detected the hydrogen atoms of crude oil however would block neutrons from penetrating other candidate techniques include chemical sampling of oil for traces of extraneous material and preparing an acoustic profile of ship when 8 thomas cochran william arkin and milton hoenig nuclear weapons databook volume i us nuclear forces and capabilities cambridge ma ballinger 1984 p 32 9 crs report rl32595 nuclear terrorism brief review of threats and responses by jonathan medalia discusses how terrorists might acquire nuclear device crs4 known to be clean to compare with profile taken as the ship nears port the vast amount of oil in supertanker works against the former technique the complex configuration of tanks on tanker works against the latter more remote possibility muon detection might work if daunting technical challenges could be overcome10 securing tankers the difficulty of detecting bomb aboard tanker underscores the importance of keeping bombs off tankers securing tankers at loading terminals would likely involve security perimeter including underwater and measures to ensure personnel reliability items brought on ship would have to be screened national nuclear security administration program second line of defense screens people and baggage for fissile material similar technology might help secure tankers securing tankers in port might not be sufficient if terrorists could smuggle bomb onto ship at sea it may be possible to improve security by using surveillance aircraft or satellites security may be greater issue as tankers slow to navigate straits or approach port several issues arise 1 would shippers let crew spend time to upgrade security beyond current levels vlccs have small crews perhaps 25 to 40 people who may have time for added tasks 2 if intelligence data indicated plot to board httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21997 tanker at sea to place bomb could warning be passed without compromising us intelligence capabilities 3 this scenario would require the connivance of the entire crew or silencing those who opposed the plot screening for personnel reliability may be the only defense against this prospect potential oversight questions and options for congress oversight questions possible oversight questions include the following how does the administration view the potential for terrorists to use tanker for nuclear attack to what extent has the administration considered this threat in planning for port and maritime security if considered serious threat what measures is the administration implementing to respond to it when will they be in place how much funding is programmed for them over the next few years which areas of detection technology may merit development which executive branch office has overall responsibility for examining or addressing this potential threat what other executive offices have responsibilities in this area is there adequate coordination among them 10 muons are subatomic particles produced when cosmic rays from space strike atoms in the upper atmosphere some 10000 muons per minute strike each square meter of earth they can penetrate many meters of rock their path is bent slightly in proportion to the density and atomic number number of protons in the nucleus of the material alamos national laboratory has conducted experiments to determine if muons can be used to detect fissile material in cargo containers the technique involves placing flatplate detector above and below the container to measure how much the paths of individual muons are bent detectors would have to be scaled up immensely to go from container to vlcc detection could be timeconsuming the level of detail increases with number of muons which increases with time see brian fishbine muon radiography detecting nuclear contraband alamos research quarterly spring 2003 crs5 potential options congress might consider options such as the following to further explore the threat discussed in this report clarify federal responsibility for tanker security by requiring lead federal agency for tanker security and making more explicit the responsibilities of various federal agencies involved in tanker security create tanker security initiative tsi analogous to the container security initiative for improving containerized cargo security11 tsi might set security standards for tankers that transport oil to us ports and for the ports where they load tankers not meeting the standards or that come from ports not meeting the standards could be denied entry to us ports establishing such regime would undoubtedly require negotiations with other countries see legislative activities below ensure that tankers are focus of maritime domain awareness which refers to surveillance and communication systems that would httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21997 permit us officials to have comprehensive understanding at any given moment of the location and identity of ships at sea assure sufficient us intelligence assets are focused on the threat and possible indications of preparations for such an attack terrorists seeking to acquire or build bomb and smuggle it onto tanker would need to go through certain steps similarly terrorist bomb placed inside tank of crude oil might have certain signatures such as way to detonate the bomb the intelligence community could analyze such steps and signatures and be alert to signs of the most critical ones determine whether funding is adequate for technologies that hold some prospect of detecting an atomic bomb aboard tanker keep oil tankers away from us ports by promoting the construction of more offshore ports like loop improve international cooperation existing international agreements and organizations that might focus on tanker security include agreements for countering narcotics crime and piracy the international maritime organization shipping associations and interpol and the international ship and port facility security code these efforts could supplement the proliferation security initiative psi multilateral effort for interdicting ships at sea that are suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction ships available for psi missions might respond to indications of tanker security problems at sea12 the united states could pursue increased bilateral cooperation with oilexporting states and countries under whose flags tankers are registered potential measures include improved 11 for more on the container security initiative see crs report rl31733 op cit 12 see crs report rs21881 proliferation security initiative psi by sharon squassoni crs6 perimeter security at oilloading terminals and more rigorous background screening and training of port workers and tanker crew members should congress conclude that proactive steps should be taken in this area the issues of who should pay and how funds should be collected would arise costs could be covered by general revenues alternatives would be to charge fee on ships landing oil in the united states or to impose tax on crude oil or petroleum products consumed in the united states congress may also wish to consider whether the issues discussed here might apply to other types of ships such as those for carrying cars or dry bulk goods legislative activities on january 24 2005 s 12 targeting terrorists more effectively act of 2005 was introduced and was referred to the senate committee on foreign relations section 325 provides for tanker security initiative under which the secretary of homeland security shall establish tanker security initiative to promulgate and enforce standards and carry out activities to ensure that tanker vessels that transport oil natural gas or other materials are not used by terrorists or as carriers of weapons of mass destruction as part httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21997 of this initiative the secretary may develop standards to prevent terrorists from placing weapons of mass destruction on tankers develop detection equipment and inspection procedures conduct rd on sensors to detect nuclear device on tanker and aid foreign countries in carrying out provisions of this initiative the legislation would also require the secretary to submit report to congress on terrorism risks posed by tankers means of combating this risk and proposed budget to carry out this initiative this legislation was not reported from committee should the 110th congress undertake further consideration of the potential tankernuclear threat issues that may garner attention include 1 how might port security grant programs enhance tanker security 2 could imaging or radiation detection systems available now or deployable in the near future significantly augment tanker security against this threat 3 if so is it worth the money to deploy them now or would it be preferable to wait until more advanced systems were available 4 if not does the current rd investment strategy consider tanker security and what detection programs might be developed to do so these questions might be raised as congress oversees implementation of the safe port act pl 109347
