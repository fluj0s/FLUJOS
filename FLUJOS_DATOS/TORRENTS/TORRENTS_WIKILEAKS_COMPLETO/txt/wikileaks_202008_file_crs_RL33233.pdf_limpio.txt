of the philippines rp maintain close ties stemming from the us colonial period 18981946 although the united states closed its military bases in the philippines in 1992 subic naval base and clark air base cooperation in counterterrorism efforts has brought the two treaty allies closer together during president gloria macapagal arroyos state visit to washington in may 2003 the bush administration pledged increased military assistance and designated the republic of the philippines as major nonnato ally 1 the main pillars of the bilateral relationship are the usrp security alliance counterterrorism cooperation trade and investment ties democratic values and extensive peopletopeople contacts filipinoamericans number approximately three million making them the second largest asianamerican group in the united states and comprise the largest number of immigrants in the us armed forces an estimated 250000 americans live in the philippines 2 despite general agreement on the importance of usrp relations and the war on terrorism bilateral frictions occasionally have arisen as philippine foreign policy has become more independent and assertive regarding rp sovereignty and selfinterests or driven by domestic political pressures furthermore areas of cooperation have narrowed somewhat since 2001 according to some analysts manila has begun to define its security needs in more multilateral rather than bilateral context while the united st ates government has been accused of viewing the philippines and the southeast asia region largely through prism of terrorism 3

the philippines afp in counterterrorism efforts supporting the peace process in mindanao supporting afp modernization and administrative reform promoting broadbased economic growth and helping the philippines to develop stable and responsive democratic institutions the united states may have reached crossroads where it faces fundamental policy questions regarding its policies toward the philippines these include whether to continue current levels of military and development assistance despite unabated political violence and instability whether to press for more aggressive role for us military forces in counterterrorism operations despite the potential for aggravating tensions in mindanao and other regions in the south or provoking antius sentiment among some groups and whether to assume role in the milfrp government peace process despite the lack of clear outcome some policy makers have questioned the effectiveness of seven years of significantly increased us assistance to the

philippines would help the afp to fight terrorist and separatist groups as well as promote democratic principles in the military some observers contend that the united states should pay more attention to the underlying causes of terrorism and separatist insurgency in the philippines such as the poverty and official corruption they advocate increasing funding for us development and other aid programs especially in muslim areas of mindanao that help provide for economic development education government accountability and conflict mitigation programs they also support us military involvement in local infrastructure projects civic action programs the united states has an interest in promoting stable and effective democratic governance in the philippines while filipinos enjoy high degree of civil liberty political leaders are freely scrutinized and elections are largely free corruption political violence and the lack of civilian control over the military continue to

individuals linked to leftist groups have risen since gloria macapagalarroyo assumed the presidency in 2001 the united states government has attempted to help address the problems of corruption and extrajudicial killings largely through its foreign assistance activities us programs related to political killings include providing additional funding to the philippine commission on human rights training philippine investigators and prosecutors educating military and law enforcement personnel in the areas of human rights and civil liberties supporting judicial system improvements and aiding civil society groups the consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 placed conditions on portion of military assistance in order to help compel the rp government to address this issue some philippine leaders and us policy analysts have called for broader us engagement beyond counterterrorism cooperation in part to counter chinas growing influence in the rp the united states is the largest bilateral source of foreign direct investment and the second largest bilateral provider of official development assistance in the rp after japan the united states remains the rps largest trading partner although bilateral trade contracted slightly in 2007 while rpchina trade continued to expand rapidly when hong kong is included however rpchinahong kong trade now exceeds rpus trade 4 in the past few years china has become major sponsor of infrastructure energy agriculture and mining development in the philippines the rp reportedly is the largest recipient of prc loans in southeast asia

nacionalista party senator loren legarda gen uine opposition coalition and senator manuel mar roxas ii liberal party7 on the one hand rp citizens enjoy high level of political freedom including robust civil society while the legislative and judicial branches exert checks upon the presidency on the other hand philippine politics are plagued by corruption and cronyism and power is concentrated in the hands of entrenched socioeconomic elites one analyst describes the philippines as weak state captured by strong interests 8 another rising concern among some opposition and civil society groups is the growing influence of the philippine security forces in the arroyo administration exemplified by the number of armed forces and police officials appointed to high level positions in government they argue that arroyo has thereby attempted to bolster her strength both within the military itself and visavis opposition groups in return for the militarys support the president has protected the security forces from charges of corruption and human rights abuses9 freedom house characterizes the philippines as partly freeits rating of political rights falling from 3 to 4 on scale of 1 to 7 in

but historically has had difficulty articulating and carrying out broad policy options and programs political parties and groupings tend to be fragmented and shifting driven more by individual personality or geographic and sectoral interests than by unifying ideologies platforms and policy goals the public often elects and places its trust in charismatic leaders who distribute the spoils of

politicallymotivated acts of violence against journalists and other mass media personalities and extrajudicial killings of individuals linked to leftist groups have risen since gloria macapagal arroyo assumed the presidency in 2001 reportedly reaching peak in 2006 according to one estimate 58 journalists reportedly have been killed since 2001 15 many experts attribute these killings to local power struggles rather than to systematic crackdown on media freedom directed by manila in many cases powerful local political families reportedly have targeted journalists or mass media personalities who had either exposed the business practices of these families or threatened their interests by allying with rival families or criticizing local government corruption the police often beholden to local elites have been accused of failing to perform proper investigations while higher levels of government have been blamed for not aggressively pursuing or prosecuting those responsible for the violence16 the communist insurgency has spawned another type of killing since the late 1960s the communist party of the philippines cpp allegedly has developed an extensive array of front groups in rural areas these groups often have operated in close proximity to noncommunist but leftleaning social groups and nongovernmental organizations ngos trying to assist poorer filipinos 17 members of both communist groups and civil society have been the targets of assassination between 2001 and 2007 hundreds of mostly leftist political trade union farmer church and human rights activists reportedly were killed over 800 according to philippine human rights groups however philippine national police task force declared that about three fourths of these killings were nonpolitical in nature 18 some reports have attributed most of these deaths to the armed forces of the philippines experts argue that the afp has been so dedicated to eradicating the cpp and its armed wing the new 13

blamed as well as the notion that the victims were innocent some military officials have responded to allegations with counter claims that the deaths were fabrication of the cpp that political and social organizations of whom many alleged victims were members such as the national democratic front bayan muna and karapatan were fronts for the cpp or that activists were killed as part of cpp intraorganizational purge 20 in 2006 partially in response to outcries from philippine and international human rights groups the catholic church of the philippines and european countries president arroyo created special task force to investigate the extrajudicial killings and invited the united nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions philip alston to conduct fact finding mission the task force melo commission and the special rapporteur released their findings in january 2007 and february 2007 respectively21 both studies implicated the philippine armed forces but not the government they largely rejected the assertions that many leftist activists were linked to the communist party killed by the cpp as part of an internal organizational purge or died in military combat between the afp and the new peoples army in response to recommendations of the melo commission and special rapporteur the arroyo government reportedly has taken major steps to bolster the investigation and prosecution of cases involving unlawful killings and establish procedures to ensure greater accountability in the military and police forces 22 although the number of such deaths has declined some human rights advocates contend that most of the perpetrators of such crimes have remained unpunished23

terrorist and insurgency situation in the southern philippines has become increasingly complex since 2002 when philippine and us forces conducted relatively successful operation against the abu sayyaf terrori st group on basilan island off the southwestern tip of the big southern island of mindanao33 over span of about four years the operation reduced abu sayyafs strength from an estimated 1000 active fighters to an estimated 20040034 see figure 1 map of the philippines however there are other developments of decidedly negative nature that could worsen the overall situation in the southern philippines and even the philippines as whole one worrisome trend is the growing cooperation among abu sayyaf several major moro islamic liberation front milf commands and elements of jemaah islamiyah ji on mindanao ji the southeast asian muslim terrorist organization with ties to qaeda appears to have made mindanao primary base for building up its cadre of terrorists moreover this cooperation among the three groups appears to be transforming mindanao into significant base of operations rather than just site for training and these operations appear to increasingly target the philippines for terrorist attacks related development is the emergence of group of filipino muslim converts in the northern philippines the rajah solaiman movement which is working with abu sayyaf and ji the result has been an increase in terrorist bombings since 2002 both in number and destructiveness and an increase in the level of bombing targets in the northern philippines including manila other obstacles to resolving th conflict in the south include distrust between the mnlf and milf and the factionalism that exists among the two fronts some analysts suggest that if the milf agrees to settlement with the government and ceases to represent more fundamentalist alternative then some of the more radical members and leaders may be compelled to join ji or abu sayyaf 35

states have weakened abu sayyaf on basilan island and in the sulu islands however under the leadership of khadafi janjalani abu sayyaf reoriented its strategy and appears to have gained greater effectiveness as terrorist organization janjalani deemphasized kidnaping for ransom and instead emphasized developing capabilities for urban bombing he improved ties with key military factions of the milf and established cooperation with ji he also reemphasized the islamic nature of abu sayyaf thus even though abu sayyafs armed strength fell from an estimated 1000 in 2002 to 200400 in 2005 the capabilities of the organization may be growing37 khadafi janjalani moved some of abu sayyafs operations and leadership to the mainland of western mindanao there it reportedly established links with elements of ji using several milf base camps where the two groups reportedly engage in joint training with an emphasis on bombmaking carrying urban attacks38 two key ji leaders from indonesia also relocated to jolo island in the sulu island chain southwest of basilan in march and april 2003 abu sayyaf ji and milf cadre carried out bombings in davao on mindanao which killed 48 by mid2005 jemaah

arroyo had schemed to use the memorandum which would require changing the government from unitary form to federal one to amend the philippine constitution which also would open the way for her to remove the ban on seeking second term of office42 the supreme court ruled on october 14 2008 that the memorandum was unconstitutional in an 87 decision the court held that the associative relationship envisaged in the memorandum was illegal in that it implied eventual independence for the bje 43 some analysts suggest that the arroyo administrations lack of legitimacy and preparation on related constitutional issues and had doomed the agreement from the start44 renewed fighting between the afp and milf brok out following the collapse of the accord reportedly resulting in the displacement of

furthermore stronger collaborative relationship has developed between these milf commands and abu sayyaf since 2002 zachary abuza an expert on islamic terrorism in southeast asia has identified four

over strategy toward the milf the arroyo administration has emphasized negotiation the afp has favored more aggressive strategy and is suspicious of negotiated settlement the collaboration between elements of the milf ji and abu sayyaf also suggests that key milf commanders may not support any agreement between the milf leadership and the philippine government that does not include outright independence for the muslim areas of the southern philippines in that scenario the milf could fracture with hardline elements embracing even more closely ji and abu sayyaf which could give rise to greater terrorist threat despite settlement furthermore there is another view that the milf leadership has relationship with hardline milf commands similar to that between the political organization sinn fein and the armed wing of the irish republican army according to this view the milf leadership is acting as front for the hardline commands shielding them from the afp 49

the afps advocacy of militarily aggressive strategy us ambassador to the philippines kristie kenney signaled bush administration support for the 2008 memorandum of agreement when she attended the signing of the accord in kuala lumpur malaysia56 the united states also increased its aid presence in areas of the milf insurgency in september 2007 the bush and arroyo administrations signed an agreement for us peace and development program in mindanao costing 190 m illion over five year period us aid programs in milf areas involve support for schools infrastructure programs and program to reintegrate exmilf fighters into civilian society moreover us military forces in the philippines have extended civic action programs from abu sayyaf conflict areas into milf regions and the us military is negotiating with local leaders to expand these programs 57 deepening us involvement has raised the stakes for the united states especially if the philippinemilf conflict worsens in 2009 if the collapse of the august 2008 memorandum of agreement should lead to complete breakdown of negotiations and the ceasefire the obama administration could be confronted with policy decisions regarding the us role in wider war the afp could be expected to propose increased supplies of us arms and military equipment and likely would argue for more direct us military role the philippine government might change its previous policy of opposition to us military role and encourage us actions against the milf similar to those in the joint operations against abu sayyaf if significant elements of the milf were to move closer to ji and abu sayyaf and if they were able to continue or expand terrorist operations the obama administration could face additional pressures for greater us military involvement given the seemingly intractable nature of the muslim problem in the southern philippines the obama administration faces difficult policy choices one policy dilemma is whether to pressure the philippine government and political establis hment to negotiate an agreement with the milf along the lines of the 2008 memorandum of agreement granting muslim mindanao unique system of autonomy despite likely opposition to such settlement among some groups on both sides of the conflict this scenario appears increasingly plausible given the perceived poor performance of the philippine government and political establishment in dealing with and ultimately rejecting the august 2008 accord group of former us ambassadors to the philippines wrote in the wall street journal asia in september 2008 that the philippine supreme court precipitated true crisis when it is sued temporary restraining order that aborted the memorandum of agreement and that something very much like the recently suspended agreement would have to be part of any future settlement 58 both rp government and milf leaders reportedly have called on the united states to get more directly involved in

whether to continue current levels of military and development assistance to the rp some analysts suggest that although philippine and joint rpus military operations have reduced abu sayyaf armed strength lasting solution in mindanao requires political will and consensus in manila that may be beyond the reach of us assistance programs furthermore us aid efforts that aim to address the economic roots of the problem while they reportedly have garnered goodwill among many local residents may fail to affect larger trends and stem the tide of violence other observers argue that washington needs to become more engaged and provide greater support especially nonmilitary assistance in conflict ridden areas without greater us assistance they contend not only would the risk of violence grow but also us leverage in the philippines may diminish 60 g18g145g146g149g146g153g153g146g151g142g561g5g152g150g150g158g151g146g156g157g561g18g138g155g157g162g561g507g5g18g18g508g561 the cpp has directed an

in the past decade the philippines has pursued stable and friendly political and economic relations with china while relying upon the united states and the association of southeast asian nations asean

of china has sought to forestall greater us military presence in the region clash over disputed territory in the spratlys that might provoke us involvement and philippine support of the united states in possible military crisis involving taiwan rather than take back seat following the strengthening of philippineus ties after 2001 china has offered manila muchneeded military assistance and well as

conduct of parties in the south china sea doc which many in the region hope will evolve into formal code of conduct that promotes peaceful resolution of territorial disputes in 2003 china acceded to the treaty of amity and cooperation in southeast asia which renounces the use of force and calls for greater economic and political cooperation some analysts contend that the arroyo governme nts withdrawal of rp military personnel from iraq in july 2004 created temporary chill in manilas relations with washington while philippine contacts with beijing became warmer president arroyo paid an official visit to china in september 2004 in november 2004 rp and prc military officials signed memorandum of understanding on defense cooperation and in ma 2005 the two countries signed agreements 69
