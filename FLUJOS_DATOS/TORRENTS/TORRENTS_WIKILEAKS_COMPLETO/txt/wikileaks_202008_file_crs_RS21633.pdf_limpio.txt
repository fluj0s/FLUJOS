great britain the 2003 treaty senate response to initial objections to 2003 treaty the senate gave its advice and consent to the 2003 treat on september 29 2006 subject to an understanding two declarati ons and three provisos 152 cong rec s10766767 daily ed sept 29 2006 the understandi ng declarations and proviso s confirm that 1 federal courts will retain the authority to bar extradition when request fails to meet the demands of 2003 treaty 2 the 2003 treaty does not oblig ate the united states to take any action proscribed by the constitution 3 the parties have disclaimed any interest in prosecuting offenses committed in northern ireland prior to and addressed in the belfastgood friday agreement it also urges the secretary of state to consider carefully any requests for the extradition of fugitive who was previous acquitted and after the treaty becomes effective it requires annual re ports from the secretary on the number and disposition of extradition requests under the treaty critic s had earlier objected to the treaty on the grounds that it eliminates the political offense for any offense allegedly involving violence or weapons including any solicitati on conspiracy or attempt to commit suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21633crs2 crimes it does and more there is likely to be little consensus over whether this is objectionable it is the issue that dominated debate over the supplementary treaty there is little disagreement over the origins or origin rationale of the exception the difficulty comes in defining the exceptions proper scope should it protect fleeing insurgents from prosecution and punishment for acts of violence they committed against the military forces of the government they sought to ove rthrow absent treaty bar united states courts have held that it shoul d apply to crimes committed incide ntal to and in furtherance of rebellion or similar political disturbance reliance upon the exception led to the exemptions to the exception found in the proposed supplementary treaty the senate accepted somewhat reduced list of exemptions to the political offense exception in exchange for expanded judicial authority to verify probable cause and the bona fides of request several of the enlargements those dealing with firearms possession conspiracy property damage involuntary manslaughter unlaw ful detention serious or otherwise repeal specific senate am endments to the s upplementary treaty as originally transmitted to the senate the inclusion of threats firearms possession of explosives property damage independent of bodily injury and accessories after the fact appears to carry the provision well beyond the coverage of even the more ambitious of such provisions in our other recent extrad ition treaties its sweep is made all the more dramatic by removal of the judicial safe ty valve found in the supplementary treatys improper motives article the senate responded with th explicit understanding that as part of the extradition process normally conducte d under the laws of the united states united states judge makes determinati ons regarding the application of the political offense exception the understanding is reenforced by the second d eclaration confirming th role of the courts in the extradition process and by the provi sos indicating that the 2003 treaty is not designed to permit the prosecution of fugitives from northern ireland for offenses committed prior to the good friday agreement transfers responsibility for determining whether the extradition request is politicallymotivated from the courts to the executive it does again whether this is objectionable may depend upon persp ective born of concern for fairness the features of the supplementary treaty are nonethele ss unique of course the question of whether the crime upon which an extradition reque st rests is political crime is closely related to the question of whether an extr adition request is grounded in improper political motives the 2003 treaty strikes or at least extensively prunes perhaps the most individualistic features of the existing tr eaty the treatment of improperly motivated requests and the specifics concerning the exis tence of probable cause article 3 of the supplementary treaty establishes judicial procedure replete with appella rights to bar extradition based on trumpedup charge s or improperly motivated requests the 2003 treatys pruning of the improper motivation clause leaves only political motives suspect and expressly removes the i ssue from the courts more broadly drafted clauses proscribing racial religious or other improperly motivated extradition requests are not uncommon elsewhere the 2003 treat ys repeal of the judicial authority to inquiry into extradition motivation however comports with treatment of the issue diplomatically and judicially moreover as noted above the understandings declarations and provisos upon which the nate insisted emphasize that whether particular extradition request satisfies treaty requirements remains an initial judicial determination and disclaim any intent to reope n the good friday agreement httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21633crs3 eliminates the need for any showing by the united kingdom of facts sufficient to show the person requested is guilty of th crime charged mere unsupported allegations are sufficient the supplementary treaty s probable cause article reenforces the benefits of article 3 while the 2003 treaty strike s 1 the supplementary treaty language insuring an individual the right to contest the existence of probable cause to justify extradition and 2 the original treaty langua ge on the weight of evidence required for extradition it does insist that the documenta tion accompanying request include such information as would provide reasonable basis to believe that the person sought committed the offense for which extradition is requested 2003 treaty art83c allows for extradition even if us federal law is violated it does but in less dramatic manner than the objec tion might imply as general rule the 2003 treaty like its predecessor limits extradition to misc onduct outlawed in both countries the exception is found in cases of extraterritoria lity the existing treaty obligates the parties to extradite with respect to crimes committed within the jurisdiction of the requesting country historically the united states has construed this language to mean offenses committed within the territory of the requesting country as the united states began to assert its criminal extraterritorial jurisdiction more regularly it began to negotiate extradition treaties that either permitted or required extradition to the united states with respect to crimes committed outside this country our present treaty favors the historical model the 2003 treaty requires extradition in extraterritorial cases wh ere the law of the two countries would apply comparably but permits extradition in other cases thus the united states would be permitted to honor british extradition request for an individual charged with violation of british law on the basis of conduct committed entirely within this country eve n if the conduct were completely lawful under our laws and it would be required to honor re quest based upon conduct here but in viola tion of british version of statute like 18 usc 2339b providing material support to terrorist or ganizations or 18 usc 956 conspiracy to commit various acts of violence or property damage overseas eliminates any statute of limitations it does as do several of our more recent extradition treaties the vast majority of the extradition treaties to which the united states is party contain st atute of limitations bar of some kind in some instances the bar is triggered by the law of the requesting country in some by the law of the requested country and in others by the law in either country the rationale is presumably the same as in other contexts that at least in some instances it is unfair to require individuals to defend themselves against stale charges after memories have faded evidence has disappeared and witn esses have died our existing treaty with the united kingdom bars extradition if trial would be barred by the lapse of time under the laws of ither country the supplementary treaty submitted to the senate contained an amendment which would have limited this clause to instances barred by the laws of the re questing country the change was thought to benefit the united kingdom in terrorism cases which were not subject to statute of limitations the senate dropped the amendment from the s upplementary treaty since then number of the treaties submitted to the senate continue to contain statute of limitations clause but perhaps an equal number of others either silently omit the clause or include clause specifically declaring that the expiration of period of limitation is nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21633crs4 bar to extradition the 2003 treaty eliminates th passage of time as defense altogether regardless of the nature of the crime allows for provisional arrest and tention for 60 days upon request by the united kingdom it does but so does the existing treaty provisional arrest refers to the authority to arrest the individual sought for extradition before receiving the full documentation required to in itiate extradition proceedings the 2003 treaty is more precise than the existing treaty in its description of the information that must accompany request for provisional arrest the 2003 treat also affords the parties great flexibility as to the permissible recipients of request s and documentation but the most substantial change seems to be that under the existing tr eaty the individual must be released after 60 days if the necessary documentation has not arrived while under the 2003 treaty release is discretionary allows for seizure of assets by the united kingdom crimerelated assets are subject to seizure under the laws of the united ki ngdom and of the united states under various circumstances some of which implement or supplement our treaty obligations the existing treaty permits the transfer of eviden ce and assets from one country to the another facially the 2003 treatys treatment of forfe itable property differs from its predecessor in two respects it describes the property subject to confiscation more broadly and it omits any reference to the rights of claimants the existing treaty provision is limited to proceeds rather than items connected with th offense and only extends to items in the actual possession of the individual to be extradited the changes reflect greater federal emphasis on forfeiture as law enforcement tool than was the case when the existing treaty was negotiated federal law now authorizes confisca tion of property derived from or in some instances used to facilitate any number of federal crimes including terrorism organized crime drug trafficking and othe r profit generating crimes when they are involved in financial transac tions in this country it per mits the confiscation of the proceeds from drug trafficking crimes of vi olence fraud public corruption or smuggling in violation of the laws of other countries federal law also provides fo r federal court orders freezing property located in this country but subject to confiscation under fore ign forfeiture laws comparable to our own and for enforcement of foreign forfeiture orders by federa l courts under some circumstances moreover it vests the attorney general with the power to share the proceedings from federal confiscations with fo reign countries pursuant to an international agreement to do so the innocent claimant protections of these statutes would seem to mitigate any adverse consequences attributable to the omission of any reference to the rights of claimants in the 2003 treaty allows for extradition for one offense and then subsequent prosecution in the uk for an unrelated offense thus elimina ting the timehonored rule of speciality the 2003 treaty continues the rule in effect but allows the united states to consent to deviation by the great britain and vice versa the rule of specialty permits individuals to be tried andor punished only for the crime s for which they are extradited the rule is designed to ensure that an individual is not tried or punished for crime for which he would not have been extradited and the elimination of the rule might be particularly unfair where the individual sought has waiv ed extradition for purposes of american law the rule is matter of statutory cons truction and consequen tly can be overcome by provision in later treaty most recent tr eaties permit the requested country to consenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21633crs5 to trial or punishment for offenses othe r than those for which the individual was extradited even without sp ecific treaty clause federal c ourts have held that the requested country may consent to trial or punishment for ffenses other than those for which extradition was granted federal courts are divide d however over the question of whether an individual may successfully raise th rule on behalf of the country of refuge our existing treaty with great britain codifies the rule and has consent exception the 2003 treaty preserves the rule but cont ains an explicit consent exception applies retroactively for offenses alle gedly committed even before the ratification of the treaty it does most extradition treaties do the significance of the clause in the 2003 treaty may be what it does not do the supplementary treaty endorses the general rule but makes it applicable to earlier offenses only if the offense was proscribed by the laws of both countries at the time of its commission the 2003 treaty clause has such reservation the omission may be signifi cant when read in conjunction with the extraterritorial clause to permit extrad ition for earlier misconduc t committed outside the territory of the requesting country under circumstances where the misconduct is not proscribed by the laws of the country of refuge other treaty clauses the 2003 treaty has other clauses some of them departure from our earlier be nefits and obligations extradition to third countries or entities as in the case with our existing treaty with great britain the specialty ban on prosecution of additional crimes often includes ban on reext radition to third country beginning in the 106th congress several extr adition treaties submitted to the senate bar reextradition to intern ational tribunals without consent this may have been done at our behest with an eye to the international cr iminal court or at the behest of our treaty partners with an eye to our statutory provi sions relating to the yugoslav and rwandan tribunals or both or for some other reason in any event the 2003 treaty may yield the same result through its more cryptic reference to onward extradition in the case of multiple extradition requests the 2003 treaty mainta ins essentially the same standards for dealing w ith requests from third country that elects to submit contemporaneous request to the country of refuge rather than submitting subsequent request to the country to whom extradition has been granted the only real difference is that the existing treaty specifically mentions the nationality of the individual sought as factor to be considered wh ile the parties may count na tionality among the unmentioned relevant factors that the 2003 treaty considers in play it may be however that the parties have rejected nationality as relevant extraditi on factor under any circumstances after all elsewhere in the 2003 treaty they have denied themselves the right to refuse to extradite on the basis of nationality and have removed the identification of the nationality of the person sought from the information that must be provided with an extradition request double jeopardy ordinarily an individual cannot be extradited on the basis of conduct for which he has alread been tried our existing treaty with great britain bars extradition if prosecution would be precluded in the country of refuge by virtue of any earlier trial there or in the requesting c ountry or in third country the 2003 treaty prohibits extradition where the individual has been tried in the country of refuge and allows country of refuge to deny request for an individual tried in third country senate proviso urges the secretary of state to be sensitive to the possibility of unfairhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21633crs6 treatment when considering british extradition request for fugitive previously acquitted there nationality some nations prefer not to extradite their own citizens and have insisted that their extradition treaties preserve their right to decline requests to extradite their own nationals the united states opposes his vi ew our existing treaty with great britain does not address the issue directly and as consequence the united states may not decline to extradite an american to great britain solely on the grounds of citizenship like several of our more recent extradition agr eements with common law countries the 2003 treaty makes this result explicit waiver neither federal law nor most early treaties provide any obvious mechanism under which an individual might waive extraditi on proceedings in this country this can work to the inconvenience of both countries in volved in cases where the delay is of real benefit to the individual sought the present treaty does not address the issue but like most modern treaties th 2003 treaty has waiver clause translations our extradition agreements with englishspeaking countries do not ordinarily include translation clause the 2003 treaty requires documentation in english with the cost of any translation to be borne by the requesting country as is ordinarily the case in our extradition rela tions with nonenglishspeaking countries deferred prosecution or punishment our existing treaty with great britain requires deferral of an extradition request for an individual being tried or serving sentence in the requested country for anot her offense the 2003 treaty affords the requested country greater flexibility it may defer the extradition request the trial or service of the sentence in the case of the united states one commentator has suggested that because of constraints on stale pros ecutions the united states may be willing to postpone service of sentence but is not likely to surrender an individual pending trial unless it is willing to abandon the prospect of future prosecution transit although the present treaty is silent on the matter most modern extradition treaties to which the united states is party contain transit clause that allows each country to effectuate its extr adition relations with third nati ons by transporting individuals across each others territory the 2003 treaty cl ause grants federal and british authorities discretionary authority to approve transfers through th eir respective countries with exceptions for transportation through partys air space and procedures in the case of unscheduled aircraft landings capital crimes the existing extradition treaty makes special provision for capital cases artiv the 2003 treaty makes essentially the same accommodation
