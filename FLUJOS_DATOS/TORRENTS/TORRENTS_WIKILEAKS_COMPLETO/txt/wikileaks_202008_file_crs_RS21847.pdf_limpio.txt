groner martin thomas manton john parker evan evans and kimbrough stone in his annual report for that year atto rney general cummings also recommended legislation that would provide for the crea tion and maintenance of an administrative system11 an efficacious administrative machin ery cummings noted is as necessary in the courts as it is in other branches of government and in private enterprise cummings continued i believe too that there is something inhe rently illogical in the present system of having the budget and expenditures of the courts and individual judges under the jurisdiction of the department of justice the courts should be an independent coordinate branch of the government in every proper sense of the term12 unlike president roosevelts controversia l courtpacking plan the proposal for an administrative office was not means to control the judiciary13 it was thought of as way to create an efficient court system and to make the judicial branch truly independent branch of government during the second session of the 75th congress senate judiciary committee chairman henry f ashurst introduced s 3212 bill to establish the administrative office of the united states courts on january 11 193814 the bill would have vested an ao director with authority to carry out all administrative nd personnel functions of the federal courts under the supervision of the chief justice and conference of senior judges although hearings were held by th senate judiciary committee the bill received further action at the end of the 75th congress attorney general cummings took up the discussion of the matter with the judicial conference15 the conference decided that in cummings words it was incumbent upon the courts them selves the judges of the courts to clean their own house rather than be subject to the embarrassment and destruction of our theory of government by having it done by someone else16 as result the conference decided to appoint committee to work alongside the attorney general to study and refine s 321217 the committee was authorized to work with the attorney general to design bill that congress would adopthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21847crs4 18 us congress

were held by the senate judiciary committee on s 188 and by the house judiciary committee on hr 599919 at the senate hearings attorney general cummings defended the bill as way to separate the judicial branch from the executive of course the judiciary is one of the great coordinate branches of our government and as such as i think all will agree it should be independent that it should have its budget and its administrative functions the expenditures of the judges the salaries of clerks and the innumerable details connected with its administration handled by the attorney general through the machinery of the department of justice remembering all the time that the department of justice represents most of the litigation in the courts themselves is an anomaly i have never been able to reconcile myself to that situation i have felt that it meant the exer cise of authority by the attorney general or the department of justice that should be placed elsewhere it should of course be placed with the branch of the government that is directly concerned20 s 188 was approved by the nate judiciary committee and pa ssed by the senate the house of representatives ear lier passed hr 5999

william rehnquist has noted that most federal cour ts have developed or are in the process of developing tinuityofoperations plans25 also of concern for the courts is the i ssue of mail handling after the october 2001 incident involving anthrax contamination of us government mail study was done to research several existing courthouse mail facilities and handling pr actices and to help develop procedures and infrastructure for safe mail handling in federa l courthouses the studys recommendations were approved by the judicial conference in 2002 initially 12 million from an emergency secu rity supplemental appropriation was used to construct centralized mail rooms in courthouses26 in 2004 congress approved over 277 million to enhance mail security as well as overall courthouse security27 financial and mana gement control before the early 1990s district court funds were controlled solely by the ao request for money was only given for specific expenses and even then only by written requests since that time the ao has been working to decentralize its financial and management control system28 currently about 2 billion each year are managed by the courts29 the program gives district courts the flexibility to respond to unfores een situations for example in may 2003 tornado caused extensive structural damage to the courthouse in jackson tennessee the court clerk used
