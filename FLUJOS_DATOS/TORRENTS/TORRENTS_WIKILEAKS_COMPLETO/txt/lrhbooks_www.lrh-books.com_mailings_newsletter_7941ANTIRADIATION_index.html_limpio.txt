bridge enewsletter lrhs congress lectures date doing something about it now each one of us has certain amount of responsibility in this sphere this universe whatever size it is and the number of times we didnt go into communication are the number of times were out of communication so we can always say the wrong thing to do is nothing theres big atomic bomb what can i do about the atomic bomb im just im not anything why are you just you howd you get to be just you well everybody is broke and theres five states blowing away out there and theres drought sweeping through the middle west and we have an oversupply of food i dont know how we mesh these things together and there isnt enough money to buy products and the distribution is that and so forth and you say well im just i cant do anything howd you get to be just you that cant do anything about it by not doing anything about it dont you see someday sooner or later anybody has to turn on the devils that pursue him someday you can turn with processing but you can also turn with living by what by doing something about it now there are not wrong things to do and right things to do to the degree of error that there is nothing to do about it can you see that this excerpt was taken from washington congress on antiradiation confront individual importance and the dynamics an article by l ron hubbard excerpted from the washington congress on antiradiation confront lectures scientology could be characterized as just good game it might not even be important it might not even be important at all but if it isnt important then we had better get our heads together and we better send an expedition out to some nearby planet to find out if theyre ready to start genetic line im serious i would just as soon work it on that basis of look around and find some nearby planet that could be patched up you know factually but its matter of eitheror im afraid either put this one in condition where it can survive or find one that can be put in condition in which one would like to live and if theres any other choice i dont know about them if there are any other choices at all i havent heard of them now there isnt choice unfortunately for thee or of well lets just sit back and wait to see how it all goes weve known for years the wrong thing to do about anything we may not know the right things to do but by golly we know the wrong thing to do about any given circumstance or situation and thats to do nothing you sit down in any given situation and you think now what shall i do theres always one thing that you usually can be sure of theres one positive certainty that you can have that its wrong to do nothing now to people that get tired easily this is strenuous viewpoint its pretty wild though you come to inspect these situations that we say well i cant do anything about it thats business of mine only busybody would rush in there and we say well all right ill do nothing about it its come into my awareness now what shall i do about it nothing yeah thats the right answer is it mark it up on the time track week by week somewhere up the line because you did nothing that same situation is going to go whap youre going to say what happened now this is horrible view because it presupposes tremendous amount of busybodiness and activity on the part of an individual but if you want to know why things are off the wheels so far look how many times nothing was done and add up in the last seventysix trillion years all the times nothing was done and youve got the exact problem you have at this minute you abandoned control and responsibility and communication with you got problems lots of them it didnt matter whether it was bad or good bad or good are just pries people use to make other people act you see that they dont exist as such but something existed and we said im unwilling to communicate with it im unwilling to do something about it what is the difference between those two statements observably difference im unwilling to do something about it im unwilling to communicate with it what happens to your reality what happens to your affinity what happens to the reality and affinity of the other dynamics you get extreme individuation as result its all right to be an individual but its all right to be something else too theres nothing wrong with the first dynamic if youve got seven others in good action theres nothing wrong with being the most important person under the sun if everybody else is just as important as you are you got that real good the only thing that you ever object to in important people is because they act so thoroughly too many times on the supposition that everybody else is crumb you are important but youre as important as seven dynamics are important to you l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture project third dynamic this lecture is available in the washington congress on antiradiation confront lectures now available in the following languages
