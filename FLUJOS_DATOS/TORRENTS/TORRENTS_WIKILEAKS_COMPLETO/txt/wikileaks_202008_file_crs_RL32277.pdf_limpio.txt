acute care as well as longterm care to more than 50 million americans at cost to federal and state governments of approximately 2963 billion in fy2004 of ll federally supported social programs only medicare comes close to this level of spending and only social security costs more medicaid is jointly financed by the federal and state governments but each state designs and administers its own versi on of the program under broad federal guidelines the complexity of medicaid presents an enormous challenge for anyone attempting to generalize about the program state vari ability in eligibility covered services and how those services are reimbursed and delivered is the rule rather than the exception furthermore dicaid is targeted at indi viduals with low income but not all of the poor are eligible and not all those covered are poor this report summarizes the basic elemen ts of medicaid and includes the most recent data available ranging from 2000 to 2006 depending on the data source

security amendments of 1965 pl 8997 it grew out of and replaced two earlier programs of federal grants to states that provided medical care to welfare recipients and the aged medicaid is meanstested entitlement program it is jointly financed by federal and state funds federal contributions to each state are based on states willingness to finance covered medical services and matching formula each state designs and administers its own program under broad fe deral rules the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms within the us department of health and human services hhs is responsible for federal oversight of the program in fy2004 total federal and state spending on medicaid reached 2963 billion see table 1 slightly exceeding net outlays for medicare ot her meanstested cash or noncash

1750 87 sources crs tabulations of form cms64 data from the centers for medicare and medicaid services to many medicaid is an enigma th programs complexity surrounding who is eligible what services are paid for and how those services are reimbursed and delivered is one source of this confusi on variability across state medicaid programs is the rule not the exception and adds to the confusion income eligibility levels vary services covered vary and the thod for and amount of reimbursement for services differ from state to st ate in addition more and more states in recent yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32277crs2 have implemented variety of major program changes using special waiver authority furthermore medicaid is program that is targeted at lowincome individuals but not all of the poor are elig ible and not all those cove red are poor for populations like children and families primary and acute care are often delivered through managed care while the elderly and disabled typically obtain such care on feefor service basis nationwide medicaid finances the majority of longterm care services such services include for example nursing home care and communitybased services designed to support the elderly nd disabled in their homes recently some states have begun to integrate medicare and medicaid financing andor coverage of acute and longterm care serv ices for these populations the complexity of medicaid presents an enormous challenge for anyone attempting to make ge neralizations about the program this report scribes federal medicaid rules that govern 1 who is eligible 2 what services are covered and how they are delivered 3 how the progra m is financed and administered 4 key provider reimbursement issues and 5 the significant role of waivers in expanding eligibility and modifying services it concludes with brief legislative history of major laws affecting medicaid enacted since 1996 eligibility federal medicaid statute defines over 50 distinct population groups as being potentially eligible for states programs some groups are mandatory meaning that all states that participate in the medicaid program must cover them others are optional prior to the 1980s medicaid eligibility was limited to very lowincome families with dependent children poor elderly and disabled individuals and the medically needy beginning in the 1980s additional eligib ility pathways were added to the medicaid statute to allow for the coverage of higher income children and pregnant women as well as other elderly and disabled individuals most recently states were given the option to provide medicaid to other groups with specific characteristics including certain women with breast or cervical cancer to uninsured individuals with tuberculosis and to additional working individuals with disabilities not all groups of medicaid beneficiaries receive the same t of benefits to understand the different benefits offered to each group see benefits medicaid is meanstested program to qualify applicants income and resources must be within certain limits the specific income and resource limitations that apply to each eligibility group are set through combin ation of federal parameters and state definitions conse quently those standards vary considerably among states and different standards appl to different population groups within state for many of those groups moreove r states have permission under special provision section 1902r2 to use more liberal standards for computing income and resources than are specifi ed within each of the groups definitions most states use section 1902r2 to ignore or disregar d certain types or amounts of income or assets thereby extending medicaid to indivi duals with earnings or assets too high to otherwise qualify under the specified rules for that eligibility pathwayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32277crs3 1 ka maloy ka kenney j darnell and s cyprien can medicaid work for low income working

automatically eligible for medicaid dicaids section 1931 however preserves medicaid entitlement for individuals who m eet the requirements of the former afdc programs in effect in their states on july 16 1996 this categorical group was created when tanf replaced afdc to ensure that wincome families do not lose medicaid as result of welfare reform states have significant flexibility in defining the income and resource standards for those families qualifying for medicaid under section 1931 1 income standards may be reduced below those in effect in 1996 but they cannot be lower than those us ed on may 1 1988 2 income and resource standards may be increased for any peri od after 1996 but by more than the percentage increase in the consumer price index cpi for the same period and 3 states may use less restrictiv methods for counting income and resources than those in effect on july 16 1996 certain individuals qualifying under th section 1931 pathway may be denied medicaid coverage if they re

must continue to provide medicaid cove rage to their children in 2002 39 states had taken advantage of the flexibility of section 1931 to expand eligibility for working families by disregarding some earned income thereby allowing families with higher total income to qualify for the program additional states eliminated various income and assets rules again for lowincome working families thus expanding their access to medicaid1 povertyrelated pregna nt women and children between 1986 and 1991 congress gradually extende d medicaid to new groups of pregnant women and children under these

permanently requires four months of tma for families losing medicaid eligibility due to an increase in earned income or hours of employment tma was established in part to address th concern that individuals receiving afdc payments would not seek work or would turn down work opportunities for fear of losing medicaid in 1988 congress expande d tma so that states must continue providing medicaid

1925 of the social security act was originally authorized to replace the permanent fourmonth tma requirement through fy1998 but its suns et has been repeatedly extended over the years if the 12month tma provision is allowed to expire states will still be required to provide four months of tma to families that lose medicaid eligibility due to an increase in earned income hours of employment or

medicaid enrollme nt of children by 3 to 7 million for all ages the undercount was as much as 105 million21 the impact of the medicaid undercount on estimates of the uninsured is debatable some research suggests that the medicaid underc ount is the result of survey respondents selecting some other source of health insurance besides medicaid although this results in medicaid undercount it woul d not cause an ove restimate of the uninsured since these respondents are still claiming source of coverage however if medicaid enrollees fail to respond as having any source of coverage they would inappropriately be considered uninsured additional research is needed on this topic to determine the impact of the dicaid undercount on uninsured estimates another source often used to estimate

treat sickle cell disease and its complications this benefit includes primary and secondary medical strategies and treatments for persons with sickle cell disease who otherwise meet medicaid financial eligibility standards services include ch ronic blood transfusion to prevent stroke among those at high risk genetic counseling and testing for persons with the disease or sickle cell trait to facilitate treatment and prevention of symptoms and other care to prevent those who have experienced stroke from having additional strokes rule of construction in the law notes that addition of this new benefit does not imply that states could not have covered these services previously related administrative services including for example identification of eligibles and ducation about the disease and its complications are also covered in addition states are able to waive many of the basic benef its rules to provide special home and communitybased services for persons who are in need of long term care and to conduct dem onstration projects that st alternative methods of meeting the overall purpose of the medicai d statute these waivers include home and communitybased services hcbs under the hcbs waiver authority states can provide special benefits tailored to meet the longterm care needs of targeted populations among the benefits offered under these programs are case management homemaker home health aide pe rsonal care adult day health habilitation respite care day treatment or other partial hospitalization services and psychosocial rehabilitation and clinic services for individuals with chronic mental illness states can also cover wide range of other medical nonmedical social and supportive services that allow pe rsons who need longterm care to remain in the community for more information on hcbs waivers see the medicaid waiver programs subsection below section 1115 research and demonstration waivers states have great deal of flexibility to fine benefits under section 1115 waivers many of the rules outlin ed above regarding benefits may be waived under comprehens ive 1115 demonstrations states generally provide broad range of services statewide the bush administration has encouraged states to pursue targeted policies under three waiver initiatives ll using section 1115 authority under pharmacy plus waivers states are encouraged to provide

coverage that is available to these individuals under pharmacy plus waiver s has yet to be defined the mma of 2003 only requires the secretary to apply coordina tion requirements to certain prescription drug plans including those operating under waiver under section 1115 the aug 3 2004 proposed regulations clarify that drug covera ge under pharmacy plus waiver programs will not be allowed to fill the gap in coverage in the part d prescription drug benefit however since the mma allows states to use state pharmaceutical assistan ce program spap funds to assist beneficiaries with outofpocket expe nditures the proposed regulations suggest that pharmacy plus waivers will become obsolete in 2006 the proposed regulations assert that states would be better off using their current pharmacy plus spending toward spaps as they are allowed to wrap around the federal part d benefit 25 expenditures shown in table 8 are those reported by states through the medicaid statistical information system msis for fy2002 these data do not match fy2002 expenditures reported above in table 1 based on cms64 reports data reported on form cms64 have always varied from the msis reported totals because the cms64 reports are filed for financial accounting purposes they are generally considered to be more accurate accounting of total outlays and are pref erred when examining state andor federal totals those data however do not allow for analysis of spending patterns and use of services for individuals or among groups of i ndividuals for example by basis of eligibility for such

in 1987 the secretary of hhs issued re gulations establishi ng separate upper payment limits for inpatient and outpatient services provided by different types of facilities an ggregate upper payment limit was established for each type of institutional provider of medicaid services by ownership state versus other that would not exceed what would have been paid for those services under medicare payment principles in 2000 the secretar determined that some states made arrangements with city or c ounty facilities to pay th facilities at inflated rates the city or county facilitie s then transferred some or all of the enhanced payments back to the state bipa 2000 addressed these funding methods by requiring regulations to provide separate upper payment limits for private nd nonstate public facilities up to 100 of the medicare rate for such services later through regulation the clinton administration allowed payments to city and county public hospitals up to 150 of the medicare rate for their services in january 2002 the bush administration changed the special rule for city and county hospita ls to 100 of the medicare rate administration medicaid is stateadministered program at the federal level the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms of the us department of health and human services hhs is responsib for overseeing state operations federal law requires that single state agency be charged with administration of the medicaid program generally that agency is either the state welfare agency the state health agency or an umbrella human resources agency the single state agency may contract with other state entities to conduct some program functions further states may process claims for reimbursement themselves or contract with fiscal agents or health insuring agencies to process these claims the federal share of administrative costs is 50 for all states except for certain items for which the authorized rate is higher delivery systems there are two systems for delivering rvices under medicai d feeforservice and managed care these systems differ in how the state pays for the services it covers and how the individual accesses rvice providers most states use combination of both of these systems to deliver medicaid services the primary elements of these systems and initiatives to deliver longterm care services are discussed below feeforservice the feeforservice system has been th primary method of paying for and delivering medicaid services since the pr ograms enactment in 1965 under feefor service medicaid beneficiary determines in consultation with physician the typehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32277crs35 of services needed and can receive thos services from any medicaid participating provider states may limit the amount of services or require prior approval of services but the individual retains significant flexibility the provider receives payment from the state medicaid agency for that particular service based on rates established by the state states have significant flexibility in developing how payment rates are calculated and there is significant variation by state and by service for example the rate may be related to the actual cost of the service for an individual provider or could be fixe d predetermined amount fo r particular procedure although enrollment in managed care has increased over the last decade the feeforservice system continues to be widespread and importa nt service delivery mechanism the feeforservice system is used for individuals whose medicaid eligibility group or geographic location is not served through managed care or for persons who opt out when managed care is voluntary the feeforservice system is also used for those medicaid services not covered by managed care contract for individuals who live in rural areas nd individuals who are elderly or have disability feeforservice continues to be the dominant delivery system states have tended to exclude these groups from managed care programs individuals in rural areas often have limited choice of managed care plans and service providers individuals who are elderly or who have disability often have complex medical conditions which can be costly and require specialty care and their health status can be unpredictable though individuals who are elderly or who have disability tend to be excluded states have started to develop managed care approaches for these groups to contain cost and test alterna tive delivery systems as discussed below under primarily feeforservice system state medicaid expenditures and the number of enrollees has increased significantly over the 10year period between 1985 and 1995 state medicaid expenditure s increased from 182 billion to 673 billion an average growth rate of 14 nnually this increase primarily reflected increases in medical costs and increases in the number of medicaid enrollees among other causes between 1985 and 1995 the number of medicaid enrollees

general medicaid beneficiaries in managed care have been increasingly enrolled in plans that are only serving medicaid bene ficiaries from june 30 1998 through june 30 2003 the number of co mmercial managed care plan s providing services to medicaid beneficiaries declined an average of 10 per year35 as comparison the number of managed care plans serving only medicaid beneficiarie s declined 2 per year over the same time period36 this evolution of the managed care market is not necessarily negative if it strengthens the overall delivery system but it may result in decreased continuity of services and add itional administrative costs if beneficiaries must switch providers or ree nroll in different plan longterm care delivery system longterm care refers to wide range of supportive and health services for persons who have lost the capacity for selfcare due to illness frailty or disabling condition it differs from acute care in that the goal of longterm care is not to cure an illness that is generally of short duration but to allow an individual to attain and maintain an optimal level of functioning over the longterm since the establishment of the medicaid program in 1965 longterm care services ie nursing home and home care have been delivered largely through the feeforservice delivery system 1981 amendment to the medicaid statute established section 1915c wa ivers giving states the option of providing home and communitybased services to individuals who would otherwise be eligible for institutional care many states arrange for these services to be delivered on feefor service basis often using case managers to determine service needs and authorize delivery concerns about uncoordinated longterm and acu care inefficiencies in disease management for persons with multip chronic conditions and growing costs however have encouraged fede ral and some state governments to develop alternative systems to pay for and deliver longterm care services in recent years many of the alternative delivery systems that states and the federal government have veloped coordinate longt erm care services for dual eligibles persons who are eligible for both medicaid and medicare through managed care programs one example is the program for allinclusive care for the elderly pace originally modeled after the on lok senior health services pilot project in san francisco pace makes available all services covered under both programs without amount duration or sc ope limitations and wit hout application of any deductibles copayments or other cost sharing under the program certain low income individuals age 55 and older w ho would otherwise require nursing home care receive all health medical and social services they need an interdisciplinary team of physicians nurses physical therapists social workers and otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32277crs43 professionals devel op and monitor care plans for enrollees monthly capitated payments are made to providers from bot h the medicare and medicaid programs as specified in medicare and dicaid statutes the amount of these payments from both programs must be less than what would ve otherwise been paid for comparable frail population not enrolled in the pace prog ram payments are also adjusted to account for the comparative frailty of pace enrollees pace providers assume the risk for expenditures that exceed the revenue from the capitation payments the balanced budget act of 1997 made pa ce permanent be nefit categ ory under medicare and state plan optional bene fit under medicaid as of february 2005 there were 32 pace sites across 18 states other examples of state initiatives to provide coordinated longterm care services include the minnesota senior health options msho the wisconsin partnership program and the continuing care network ccn demonstration of monroe county new york the msho pr ogram combines medicare and medicaid financing to integrate acute and longterm care services for dually eligible seniors residing in seven counties in minnesota the program c onsolidates all medicare and medicaid managed care requirements into single contract overseen by the state allowing msho to reduce duplication and resolve important differences across medicare and medicaid delivery systems like pace the wisconsin partnership program pays capitated payments to providers to coordina acute and longterm care services for persons who would otherwis qualify for nursing home care it also places strong emphasis on services provi ded in home and community settings this program however was designed specifically to serve rural areas new yorks ccn project enrolls at least 10000 elderly be neficiaries includi ng 1500 who had been certified for care in nursing facility to participate enrollees must be age 65 or over eligible for medicare ndor medicaid and reside in the programs service area capitation payments made to ccn are intended to cover all of medicares acute care services for this population and most of medicaids longterm care services medicaid prescription drug coverage for ex ample is paid separately on feefor service basis states have also experimented with other initiatives that capitate payments for acute and longterm care services under th medicaid program only examples of these demonstrations include the nati ons only statewide mandatory medicaid managed care program the arizona l ongterm care system altcs and small voluntary programs such as flor idas communitybased diversion pilot project floridas diversion program serves selected metropolitan areas and c ounties case managers employed through both of these programs arrange medicaid long term care services and coordinate with medicare providers to deliver acute care services all of these programs were designed with the expectation that they would control costs and reduce administrative complexity they also intend to delay institutionalization and thus incur savi ngs for medicaid through the provision of expanded home and communitybased care options and in some cases greater beneficiary control over services those programs that also capitate medicare are intended to reduce hospitalization and skilled nursing facility expenditures as well as other acute care costs associated with institutional care while these initiativeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32277crs44 37 section 1115 also

primary provisions of the social security act used today that authorize states to implement waiver programs are sec tion 1115 and section 1915c in recent years there has been increased interest among states in demonstration programs as means to restructure medi caid coverage control costs and increase flexibility whether large or small reforms the waiver programs have resulted in significant changes for medicaid beneficiaries nationwide section 1115 waiver monstrati on programs section 1115 of the social security act provides the secretary of health and human services hhs with broad authority to waive certain statutory requirements in the medicaid program allowing states to conduct research and demonstration programs to further the goals of title xix37 under section 1115 the secretary may waive medicaid requirement s contained in section 1902 known as freedom of choice of provider comparability and statewideness see benefits subsection for discussion of these requirements states often use section 1115 waivers to offer different serv ice packages or combination of services in different pa rts of the state st new reimbursement methods change eligibility criteria in orde

operation for 10 or more years for example arizonas entire medicaid prog ram operates under the section 1115 waiver authority nd this program is in its 22th year while section 1115 is explicit about pr ovisions in medicaid law that may be waived in conducting research and dem onstration projects number of other provisions in medicaid law and regulations specify limitations or restrictions on how state may operate waiver program for example one provision restricts states from establishing waivers that fail to provide all mandatory services to the mandatory povertyrelated groups of pr egnant women and children another provision specifies restrictions on costsharing im posed under demonstration waivers financing approved section 1115 waivers ar deemed to be part of medicaid state plan and are fi nanced through federal and st ate matching funds at the regular fmap rate however unlike regular medicaid costs associated with waiver programs must be budget neutral to the federal government over the life of the waiver program to meet the budget neutra lity test estimated spending under the waiver cannot exceed the estimated cost of the states existing medicaid program under current law pr ogram requirements39 for example costs associated with an expanded population eg those not alr eady covered under the states medicaid program must be offset by reductions elsewhere within the medicaid program several methods used by states to generate cost savings for the waiver component include 1 moving part of the medicai d population into managed care 2 limiting benefit packages for certain eligibility gr oups 3 providing targeted services to certain individuals so as to divert them from full medicaid coverage and 4 using enrollment caps and costsharing to reduce the amounts
