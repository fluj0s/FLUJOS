threat to the us army the intentional or unintentional leaking and posting of us army sensitive or classified information to wikileaksorg could result in increased threats to dod personn equipment facilities or installations the leakage of sensitive and classified dod information also calls attention to the insider threat when person or persons motivated by particular cause or issue wittingly provides information to domestic or foreign personnel or organizations to be published by the news media or on the internet such information could be of value to foreign intelligence and security services fiss foreign military forces foreign insurgents and foreign terrorist groups for collecting information or for planning attacks against us force both within the united states and abroad snf the possibility that current employee or mole within dod or elsewhere in the us government is providing sensitive information or classifie d information to wikileaksorg cannot be ruled out wikileaksorg claims that the leakers or whistleblowers of sensitive or classified dod documents are former us government employees these claims are highly suspect however since wikileaksorg state s that the anonymity and protection of the leakers or whistleblowers is one of its primary goals referencing of leakers using codenames and providing incorrect employment information employment status and other contradictory information by wikileaksorg are most likely rudimentary opsec measures designed to protect the identity of the current or former insiders who leaked the information on the other hand one cannot rule out the possibility that some of the contradictions in describing leakers could be inadvertent opsec errors by the authors contributors or wikileaksorg staff personnel with limited experience in protecting the identity of their sources u the stated intent of the wikileaksorg web site is to expose unethical practices illegal beha vior and wrongdoing within corrupt corporations and oppressive regimes in asia the former soviet bloc sub saharan africa and the middle east to do so the developers of the wikileaksorg web site want to provide secure forum to where leakers contri butors or whistleblowers from any country can anonymously post or send documentation and other information that exposes corruption or wrongdoing by governments or corporations the developers believe that the disclosure of sensitive or classified informat ion involving foreign government or corporation will eventually result in the increased accountability of democratic

wikileaksorg some contend that the leaking and posting of information on wikileaksorg is constitutionally protected free speech supports open society and open government initiatives and serves the greater public good in such manner that outweighs any illegal acts that arise from the posting of sensitive or classified government or business information others believe that the web site or persons associated with wikileak sorg will face legal challenges in some countries over privacy issues revealing sensitive or classified government information or civil lawsuits for posting information that is wrong false slanderous libelous or malicious in nature for example the wikileaksorg web site in the united states was shutdown on 14 february 2008 for 2 weeks by court order over the publishing of sensitive documents in case involving charges of money laundering grand larceny and tax evasion by the julius bare bank in t he cayman islands and switzerland the court case against wikileaksorg was

and technologists fro m the united states china taiwan europe australia and south africa its web site became operational in early 2007 the advisory board for wikileaksorg includes journalists cryptographers former us intelligence analyst and expatriates from chin russian and tibetan refugee communities the acic does not have any information to associate or link the former us intelligence analyst on the wikileaksorg advisory board with the leakage of sensitive or classified dod documents posted to the web site6 u wikileaksorg claims to have developed an uncensorable version of the publicly available wikipedia interface that is intended for mass leakage of sensitive documents that expose wrongdoing and for allowing users to comment on the documents posted to the web site through its web site wikileaksorg encourages large scale anonymous leaking and posting of sensitive and confidential government and business documents on the internet wikileaksorg claims to have received more than 12 million documents from dissident communities and anonymous sources throughout the world if true additional articles involving sensitive or classified dod will most likely be posted to the wikileaksorg web site in the future 7 snf wikileaksorg uses its own coded software combined with wiki mediawiki openssl freenet tor and pgp to make it difficult for foreign governments fiss law enforcement agencies and foreign businesses to determine where leak ed document originated from and who was responsible for leaking the document the goal of wikileaksorg is to ensure that leaked information is distributed across many jurisdictions organizations and individual users because once leaked document is pla ced on the internet it is extremely difficult to remove the document entirely 8 snf the obscurification technology 9 used by wikileaksorg has exploitable vulnerabilities organizations with pr operly trained cyber technicians the proper equipment and the proper technical software could most likely conduct computer network exploitation cne operations or use cyber tradecraft to obtain access to wikileaksorgs web site information systems or networks that may assist in identifying those persons supplying the data and the means by which they transmitted the data to wikileaksorg forensic analysis of dod unclassified and classified networks may reveal the location of the information systems us ed to download the leaked documents the metadata md5 hash marks and other unique identifying information within digital documents may assist in identifying the parties responsible for leaking the information in httpwikileaksorgﬁleusintelwikileakspdfsecretnoforn secretnoforn page 6 of 32 addition patterns involving the types of leaked information classification levels of the leaked information development of psychological profiles and inadvertent attribution of an insider through poor opsec could also assist in the identification of insiders u wikileaksorg supports the us supreme court ruling regarding the unauthorized release of the pentagon papers by daniel ellsberg which stated that only free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government the wikileaksorg web site further states the followi ng we aim for maximum political impact we believe that transparency in government activities leads to reduced corruption better government and stronger democracies all governments can benefit from increased scrutiny by the world community as well as their own people we believe this scrutiny requires information historically that information has been costly in terms of human life and human rights but with technological advances the internet and cryptography the risks of conveying important informa tion can be lowered 10 u the opsec measures used in the submission of leaked information to wikileaks using the internet are designed to protect the identity and personal security of the persons or entities sending or post ing information to the web site wikileaksorg claims that any attempt at trace routing of ip addresses mac addresses and other identifying information of home computer submissions as opposed to cyber café submissions through wikileaksorgs internet submission system would require knowledge of information available only to wikileaksorg programmers and to rights organization serving the electronic community or would require specialized ubiquitous traffic analysis of internet messages and routing systems nevertheless it remains technically feasible for fiss law enforcement organizations and foreign businesses that have the motivation intentions capability and opportunity to gain online access or physical access to wikileaksorg information systems to identify and trace whistleblowers through cyber investigations advanced cyber tools and forensics 11 u another method of posting leaked information to the web site anonymously is for leakers to use postal mail to send the information to volunteers in various countries who have agreed to receive encrypted cds and dvds from leakers these volunteers then forward the information to designated personnel who then upload the data on the cds and dvds to the wikileaks org web servers to protect or mask the sender leakers can take opsec measures such as using wikileaksorg encryption protocols when writing cds and dvds using gloves while wrapping taping handling and mailing packages and not including return addr ess or including fake return address on packages containing leaked information such measures are designed to protect the identity of the leakers and prevent fiss law enforcement and postal inspectors from intercepting the mail and decoding the informa tion on the data storage devices in transit wikileaksorg also claims that it is developing easy touse software to encrypt the cds and dvds use of such methods also protects facilitators or intermediaries from harm because they would not know the conten t of the encrypted submissions 12 u wikileaksorg spokesperson stated in early january 2007 that about 22 persons are involved in the open society initiative to make governments and

accessing sensitive information embarrassing information or alleged propaganda the governments of china israel and russia have asserted that they have right to remove from the internet protected

to prepare objective new reports conversely this same informati on could be manipulated to prepare biased news reports or be used for conducting propaganda disinformation misinformation perception

toes for us army units deployed to afghanistan and iraq in april 2007 provide wealth of information that could be used by fiss foreign terrorist groups and iraqi insurgents to identify unit capabilities and vulnerabilities that could ssist in conducting attacks against camps convoys and other targets the information can also be compared with other publicly available databases to develop extensive order of battle files of vehicle types communications and jamming equipment informati on systems and weapons systems files that could be used to determine the capabilities limitations and vulnerabilities of the organic equipment assigned to military units such information could aid enemy forces in planning terrorist attacks selecting the most effective type and emplacement of improvised explosive devices ieds building triggering devices to defeat countermeasures organic to friendly units and selecting the most effective direct and indirect weapons systems for conducting physical at tacks against targets such as military units convoys and base camps u one wikileaksorg news article also discusses the use of ieds by foreign terrorists and insurgent groups and claims that the ied threat has resulted in shift in dod funding priori ties similar to the manhattan project to develop atomic weapons in world war ii for current research development and fielding of ied countermeasures through the joint ied defeat organization in addition the author of the article attempts to provide costtobenefit analysis of these ied tactics and countermeasures the author claims that the leaked information reveals that 12097 warlock counter rcied remote controlled improvised explosive device electronic warfare crew systems are in iraq and t hat the purpose of the warlock is to jam radio signals from devices such as mobile phones to prevent such signals from detonating ieds httpwikileaksorgﬁleusintelwikileakspdfsecretnoforn secretnoforn page 11 of 32 the author claimed that 7530 systems used in iraq were purchased at cost of 11 billion claim was made regarding the cost of remaining 4567 systems snf the author of the above mentioned article incorrectly interprets the leaked data regarding the components and fielding of the warlock system resulting in unsupportable and faulty conclusions to allege war prof iteering price gouging and increased revenues by dod contractors involved in counter ied development efforts this article provides an example of how the leaked toe information can be manipulated and misinterpreted to produce inaccurate information for news article snf the author of the article then argues that the us army receives poor return on its investment in counter ieds the following excerpt from the article could be used by adversaries in potential propaganda or influence operations if we view ieds as rebel investment to which the united states must pay dividends in defensive equipment costs then every insurgent dollar spent has return on investment of somewhere around thousand fold significant price gouging by counter ied defens contractors is evident for comparison each briefcase sized warlock ied jammer of which is there is on average more than one per vehicle is worth 150000 however as can be seen by this analysis that is more costly than nearly every vehicle it was designed to protect the warlock producer dod defense contractor name redacted predicts financial year 2007 will see 400 percent total revenue increase over its 2003 levels 21 snf intelligence indicates that in surgents in afghanistan have recovered several warlock systems 22 it is possible that warlock systems captured in afghanistan were sent to iran for reverse engineering and for use in developing countermeasures to warlock snf were warlock system successfully reversed engineered or countermeasures successfully developed by foreign terrorists insurgents or the iranian government us and coalition forces would be at greater risk of rcied attacks especially those units eq uipped with warlock systems similar to those that had been captured and exploited it is also possible that any countermeasures developed to defeat the warlock system would be provided to the jaysh mahdi jam and other anti us insurgent or terrorist gr oups operating in iraq and afghanistan the toes could be used to identify and target specific units equipped with

chemical herbicides and riot control agents renounced first use of herbicides in war except for specified defensive uses and first use of rcas in war xcept for defensive military modes to save lives in ratifying the cwc the us senate wrote an amendment into its resolution approving the cwc that stated united states interpretation of how rcas might be used for specific defensive purposes as specified by the 1975 executive order 31 u such varying interpretations reflect deliberate ambiguity in the cwc which states that riotcontrol agents may not be used as method of warfare the original cwc and modified cwc app roved by the us senate however does not define this phrase method of warfare the actual version of the cwc passed by the us senate was not considered by the authors of the report the cwc ratified by the us senate list exceptions in the usage of rcas for us military forces that are not considered by the us government to be in violation of the cwc 32 u in the same report the authors claimed that the use of white phosphorus by the us military during the 2004 assault on f allujah iraq should also be considered violation of the cwc the authors noted however that the us army claimed usage of white phosphorous as smoke screen and an incendiary in the fallujah operation and that this usage is not technically cover ed by the cwc u alleged human rights violations related to joint task force guantanamo standard operating procedures ufouo another example of leaked information posted to the wikileaksorg web site on or about 7 november 2007 is an outdated copy of the joint task force guantanamo camp delta standard operating procedures sop marked as unclassifiedfouo signed by mg miller and dated 28 march 2003 news article written by wikileaksorg staff writers also posted on 7 november 2007 claims the sop exposes systematic methods for preventing illegal combatants and detained prisoners incarcerated at joint task force guantanamo facilities at camp delta from meeting with the international red cross as well as the use of extreme psychological stress as means of torture against detainees the unauthorized release of the sop has prompted authors posting to the wikileaksorg web site to claim that the document proves the us army was torturing and violating the human rights of detainees held at guantanamo b ay this sop was also the subject of lawsuit by international human rights groups and domestic civil rights organization requesting the release of the document under the us freedom of information act 33 u the author cla imed that subsequent us military statements including dod spokesperson to reuters news service and the miami herald confirm the veracity of the jtf sop document on wednesday 14 november 2007 week after the sop was posted to

to the web site be censored and removed from the web site the actual wording of the dod mail message sent to wikileaksorg requested that the docume nt be removed from the web site and that the

intelligence center ngic classified secretnoforn entitled u complex environments battle of fallujah i april 2004 ngic 1127 7138 06 the ngic report was the second in series of reports that analyzed recent war fare in complex environments such as urban environments see figure 2 the ngic report discusses enemy use of asymmetric tactics techniques and procedures ttp during the battle of fallujah in april 2004 and offers many useful lessons learned regarding how relatively weak adversary can prevent the united states from accomplishing its military objectives wikileaksorg claims the document was leaked by source it refers to as peryton who is described as former employee of ngic both copy of the actual ngic classified report in pdf and the wikileaksorg news article were posted on the wikileaksorg web site variety of newspapers wire services and other news and media organizations wrote numerous articles based on the original wikileaksorg news article and actual classified document posted to their web site 35 snf the possibility that current employee or mole may exist within dod or elsewhere in the us government who is actively providing sensitive or cla ssified information to wikileaksorg cannot be ruled out nevertheless the claim that the leaker is former ngic employee is highly suspect since wikileaksorg claims that the protection of the anonymity of the whistleblower or leaker is one of its primary concerns in addition this claim could simply be crude attempt to mislead investigations into who leaked the document use of code name incorrect employment information or incorrect status are most likely rudimentary opsec measures designed to protect the identity of the current or former insider who leaked the information in addition usage of present and past verb tenses and other contradictions in referencing peryton by the wikileaks author and staff personnel are most likely part of deliberate deception but one cannot completely rule out the possibility that some of these contradictions could be inadvertent opsec errors made by authors lacking experience in protecting their methods or sources snf unclassified mail addresses and work telephone numbers of the authors and other persons referenced in the ngic report were listed in the ngic document thus making them available to members of the news media attempting to verify the leaked information wikileaksorg and some other ne ws organizations did attempt to contact the ngic personnel by email or telephone to verify the information such efforts by wikileaksorg to verify the information are in contravention to its stated policy not to attempt to verify the information it recei ves from its sources wikileaksorg went forward with publishing their news article based on the classified ngic report although they did not receive response to their inquiry this is of interest because some journalists exploit the lack of response t their inquiries by implying that refusal to respond failure to respond to foia request or failure to verify or receive other information presumes that those failing to respond have something to hide this further weakens httpwikileaksorgﬁleusintelwikileakspdfsecretnoforn secretnoforn page 16 of 32 the claim that an alleged f ormer ngic employee leaked the information and strengthens other possibilities former ngic employee would be regarded by many as highly credible source and either taken at his or her word or asked to provide other bona fides to verify the employment claim given the high visibility and publicity associated with publishing this classified report by wikileaksorg however attempts to verify the information were prudent and show journalist responsibility to the newsworthiness or fair use of the classifie d document if they are investigated or challenged in court 36 secretnoforn u the following is descri ption of the map and explanation of the classification markings provided in the

information that was out of context from the actual ngic report the article intertwined classified information from the ngic report and information gleaned from other news artic in the open media to strengthen its portrayal of the coalition offensive operations in fallujah in 2004 as military and political defeat for the united states the leakage of this ngic report could allow anti coalition forces to portray themselves as victors because they successfully manipulated the media coverage in the april 2004 battle to divide the coalition forces politically and force halt to the offensive operations the leaked report could also provide foreign governments terrorists and in surgents with insight into successful asymmetric warfare tactics techniques and procedures that could be used when

that accessing the web site itself is crime and that shutting down or blocking access to the web site is reasonable countermeasure to prevent viewing or downloading of objectionable content this

wikileaksorg some believe that the leaking and posting of information is constitutionally protected free speech and supports freedom of the press open society initiatives and government accountability and that leaking the information serves the greater good versus any illegal acts that arise from the posting of sensitive or classified government or business information others believe that wikileaksorg or individual persons associated with wikileaksorg will face legal challenges in some countries regarding the privacy of individuals and businesses the revelation of sensitive or

its staff writers as journalists the contention by some is that wikileaksorg does not qualify as news organization and thus its staff writers are not journalists wikileaksorgs desire to expose alleged wrongdoing by revealing sensitive or classified government or business information in effect encourages the theft of sensitive or classified proprietary information or intellectual property in doing

foreign countries the alleged whistleblowers are in effect wittingly violating laws and conditions of employment and thus may not qualify as whistleblowers protected from disciplinary action or retaliation for reporting wrongdoing in countries that have such laws also the encouragement and rec eipt of stolen information or data is not considered to be an ethical journalistic practice in addition the sources of wikileaksorg staff writers are not verified nor are its news articles fact checked or confirmed by additional sources as customary i n news organizations moreover there is editorial review of the articles prior to publication finally some critics contend that the staff writers are biased and have made unsupportable claims to support political agendas to effect change in
