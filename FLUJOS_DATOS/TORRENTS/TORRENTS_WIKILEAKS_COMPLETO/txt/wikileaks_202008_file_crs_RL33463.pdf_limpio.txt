setting precedents and by demonstrating the real bene fits of free and fair trade5 the manner in which the administrati on chooses potential fta partners has been the subject of scrutiny by some mbers of congress traditionally regional and bilateral trade agreements have been negotiated for mixture of economic political and development reasons the uscanada freetrade agreement fta was primarily economic in nature recognizing the largest bilateral trade relationship in the world between two countries at similar stage of development the partnership with mexico to create nafta br ought in country at different stage of development and gave attention to trade as lever to encourage economic advancement it also had geopolitical rationale of encouraging stability in the us neighbor to the south the fta with israel was seen by supporters as an affirmation of us support for the jewish state while the fta with jordan could be seen as reward for jordans cooperation in the middle east peace process in may 2003 thenustr zoellick enumerat ed several factors used to evaluate countries seeking to negotiate trade agreements with the united states but he said there were formal rules or pro cedures to make the determination6 gao study released in january 2004 reported that an interagency process d been established to assess fta partners using six factors these factors include countrys readiness in terms of trade capabilities the maturity of its political and legal system and the will to implement reforms the economic benefit to the united states the countrys support of us trade
