take private lender to process the loan application it can vary by lender as an example citiassist normally gives an initial indication to the application within few minutes of receiving the online application when citiassist has approved the loan they will ask the university to certify that the course participant is accepted and about to enroll the university will normally receive the tuition payment from citiassist 12 weeks after the course participant submits the online loan application 5 when can the personal instruction be given to tm course participants using citiassist course participants should not receive personal instruction in the transcendental meditation technique until after the university receives the funds from the private lender the universitys tm course coordinator will immediately notify the applicable center and mved when the funds are in hand upon notification the center should enter the appropriate information in netsuite the university will send the funds directly to the bank account designated by mved what are the other types of loans other than citiassist can be used for this course you can use any private educational loan that is available for nondegree continuing education courses for example the us bank gap loan has lower interest rate it also has an upfront fee of 4 or 8 depending on your credit history the upfront fee is deducted from the loan disbursement so if you need 2000 and your upfront fee is 8 you must borrow 2174 even with this fee this loan might be less expensive than citiassist it depends on the interest rate and your credit history and the length of the loan as determined by the amount you borrow when the citiassist loan requires fee due to the credit history the fee is not deducted from the disbursement the fee is added to the repayment so for citiassist the amount you need is also the amount you would borrow this comparison table below is sample 2000 loan repaid 50 per month for about four years 1000 loan would be repaid 50 per month for about two years credit interest rate fee loan repayment payments gap loan us bank good tbill35 4 2083 2343 47 gap loan us bank fair tbill35 8 2174 2429 48
