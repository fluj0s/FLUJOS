comprehensive other crs reports discuss diffe rent aspects of budget pro cess reform in more detail1 the context of budget process reform the main impetus for budget process reform may arise from variety of sources congress initiated thorough overh aul of its internal budget process and ameliorated ongoing c onflicts with president richard nixon over the withholding of appropriated funds throu gh enactment of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1 974 presid ent bill clinton like many presidents before him requested lin eitem veto authority whic h congress granted in 1996 in the line item veto act but was invalidat ed by court action in 1998 state and local government officials were instrumental in securing passage of the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 finally special commissions such as the presidents national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission have recommended changes in budget structure and procedure that have been adopted citations to laws identified in this report are provided in the appendix perhaps more than any other factor over the years concern about the size and persistence of the federal ficit has animated calls for budget process reform the federal deficit which amounted to 162 billion for fy2007 jumped to 455 billion for fy2008 in the face of significant economic downturn2 media reports have indicated that the deficit for fy 2009 driven upward by further economic deterioration and the need for economic stabilization and stimu lus legislation may reach the 1 trillion level3 the dramatic

enacted over the past century and full legal citations to them is provided in crs report rl30795 general management laws compendium clinton t brass coordinatorpersistence at high levels in the short term can be expected to fuel strong interest in procedural reform the federal budget process is rooted in constitutional ma ndates statutory requirements house and sena rules and practices and administrative directives4 thus there are several avenues through which budget process changes can occur either chamber may focus on changes in its rules thereby minimizing the time needed to effect the change and the scale of potential conflict needed to be resolved but at the same time possibly minimizing the impact of the changes broader and potentially more consequential changes involving statutes or constitutional amendments may entail larger set of participants in the decisionmaking ie the other chamber the president state legislat ures likely escalating the effort required to reach agreement and lengthening the time period before the changes take effect legislative changes in the budget pro cess may take the form of freestanding bills or joint resolutions eg the line item veto act or may be incorporated into other budgetary legislation such as acts raising the debt limit eg the balanced budget and emergency deficit control ac t of 1985 also referred to as the gramm rudmanhollings act implementing reconciliation instructions eg the budget enforcement act of 1990 or providing annua l appropriations eg revisions in the senates cap on discretionary appropriations budget process changes also may be included in the annual budget resolution c oncurrent resolution or in simple house or senate resolutions in some years changes made in the budg et process were comprehensive the budget and accounting act of 1921 establis hed the executive budget process the congressional budget act of 1974 created th congressional budget process and the balanced budget and emergency defi cit control act of 1985 and the budget enforcement act of 1990 imposed additiona l budget controls on temporary basis5 in other years such as 1987 1993 and 1997 existing budget process statutes were modified in less comprehensive fashion and extended for limited periods at other times congress and the president enacted statutes changing only selected aspects of the budget process the line item veto act of 1996 is one example finally in every congress the house and senate ve modified existing rules and practices affecting the budget process nd sometimes instituted new ones like other types of legislation statut making changes in the budget process are subject to review by the judiciary in several major instances the supreme court has declared procedures established by c ongress and the president to be invalid on constitutional grounds the onehouse gislative veto found in many actshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33818crs3 6 for detailed discussion regarding the changes in

president may successfully modify legislation eg 1987 legislation modi fying the grammrudmanhollings act vesting the authority to trigger sequester in the director of the office of management and budget but sometimes persistent efforts to enact corrective legislation do not succeed eg lineitem veto proposals given that nearly every committee of the house and senate has jurisdiction over legislation with budgetary impact intere st in the budget process and proposals to change it radiate throughout both chambe rs although jurisdiction over executive and congressional budget proce dures generally resides with the budget oversight and government reform and rules committees in the house and with the budget homeland security and governmental affairs and rules and administration committees in the senate other house and senate committees particularly the appropriations and tax committ ees may exert influence over budget process changes affecting their legislative interests the first action in the 110th congress to change budget procedures occurred on the second day of session january 5 2007 the house which unlike the senate is not continuous body must adopt its rules anew at the beginning of each congress traditionally the house adopts its rule s from the previous congress with modifications that may include changes in the budget process in the form of simple resolution the rules package for the 110th congress hres 6 contained several changes in the budget process including payasyougo paygo rule for the house discussed below6 second opportunity for budget process changes came in march and april of 2007 when the two chambers considered the budget resolution for fy2008 sconres 21 hconres 99 under author ity referred to as the elastic clause in section 301 of the 1974 congressional b udget act either chamber may include procedural provisions in the annual budget resolution that are consistent with the purposes of the 1974 act the two chambe rs

section 521 new senate rule xliv on earmarking and 3 hres 491 adopted by the house on june 18 2007 measure dealing with the inclusion of earmarks in conference reports on regular appropriations acts that were not submitted to the conference by either chamber congress also may express its interest in the budget process in venues that do not involve legislative activity in th past consideration in the senate of nominations to the position of director of the office of management and budget often has afforded the opportunity to discu ss budget process reforms following his announcement on june 19 2007 that omb dir ector rob portman would resign in august president george w bush indicated that he would nominate jim nussle former chairman of the house budget committee to the position nominations to the position of omb director are cons idered pursuant to sres 445 108th cong by both the senate budget committee and the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee the senate confirmed the nussle nomination on september 4 2007 by vote of 6924 lthough budget process changes were not prominent part of the debate in committee and on the floor paygo requirement and other procedural matters were discussed briefly selected budget process reform proposals among the various budget process reform proposals that have been acted on during the 110th congress or that are under disc ussion many pertain to categories such as internal paygo rules in the house and senate restorati on of the statutory discretionary spending limits and paygo requirement earmarking and modifications to budget resolution reconc iliation and appr opriations processes in order to illustrate the divers ity of proposals these and ot her categories of reform are discussed briefly below paygo rules and discretionary spending limits for fy1991 through fy2002 federal budget legisla tion was constrained by statutory limits on discretionary spending and paygo require ment for direct spending sometimes referred to as mandatory spending and revenue legisl ation both these budget constraints were established by the budg et enforcement act of 1990 which amended the balanced budget and emergency defi cit control act of 1985 the discretionary spending limits and the paygo requirement were enforced by sequestration process by which violations were remedied by automa tic acrosstheboard spending cuts these statutory budget constraint s were extended in 1993 and 1997 and further modified by other legislation but the discretionary spending limits expired at thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33818crs5 7 the house budget committee held hearing on the matter perspectives on renewing statutory paygo on july 25 2007 8 for review of these efforts see crs report rl32835 paygo rules for budget enforcement in the house and senate by robert keith and bill heniff jr archivedend of fy2002 and the paygo requirement ffectively was terminated in december 2002 in recent years there has been considerable interest in restoring and possibly making significant modifications to the statutory enforcement procedures7 some observers have argued that the budget enfo rcement mechanisms associated with the bea promoted fiscal discipline throughout the 1990s and contributed to the federal government achieving total budget surplus in fy1998 the first in almost 30 years and the following three fiscal years with the return of deficits some have argued for restoring such statutory mechanisms for fiscal discipline principal point of contention with regard to the paygo requirement is whether it should appl to revenue legisl ation while some maintain that revenue re ductions should not face the hurdle of statutory paygo requirement because they are needed to continue the economic growth that fuels growing revenues others assert that acco mmodating further revenue reductions in paygo requirement ie by applying it only to direct spending likely would undermine efforts to achieve significant ficit reduction in part by encouraging some spending initiatives to be reformulated as revenuelosing provisions the fy2008 budget resolutions included senseofthecongress statement that statutory paygo requi rement should be reinstated to help control the deficit section 508 of sconres 21 in the case of the statutory limits on discretionary spending one issue has been the period of time for which they should be established advocates of two or three year limits argue that the fiveyear framework employed earlier leads to limits that are too unrealistic in the later years due to changing circumstances limits that are unrealistically high fail to impose discipline while limits that are unrealistically low encourage evasions through gimmickry and other means shorter term limits they argue are more apt to be realistic and effective constr aints on spending as supplement to the st atutory paygo requirement the senate established its own paygo rule in 1993 as provision in the fy1994 budget resolution the rule which operates differently than th statutory requirement has been modified several times over the years several unsuccessful fforts were made to establish paygo rule in the house8 as indicated previously paygo rule was contained in title iv section 405 of the houses rules package for the 110th congress hres 6 title iv was considered separate ly and adopted by the house on january 5 2007 by vote of 280152 all five titles of h res 6 were adopted by the house and took effect on that day the houses paygo rule im poses bar against revenue and direct spending legislation that increases deficit or reduces surplus over different timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33818crs6 9 the new rule is discussed in more detail

senate re vised its paygo rule as part of the fy2008 budget resolution section 201 of sconres 21 th revised senate rule conforms closely to the new house rule applying to the same two time periods and eliminating any exception for revenue or direct spending proposals assumed in the budget resolution it expires on september 30 201710 the revised senate paygo rule is buttr essed by another rule in the fy2008 budget resolution section 203 of sc onres 21 that would prohibit the consideration of legislation increasing the deficit by more than 5 billion in any of the four 10year periods covering fy 2018fy2057 the pending budget resolution for fy2009 would revise this rule by ba rring any deficit increases ie without regard to threshold in any of the four 10year periods beginning with fy2019 both the paygo rule and the longterm defi cits rule can be waived only by the affirmative vote of threefifths of the membership 60 senators if seats are vacant earmarking reform of congressional earmark ing practices in appropriations direct spending and tax legislation nd accompanying reports was considered in 2006 by the house and senate but the two ch ambers did not come to resolution of the issue the issue has been addressed again by both chambers during the 110th congress11 while definitions of earmarking vary an earmark generally is considered to be an allocation of resources to specificallytargeted beneficiaries either through earmarks of discretionary or direct spending limited tax benefits or limited tariff benefits earmarks may be proposed by the president or may be originated by congress concern about existing earmarkin g practices arose because some of them were inserted into legislation or accompan ying reports without any identification of the sponsor and the belief that many earma rks were not subject to proper scrutiny and diverted resources to lesserprior ity items or items without sufficient justification thereby contributing to wasteful spending or revenue loss the essential feature of earmark re form proposals is bar against the consideration of legislation that does not identify individual earmarks and the members who sponsored them the

aggreg ate spending and revenue levels and spending levels by major functional categorie s for at least five fiscal years the budget resolution which is concurrent resolution and therefore does not become law provides an overall budget plan that guides congressional action on individual spending revenue and btlimit measures the 1974 act includes an optional reconciliation procedure that provides for the development and consideration of revenue spending and debt limit legislation to carry out budget resolution policies enforcement of budget resolution policies so occurs by means of various points of order that may be raised on the floor budget resolutions and reconciliation measures are considered under expedited procedures in both chambers some members of congress as well as the president have argued that the budget resolution would be more effective in enforcing budget policy by making it joint resolution requiring the presidents approval joint budget resolution would directly involve the president in congre ssional actions on the budget early in the process if the president and congress r each an impasse on joint budget resolution however some are concerned that action on spending and revenue bills might be significantly delayed during the 1980s and much of the 1990s reconciliation was us ed principally as means of reducing the deficit while some reconciliation measures included spending increases or reve nue reductions the net impact of the legislation was to reduce the deficit in recent years the reconciliation process s been used mainly to expedite the passage of legislation that increases the deficit primarily through revenue reduction some members in the house and senate have argued that the reconciliation process should be altered so that it may be used only to reduce the deficit as part of the changes in the budget process included in the rules package for the 110th congress hres 6 the house include d ban in section 402 against the consideration of budget resolution contai ning reconciliation dir ectives that would increase the deficit or reduce the surplus over the sixyear or 11year periods beginning with the current fiscal

rescission powers for the president contend that such tools will enhance budgetary discipline critics suggest that their usefulness for budgetary discip line is overstated and that they may adversely affect the balance of power between congress and the president over budget decisions the senate considered legislative lineitem veto proposal in the 110th congress in the form of an amendment offe red
