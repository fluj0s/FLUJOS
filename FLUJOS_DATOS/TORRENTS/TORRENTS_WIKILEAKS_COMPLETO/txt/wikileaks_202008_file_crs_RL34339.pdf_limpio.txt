resources science and industry division june 20 2008 abstract congress has reauthorized or amended this act eight times since 1972 responding to changing issues combined with continuing interest in assisting states to manage their coastal resources participants also have adjusted their programs to reﬂect their changing priorities since 1999 when the most recent reauthorization expired congress repeatedly has considered but not enacted reauthorization language reauthorization has proven diﬃcult in part because the numerous stakeholders broadly consisting of three groups participants use and development interests and environmental interests have divergent views about possible changes to the current approach and about which topics should be emphasized or eliminated from the purview of coastal management since the law expired in 1999 the context in which reauthorization legislation could be considered continues to change these changes include events such as hurricane katrina in 2005 new information such as knowledge about places in coastal waters where biological activity ceases during some seasons called dead zones trends such as rising energy prices climate change and implementation of other federal programs addressing coastal topics two reauthorization bills have been introduced in the 110th congress s 1579 the coastal zone enhancement reauthorization act of 2007 and hr 5451 the coastal zone reau thorization act of 2008 both bills would increase authorization levels for the coastal zone management programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339 order code rl34339

divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339coastal zone management background and reauthorization issues summary the coastal zone management act czm was first enacted in 1972 at time when coordinated land use pl anning was generally supporte d in congress planning was seen as central to protecting natural resources while fostering wise development in the coastal zone since 1972 pressure s for both preservation and development have grown more intense as people continue to migrate to coastal areas to take advantage of economic opportun ities to retire and to pur sue recreational interests as economic activities continue to concentrate in coastal locations and as natural resources are threatened by the magnitude and location of these changes the czma recognizes that many of these pressures are not compatible and also that states and in some states local government have the lead responsibility for planning and managing their coastal zones the czma authorizes grants to states to develop and implement coastal management programs to address these pressures the concepts behind the program combined with the mode st grants have attracted 34 of the 35 eligible states and territories to particip ate although authorization for appropriations expired after fy1999 congress conti nues to fund this program congress has reauthorized or ame nded this act ei ght times since 1972 responding

participant 2 3 acknowledgment this report was originally written by retired crs specialist jeffrey zinnhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339coastal zone management background and reauthorization issues introduction economic activity and people are increasingly concentrated in the coastal zone as are important and often fragile natural resources one way to address the resulting conflicts is through coordina ted planning that attempts to foster wise development while protecting natural resources in r ecent decades pressures for both preservation and development have grown more intense at many loca tions as people continue to migrate to coastal areas to take advantage of economic opportunities to retire and to pursue recreational interests as economic activities continue to concentrate in coastal locations and as coastal natural re sources such as estuaries beach systems and wetlands are threatened by the magnitude and location of these changes views about how the coastal zone mig ht be managed are also shaped by recent events such as hurricane katrina and other natural di sasters by new information such as knowledge about the socalled dead zones where biological activity ceases during portion of the year and by current trends such as the health of the economy and rising energy prices as well as by views about the appropriate role for the federal government in land use planning includi ng uses and activitie s on nonfederal lands the coastal zone management act czma pl 92 532 16 us c 1451 1464 was enacted in 1972 at time when congress was considering options to res pond to widespread public concern about estu arine and oceanfront degradation at the same time it was also considering general national land use planning legislation to foster state and local planning capacity and coordination bills were reported by senate committees in 1970 and 1972 and passe d the senate in 1972 s 632 in the 92nd congress but not enacted many in congress concluded that the challenges that national land use planning legisla tion was intended to address were most concentrated in coastal areas and needed immediate attention the result was the czma enacted with promise by some c ongressional leaders to continue to pursue national land use legislation these leaders st ated that they intended to fold coastal management into this more encompassing legislation at later date comprehensive land use planning legisla tion was never enacted and congress has not ventured beyond the czma with this approach to resource planning and management nevertheless since 1972 many of the tre nds that called cong ressional attention to need for this legislation have continued to grow coastal population central to many of these trends is increasing coastal population the number of people in coasta l counties continues to grow increasing by 33 million between 1980 and 2008 about 53 of the countrys population is estimated to live in the 673 coastal c ounties which is about 21 of all counties other measures of concentration are that 23 of the 25 most densely populated counties in 2003 were coastal and about onequarter of all seasonal homes are foundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339crs2 1 additional information about coastal popul ation trends can be found in march 2005 report from noaa titled population trends along the coastal united states19802008 2 state definitions of their coastal zones vary widely from narrow band california for example is limited to band 1000 yards inland from the mean high tide line to the entire state florida for example also some st ates use political boundaries while others use distance from the shore finally several stat including florida and connecticut use tiers to distinguish land closer to the coast from other landin coastal florida1 using coastal counties to measure the concentration of people and development greatly understates th degree of concentration b ecause in many counties both are most heavily centered along the immediate coastline which is the preferred site for highvalue housing and the location of many service and recreational businesses si gnificant byproduct of this pattern is that shoreline development has modified beach systems and other coastal landscapes in some more rural coastal counties very high tion of the county tax base is often on the immediate coast pressures on natural resources caused by the degradation that can accompany this development pattern have been documented repeatedly looking at coastal population at the scale of states almost 82 of the countrys population lived in coastal states and territories according to the 2000 census in many of these however only portion of the state is in the coastal zone especially in larger states that extend far inla nd total state population and coastal zone population as defined by each st ate that participates in the federal coastal program are shown for each listed participant in the third column of the table in appendix c 2 according to the office of ocean and coastal resources management ocrm in the national oceanic and atmospheric ad ministration noaa an agency of the department of commerce where the federa l coastal program is administered about 11 of the area of the country is in these defined coastal zone areas however these coastal areas are home to more than 41 of the countrys population that also means that more than twice as many people live in coastal states but outside the coastal zone about 40 of the total as live in noncoastal states about 18 of the total coastal environmental threats in the 35 years since the czma was enacted some of the trends leading to its enactment have been slowed or reversed but many have not and new issues have appeared for example development continues in coastal areas but in many locations more recent development includes environmental considerati ons from protecting dunes and beaches to treating water that were not part of coastal developments more than 30 years ago one example of new issue is the growing awareness that sea levels will continue to rise according to most experts intensifying the xposure of property and people to hazardous conditions associated with majo r storms therefore if the czma had never been enacted and one were to cons ider enacting new czma today it might take different form and be focused on somewhat different collection of coastal topics czma incentives the czma creates structure where the 35 eligible states and territories participants can choose to apply for relatively m odest federal grants from the ocrm these grants can be us ed to address numerous coastal topicshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339crs3 3 section 305 grants are longer authorized as almost all eligible participants had developed approved programs by 1990 4 federal funding has totaled about 100 million annually in most recent years according to data compiled by the office of ocean and coastal resource management appendix c lists the total dollar amounts going to each participant in fy2007 5 the eligible state that does not ve an approved program is illinois 6 nonpoint source pollution enters surface ndor groundwater from diffuse or unconfined sources and typically occurs as result of precipitation events examples might include runoff from impervious surfaces and from land rfaces in contrast point source pollution refers to discharges from such facilities as factories and sewage treatment plants 7 the act as amended is reproduced at http wwwcoasta lmanagementnoaagovczm czm_acthtmlunder the original law section 305 provide d matching grants for up to three years to help fund initial preparation of coastal management plans3 while participation is voluntary two incentives provided throug h the czma have attracted considerable interest one incentive is the modest financ ial assistance in the form of grants under several sections of the law to implement their plans4 participants have developed widely varying programs that emphasize di fferent topics within the rather general components identified in the law and defi ned in greater detail in regulation second incentive is the federal consiste ncy provision in section 307 which gives participants leverage with the federal g overnment by requiring that any federal actions in or affecting the coastal zone be consistent with the coastal plan after it has been approved by noaa these incentives pparently have had the intended effect as 34 participants are administeri ng federally pproved programs5 provisions in the czma review of the enacted reauthoriza tion legislation briefly summarized in appendix b shows that the underlying approach of the program have changed little even though the topics addressed thr ough the programs have evolved as noted above the approaches have remained vol untary with the notable exception of the section 6217 program to ddress nonpoint source water pollution discussed below which was not enacted as an amendment to the czma and participants continue to have wide latitude in what issues they choose to emphasize when implementing their programs6 the major provisions in current law are briefly summarized below appendix contains summary of the conten ts of every provision in the czma provisions in the czma the basic approaches and procedures that were established in the initial law and in implementing regulations have been retained even though the czma has been amended eight times since 1972 these amendments responded to evolutionary changes in national coastal issues for example amendments in 1976 and 1978 ddressed concerns about th potential environmental and coastal development impacts of accelerated and expanded offshore energy development major provisions in t odays czma as amended include the following7 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339crs4 section 303 is declaration of policy it identifies six purposes of the act including to preserve protect develop nd where possible to restore or enhance resources of the coastal zone to assist states in implementing management plans for at least 11 listed purposes to encourage special area management plans to improve predictable decisionmaking to encour age intergovernmental cooperation to encourage intergovernmental sharing of information and to respond to changing circumstances affecting coastal environments section 306 authorizes grants to participants to implement approved programs programs are required to contain nine sp ecified elements and the participant must meet numerous specified proce dural and substantive require ments procedures to be followed when participants modify or amend their programs are specified section 306a establishes the coastal resources improvement program which provides matching grants to participants to 1 preserve or restore resources that meet certain qualifications 2 redevelop urban waterfronts 3 improve access to coastal areas such as beaches and 4 provide pr ocess to develop aqu aculture facilities section 307 authorizes the federal consiste ncy provisions which require that each participant be given th opportunity to certify that all federal actions in or affecting its defined coastal zone are cons istent with its federally approved coastal management program it also includes provisions for coordi nation and cooperation and authorizes the use of sp ecial area management planning section 308 establishes fund to make loans to 1 address regional issues 2 initiate demonstration projects 3 respond to emergencies and disasters 4 fund awards that recognize exce llence see section 314 and 5 support the analysis and application of the public trust doctrine section 309 authorizes coastal zone enhancement grants for nine specified purposes including 1 protecting and enha ncing wetlands 2 ddressing natural hazards 3 improving coastal access 4 reducing marine debris 5 developing procedures to address the secondary eff ects of coastal development 6 fostering special area management planning 7 planning for ocean resources and 89 facilitating energyrelated activities and aquaculture facilities section 315 establishes the national estuarine research reserve system sites in this system nominated by participants are used as research and education centers system goal is to use sites in every coastal biogeographic region for comparative research projects in addition to the czma closely rela ted program called the coastal nonpoint source pollution control program czara was enacted in section 6217 of the coastal zone reauthorization act amendments of 1990 in the omnibus reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 title vi section 6217 104 stat 1388 314 czara is freestanding law rather than an amendment to the czma it requires czm participants to develop coastal nonpoint source pollution control programs as part of their coastal management efforts it identifies program contents the approval process and what portion of federal coastal zone and water pollution assistance could be lost for noncompliance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339crs5 8 conversation with federal office of ocean and coastal resource management ocrm staff nov 14 2007implementing the czma federal funding for coastal zone management after participant plans are federally approved funds from total of five accounts become available through the czma the office of ocean and coastal resource management in noaa administers these accounts these account s include three ty pes of management grants funds to address nonpoint source pollution and support fo r participation in the national estuarine research reserve system the basic management grant to implement the program is provided under section 306 section 306a added in 1980 provides additional grants to participants who are satisfactorily implementing their programs to address four specific topi cs listed above section 309 added in its current form in the 1990 amendments provides grants for nine specified enhancement areas also listed bove on competitive basis total funding for these three grant prog rams was last authorized at 505 million in fy1999 percentage or dollar amount is specified for the section 306 or section 306a grants and between 10 and 20 of the total appr opriated for section 306 and section 306a is to be made available for secti on 309 grants up to an annual ceiling of 10 million in fy2008 cong ress provided 644 million to implement these programs fourth source of grants was added in 1990 with enactment of the czara to more effectively manage nonpoint source water pollution that degrades coastal waters czara was enacted in conjunc tion with the 1990 czma amendments but is freestanding law rather than an amendment to the czma the program provides implementati on and planning grants annual funding has decreased in recent years from nearly 10 milli on to approximately 3 million the estuarine research reserve system authorized by section 315 of the czma and currently consisting of 27 units receives funding for land acquisition and facility construction and for operations operations incl udes research and education programs and coastal monitoring total funding in fy2007 was 255 million and in many recent years about 60 of the total has been used for acquisition and construction all funding for acquisition nd construction is earmarked for specific units the consistenc provisions the consistency provisions in section 307 require that each participant be given the opportunity to certify th at all federal actions in or affecting its defined coastal zone be consistent with its federally approved coastal management program federal ac tions include not only construction projects but also financial assistance and the issuing of federal licenses and permits historically states have c oncurred with about 95 of th federal actions they have been asked to certify8 however when participant disagrees with the federal agency proposing an action as to whether that action will be consistent with the participants plan therehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339crs6 9 all data summarized in this paragraph can be found at httpcoastalmanagementnoaa govconsistencyresourceshtml the site was visited november 20 2007 and the data were last updated september 20 2007 10 biogeographical regions are

wwwnerrsnoaagovbackground_bioregionshtmlis an appeals process if agreement is not reached during any of the steps in this process final determinati on is made by the secretary of commerce to date 40 consistency decisions have been subjects of these secretarial determinations and an additional 61 have been settled or withdrawn after they reach the secretarial level but before determination is made9 of the 40 decisions 27 have been made in favor of the participant and 13 in favor of the applicant the subject of 16 of these appeals has been offshore energy activities and half of these 8 have been decided in favor of the participant the most recent decision filed in late 2002 with secretarial decision announced in may 2005 was about proposed natural gas pipeline opposed by the state of connecticut in this instance the secretary overrode the state determination currently f our appeals are pending it is widely believed that the existen ce of the consistency requirement and the uncertainty of the outcome of an appeal have led applicants to negotiate with states and to modify proposed actions early on thereby reducing the number of appeals however there are data on the number of proposed actions that have been altered because of the consistency process the national estuarine research reserve system the national estuarine research reserve system is network of protected areas nominated and administered by participants the areas are protected as sites for longterm and comparative research education and stew ardship the federa l program provides matching funds to acquire sites up to maximum of 5 million it provides 70 of the funds for operating and managing th reserves as well as construction of facilities and activities re lated to education the national system was set up to include sites representing each of 11 coastal biogeographical regions and 29 subbiogeogr aphical regions that are found in the coastal united states10 to date 27 units have been designated in 19 subbiogeographical regi ons units have been designated since 1974 the first was south slough oregon the most recent designation was made in may 2006 missionaransas texas the system encompasses 11 million acres of estuarine lands and waters and coasta l wetlands the sites range in size from 571 acres old woman creek ohio to 365000 acres kachemak alaska monitoring and evaluati ng participant programs information about participant programs is gathered during pe riodic evaluations these evaluations are conducted on multiyear cycle generally every three years ocrm has the discretion to schedule evaluati ons more frequently if it s concerns that warrant followup review sooner years in which the most recent evaluations were conducted are listed in the fourth column of the table in appendix c for fy2008 noaa has scheduled nine programs for evaluation these evaluations are among the sourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339crs7 11 for more detailed summary of recent evaluations see czma section 312 evaluation summary report 2006 available at httpwwwcoasta lmanagementnoaagovsuccess media312summaryreport2006pdfof information that ocrm draws on when it summarizes the activities and accomplishments of participants and the federal program in biennial report to congress11 the most recent repor t covered fy2004 and fy2005 the ocrm evaluates each states accomplishments only against the goals of that states program rather than against broader criteria applied to all participants in addition the ocrm has developed system of national indicators called the performance measurement system this system provides information on some program characteristics for all participants ocrms participant evaluations appear never to result in either perfect rating or failing rating that is participant is concluded to be successfully doing everything to fully implement its program or to be performing so poorly that the participan t is threatened with reduction or loss of federal funds instead eval uations always show where participants could be doing something more or could make adjustments to be more successful to date program has lost its funding although at l east one state califor nia reportedly was once threatened with loss of funding about two decades ago participant approaches to coastal zone management the general language of the czma and ocrms implementation of it have given participants the eligible states and territories great latitude in both how to participate in the federal program and what topics they em phasize participan ts have used this flexibility to organize and administer their programs in many different ways and emphasize different topics among the variations disc ussed below are relationships between state and local levels of govern ment which program elements are being emphasized and where the program is situated in each participants government one major variation from participant to participant is how responsibilities are divided between the state and local levels of government in some participant states such as washington which administers th first coastal management program that was federally approved the coastal program is largely administered at the local level by county and city governments in othe r participant states such as rhode island the state level of governme nt retains responsibility for implementing most or all of the program these differences appear to mostly reflect relationships between levels of government over planni ng responsibilities and natura l resource management that were established long before the czma wa s enacted it does not appear that any participant has significantly altered these basic relationships to accommodate coastal management program second variation is the selection of pr ogram elements that participants choose to emphasize california for example is widely recognized in the coastal community for the great attention that it has given to beach access it has prepared detailed maps to show public access points how they can be reached and opportunities for car parking also it has bought or obtained easements to additional corridors to increase the number of access points this is not to imply that california works only on beach access through its program most participants emphasize severalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339crs8 elements at any time however the diversity of coastal concerns among all participants is demonstrated by the fact that almost every authorized czma program element has been emphasized by some participants each biennial report to congress is re plete with examples of participant activities some include brief overview for each participant and others provide examples for each theme identified in the 20042005 report common themes identified include the challenges of reduced funding the growing need for interstate coordination and cooperation the concern about public access in most programs evolving efforts to address water quality issues and not surprisingly efforts to plan for coastal hazards much of the disc ussion in this report is organized around discussions of each of the six major goals of coastal management termed focus areas that the ocrm has identified each of these discussions includes number of participant activities nd success stories these areas include coastal habitats coastal hazards coastal water quality public access coastal community development and protecting water dependent uses and revitalizing urban waterfronts third variation is the placement of the program in the participants organizational structure few participan ts such as california have created an independent coastal mana gement agency most participants have nested their coastal programs within established agencies or offices the broader responsibilities for these lead agencies range from protection of natural or living resources or environmental protection and regulation to planning fo r some participants the program is directed by the governors offi ce rather than by an agency with other program administration res ponsibilities where programs are placed within state government provides strong indication of how that par ticipant approaches coastal management because these agencies and offices tend to emphasize the topics and issues that are already part of their responsib ilities within the administering agencies or offices some participants ve created independent units that address only coastal management topics while othe rs have assigned coastal management to units that already had other responsibilities the second column of the table in appendix c lists the lead agency or agencies administering the coastal program for each participant regional cooperation there are limited numbe r of cooperative efforts and fewer than might be expected at time when partnerships and coordination are hallmarks of governance especially if one is looking for formal cooperative agreements the largest multistate coopera tive coastal efforts appear to be the chesapeake bay program and the great lakes program these are also perhaps the oldest continuous cooperative efforts the lead agency at the federal level for both is the environmental protection agency but many other federal agencies among them noaa and all the states in both waters heds participate in the case of the chesapeake bay program the states of virginia and maryland reportedly have significant portions of their coastal program efforts in activities that also contributehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339crs9 12 for more information on this issue see crs report rl34326 apalachicola chattahoocheeflint acf drought fede ral reservoir and species management coordinated by nicole t carter 13 for more information on hypoxia see crs report 98869 marine dead zones understanding the problem by eugene h buck 14 special area management plan is defined in section 304 of the czma and is identified as one of nine coastal zone enhancement objectives in section 309a of the act to the goals of bay restoration for exampl both states have estuarine reserve units in the bay that are important research nd education centers however chesapeake bay restoration efforts are not managed by the coastal progra ms in either state there likely are additional opportunities fo r cooperative efforts where either river or an estuary is boundary between two states and where co astal state is part of multistate watershed an example of the first type of situation is in oregon and washington which share the columbia rive r as boundary both states appear to work toward compatible goals for the wer reach and mouth of the river but formal coordination currently exists an example of the second type of situation is in the southeast where florida georgia and mississippi are attempting to find mutually acceptable ways to deal with drought in the apalachicolachattahoochee flint river watershed which threatens th water supply for atlanta however remedies for atlanta in turn may threaten endangered and commercially and recreationally valuable species in the coastal florida portion of the drainage12 the czma does not require or ca ll for coordination either between coastal states or between coastal and noncoastal states pr ovisions in section 307 that addressed that topic were deleted in th 1986 reaut horization pl 99272 and the record that accompanied this reauthorization provides explanation for this change section 307 is now limited to addressi ng coordination and coopera tion between participants and the federal community the question of how coastal states and their coastal zones are affected by activities in inland states has become more visible in recen t years as topics like the hypoxia zone in the gulf of mexico ve received more publicity it is widely believed that this zone which is depleted of oxygen and therefore of marine life for part of the year is result of an influx of nutrients associated with agricultural and land management activ ities throughout the mississippi river drainage the largest and most concentrated source of nutrients is the corn belt more than thousand miles away according to analysis c onducted by the us geological survey13 similar but less extensive such zone is found in other coastal areas such as the main drainage channel of the chesapeake bay in this instance the sources of nutrients are concentrated in states upstream in the watershed especially in pennsylvania special area management plans samps samps are resource management plans and implementation programs for discrete areas where complex coastal issues are concentrated14 samps are supposed to improve the predictability and transparency of government decisionmaking in actions such as permitting by clarifying what activities and actions will be allowed at sites where multiple options are possible this is accomplished by combination of refining general coastalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339crs10 15 information on the status of each particip ants czara plan can be found at http www coastalmanagementnoaagovnonpointpro_approvalhtml 16 for more information on success stories see httpwwwcoasta lmanagementnoaagov nonpointsuccesshtmlpolicies improving intera gency coordination and recognizing the cumulative impacts of multiple actions that may seem innocuous on casebycase basis samps can be challenging to develop as the plan development requires flexibility and commitment from all parties that will be involved in implementing it in some instances the effort to develop the plan has not reached successful conclusion especially where the issues it seeks to address are complex and involve large number of agencies and other parties samps have been used for more than two decades under the czma since the initial effort in grays har bor washington started many states participating in the coastal management progra m have successfully devel oped samps to address such diverse topics as water front revitalization hab itat protecti on water quality improvements and other topics that are more generally addressed through participants coastal management programs nonpoint source water pollution in coastal areas congress has directed the coastal zone management effort to more aggressive ly address one topic over all others nonpoint water pollution by implementing the coastal zone act reauthorization amendments czara provisions enacted in 1990 the czara provisions require participants implementing an approved coastal program to prepare an additional program element to address nonpoint source pollution to restore and protect coastal waters the secretary of commerce and administrator of the environmental protection agency must approve each participants program element czara may be considered regulatory unlike the remainder of the coastal management program because if participant does not submit plan it risks losing up to 30 of its basic coastal manage ment program funding from noaa and up to 30 of its section 319 funds nonpoint s ource pollution management grants under the clean water act from epa all participants have s ubmitted plans and received c onditional approval and 19 have received full approval15 participants have deci ded to drop out of the federal coastal program rather than work to implement this requi rement noaa and epa have not rejected any plans but have indicated that th ey might impose future funding cuts on states that do not address issues th at would enable the plan to be approved the federal ocrm identifies participant success stories addre ssing six sources of polluted runoff agriculture forestry urban marinas hydromodification and wetlands and riparian areas16 however accomplishments have been limited because of several factors the most prominent of these factors is generally perceived lack of federal funding as cu rrent annual funding levels are about 10 million for all participants which is small portion of the much higher costs to fully implement their programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339crs11 reauthorizing the czma status and issues since the czma was last reauthoriz ed in 1996 interest in policies and programs that address coasta l topics has grown bringing additional attention to some elements of coastal management efforts coastal and ocean topics have been elevated among policy makers through th work of two recent national commissions one of these commissions the pew oceans commission was established in april 2000 and released its final report americas living oceans charting course for sea change on june 4 2003 this report incl uded 26 recommendations within six categories and two of those categories titled preserving our coasts and cleaning coastal waters deal with topics addressed in coastal management efforts the second commission the us commission on ocean policy was created by legislation enacted in 2000 pl 106256 this commission issued its final report an ocean blueprint for the 21st century in september 2004 the commission made 212 recommendations includi ng 13 critical actions many of these recommendations have coastal component in september 2006 noaa and the coastal states organization cso group that represents participants in the federal coastal zone management program released report titled discussion paper current and fu ture challenges for coastal management this report is more focused on coastal topics but draws on the work of the two commissions among other sources according to the authors it identifies 28 topics and for each topic provides brief introduction and identifies some key questions and possible approaches noaa and the cso are each reportedly developing possible czma reauthorization legislation based in part on the contents of this discussion paper topics identified as specific challenges for coastal management include governance issues federal coordi nation interstate and regional collaboration local government involvement and nongovernmental organizations and the priv ate sector pa rtnerships resource and management issu habitat conservation and restoration nonpoint source po llution cean resources management coastal hazards promoting ec onomic growth and sustainable development public acce ss climate change marine commerce and transportation invasive species and knowledge and understanding and decision s upport res ource assessments science to support management and providing tools and technologies the public also has become more aware of coastal issues informed by widespread press coverage of specific events like hurricane katrina and more general trends such as the reported incr eased frequency of hurricane formation sea level rise fishery stock d eclines and expanding areas of socalled dead zones associated with hypoxia each of the i ssues discussed below may be largely viewed by the public and congress as freestanding topic but several themes connect them including where they occur the effectiveness of existing programs and policies in addressing them and limited ability to deal with their interrelated characteristics growing recognition of these themes c ould prompt policy makers to devote morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339crs12 attention to coastal management issues pecially if specific events trigger greater attention and interest the topics discussed below are selected issues that are currently receiving attention this is by means complete list of issues which continue to evolve nationally and the importance of each issue may be viewed differently from place to place the discussion below centers on how coastal zone management efforts currently recognize and try to address each issue and what changes in policy have been proposed to enhance those efforts for some of these topics coastal management could be central or critical policy response while for others it could be one of multiple components in how the topic is addressed these issues are addressed in some of the more than two dozen reauthorization proposals that have been introduced ce the czma authorization expired in 1999 none of these legislative proposals has been enacted most of these proposals would have made modest rather than major changes to the current law they all would have increased funding levels for at least so components of the coastal management effort and many would have made ad justments to the purposes of coastal management two reauthorization bills have been introduced in the 110th congress s 1579 the coastal zone enhancement reauthoriz ation act of 2007 introduced by senator snowe and hr 5451 the coastal zone reauthorization act of 2008 introduced by representative bordallo on june 4 2008 the house committee on natural resources subcommittee on fisheries wildlife and oceans voted to pass hr 5451 substitute amendment was introdu ced and approved with language from three previously introduced bills hr 5453 which would provide grants to coastal states to develop climate change adaptations plans to prepare for the negative consequences of climate change hr 3223 which would establish working waterfronts grant program hr 5452 which would establish grant program to encourage coastal states to voluntarily plan for renewable energy projects the subcommittee also approved an amendmen t to that would re vise and update the national estuarine reserve system senate and house versions of the bill would increase authorization levels for the coastal zone manage ment program coastal natural hazards and sea level rise coastal hazards are receiving more attention for several reasons these include reported increase in the number of hurricanes in recent years the devastation along the central gulf coast and on the florida peninsula caused by several recent hurricanes effects on the coastal zone from anticipated rates and patterns of sea level rise and continued investment in coastal development coastal zone management program participants address these topics through general polic ies to manage coastal development so ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339crs13 to limit threats that could result in the loss of life and property participant programs are intended to be part of any effort s to discourage unwise development in flood prone and exposed areas and to encourage protection of natura l protective features along the coast including beach systems coastal barriers and wetlands while addressing coastal hazards is primarily the responsibility of floodplain programs and emergency programs advocates maintain there is an important role that better planning and land use decisions through the coastal management program could contribute to these efforts serving th dual goals of reducing public costs and lowering the need for relief in the future from their perspective the coastal management effort could contribute to anticipating and minimizing the effects of future coastal hazard events in many ways they argue that congress shoul d direct the coastal progra m to give greater priority to coastal hazards by such changes as requiring that certain portion of federal grant funds be spent on topics related to coasta l hazards they believe that the coastal program and noaa more generally should wo rk more closely with the federal emergency management adminis tration and others concerne d with natural disasters at the federal and state leve ls to provide better informa tion such as comprehensive maps and stronger partnershi ps through coordinated planni ng to assist in dealing with anticipating and understanding coasta l hazards additionally they ask for congress to have the federa l coastal program report on how its efforts are increasing the capacity of participants to deal eff ectively with these topics one aspect of building capacity might be to make the coastal zone program central to other programs that tie federal assistance to participation in programs that are designed to lower vulnerability or risk finally coastal hazards could be given more prominent role in all program evaluations coastaldependent and other living resources the coastal zone is both the site of very diverse ecosystems and the location of intense development pressures that may adversely affect those systems habitat pr otection efforts have tended to be highly fragmented focusing on specific coastaldependent species that are endangered that have co mmercial and recreational value or that are invasive there are certainly numerous habitat prot ection success stories but those tend to focus on specific species locations or programs rather than larger ecosystems and more comprehensive approaches coastal dependent species do not appear to play prominent role in the current federal law or in most participant programs the czma identifies these resources in several places in the congressional findings section and includes it as topic of one of 11 national policies where it calls for greater coordination between federal and participant levels and better and more comprehensive planning however in terms of funding for coastal zone enhancement grants under section 309 of th czma participants could use several provisions to protect these species efforts to address threats to coastaldependent species issues reinforce the potential value of approaching these topics more broadly than just with regard to the species itself other examples of topics where broader considera tions may be helpful include wetlands protecti on fisheries management hypoxia and nonpoint source pollution past experiences suggest that each of these topics are most successfully addressed in broader rather than narrow context one that considers larger scaleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339crs14 17 this concept taken from land use planning would divide the ocean into areas where some uses would receive preference over others and incompatible uses might be limited or prohibitedand many factors for example the hypoxia condition more graphically termed dead zone has been identified in num ber of coastal waters in both nearshore marine areas and estuaries the sources of the inputs that create hypoxic conditions are often many miles away most famously in the case of the mississippi river drainage where nutrient and chemical inputs associated with agricultural production in the corn belt generally the upper mississippi river and ohio river basins are believed to be major cont ributors to hypoxia in the gulf of mexico while the coastal zone program is unlikely to directly reach the corn belt it could be used as mechanism to coordina the myriad federa l and other programs limited to or affecting coastaldependent living resources better coordination could lead to improved program eff ectiveness and be more cons istent with the principles of managing resources on an ecosystem basis additional planning at the state level and the regional level the sa lmon restoration effort in the pacific northwest may be the most prominent current example could have substantial benefits for living resources the ocean side of the coastal zone the ocean side of coastal management extends to state boundaries wh ich are 3 nautical miles offshore or 9 nautical miles for texas and the gulf coas t of florida participants coastal management programs have tended to gi ve limited attention to the ocean side of coastal management as they focus on where the land and water meet and on the land side of the coastal zone however with in state waters the number and intensity of uses are growing and this growth is likely to continue some of these uses are not compatible with others some new activities include interest in siting new energy facilities ranging from liquified natural gas lng terminals and pipelines to offshore wind farms use of sand and gravel resources and new aquaculture facilities each participant has its own set of laws and programs to address these issues many of these uses also transect th statefederal boundary and in federal waters complex array of federal laws and programs guides activities and is used to frame issues the czma encourages participants to comprehensively plan for marine resources and uses within state waters few participants have addressed these uses in one fashion or another already regon massachusetts and california are examples and more are reportedly consid ering doing so as well the czma also enables states to influence federal decisi ons beyond 3 miles in fe deral waters through the consistency provision as participants seek to become more involved in ocean management they often encounter lack of basic information about the ocean side of their coasts and lack of expertise to effectively address many of the management topics congress could add provisions to the czma to encourage participants to more aggressively identify and address state ocean management topics within the complex planning framework of coastal ma nagement and consider innovations such as ocean zoning17 it could also include language to encourage states to work more closely with federal agenci on topics that transce nd coastal boundaries and amend the consistency provision in ways that would increase coordination httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339crs15 18 one example of such an effort is evaluation of the national coastal zone management program prepared in 1991 by the department of city and regional planning at the university of north carolina for the national coastal resources research and development institutesome interests have also sought to act legislation to extend offshore state boundaries from 3 miles to 12 miles efforts to make such change would generate issues such as whether control of and revenues from subsea energy resources would also shift from the federal government to states and whether states would assume responsibilities including the costs for forcing laws in the expanded state waters there also may be problems for some users and uses that had operated under federal law which is consistent thr oughout waters under fe deral jurisdiction but might be different in adjoining state waters and also vary from state to state there is also potential for litigation if neig hboring participants disagree on how boundary lines are to be extended to 12 miles offshore especially where there are rocky outcrops offshore that provide options for locating lateral boundari or where there are resources of value such as subsurface energy resources that would lie within the jurisdiction of multiple participants or both participant and federal waters even though lateral boundaries between states ve been settled it is unclear whether an extension of jurisdiction may ins tigate new litigation governance improved governance has been goal of the federal coastal zone management program among the ma ny potential benefits of this program cited by observers are that it builds capacity within participants to plan for and manage coastal areas provide s opportunities and central focus for coordination and building partnerships and he lps government make more informed decisions these benefits have proven difficult to measure and the federal office does little to measure these benefits beyond evaluating par ticipant activities and accomplishments in implementing their coastal program usually every three years efforts to quantitatively measure broader benefits of the federal and participant programs to either coastal resources or coastal gove rnance have proven extremely challenging18 given the central importance of gove rnance number of topics may be addressed in reauthorizati on legislation one topic could be to use coastal management to create new opportunities fo r greater coordination among the many federal programs that operate in coas tal areas these programs continue to proliferate and are administered by many agencies each with its own mission second topic could be to encourage additiona l regional or intersta coordination and collaboration since many coastal issues transcend political boundaries efforts in some locations such as the chesapeake ba and the great lakes may be potential models for others to draw from benef its of managing resources at the scale of watershed or landscapes are receiving great er attention and the czma may offer structure that can be used to foster working at that scale thir d topic could be using coastal management to create greater consistency among decisions made by local governments concerning coastal resources th is could be fostered by establishing national framework to support local govern ment efforts and by providing funding and technical assistance to support this fra mework finally r eauthorization could include provisions that would encourage additional collaboration with private and nongovernmental organizations the bu sh administration has encouraged suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339crs16 19 for more information see httpcoastal managementnoaagovlandcelcp_indepthhtmlrelationships through its cooperative cons ervation initiative which is promoting those types of collaborative efforts ma jor benefit of this approach could be to draw on the greater flexibility that nongovernmental organizations often have to work toward their goals the czma in context select ed related federal laws and programs participants use their coastal zone management programs to coordinate many topics and activities that are also addressed by other federal laws and programs some of these topics and activities also might appear in czma reauthorization legislation the reauthorization might di rectly recognize topic making it consideration for coastal program participan ts or it might indirectly recognize the topic by calling for coordination or recognition in participant programs the programs discussed below are all limited to implementation in coastal locations and are therefore among those most directly related to aspects of coastal management each program addresses topics that can be central to coastal management efforts in some but not all locations in addition to the programs below many other federal programs are not limited to coastal areas but can have substantial effects on coastal areas such programs include many infrastructure development programs for highways water and sewer facilities shoreline protecti on and the like financial subsidies such as numerous loan and grant programs and provisions in the federal tax code for mortgage interest deductions and the availability of federal flood insurance and disaster relief efforts coastal and estuarine land conservation program celcp celcp enacted in the fy2002 department of commerce justice and state appropriations legislation p l 10777 provides matching grants to eligible states and local governments to develop and implement plans to acquire property or easements on coastal property matching federal grants are awarded competitively to participants with pproved plans between 2002 and 2006 130 projects have been funded at total federal co st of 177 million funded project s have protected coastal habitats including wetlands reduced coastal water pollution and improved access to the coast for recreation19 coastal barrier resources act cbra cbra enacted in 1982 pl 97348 and amended numerous times designates undevel oped coastal barriers and adjacent areas where most federal spending that would support add itional development is prohibited the system includes 585 units encompassing nearly 13 million acres of land and associ ated aquatic areas it also includes 271 otherwise protected areas where the only unavailabl federal program is flood insurance every unit is identified in law and with reference to map so both designating units and drawing boundaries have been cont entious for some units only congress can modify the unit boundaries and it has enacted numerous sitespecific amendments

report on the louisiana portion of the program show ed that 78 projects have reestablished or protected more than 70000 acres of wetlands and enhanced an additional 320000 acres at cost of almost 625 million21 national estuary program nep section 320 of the the clean water act in 1987 amendments pl 95217 cr eated nep to maintain and restore estuaries of national significance epa administers this program there are 28 neps around the country with half of them along the east coast between maine and north carolina each nep is implemented throug h partnership repres ented by all levels of

programs for specific coastal locations especially specific estuaries have also b een enacted perhaps the oldest and largest such program is the chesapeake bay program led by the epa and involving numerous federal state nd other participants the chesapeake bay program has large components for basic research to better understand the bay especially thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339crs18 23 for

have adverse effects on the resources in the bay and to inform and involve wi array of interests in bay restoration efforts the bay program has been in operation for n early 30 years and can document both accomplishments and remaining problems23 there is continuing controversy however over measuring program accomplishments other sitespecific programs include ones for long island sound the great lakes and the everglades and southwest florida none of these progra ms is as comprehensive as the chesapeake bay program and none has as long track record as comprehensive program concluding observati on strengths and weaknesses of the czma approach since the federal coastal management program addresses the often conflicting pressures of resource protec tion and economic development some may view it as model for possible application in othe r places rapidly urbanizing areas or segments of waterfront areas along rivers and lakes where similar conflicting pressures are concentrated the qualities of such model may become clearer when one looks at some of the strengths and weaknesses that the many czma observers have identified as some of these obs ervations are based in part on value judgments what may be regarded as st rength by one person may be weakness to another an example of divergent views is the debate over whether it is strength or weakness of the federal program to have permitted great variability in how the program is administered from participant to participant in looking at czma as model the context of each par ticipants program is important this context reflects its traditions of governance such as the laws and programs that are available to apply to the coastal management effort already established approaches to managing natural resources and guiding development the role of the state level in planning and managing land use nd the relation between state and local levels of government to administer programs in reviewing the two lists below it is also important to remember that different aspects of the program or different topics that the program addre sses may be important to different people each of the listed strengths and wea knesses could be explored further for comparative purposes but just listing them points out what makes the czma and participant programs unique some of the strengths of the czma pproach identified by coastal management observers are it provides framework for coasta l planning that has considerable latitude so that each participant can address its individual needs it measures progress in the cont ext of each participants capabilities rather than using one standard by which all participants are evaluatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339crs19 it allows participants to devel op and expand its capacity for planning and management as it considers all activities occurring in or affecting geographic area fined by the participant it includes as an integral co mponent system of participant designated protected research and education sites that provide opportun ities to engage in comparative research projects and to educate the public about the value of coastal resources it provides federal funding to courage activities th at participants might otherwise not initiate it provides procedure that allows participants to effectively oppose federal actions that are viewed as incompatible with their goals congress has periodically updated the federal law and participants have updated their plans to reflect changing concerns about the coast some of the weaknesses of the czma approach identified by coastal management observers are it is voluntary program that has almost regulatory leverage on participants actions participants can do too many alternative things and have very widerange of levels of effort and still be considered to be successfully implementing their program overall funding is inadequate to pay for doing all or even portion of the right things that ever participant should be doing where there is federal interest in coasts some of the participants use their programs to accommodate coastaldevelopment and do not do enough to protect natural resources and the environment after more than 30 years of effort and numerous studies themagnitude or dimensions of the impact that the federal program or any of the participants programs have had on either the rate and pattern of coastal development or on protection of important coastal resources is still uncertainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34339crs20 appendix provisions in the coastal zone management act as amended section 302
