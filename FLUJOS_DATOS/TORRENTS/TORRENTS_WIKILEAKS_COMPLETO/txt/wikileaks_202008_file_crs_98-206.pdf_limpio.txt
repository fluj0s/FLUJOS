miner waiver application s administrat ive provisions to the blm section general provisions also affect other issues for instance one provision directs the blm to reauthorize grazing permits prior to completion of reviews under applicable laws such as the nationa l environmental policy act section 124 number of provisions of the omnibus law cut ac ross agency jurisdictions one such provision prohibits the interior secretary from purcha sing land in alaska without first attempting to acquire such lands through exchange of unreserved public lan d section 127 because it addresses land purchases by the secretary of the interior the provision could aff ect the national park service nps and the fish and wildlife service fws in addition to blm althou gh it is likely that the lands

currently manages the 376 units that comprise the national park system including 56 full or actual national parks the premier units of the system in addition to the national parks the diverse park system includes national preserves recreation areas reserves monuments battlefields seashores and number of othe r categories the system has grown to more than 80 million acres in 49 states and the district of columbia i n recent years over 270 million visitors have visited the parks annually the nps has the often contradictory mission of facili tating access and serving park system visitors while protecting and preserving the natural and cultural resources entrusted to it for nearly two decades the park service has operated with tight budgets during this period congress restricted appropriations to operate and maintain th park system while continuing to add new units to the system combined wit h increased visitation the essentially static funding had stretched personnel impaired operations and generated multibillion dollar backlog of deferred maintenance however spending for the nps now appears to have higher priority temporary closure of nps units part of federal governmentwide shutdown during the budget debates of late 1995 and early 1996 helped galvanize public support for increasing nps operations and maintenance funding in fy1997 fy1998 and fy1999 the administrations operations budget request for the nps for fy1999 totals 1321 billion the house recommended 1333 billion nd the senate recommended 1288 billion the conference agreement provides 1286 billion for operation of the national park system deferred maintenance the park system has formidable maintenance burden with thousands of permanent structures roads bridges tunnels employee housin g units water nd waste systems etc the nps has valued these assets at over 3 5 billion but they would deteriorate without adequate care and maintenance i n fy1999 the administration proposed attacking the deferred maintenance backlo g with 62 million increase in nps maintenance from fy1998 with total request for 446 million the house committee recommended slightly larger increase 6 4 million and the senate committee recommended smaller increase but still 1 8 million 5 above the fy1998 level the conference agreement provides 41 2 million for maintenance mounting concerns about the buildup of unmet maintenance needs s prompted congress to seek new funding sources congress and the administration have generally agreed to address problems and adequately fund the operation of the park system and to aggressively attack the maintenance backlog in the fy199 9 budget request the administration had proposal that would add more than 2 5 million annually for nps management purposes from park concessioners franchis fees number of l arge concession contracts are due for renewal and the trend has been for substantial increases the proposal is to keep the concession fees for the park system rather than having them returned to the general fund of the treasury as is current practice recreation fee demonstration program the administrations proposal fo r maintenance parallels the recreation fee demonstration program being tested by the nps and three other federal land management agencies the recreation fee programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98206crs10 began in fy1996 to allow higher entrance and recreation user fees with the adde d fees being retained by the unit where the money is collected it was hoped that the addition fees would be incentives to agency managers to be more aggressive i n pursuing selffinancing for operating and maintaining their units the nps i s expecting to collect 1365 million under this program in fy1999 the omnibu s appropriations bill extended the fee demonstration program for 2 additional years urban park and recreation fund the house had approved an amendment to the bill to fund the urban park and recreation recovery uprr program at 2 million the administrations request although the program was last funded i n fy1994 pr evious appropriations were about 5 million annually with communities competing for many more grants than there was money available for the highl popular matching grant program had helped local governments rehabilitat playgro unds recreation centers ball courts and playing fields in urban areas th conference agreement did not provide the proposed 2 million stating that th committee determined that this effort could not be accommodated with the limited resources available this year relat ed legislation congress approved bill s1693 the national park s omnibus managemen t act of 1998 under expedited procedures at the end of 105 th the bill provides for long anticipated park criteria and management reforms and an overhaul of the park services concessions policy to allow revenue generated fro m concession contracts to be returned to appropriate na tional park units without annual appropriations other provisi ons calling for new fee authorities and higher fees from film makers were dropped from the final version of this bill in another collatera l initiative national park roads considered an important

sources have not always been i n agreement under the administrations national performance review reinventin g government initiative the bia had planned to pursue restructuring and downsizing through the tribal shares process in which tribes and the bia determine first which bia functions are inherently federal and which are available for triba l management and second what each tribe s share of funds is for the latter functions but the bia states the interior solicitor has advised against that procedure appropria tions committee reports for fy1997 and fy1998 directed the bia t develop

relating to whether tribes other financial resources are taken into account first muc h if not most bia funding even while serving tribal needs is not required to be distributed on natio nal per capita or other formula basis second tribes own nonbia resources especially busin ess revenues are not always required to be taken into account both the senate appropriations committee and the house interio r appropriations committee take note of the issues for bot h the fy1998 and fy1999 interior appropriat ions bills the senate appropriations committee has proposed 1 requiring the bia to develop several alternate formulas for distributing tpa funds on the basis of need taking into account tribal business revenues including gaming and 2 requiring tribes to submit tribal business revenue information to bia and in the fy1999 bill proposed implementing the new distribution formula in fy2000 i n addition the senate committees fy1999 bill proposed reallocating half of tpa funds

relationship with the tribes will not be diminished supporters of the senate committees proposals claim that bia funding i s inequitably distributed tha t poorer tribes do not receive adequate funding that tribal tpa funds recei ved per capita do not correspond with indicators of tribal need that only 30 percent of tpa funding is based on formulas and that gao study shows some rich tribes got more tpa funds in fy1998 than tr ibes with outside revenues opponents respond that almost all tribes are in poverty that bia funding i s insufficient to meet tri bal needs and that meanstesting tpa funding would penalize tribes who still have severe needs would violate the federal trust responsibility t tribes has not been fully analyzed and would be fair since it is not required of state or local governments receiving federal assistance in considering similar proposals in the fy1998 ppropriations bill congress had dropped the requirements for formula and tribal income data and instead d distributed some fy1998 tpa funds so that each tribe might receive the minimu m funding recommended by the 1994 report of the joint tribalbiadoi task force on bia reorganiz ation 160000 per tribe except 200000 per tribe in alaska with allocation of any remaining tpa funds based on recommendation of tribalfederal task force in addition several senators had requested the gao to report on tpa distribution issues the tribalfederal tpa task force made its distributio n recommendations january 29 1998 and also recommended creating longter m work group on tpa funding allocation recommendation the bia supported the gao presented its tpa distributi on study in april and july 1998 among the gao findings were that twothirds of fy1998 tpa funds were distributed based n historica l levels and onethird was distributed based on formulas that tp distribution per capita varied widely across bia areas and that tribal governments reporting of revenues were inconsistent in including or excluding nonfedera l revenues the gao results were used by the senate appropriations committee in developing the fy1999 proposals described above congre ss in the interior appropriations portion of the fy1999 omnibu s appropriations act dropped the senate appropriations committees propose d reallocation scheme and dropped the requi rement that tribes submit revenue data but retained the requirement that

costs from earlier years in spite of court decision s confirming federal responsibility for such costs congress ag ain approved the house recommended oneyear moratorium on selfdetermination contracts

both the hous and the senate committee also noted environmental penalties against bia for violations regarding underground storag tanks and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and the hous provided funds for environmental cleanup congress approved 3 million for thi s purpose only the senate committee included bill language restricting the huro n cemetery in kansas to use as cemetery an oklahoma tribe has at times proposed using it for gaming congress retained this provision the senate committee als prohibited taking lands into trust in scott county in minnesota near minneapolisst
