methodology 11 introduction the project management guide ensures the approach used by all scheme agents when implementing change is consistent the methodology outlined in this guide represents generic approach based on the principles of bestpractice project management and is designed to complement existing methodologies and processes used by scheme agent in the delivery of project work the primary focus of this methodology is to provide workcover with knowledge of the scheme agents project planning and cost estimates to facilitate workcovers administration activities scheme agent must adopt this project management methodology unless it receives approval from the nominal insurer to use an alternative methodology 12 objectives the objective s of the project management guide are to improve workcovers visibility of the scheme agents planning strategy management progress and financial management of implementing projects promote thorough project planning and qualification practices provide standard approach for implementing projects across all scheme agents 13 scope this methodology outlined in this guide covers all projects specified by workcover approved contract variations in accordance with schedule 7 variation framework it does not cover any scheme agent change not directly associated with workcover documented requirements any changes or omissions not included within the formal project management process projects initiated by scheme agent 14 roles and responsibi lities the roles an d responsibilities of each party are outlined below workcover provision of requirements project reviews and acceptance of timeframes and costs ongoing support to scheme agent provision of relevant resources and infrastructure to meet workcover obligat ions scheme agent conduct all workcover related projects in accordance with the specification of requirements ensure the timely delivery of all aspects of the projects within agreed timeframes and budgets project management guide page 4 of 13 15 remuneration workcover will remunerate scheme gent for implementing workcover approved projects as per the deed between the nominal insurer and the scheme agent the remuneration model will be fix priced once the scheme agents planning and costs have been reviewed and approved workcover will provid funding aligned to project deliverables and milestones the scheme agent must provide all supporting documentation and activities associated with project once workcover has approved project variation to cost will be accepted unless workcover ap proves the change 16 workcover assistance enquiries about any aspect of this guide should be directed to the agent contracts branch of workcover project management guide page 5 of 13 2 project management verview this chapter provides scheme agent with an understanding of workcovers expectat ions for managing workcover projects for it systems development projects diagrammatic representation of the workcover system delivery lifecycle diagram sdld methodology is included at appendix 21 requirements the requirements for all projects will be incorporated into the project management plan document based on an approved contract variation in accordance with schedule 7 variation framework variations to the requirements will be managed through the workcover change management process as describ ed in schedule 7 22 project reviews and acceptance workcover reviews maintain awareness of each scheme agents status and progress throughout the project lifecycle project reviews will be scheduled as deemed necessary by workcover reviews will be minuted using the workcover status report template details of project milestones and costs will be recorded together with any issues that need to be addressed by either party and agreed dates for completion copy of the minutes will be supplied to the scheme gent project manager and follow up meeting arranged initial project review the initial project review is mandatory in accordance with the workcover requirements section of the business and technical requirements overview document the objective of the initial project review is to qualify the completeness of the project planning assess the reasonableness of the project cost and timelines ensure the workcover templates have been used the scheme agent project manager must provide an updated project s tatus report workcover is responsible for taking review minutes the initial review for project will involve an examination of the project management plan project schedule businesstechnical design test plan risk management plan issue management plan workcover deliverables workcover is responsible for providing clear direction to the scheme agent regarding the nature and scope of the project to be undertaken workcover will provide the scheme agent with business requirements specifications project management guide page 6 of 13 the scheme gent in conjunction with workcover will review the workcover deliverables prior to the initial project review 23 project execution the scheme agent is at liberty to commence an approved workcover project at their discretion workcover will only remunerate the scheme agent if the project has been reviewed and accepted periodic reviews to track progress and status will be conducted during the project workcover and the scheme agent will arrange reviews on periodic basis andor as deemed necessary workcov er will provide the scheme agent with minimum of one weeks notice for any unscheduled review 24 change management all changes to the project after formal approval must be documented using the workcover template details of changes will be examined at stat us reviews and accepted into the project scope at workcover discretion change request must only be included into the scope of project once workcover has formally accepted the change once scheme agents project has been initially reviewed and accept ed by workcover the costs of any change unless introduced formally by workcover will be borne by the scheme agent delays in achieving the scheduled project delivery date are the scheme agents responsibility 25 project implementati on and acceptance sch eme agent may only implement their project after workcover has granted formal acceptance using the formal project review process acceptance criteria for project is defined in the business and technical requirements overview document project management guide page 7 of 13 3 change manageme nt methodology this chapter defines each component of the project management deliverables and sets expectations between workcover and the scheme agent 31 external audit requi rements workcover reserves the right to request the formal review of the scheme age nts applications in the form of an external audit the audit will ensure that all scheme agent applications meet consistent and known standard over the medium to long term scheme agent will be made aware of the need for an audit through the business and technical requirements overview document provided with the release of the operational document set prior to the release of new manuals workcover will engage an external auditor and specify the audit requirements the business and technical requirem ents overview document provides the contact details necessary to arrange the audit and issues identified by the audit will be in the form of requirement explaining what must be done the scheme agent must include these requirements in the project scope 32 project management p lan the project management plan is the responsibility of the scheme agent project manager or the most senior person responsible for the overall success and management of the project the plan ensures that all management aspects of pr oject have been formally considered aspects associated with the project management plan include executive summary provide complete executive summary of the project objectives provide an overview of the objectives and planned outcomes of the project scope outline the scope of the project including areas in and out of scope defining the scope ensures the scale of the project is clearly outlined and understood areas deemed outside the scope of the project must be justified to ensure the overall sco pe is qualified project governance defining the roles and responsibilities ensures that all roles

associate each requirement to units of work to be performed by the project team members the document must demonstrate that all requirements have been considered in their entirety any requirement that is emed not to be in scope is qualified with an explanation all requirements deemed to be in scope are directly assigned to units of work requirement might impact more than one unit of work cross reference is useful the primary sections of business technical design document are found in the design and specification sections the design section describes the existing or new systemprocesses at high level and outlines how the project will work including the process flows between applications and u sers when describing batch processes all files must be denoted the specification section identifies areas impacted as consequence of the requirements each specification must state the details of the change to be performed in clear and concise mann er all requirements qualifying the change must be identified project management guide page 9 of 13 34 technical specificat ions for projects that require systemit changes the development of the technical specification document is the responsibility of the senior technical leader assigned to th project this document is optional and template is provided should the decision be made not to have specification document the details of the components to be changed and the details of the change must be included in the businesstechnical design document 35 test and acceptance plan the construction and maintenance of the test and acceptance plan is the responsibility of the person assigned the role in the project management plan the objective of the test and acceptance plan is to ensure that all fa cets of the project have been inspected and accepted before impacting business functionsystem the design of test cases must verify that functionality performs as specified by the requirements supplied by workcover as well as ensuring other existing fu nctionality has not been impacted the scheme agent must be able to leverage from their standard test plan and modify or introduce test cases and acceptance criteria in accordance with the requirements test cases and acceptance criteria must also specify expected results to verify the correct output for workcover planning purposes the test and acceptance plan must also document test cases involving workcover the project manager must use the workcover supplied project schedule template guidelines for constructing project schedule can be found in appendix b 36 project schedule the construction and maintenance of the project schedule is the responsibility of the person assigned the role in the project management plan the project schedule consolidates ll aspects of the project lifecycle as series of milestones and tasks that are allocated to individuals to perform 37 risk management plan s the project manager is responsible for preparing and maintaining the risk management plan risk in the context f workcover project is any risk that may potentially impact the project delivery and therefore must be managed throughout the life of the project ongoing management of risks is necessary to evaluate the likelihood of the risk occurring and the impact the risk will have to the project in the event it happens evidence of active risk management will be checklist item in workcover reviews 38 issue management the project manager is responsible for maintaining the issues register an issue is anything that impacts the project schedule and requires tracking to ensure mitigation is undertaken issues which cannot be resolved may be reclassified as risks the issue register must identify to whom the issue has been assigned the assignment date and expected c ompletion date evidence of active issue management will be checklist item in workcover reviews project management guide page 10 of 13 4 project templates project

description eg workcover claims and policy requirements change requests change request is mini project where the requirement impact analysis and scheduling of work needs to be accounted for all changes that impact the agreed imp lementation date between workcover and the scheme agent must be defined in this section change requests unless originated by workcover will not be remunerated for workcover to remunerate change request the change documentation must be signed by the w orkcover reviewer for acceptance of payment requirements analysis the requirements analysis phase is the period of time allocated to review the requirements and specify the changes necessary to the agents application workcover will specify the time for this period business technical design the business technical design phase represents technical analysis of the requirements as they impact the agent all requirements must be represented in this document technical specification for it system ba sed projects the technical specification project management guide page 13 of 13 phase identifies each unit of work to be completed during the construction phase essentially each program database table training script etc which is modified deleted or is new module must be identified with description of the change depending on the scale of the requirements this phase may be merged with the technical design document construction for it system based projects construction represents the code and unit test phase of the project each module identified in the technical review phase must be recorded in this section naming convention module name module description task should have more than one resource assigned the reason for this is to make levelling easier the effort must be entered in the actual work cell use the predecessor cell to link tasks at resource level system test for it system based projects system testing is the responsibility of it the objective being to confirm the completed solution functions in acc ordance with the requirements the system test plan and test scripts are to be written in conjunction with technical design project phase when constructing the schedule for system test use headings to describe the test phase in accordance with your test p lan and create sub tasks that cross reference the test cases test cases should only have one resource assigned user acceptance test user acceptance testing is the businesses opportunity to confirm the delivered solution meets the requirements workcover will be involved with this phase where interface components require confirmation as with the system test phase use headings to describe the test phase in accordance with your test plan and create sub tasks that cross reference the test cases implementa tion the implementation plan is an inventory of modules that will be moved into the production environment this document can be produced during and after the construction phase
