japan and germany nina m serafino specialist in international security affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21404 this report provides background on the us occupation experiences in japan and germany after world war ii and discusses four sets of factors from this period that could be relevant to us occupation of iraq these are 1 acceptance of us goals 2 homogeneity of the occupied populations 3 ability to manage their own affairs and 4 international legitimacy and support this report will not be updated discussion of us invasion and occupation of iraq has led to consideration of conditions in posthussein iraq including the prospects that possible occupation force could mold the iraqi government into democracy the bush administration reportedly has looked at past us occupations particularly the democratization experiences in japan and germany after world war ii as precedents some analysts question whether conditions in iraq today are sufficiently similar to the conditions in japan and germany to presume similar results ie functioning democracy and whether the level of sustained us commitment that was required there could be realistically expected this report provides information on those occupations and discusses their applicability to iraq major features of us occupations in japan and germany planning duration force size1 planning for both occupations which began as early as 1942 was marked by sharp disagreements within the roosevelt administration that continued into the early phases of the occupations the first of many documents discussing the postwar political configuration of japan in particular the status of the emperor and the possibilities and particulars of democratization was issued in march 1943 the final directives which provided the particulars of political reform were issued by the interagency state war and navy departments coordinating committee swncc 1 sources for this section include robert

was presumed that both military occupations would be relatively short for japan the supreme commander of the allied powers scap gen douglas macarthur judged the occupation would last more than three years2 it lasted six years and eight months august 1945april 1952 for germany the first military governor of the us sector gen dwight d eisenhower anticipated that the us military would provide garrison not government except for few weeks3 instead direct military government lasted four years the important first phase of the occupation may 1945 may 1949 some analysts believe the us military occupation of germany was prolonged by problems in establishing selfgovernment because of differences with the other occupying powers great britain france and the soviet union each of which controlled its own sector httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21404 in both cases substantial drawdown of us occupation forces occurred after the first year as there was virtually armed resistance in japan peak level of 385649 was reached by november 1945 but dropped to 160000 by the end of may 1946 in germany the 16 million troops in germany in may 1945 dropped to 277584 in 1946 119367 in 1947 and 79370 by 19504 in japan most major reforms had been accomplished within four years and six months in germany the us occupation was phased out in two stages germans in the us british and french sectors jointly gained control of most domestic affairs in may 1949 with the ratification of new constitution dubbed the basic law establishing parliamentary democracy the federal republic of germany or west germany until 1955 these occupying countries retained emergency powers veto over laws inconsistent with occupation policy and authority over such matters as foreign relations foreign trade the level of industrial production and military security in its zone the soviet union created an authoritarian sovietstyle state the german democratic republic or east germany the west and east entities persisted until reunification in 1990 objectives the objectives of the us occupations of both countries have been summed up in two lists of four ds in both japan and germany the primary objective was demilitarization all us planners agreed that the ability of both countries to wage war in the future should be destroyed this included destroying elements of military power including the economic apparatus that fueled war and punishing war criminals in japan the next goals were the disarmament and decentralization of the economic apparatus the latter through the dismantling of the large industrial and banking groups in germany they were denazification and deindustrialization regarding the fourth d 2 john w dower embracing defeat japan in the wake of world war ii new york ww norton company 1999 p 523 3 peterson op cit p 55 4 figures courtesy of the us army center for military history from unpublished briefing papers crs3 democratization many us policymakers and occupation planners doubted that the japanese and germans had the cultural background and psychological disposition necessary to function in democracy after the occupations began democratization assumed greater weight in both experiences as those forces who had argued that the inhabitants of those countries were capable of establishing democracies gained credibility and as the start of the cold war fostered the concept of community of democracies as counterweight to the soviet union humanitarian situation the occupations commenced amidst grave humanitarian situation with large parts of the population homeless and on subsistence diets or below in japan according to one source the war had produced 18 million military and civilian casualties and destroyed 25 of japans national wealth air attacks had destroyed 20 of the countrys housing and greater amount in some cities and 30 of its industrial capacity5 in germany between quarter to half of housing and transport had been destroyed leaving some 20 million homeless in the western zones6 although the united states provided humanitarian aid at the outset to ward off mass hunger and starvation occupation authorities and oversight officials soon worried that the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21404 us will to continue such relief efforts would flag well before the need for aid diminished this trepidation was one consideration reorienting economic policies in 1949 under pressure from congress military governor lucius d clay abandoned central feature of occupation policy in germany with which he had originally agreed the punitive dismantling of what was left of germanys industrial base to make germans pay for waging war7 instead he actively promoted germanys economic revival in japan the interagency swncc approved in january 1948 an economic recovery program intended to make japan selfsufficient through the early revival of the japanese economy and encouraging industrial growth and foreign trade to enable japan to make its proper contribution to the economic rehabilitation of the world economy8 accomplishments in both countries the occupations are credited with the construction of functioning democracies in germany the direct occupation period ended in the west with the 1949 establishment of the federal republic of germany parliamentary system built on improvements in the constitution and institutions of germanys major experience with democracy the 19191933 weimar republic in japan the scap revamped the laws institutions and mores of the countrys divine right monarchy the key reform was new constitution largely drafted by the scap staff which transferred sovereignty from the emperor to the people while retaining the emperor in largely symbolic role and banned military arms and participation in war it also dismantled the

church and state the enfranchisement of women the promotion of free press and the liberalization of education important economic changes including the dismantling of the large familyrun industrial and banking groups and widescale agrarian reform are seen as essential to the creation of functioning democracy because they broke the power of economic and military elites recent assessments of the importance of the occupation governments in establishing these democracies give much greater weight to their contribution in japan than in germany indeed one academic believes that while the united states was important to democratic outcome in japan by contrast the strength of democratic forces in west germany was such that the american contribution appears relatively marginal10 implications and questions for us policymakers11 some historians have noted that unique preconditions and circumstances contributed to the success of these occupations particularly in japan four crucial points of convergence often cited as important to the success of those occupations in establishing httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21404 democracies raise questions concerning the applicability of these models to us occupation of iraq although there is predictably disagreement over their relevance these issues provide backdrop for postsaddam planning populations acceptance of us occupations and democratization objective occupation occupation by us forces and democratic reforms were widely accepted by the japanese and germans themselves who came to blame their own leaders for the war indeed although historically much is credited to the united states for remaking these democracies many analysts believe that the high degree of cooperation from postwar japanese and german leaders was also crucial to their success analysts writing during the occupation of japan attributed success there largelyto the wholehearted cooperation of the average japanese citizen12 conclusion which subsequent research supports this cooperation has been attributed to several factors including emperor hirohitos plea before the landing of us forces that the population cooperate fully with occupation directives this ensured not only the cooperation of the average citizen but more importantly of japans powerful bureaucracy moreover the great majority of japanese rejected the old political system and military leadership and were receptive to change in the early 20th century westernstyle democratic political 9 ward op cit pp 426430 10 tony smith americas mission the united states and the worldwide struggle

american military government experience in japan in carl j friedrich et american experiences in military government in world war ii new york rinehart company 1948 p 350 these authors worried however that such obedience would undermine longrun prospects for democracy crs5 institutions had begun to develop with increasing influence exercised by political parties and greater democratization of parliamentary practices culminating in 1920 193213 in germany us occupation officials quickly became convinced that most germans thoroughly rejected nazi fascism and desired political change to successful democracy in line with democratic developments before adolf hitler took power germany had experience with limited democracy and the rule of law within an authoritarian culture and political context during the second reich or the german empire of 18711918 even before its experience with democracy during the weimar republic many democratic leaders of the weimar republic had remained in germany and were eager to work towards the restoration of democracy prospects for democracy may have been further enhanced because the areas of us occupation had more of democratic ethos in contrast to the legacy of prussian authoritarianism in the soviet occupation zone to what extent would model of western democracy be acceptable to the iraqis even if iraqis accepted such model might problems arise from iraqs lack of experience with democracy if such model is not acceptable to iraqis to what extent do they share common purpose of unifying their country around political model acceptable to the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21404 united states given the history of western colonialism in the middle east us support for israel and the drastic effects of current us backed economic sanctions against iraq would the united states have the nearly unanimous backing of the iraqi population for an occupation as it did in japan and germany if not would force enjoy greater support what difficulties could arise from the lack of general consent homogeneity of occupied populations although politically diverse the japanese and the german populations as of 1945 were each ethnically homogeneous and largely without religious animosities to what extent will ethnic and sectarian differences among iraqis impede effective government by us occupation force given those differences will iraqis be able to govern themselves within short period of time if not what arrangements such as co government as exists in afghanistan might be desirable to promote effective government what likelihood is there that such government would succeed ability to manage their own affairs largely using existing institutions although the us military governments held power and issued orders most of the functions of government were carried out by japanese and german institutions this delegation of functions was the decision of the two dominant figures in the occupation governments macarthur in japan and clay14 in germany the decision was based in their assessments of the willingness and ability of japanese and german citizens to perform these duties and the scarcity of suitable americans to do so in japan macarthur retained and worked through japans existing and centralized governmental institutions issuing orders that were then carried out by the japanese 13 ward op cit pp 423424 14 clay served as deputy to military governor eisenhower and to eisenhowers successor until he assumed the mg post himself in march 1947 but even as deputy he was viewed as bearing most of the responsibility for intheater formation and implementation of occupation policies crs6 government15 he also insisted on autonomy from us agencies to interpret instructions as he saw fit military government teams usually of military and civilian personnel and local liaison offices were also established at the prefecture ie state level and charged with observing investigating and reporting on compliance however according to one author the lack of an established policy for local military government activity resulted in abuses and patchwork of wide local variations developed16 macarthur entrusted the japanese government with demobilizing its forces in the us sector of germany the office of the military government united states omgus proceeded immediately to reconstruct german government institutions to administer occupation laws and policies even before all us officials were convinced that germans were ready for it with the german defeat the nazi government collapsed leaving the allies to replace officials and structures from the beginning clay sought to turn government over to germans as quickly as possible starting at the local level in some cases the omgus appointed former german government officials from the pre 1933 period as early as october 1945 clay issued an order that limited local omgus military activities to observing government activities at the city county and state level and reporting problems to higher headquarters elections for village officials were held httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21404 in january 1946 followed by county officials in march and city officials in may clay then pushed for the drafting of state constitutions and establishment of state governments to what extent would iraqi existing institutions continue to function what governmental functions would us or other military forces have to assume and for how long what new institutions would have to be created to what extent might grievances of those displaced from existing institutions or of those removed and punished for crimes related to participation in the hussein regime be viewed as legitimate by other iraqis and other middle eastern governments and populations to what extent could such sympathies undermine effective administration by occupation forces how much autonomy would us or administration have to adapt to local conditions international legitimacy and support the us occupations in japan and germany were viewed by other countries as morally and legally legitimate and there was widespread support for them this international consensus meant that us policy could be developed relatively free of competing foreign policy interests this was especially true in the case of japan for germany however the development of economic policy was complicated by considerations regarding other european economies if the united states were to invade iraq without the full backing of the international community to what extent would this lack of consensus or agreement undermine the basis of us international legitimacy or support what us interests would be affected by the presence of us occupation force in iraq should the united states expect significant opposition to us occupation among the leaders or populations of neighboring countries to what extent would its shortterm success be judged by its ability to meet humanitarian needs 15
