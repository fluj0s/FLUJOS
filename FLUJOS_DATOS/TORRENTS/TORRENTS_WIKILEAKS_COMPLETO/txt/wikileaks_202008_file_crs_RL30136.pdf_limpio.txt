pr actices for reserving special order speeches and securing recognition for these speeches di fferences between inserted and delivered special orders various uses of special orders and current reform proposals are also discussed governing authorities the rules of the house do not provide for special order speeches instead special orders have evolved as unanimous consent practice of the house while any member can object to the practice of holding daily special order speeches this happens infrequently during the special order period members must abide by the rules of the house the chambers precedents and the speakers announced policies in that order relevant house rules include those gove rning debate decorum and the speakers power of recognition for example repr esentative cannot deliver special order longer than 60 minutes because this would violate house rule xvii clause 2 which limits individual members to one hour in debate on any question when members 60minute special or

each legislative day5 the term speakers announced policies refers to the speakers policies on certain aspects of house procedure eg decorum in debate conduct of electronic votes recognition for special orders these policies are usually announced on the opening day of new congress in practi ce the speakers current policies on special orders announced on january 18 2007 govern recognition for special order speeches and the reservation and television broadcast of these speeches6 recognition for special orders recognition for special orders is the prerogative of the speaker while special orders routinely begin once legislative business is completed the speaker is not required to recognize members for special or ders as soon as legislative business ends under his power of recognition house rule xvii clause 2 the speaker can first recognize other members for unanim ousconsent requests and permissible motions7 the speaker may also interrupt or reschedule the special order period to proceed to legislative or other business moreover the speaker can recognize representatives for special orders earlier in the day eg when the house plans to consider major legislation through the evening hours majority party represen tative appointed as speaker pro tempore usually presides in the chair during special orde rs in recognizing members the chair observes the following announced policies of the speaker representatives are first recognize d for fiveminute special order speeches and then for longer speeches that do not exceed 60 minuteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30136crs3 8 this fourhour limitation can only be extended if the chair grants permission after consultation with the leadership of bot h parties and notification to the house 9 for example if the house completes legisl ative business at 1100 pm members are first recognized for fiveminute special orders and then the time remaining until midnight is divided between the two parties for longer special orders 10 on occasion partys leadership may desi gnate two party reps to lead backtoback special orders that collectively total one hour for example on july 14 1996 rep frank pallone and eleanor holmes norton were recognized for separate 30minute special orders as the minority leaders designees see congressional record daily edition vol 142 july 14 1996 pp h5036 and h5039 11 congressional record daily

leadership see reservation of special orders section special orders are allowed after midnight on any day on tuesdays after all legislative business is completed the chair can recognize members for fiveminute special orders and unlimited longer special orders until midnight on every day but tuesday after the fiveminut special orders the chair can recognize members for more than four hours of longer special orders8 the four hours are divi ded equally between the majority and minority each pa rty can reserve the first hour of longer special orders for its leadership or designee socalled leadership special order see below for more information when less than four hours remain s until midnight each partys two hour period is prorated9 each partys leadership usually choos designee to deliver leadership special order during the partys firs t hour of longer special orders10 this designee will sometimes lead thematic special order and yield time to other party members for example on may 7 1997 the minority l eaders designee delivered 60minute special order on hr 3 juvenile crime cont rol legislation with participation from other democratic members11 the majority leaders designee then led 60minute special order on the 1997 balanced budget agreement during which he yielded time to other republican members12 to summarize under the speakers current announced policies there are generally three stages to each days special order period first fiveminute special orders by individual members httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30136crs4 13 this current practice firmly established by the speakers announced policies of jan 5 1995 and extended by the announced policies of jan 18 2007 departs from earlier house practice previously members were recognized for special order speeches in the order that they reserved their speech ie when th ree members each reserved 30minute special order for particular day the member who reserved the speech at the earliest date was recognized first for other differences betw een current and earlier house practices see the earlier announced policies of the speaker sectionnext special orders longer than five minutes normally 60 minutes in length by the partys leadership or designee and last special orders longer than fi ve minutes length varies from six to 60 minutes by individual members reservation of special orders members reserve fiveminute and longer special orders through their party leadership democratic members reserve time through the office of the majority leader and republican members reserve time thr ough the republican cloakroom or the party leadership desk on the h ouse floor under the speakers announced policies members cannot reserve special or ders more than one week in advance moreover the date of the re servation does not affect th order in which the chair recognizes members for special orders13 the speakers announced policies requi re that the majority and minority leadership give the chair list each day showing how the partys two hours of longer special orders will be allocated among party members the chair follows this list in recognizing members for longer special orders for fiveminute special orders the majority and minority leadership compile list of fiveminute special order reservations each day this list is given to party member who asks unanimous consent that each member on the list be allowed to address the house for five minutes on speci fic date permission is routinely granted by the house notice of granted five minute special orders appears in the house section of the daily congressional record under the heading special orders granted and on the inside page of th daily house calendar formally called calendars of the united states house of re presentatives and history of legislation individual members may also ask unanim ous consent to give special order speech at the last minute to use another representatives reserved special order time or to deliver reserved special order out of the established sequence for that day these unanimous consent requests are made infrequently and pe rmission is usually granted httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30136crs5 14 from 1984 to 1994 housecontrolled television cameras panned the entire chamber during special orders 15 there are three sections in the daily congressional record 1 the proceedings of the house 2 the proceedings of the senate nd 3 the extensions of remarks section where members of the house can insert speech that was not actually delivered on the floor or extraneous materials related to th subject under discussion with the houses permission house practice congressional record chap sec 5 pp 367373 television broadcast of special orders house rule v places the broa dcasting of house proceedings under the speakers exclusive direction the sp eakers announced policies prohibit house controlled television cameras from panni ng the chamber during special orders14 instead caption also known as crawl appears at the bottom of the television screen indicating that legislative business has been completed and the house is proceeding with special orders inserted special orders instead of delivering special order speech on the house floor members may insert their speech in either the house pages of the congressional record or the section known as the extensions of remarks15 special orders inserted in the house section are published in distinctive typeface alongside the special orders delivered that day on the house floor members must decide in advance to insert special orders in the house section they make this decision when reserving the special orde r through their partys leadership representative who wants to participate in another members reserved special order can also decide in advance to insert his remarks in the house section this decision is coordinated with the member holding the special order reservation the representatives inserted remarks appear in distinctive typeface during the other members reserved special order members who are not present when recognized for their special order speech routinely have the option of inserting this speech in the extensions of remarks section permission of the house is required to insert any material in this section when the house grants unanimous consen t to special order requests it typically gives representatives permission to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material this pe rmission is usually reported in the house pages of the congressional record under the heading special orders granted see above special order sp eeches inserted in the extensions of remarks section appear alongside other inserted material eg gislative statements not delivered on the floor newspaper articles letters from constituents and are not identified as special orders all materials in the extensions of remarks section appear in distinctive typefacehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30136crs6 16 see congressional record

nd delivered special orders the practical difference between inserting and delivering special order speech is twofold first inserted special orders are available only to readers of the hard copy and online versions of the congressional record by contrast special orders delivered on the house floor reach larger audience through cspans televised coverage of house floor proceedings s econd inserted special order speeches incur less cost than those delivered on the hous floor while both inserted and delivered special order involve congressional record printing costs only delivered speeches entail the expenses of keeping the house in formal session eg electricity salaries of house officers and staff various uses of special orders members often use special orders to ddress subjects unrelated to legislation before the house they deliver speeches on broad policy issues bill they have introduced and local national or international events they also present eulogies and tributes special orders are also used to debate specific legislation and policy issues outside the time restrictions that govern legislative debate in the house and the committee of the whole as mentioned ear lier each partys leadership sometimes reserves 60minute special order to present party views on particular bill or policy issue in addition members of both partie s may coordinate their special orders to debate legislation for example in the 104th congress the two parties reserved consecutive 60minute special orders to conduct real giveandtake kind of debate of hjres 159 proposed cons titutional amendment to require twothirds majorities for bills increasing taxes16 majority and minority members participated in each partys 60minute special order in departure from regular practice these special orders took place in the middle of the day before the house considered the joint resolution the special order period also provides forum where members can practice and hone their debate skills ve teran representatives have advised new members in particular to reserve special orders for this purpose before you participate in general debate on bill get some practice get special order and have few of your fri ends participate with you get the feel of being in the well of the house how the lectern can move up and down how the microphones work practice in the somewhat stilted language of yielding to other colleagues and so forth so that wh you do get into the real legislative fight it isnt all new you have little bit of the feel of debating in the house17 during special orders freshmen majority members also have an opportunity to gain experience presiding as speaker pro temporehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30136crs7 18 these policies were announced on feb 11 1994 and implemented on feb 23 1994

61earlier announced policies of the speaker the speakers current announced policie s on special orders build upon earlier policies mainly those imp lemented on february 23 199418 these 1994 policies significantly changed special order proce dures by imposing new restrictions eg fourhour limitation on longer special orders special order reservations more than one week in advance before early 1994 special orders could be reserved months in advance and it was not unus ual to have more than 10 hours of special orders reserved for single day special order speeches also could be delivered after midnight and allnight special orders took place on occasion the speakers announced policies be fore 1994 required that members be recognized for fiveminute special order sp eeches first and then for longer speeches and that recognition alternate between majority and minority members19 when studying special order speech before february 23 1994 it is useful to remember these speeches were reserved and deliv ered under the speakers earlier less restrictive policies breaches in decorum the house rules committees subcommittee on rules and organization of the house held hearings on april 17 1997 and may 1 1997 to discuss issues raised in civility in the house of representatives hereafter referred to as civility report prepared for the march 1997 bipar tisan retreat of house members20 civility examined the publics perception of rising incivility in the house and recommended actions to reduce this perception and actual breaches in decorum the report pointed out that incivility was more likely to take place during special orders and oneminute speeches than during other periods of house floor proceedings according to civility unparliamentary language that would be taken down in regular debate was more likely to be tolerated or cautioned during special orders21 the report attributed this situation to the low number of members present during special orders it was unlikely member would make timely demand that unparliamentary words be take n down and even if this demand was made it would be all but impossible to locate the members needed to vote on an appeal of

ibidchairs ruling22 on this last point the report recommended that the house change its rules to require that appealed rulings of the chair after regular business be voted on the next legislative day23 this rules change the report argued would encourage the chair to intervene more frequently ag ainst unparliamentary language in special orders24 the 1999 report provided data on the 105th congress generally and the december 1998 impeachment debate speci fically recommendations were included the house rules committee held hearings on the 1999 report in april 1999 costs as discussed earlier daily special orders entail congressional record printing expenses for delivered and inserted special orders and the costs of keeping the house in formal session for delivered special orders eg electricity salaries of house staff and officers on february 9 1999 representative lynn rivers dmich introduced hres 47 resolution to amend house rules to requi re that the expens of specialorder speeches be paid from the members representational allowances of members making such speeches each represen tative has members representational allowance mra for expenses related to official and representational duties eg employment of staff trav franked mail supplies h res 47 was referred to the house committee on rules upon introduction but did not receive committee action in the 106th congress representative rivers introduced identical resolutions hres 97 in the 105th congress and hres 263 in the 104th congress but action was taken on either measure
