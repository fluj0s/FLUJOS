resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress climate change comparison and analysis of s 1151 and the draft climate and economy insurance act of 2005 summary climate change is generally viewed as global issue but proposed responses generally require action at the national level in 1992 the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which called on industrialized countries to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000 over the past decade variety of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in the united states but carbon dioxide emissions have continued to increase several proposals designed to address greenhouse gases have been introduced in the 109th congress two proposals s 1151 introduced by senators mccain and lieberman and draft alternative announced by senator bingaman received increased scrutiny in preparation for the senates debate on comprehensive energy legislation during that debate s 1151 introduced as samdt 826 was defeated on 3860 vote in contrast the draft alternative remains workinprogress and has yet to be introduced this report compares these two proposals both proposals would establish marketbased systems to limit emissions of greenhouse gases however the proposals differ in how those systems would work s 1151 would establish an absolute cap on emissions from covered entities and would allow entities to trade emissions under that cap the draft amendment would limit emissions intensity greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gdp and establish costlimiting safety valve to protect against high compliance costs each would set up tradeable permit program to begin addressing emissions by the year 2010 in 2004 the energy information administration analyzed an earlier version of s 1151 under eias analysis s 1151 would achieve 67 reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 compared with its projected businessasusual scenario but would not return emissions to their 2000 or 1990 levels this contrasts with the crs estimate that the draft amendment would reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions 25 in 2010 compared with eias businessasusual scenario the two proposals represent different answers to the priceversusquantity issue in reducing greenhouse gases in general marketbased mechanisms to reduce co2 emissions focus on specifying either the acceptable emissions level quantity or compliance costs price and allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution for the other variable if one is more concerned about the possible economic cost price of the program then use of safety valve to limit costs could appear to some more appropriate even through it introduces some uncertainty about the amount of reduction achieved quantity in contrast if one is more concerned about achieving specific emission reduction level quantity with costs handled efficiently but not capped tradeable permit program without safety valve may be viewed as more appropriate in the case of these alternatives s 1151 leans toward the quantity total emissions side of the equation the draft amendment leans more toward the price side this report will be updated as events warrant contents introduction 1 proposed senate legislation comparison of two proposals

affecting emission reductions 9 climate change comparison and analysis of s 1151 and the draft climate and economy insurance act of 2005 introduction climate change is generally viewed as global issue but proposed responses generally require action at the national level in 1992 the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which called on industrialized countries to take the lead in reducing the six primary greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 20001 over the past decade variety of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in the united states including monitoring of power plant carbon dioxide emissions improved appliance efficiency and incentives for developing renewable energy sources but carbon dioxide emissions have continued to increase in 2001 president george w bush rejected the kyoto protocol which called for legally binding commitments by developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions2 he also rejected the concept of mandatory emissions reductions since then the administration has focused us climate change policy on voluntary initiatives to reduce the growth in greenhouse gas emissions this focus is particularly evident in the administrations 2002 climate action report car submitted under the provisions of the unfccc of the over 50 programs summarized in the 2002 car only six are described as regulatory3 these regulatory programs were generally implemented to achieve energy or environmental goals other than the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions but produced concomitant greenhouse gas emissions reduction in this sense they could be considered the results of regrets4 policy where climate change effects resulting 1 under the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc those gases are carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o hydrofluorocarbons hfcs perfluorocarbons pfcs and sulfur hexafluoride sf6 other greenhouse gases are controlled under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer and not covered under this proposed legislation or other international agreements 2 for further information see crs report rl30692 global climate change the kyoto protocol 3 most of the programs outlined in the report involve research technical assistance information gathering or technical assistance programs initiated by the federal government or voluntary emissions reduction programs coordinated by the government 4 the regrets policy was one of establishing programs for other purposes that would have concomitant greenhouse gas reductions therefore only those policies that reduced continued crs2 from related air quality and energy policies are included in the decisionmaking process on new or modified rules number of congressional proposals to advance programs designed to reduce greenhouse gases have been introduced in the 109th congress these have generally followed one of three tracks the first is to improve the monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions in order to provide basis for research and development and for any potential future reduction scheme the second is to enact marketoriented greenhouse gas reduction program along the lines of the trading provisions of the current acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 clean air act amendments the third is to enact energy and related programs that would also have the added effect of reducing greenhouse gases an example would be requirement that electricity producers generate portion of their electricity from renewable resources renewable portfolio standard this report focuses on the second category of bills specifically comparing the major provisions of two proposals that received attention during the senates debate on the senate version of hr 6 the energy policy act of 2005 proposed senate legislation comparison of two proposals in february 2005 senators mccain and lieberman introduced s 342 the climate stewardship act of 20055 the primary focus of the proposed legislation is to reduce us emissions of greenhouse gases through the use of flexible market based mechanisms in may 2005 senators mccain and lieberman introduced s 1151 an expanded version of s 342 that includes new title designed to encourage innovation and deployment of less carbon intensive technologies sequester carbon emissions or mitigate the effects of climate change the bills emission reduction provisions are very similar to samdt 2028 to s 139 of the 108th congress which the senate debated in 2003 that amendment failed on 4355 vote during the debate on the energy policy act of 2005 s 1151 was introduced as samdt 826 and defeated on 3860 vote as summarized in table 1 s 1151 would require mandatory and economy wide emission reductions using flexible marketbased implementation strategy the bill would require economywide reductions but permits participation in pre certified international trading systems and in carbon sequestration programs to achieve part of the reduction requirement the bill excludes residential and agricultural sources of greenhouse gases along with entities that do not own single 4 continued greenhouse gas emissions at cost were considered 5 at the same time representatives gilchrest and olver introduced hr 759 which is very similar to s 342 crs3 facility that emits more than 10000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents annually6 draft amendment7 announced by senator bingaman is based on the report of the national commission on energy policy ncep that called for mandatory economywide tradeable permit program to begin limiting greenhouse gases8 the climate and economy insurance act of 2005 hereafter referred to as the draft amendment would mandate an accelerated reduction in the greenhouse gas intensity of the countrys economy9 between 2010 and 2019 the draft amendment would require 24 annual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per dollar of projected gross domestic product gdp after 2019 this reduction would increase to 28 annually implementation would be through flexible marketoriented allowance trading program the total number of allowances each year would be calculated based on the mandated decline in greenhouse gas intensity and projected gdp growth however the draft amendment includes costlimiting safety valve that allows covered entities to make payment to doe in lieu of reducing emissions the initial price of such payments would be 7 ton in 201010 thus if covered entity chooses it may make payments to doe at specific price rather than make any necessary emissions reductions the most notable difference between the two proposals is their approach to controlling emissions of greenhouse gases both would cover the majority of us greenhouse gas emissions however while s 1151 would place an absolute cap on emissions from covered entities the draft amendment aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity under s 1151 while emissions from covered entities would be capped uncovered emissions would be expected to continue to rise ultimately overall us emissions would be expected to grow under the draft amendment if it is assumed that all us emissions are covered economic growth would determine whether total us emissions grow or decline if economic growth outpaces the scheduled reductions in emissions intensity or the proposals safety valve is invoked emissions could continue to grow11 6 for more information on s 1151 see crs report rs22076 climate change summary and analysis of the climate stewardship act

continues at historic rates roughly 3 to 4 per year absolute emissions levels would be projected to increase by roughly 1 per year crs4 second key difference is the establishment of costlimiting safety valve in the draft amendment under this proposal covered entities in need of extra tradeable allowances may purchase them on an open market or they can make payment to doe at set price ie the safety valve12 under s 1151 there is provision to limit the price per allowance that covered entity would be required to pay in addition the two proposals differ in other ways as well including which entities are covered which agency has primary responsibility for the program how credits for early action and other activities can be generated and how proceeds from the saleauction of allowances will be utilized table 1 compares key topics covered by the two proposals table 1 comparison of key topics covered by s 1151 and the draft amendment topic s 1151 draft amendment emission absolute cap on

program initiatives to promote less carbon intensive technology adaption sequestration and related activities results emission reductions as discussed in the next section emission reduction estimates under both options involve at least some uncertainty particularly for the draft amendment thus the estimates provided in table 2 should be considered ballpark in nature in 2004 the energy information administration eia analyzed an earlier version of s 115113 under eias analysis s 1151 would achieve 67 reduction 13 energy information administration analysis of senate amendment 2028 the climate stewardship act of 2003 may 2004 samdt 2028 is very similar to s 1151 and is used continued crs8 in overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 compared with its projected businessas usual scenario but would not return greenhouse gas emissions to their 2000 or 1990 levels this result contrasts with crss estimate that the draft amendment would result in 25 reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 compared with eias businessasusual scenario14 crs did not estimate longer term reductions from either s 1151 or the draft amendment because of the inherent uncertainty involved in such projections qualitatively it can be stated that emissions of greenhouse gases would likely continue to increase under both options although somewhat more slowly than businessasusual in the case of s 1151 the percentage of greenhouse gases not covered by the bill would increase and would be uncontrolled by the reduction program thus the initial reduction in emissions achieved in 2010 would be slowly eaten up over time in the case of the draft amendment covered emissions would continue to grow to the extent that projected economic growth outstripped the 24 annual reduction in carbon intensity 28 beginning in 2020 and to the extent that increased costs drove covered entities to invoke the safety valve rather than further reduce emissions in the longer term emissions could potentially rise faster under the draft amendment than under s 1151 table 2 projected emissions under s 1151 and draft amendment billions of metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents year reference

2010 projections for samdt 2028 energy information administration analysis of senate amendment 2028 the climate stewardship act of 2003 may 2004 samdt 2028 is very similar to s 1151 and is used as surrogate here however the number of covered entities may be more or less under s 1151 then assumed here so the estimates may understate or overstate actual reductions that would be achieved under s 1151 for the draft amendment calculations by crs are based on projected gdp and carbon intensity improvements by energy information administration annual energy outlook 2005 doeeia03832005 february 2005 see text for discussion of uncertainties surrounding the draft amendments estimate estimates do not take into account the potential for carbon sequestration 13 continued as surrogate here however the number of covered entities may be greater or fewer under s 1151 than assumed here so the estimates may understate or overstate actual reductions that would be achieved under s 1151 14 assumptions for analysis are discussed in the next section crs9 analysis addressing the price versus quantity issue uncertainty in emission reductions the projected emission reductions under the draft amendment are more uncertain than under s 1151 the primary source of uncertainty for s 1151 is the precise number of covered entities that must meet the reduction requirements in eias analysis of previous versions of s 1151 the assumed coverage is about 75 supporters of the bill have suggested the coverage is about 85 the difference is significant as higher coverage means more reductions than estimated by eia and more certainty about their quantity lower coverage means lower compliance costs but greater uncertainty about quantity table 3 factors potentially affecting emission reductions s 1151 draft amendment gdp growth yes carbon intensity yes to year 2009 improvement covered entities yes yes safety valve yes as indicated in table 3 the draft amendment has several uncertainties with respect to emissions reductions unlike s 1151 which defines historic emissions baseline which covered entities must achieve the draft amendment calculates future baseline from projections of 2009 gdp growth and carbon intensity improvement both of those variables are uncertain in eias current projections economic growth to 2010 is assumed under its three scenarios to range from 25 annually low case to 36 annually high case with its reference case set at 31 annually crs calculations presented in table 2 assume the reference case assumption of 31 annual gdp growth however as indicated here this estimate could be off by 20 or more likewise the carbon intensity improvement projection is uncertain based on eia projections crs estimated 2009 carbon intensity of 165 million metric tons carbon equivalent per million dollars gdp mmtcemgdp for its calculations however based on the presidents climate change initiative the targeted 2009 carbon intensity is in the range of 159 mmtcemgdp15 likewise improvement could be less than projected as current intensity levels are considerably higher than 15 see crs report 98235 enr global climate change us greenhouse gas emissions status trends and projections by john blodgett and larry parker crs10 those projected under the initiative the 2002 estimate of carbon intensity is 183 mmtcemgdp like s 1151 the draft amendment raises some questions as to the exact extent of its coverage the crs estimate in table 2 assumes 100 coverage however there are potentially entities not covered under the draft amendment the final uncertainty affecting emissions reductions achieved under the draft amendment is the safety valve all analysis done of previous versions of s 1151 indicate that 7 per ton of carbon dioxide safety valve would be triggered immediately16 in contrast the energy information administrations analysis projects the safety valve would be triggered around the year 201517 as the degree to which reductions could be achieved before the safety valve would be triggered is disputed another layer of uncertainty is added to the emission reductions achieved under the draft amendment particularly in the longer term uncertainty in cost estimates the projected cost under s 1151 is more uncertain than under the draft amendment major source of uncertainty for s 1151 is future growth in greenhouse gas emissions by covered entities because s 1151 establishes firm cap on greenhouse gas emissions based on the year 2000 any increased emissions resulting from continuing economic growth would have to be offset the more robust the economic growth the greater potential for more emissions that would have to be offset to maintain the cap in general more emission reductions probably means higher costs if economic growth is less robust fewer reductions would have to be made and costs would be less s 1151 cost estimates are affected by several other uncertainties in three studies conducted on the cost of previous versions of s 1151 two studies placed the potential permit price in 2010 at 9 ton 2001 and one at 15 ton 2001 the sources of the differing estimates are different assumptions about the availability of the following 1 cost effective energy efficiency improvements 2 costeffective nonco2 greenhouse gas reductions 3 costeffective carbon sequestration and international credits and 4 future natural gas supply with program designed to achieve leastcost solution through marketbased allowance trading system restricting the availability of options increases projected costs the range between the two studies indicating 9 ton and the one indicating 15 ton illustrates the sensitivity and uncertainty surrounding s 1151s potential costs18 16 see crs report rs22076 climate change summary and analysis of the climate stewardship act s 342 s 1151 and hr 759 by larry parker and brent yacobucci 17 the national commission on energy policy ending the energy stalemate bipartisan strategy to meet americas energy

report rs22076 climate change summary and analysis of the climate stewardship act s 342 s 1151 and hr 759 by larry parker and brent continued crs11 the draft amendments cost estimates are not as sensitive to the factors identified above partly this is by design and partly this is because the draft amendment requires less emission reductions than s 1151 unlike s 1151 the draft amendment incorporates economic growth into its emissions limitation target permitting some increase in future emissions if projected economic growth exceeds the mandated improvement in greenhouse gas intensity fewer offsets required translates into lower costs like s 1151 the draft amendments projected cost is affected by the assumed availability of costeffective control measures such as those noted above energy efficiency improvements costeffective carbon sequestration and nonco2 greenhouse gas reductions along with assumed future natural gas supply however the draft amendment does not extend its flexible market implementation program to international credits in the manner that s 1151 does thus uncertainty or possible lower costs is introduced by the potential for international trading the national commission on energy policy placed the permit price of its proposal on which the draft amendment is based at 5 ton in 2010 2004 although there are uncertainties in the draft amendments potential costs its safety valve puts firm limit on its upside risk 7 ton nominal 2010 converting these estimates to 2001 dollars the projected permit price for the draft amendment would be 48 59 ton 200119 besides putting ceiling on upside cost the draft amendments safety valve narrows the band of potential costs substantially the remaining cost uncertainty is with respect to the lower bound of costs price versus quantity the safety valve the purpose of safety valve is to bound the costs of any climate change control program price at the expense of reductions achieved quantity20 in general marketbased mechanisms to reduce co2 emissions focus on specifying either the acceptable emissions level quantity or compliance costs price and allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution for the other variable for example tradeable permit program sets the amount of emissions allowable under the program ie the number of permits available caps allowable emissions while letting the marketplace determine what each permit will be worth likewise carbon tax or the safety valve contained in the draft amendment sets the maximum unit per ton of co2 cost that one should pay for reducing emissions while the marketplace determines how much actually gets reduced in one sense 18 continued yacobucci 19 for the safety valve eia estimated its 2003 dollar valve at 610 ton crs converted it along with the ncep cost estimate to 2001 dollars using the gdp implicit price deflator see energy information administration impacts of modeled recommendations of the national commission on energy policy report sroiaf200502 april 2005 20 see crs report rs21067 global climate change controlling co2 emissions cost limiting safety valves by larry parker crs12 preference for pure tradeable permit system or inclusion of safety valve depends on how one views the uncertainty of costs involved and benefits to be received for those confident that achieving specific level of co2 reduction will yield significant benefits enough so that even the potentially very high end of the marginal cost curve does not bother them pure tradeable permit program may be most appropriate co2 emissions would be reduced to specific level and in the case of tradeable permit program the cost involved would be handled efficiently though not controlled at specific cost level this efficiency occurs because through the trading of permits emission reduction efforts concentrate at sources at which controls can be achieved at least cost however if one is more concerned about the potential downside risk of substantial control costs to the economy than of the benefits of specific level of reduction then including safety valve may be most appropriate in this approach the level of the safety valve effectively caps the marginal cost of control that affected entities would pay under the reduction scheme but the precise level of co2 achieved is less certain emitters of co2 would spend money controlling co2 emissions up to the level of the safety valve however since the marginal cost of control among millions of emitters is not well known the overall emissions reductions for given safety valve level on co2 emissions cannot be accurately forecast in essence the safety valve on the draft amendment could be seen as contingent carbon tax hence major policy question is whether one is more concerned about the possible economic cost of the program and therefore willing to accept some uncertainty about the amount of reduction received ie safety valve or one is more concerned about achieving specific emission reduction level with costs handled efficiently but not capped ie pure tradeable permits s 1151 leans toward the quantity total emissions side of the equation the draft amendment leans more toward the price side conclusion the two proposals s 1151 and the draft amendment would establish marketbased systems to limit emissions of greenhouse gases however the proposals differ in how those systems would work s 1151 would establish an absolute cap on emissions from covered entities and would allow entities to trade emissions under that cap the draft amendment would limit greenhouse gas emissions intensity and establish costlimiting safety valve to protect against high compliance costs under both proposals shortterm us emissions would likely be below businessasusual scenario although reductions under s 1151 are likely to be larger and more certain in contrast the cost of the draft amendment is likely to be less and more predictable however under both proposals total us emissions could be expected to continue their upward trend albeit at slower rate than currently forecasted for other versions of this document see
