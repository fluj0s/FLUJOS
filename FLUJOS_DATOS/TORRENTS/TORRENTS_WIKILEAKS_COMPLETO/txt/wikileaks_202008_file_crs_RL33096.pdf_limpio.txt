hurricanes the public health and medical response summary hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast in late august 2005 causing catastrophic wind damage and flooding in veral states and massive dislocation of victims across the country the storm was one of the worst natural disasters in the nations history estimates are that more than 1200 people were killed and about 2 million displaced hurricane rita which made landfall along the gulf coast in late september 2005 was ultimately less lethal than katrina but prompted aggressive preparedness efforts by governments and citizens shaken by the devastation of the earlier storm in response to series of disasters and terrorist attacks over the past decade in particular the terror attacks of 2001 cong ress the administration state and local governments and the private sector have made investments to improve disaster preparedness and response new federal authorities and pr ograms to strengthen the nations public health system were introduced in compre hensive legislation in 2002 congress also created the department of homeland security dhs in 2002 to provide national leadership for coordinated preparedness and response planning new national response plan nrp unched by dhs in december 2004 met its first major test in the re sponse to hurricane katrina according to the nrp the department of health and human services hhs is tasked with coordinating the response of the public health and medical sectors following disaster hhs works with several other agencies to accomplish this mission which includes assuring the safety of food water and nvironments treating the ranks of the ill and injured and identifying the dead hhs activities are coordinated with those of other lead ag encies under the overall leadership of dhs congress and others will review the re sponse to hurricanes katrina and rita with an eye toward assessing how well the nrp worked as an instrument for coordinated national re sponse and how well various agenci at the federal state and local levels carried out their missions unde r the plan hurricane katrina dealt some familiar blows in emergency response th failure of communication systems and subsequent difficulties in coordination cha llenged response efforts in this disaster as with others before it hurricane ka trina also pushed some response elements such as surge capacity in the healthcare workforce to their limits the response to hurricane katrina has also called attention to the matter of disaster planning in healthcare facilities and the potential role of health information technology in expediting the care of displaced persons policymakers will doubt study these elements of the katrina response and s eek options for continued improvement in national disaster

hurricanes the public health and medical response introduction hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast in late august 2005 causing extensive wind damage and catastrophic flooding nd leading to presidential disaster declarations for alabama florida loui siana and mississippi the storm was one of the worst natural disasters in the nations history hurricane rita which made landfall along the gulf coas t in late september 2005 was somewhat less severe than katrina when it hit but few days earlier in the gulf it had been powerful category five hurricane government officials and citizens shaken by the devastation of the earlier storm mounted aggressive preparedness efforts in anticipation of hurricane rita drawing on lessons learned from katrina just weeks earlier hurricane katrina is estimated to have killed more than 1200 people and displaced about 2 million the death toll tinues to be revised as bodies continue to be found and investigations into th causes of death of others continue1 more than 4000 persons are still reported missing the federal emergency management agency fema recently increased its timate of the number of persons displaced by hurricanes katrina and rita to about 2 million2 the logistical hurdles posed by hurricane katrina were formidable communications were knocked out in hardhit areas which compromised the process of assessing and prioritizing needs phys ical access was blocked in some areas and civil disorder was problem in some othe rs each kept responders from delivering aid in some cases victims were isolated without water and dicines and hospitals that had not been evacuated before the hurricane were unable to sustain operations each circumstance required the emergency evacuation of critically ill patients to triage center which then itself became overwhelmed federal state and local governments businesses and corporations the faith co mmunity and other volunteers all pitched in to speed relief to katrinas victims but keeping all of it coordinated was challenge responding to catastrophe of the scope of hurricane katrina requires that variety of public health and medical activities be carried out and coordinated public health activities are those that identify address or prevent health problems inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33096crs2 populations examples include assuring the safety of food and wa ter preventing the spread of disease in shelters evaluating the safety of neighbor hoods for rehabitation and assuring the health nd safety of responders dical activities are those that deliver healthcare services to individuals examples include treatment of injuries continuity of care for those with chroni c illnesses mental h ealth counseling and causeofdeath investigation the medical response to hurricane katrina may have posed the greater challenge the public health response required the coordination of variety of agencies communitybased organizations nd private parties at different levels of government though these entitie s had generally worked together in the past the medical response in contrast required the coordination of broader mix of federal state and local government agencies private parties and others with comparable recent precedent or experience in such an effort on this scale over the past decade in response to the oklahoma city bombing the terror attacks of 2001 and severa l serious natural disasters congress and the administration created new authorities structures and plans to assure that government at all levels can respond well to disasters like hurricane katrina local and state governments are to be the firs t responders in disaster when their resources are overwhelmed federal assistance is pr ovided under the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assi stance act the stafford act and other authorities new national response plan nrp places the s ecretary of homeland security in charge of coordinating the overall federal response the secretary of health and human services hhs is in charge of coordinating the federal public health and medical response during disaster in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita congress is likely to review response efforts recent public health prep aredness laws and the nrp while even the best plan and response may be overw helmed in disaster of the scope of hurricane katrina congress may noneth eless find opportunities to revisit management structures programs and goal s in order that national response capability can be steadily improved this report will discuss rele vant authorities and response plans that guided

majority of deaths from hurricane katrina resulted from coastal storm surges and from flooding in new orleans the catastrophic scope of hurricane ka trina presented some unusual public health threats

and involve agencies that work together regu larly though often at different levels of government medical response capabilities in contrast span wide array of sectors both public and private and involve more nontraditi onal partnerings such as the coordination of dhs and partment of defense dod activities by hhs successful medical response to disaster requires the c oordination of six elements patients in need site where care is provided the needed drugs supplies and equipment provider workforce system of record keeping and financing mechanism though national disaster pl anning has long anticipated the need to respond to mass casualty incident such situati on with overwhelming num bers of nonfatal illness and injury victims has not happened recently in the united states while certain recent events eg the septembe r 11 2001 attack and so jetliner crashes have tested the national system for mass fatality management hurricane katrina is the only event in recent times that has caused nonfatal mass casualties of scope that could not easily be absorbed into the existing healthcare system scrutiny of the response to this challenge is ongoing as discussed earlier federal leadership for medical emergency response is based in hhs per its coordinating responsib ility under nrp esf8 numerous medical response programs and activitie s reside in hhs agencies within the public health service phs in addition the commissioned corps of the phs headed by the surgeon general is composed of many healthcare professionals who are expected to maintain current skills and

of infectious diseases and ii other public health threats and emergencies57 discussions have followed about whether focus on terrorism eg the civilian smallpox vaccination program has hampered prep aredness for other threats or on the other hand whether flexible allhazards grant guidance has fa iled to assure state preparedness for some specific threats eg cyanide or plague attack58 some reports suggest that the public h ealth response to hurricane katrina was streamlined by some allhazards impr ovements made ce 2001 for example when the louisiana state public health laboratory in new orleans

their activities these afteraction reports are expected to be prepared and submitted to variety of agencies involved in the response to hurricane katrina as after action reports become available congress may review the public health and medical response to hurricane katrina to determine how well it met the goals congress laid out for achieving flexible efficient national system for response to health emergencies part of this review may be the consideration of the process of developi ng standards for federal state and local public health preparedness process which has prove n difficult in the past coordinated needs assessments needs assessments are considered cr itical in the response to catastrophic disasters when it is likely that res ponse assets will be ove rwhelmed lives may be saved by prioritizing the response as eff ectively as possible eg matching the deployment of ndms teams as well as possi ble to defined areas of medical need however the response to public health nd medical needs may have to be delayed until response has been made to other problem s such as civil disorder or lack of physical access therefore coordinatin g the assessments across all sectors is essential following disaster the nrp calls for the early deployment of emergency response teams for assessment erta which are femaled teams that work with state emergency operations centers eocs and others to conduct initial and ongoing impact assessments early assessmen ts define the extent of problems such as flooding the integrity of roads and bridges and damage to the electricity grid

that appropriate public health medical and mental health responses can reach their targ ets quickly and efficiently disaster planning in healthcare overview following hurricane katrina there were numerous reports of problems experienced by fragile or dically needy persons these problems included 1 drownings and dehydration in facilities that did not evacuate and were flooded by the hurricane storm surge 2 emergency evacuations of deteriorating patients from hospitals that were unable to care for patients after power water and food had been cut off for several days nd 3 chronic conditions exacerbated by the loss of access to needed care such as insulin oxygen therapy or kidney dialysis in preparing for hurricane rita authorities in many communities on the texas and louisiana coast paid particular attention to identifying and helping those with special health needs providing public transpor tation to support the evacuation of nursing homes and those receiving other health services hurricane katrina also exposed number of problems that healthcare facilities experienced as result of the scope of th disaster the failure of communications systems across the gulf coast made it difficult for facilities to seek assistance or for emergency responders to know that facility was in need in addition since all facilities were simulta neously affected the use of shared resources double counting led to problems for example single ambulance companies had contracted to evacuate multiple facilities this arrangement which would work well if facilities had been affected in isolation was untenable in wide scale disasterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33096crs20 64 civil district court for the parish of new orleans state of louisiana city of new orleans promulgation of emerge

see evacuation strategies for disaster planning healthcare hazard management continuedfollowing the hurricanes experts have st ressed the need for coordinated disaster planning in healthcare they note that in addition to assuring that facilities are well prepared on their own they must be integrated into communitywide emergency management activities further identifying vul nerable noninstitutionalized populations and assuring their care before during and after disaster also requires communitywide coordinated approach regulation of institutions and services healthcare facilities eg hospitals and nursing homes are regulated by state and local authorities with varying degrees of federal involveme nt regulations provide an opportunity for oversight of two critical disaster planning functions evacuation and continuity of operations in this context continuity of operations the ability to sustain lifesaving operations in the absence of power water and other exte rnal supplies could also be considered sheltering in place given the nature of their business hospitals are generally able to continue operations in the face of power outages at least temporarily because they employ generators to maintain critical lifesupport functions in an emergency furthermore it is difficult to evacuate hos pital or nursing home patients as their special needs may require special transport and host facilities this may motivate better preparedness for continuity of ope ration as more feasible option than evacuation healthcare facilities should be ab to do both though as different types of disasters would require one or the other response hospitals in new orleans that initially chose to continue operations ultimately had to evacuate evacuation policies and regulations for healthcare facilities have long focused on fire safety for which the need to evacuate is evident and for which drills are regularly conducted by local fire safety authorities evacuation planning for predicted threat such as hurricane may be more challenging the decision to evacuate or not may hinge on emergency management rather than healthcare expertise and may be guided by local officials rather than facility managers for example the mandatory evacuation order issued by the city of new orleans on august 28 excluded essential personnel of hospitals and their patients but did not exempt other types of healthcare facilities64 in preparing for hurricane charley in florida in 2004 one county issued count ywide mandatory evacuation order while neighboring county issued mandato ry order for nursing homes only65 while healthcare facilities are licensed and regulated by state and local authorities there is role for federal oversight of their disaster preparedness and response

not in isolation70 the commissions 2005 emergency management standards include requirement that hospitals conduct hazard vulnerability anal ysis to determine th types of hazards the facility is likely

persons during the 2004 hurricanes the stat facilitated evacuation to the shelters of individuals who were preidentified by county health partments this arrangement facilitated care of those whose
