weapons or ballistic missile s declined initially but was rekindled beginning with the 104th congress using satellites to attack ballistic missiles has been controversial since president r eagans 1983 announcement of strategic defense initiative to study the viability of building ballistic missile defense system to protect the united states and its allies the clinton administration changed the name of the strategic defense initiative organization to the ballistic missile defense organization to reflect new focus on theater missile defense in the wake of the persian gulf war rather than national missile defense the george w bush administration changed the name to the missile defense agency mda to reflect its interest in broad missile defense goals3 the concept of placing weapons in space as part of missile defense system or otherwise remains cont roversial may 18 2005 new york times article reported that the new national space policy being developed by the bush administration would move the united states closer to fielding offensive and defensive space weapons4 thenwhite house press secret ary scott mcclellan responding to questions at white house press briefing stressed that the new policy still being developed does not represent substantia l shift in us policy the same day representative kucinich introduced b ill hr 2420 that would have banned weapons in space and the use of such weapons to damage or destroy objects in orbit the house rejected 124302 kucinich amendment to the foreign relations authorization act hr 2601 on july 20 2005 that was similar to his bill the

government accountability office gao dod intended to implement 10 of the 13 organizational recommendations9 although additiona l updates have been provided several dod space programs have experi enced significant cost overruns and schedule delays raising concerns about dods acquisition process for space systems the defense science board dsb and air force scientific advisory board afsab commissioned task force chaired by retired lockheed martin executive tom young to review dod space program ac quisition because of significant cost increases in several programs its may 2003 report was publicly released in september 200310 four key findings of the report were that cost has replaced mission success as the primary driver in managing acquisition processes creating excessive technical and sche dule risk the space acquisition system is strongly biased to produce unrealistica lly low cost estimates government capabilities to lead and manage the acquisition pro cess have seriously eroded and there are long term concerns about the space industrial base ccording to press reports the task force produced an update in august 2004 that c oncluded that some of the space programs it criticized were making progress but still required close review and that better coordination is needed between the military and intelligence agencies in setting requirements11 on april 6 2006 the senate committee on armed forces held hearing on space acquisitions at that hearing cris tina t chaplain gaos acting director of acquisition and sourcing stified that dods space acqui sition programs continue to face substantial cost and schedule overruns in some cases according to ms chaplain cost growth has come close to or exceeded 100 causing dod to nearly double its investment with corresponding increase in functionality additionally many programs have experienced significan t schedule delays as much as six years postponing delivery of promis ed capabilities to the warfighter12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33601crs5 13 an overview of this program is available online at httpwwwglobalsecurityorg spacelibraryreport1998sb irsbrochurepart07htm 14 10 usc 2433 commonly

sbirshigh congre ss has continued to acknowledge the programs importance and has therefore maintained high levels of funding the presidents fy2008 budget request of 107 billion represents total increase of 4009 million from fy2007 with 587 million reserved for rdte and 483 milli on for procurement the proposal provides for the continued assembly integration and testing of the first tw sbirs

aehf program18 which in turn is followon to the current series of milstar satellites aehf itself is controversial because of cost overruns and changing satellite and constellation specifications tsat is expected to transform dod communications by providing vastly greater capacity than is available today by operating at much higher optical frequencies if tsat is delayed some observers ggest that additional aehf satellites may be needed in may 2006 gao released report outlining the ongoing issues and problems in the development and deploy ment of the tsat system19 specifically gao stated that dod was not meeting original cost schedule and performance goals established for the tsat program however gao not ed that dod is taking positive steps to lower risk in the tsat program so it can enter the product velopment phase with greater chance of success the fy2007 appropriation for tsat is 7371 million 130 million below the 867 million budget request congress also dir ected the secretary of the air force to submit report to the congressional defense committees explaining what actions the air force has taken to address the remaining concerns raised by the tsat program review group and the gao including 1 the need to significantly refine requirements so that program content can be matched to budget constraints and how the department plans to c ontrol requirements to prevent problems associated with requirements creep 2 the need to ade quately staff the tsat program office with experienced space acquisition professionals 3 the status of refining key performance parameters so they provide sp ecificity and validation metrics and 4 the implications for other programs such as space radar and future combat system of less capable initial block of tsat satellites this report was delivered february 15 2007 as required for fy2008 the president has requested budget for research and development of 9636 million an increase of nearly 234 million over fy2007 funding levels the total appropriation of 7299 million in 2007 was net increase of 43 from fy2006 the first tsat was planned to launch in late 2014 but the air force pushed that date to early 2016httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33601crs7 20 an overview of this program is available online at httpwwwglobalsecurityorgspace systemssrhtm 21 for example in its 2004 report on the fy 2005 dod appropr iations bill hrept 108 557 the committee noted that the estimated co st for ninesatellite constellation was 34 billion and the air force considers nine satellites to be less than half the number required the committee expressed skepticism about the 34 billion estimate as well 22 this report is available online at httpwwwcbogovftpdocs76xxdoc7691 0103spaceradarpdfspace radar space radar20 is planned to consist of yettobedetermined number of satellites that would track m obile targets as opposed to fixed targets on the ground as of january 2007 the air force had not yet decided on the final design of the satellites or the final architecture of th constellation the house appropriations committee has sharply criticized the program for the past several years21 due to ongoing cost overruns and missed rd milestones congress also directed the secretary of defense and the director of national intelligence dni to submit joint report to the congressional defense and intelligence committees describing 1 the re spective roles and re sponsibilities of the intelligence community and the dod with re spect to the development of the space radar program including an updated memorandum of agreement between the secretary and the dni 2 the process by which the intelligence community and the dod coordinate joint developm ent efforts and requirement s definition and 3 the plans for achieving costshare agreement between the intelligence community and the department for the development nd acquisition of space radar capability congress also asked for commitment from the secretary and the dni that space radar would be single system responsiv to the requirements of each organization this report was due march 1 2007 but has not yet been submitted beginning in fy2008 funding for the sp ace based radar will transfer to the defense reconnaissance support activ ities program and fundi ng amounts have been classified for the fy2008 budget request b ecause of the progra ms integration into the national intelligence community for fy2007 congress appropriated 1864 million for the space radar program nearly twice the fy2006 budget of 983 million the first satellite launc h is scheduled for fy2016 additional information about space rada r is available in the january 2007 congressional budget office report lternatives for military space radar22 this

acqui sitions status of ballistic missile defense program in 2004 march 2006 gao 05243 in this report gao reported that dod had estimated the lifecycle cost for stss then sbirslow th rough fy2022 at 118 billion the house appropriations committee reported in 2001 hrept 107298 p 250 that the programs life cycle cost had grown from 10 billion to over 23 billionspace tracking and surveillance system stss formerly sbirslow the space tracking and surveillance system stss previously sbirslow is designed to support missile defense23 the goal of an operational stss is to track missiles through all three phases discriminate between warheads and decoys transmit data to other systems that will be used to cue radars and provide intercept handovers and provide da ta for intercept h itkill assessments tracking missiles during the midcourse phase is more diffi cult than during boost because the missile is longer firing its engines and he nce does not have strong infrared heat signature making it necessary to track cold object against the cold background of space similarly tracking warheads af ter they have been deployed and discriminating between warheads and decoys is technically challenging task cost estimates are problematic because there is fina l system architecture and the schedule is in flux in march 2005 gao reported that dods estimate for the program between 2002 and 2011 is approximately 45 billion life cycle cost was not provided24 for fy2008 the president requested budget of 331 million for the stss program an increase from the fy2007 budget of 322 million
