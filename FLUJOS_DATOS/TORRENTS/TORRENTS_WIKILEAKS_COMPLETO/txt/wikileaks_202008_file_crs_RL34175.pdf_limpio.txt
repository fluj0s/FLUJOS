cooperation and development oecd the oecd consists of 30 democracies most of which are considered the most economically advanced countries in the world according to oecd data the united states spent 6102 per capita on health care in 2004 more than double the oecd average and 199 more than luxembourg the secondhighest spending country in 2004 153 of the us economy was voted to health care compared

chris l peterson and rachel burton domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34175us health care spending comparison with other oecd countries summary the united states spends more money on health care than any other country in the organization for economic cooperati on and development oecd the oecd consists of 30 democracies most of wh ich are considered the most economically advanced countries in the world accordin g to oecd data the united states spent 6102 per capita on health care in 2004 more than double the oecd average and 199 more than luxembourg the second highest spending c ountry in 2004 153 of the us economy was devoted to health care compared with 89 in the average oecd country and 116 in secondplaced switzerland why does the united states spend this amount on health care economists break health care spending into two parts price and quantity which includes the number of visits to health care providers and the intensity of those visits in terms of quantity oecd data indicate that the united states has far fewer doctor visits per person compared with the oecd average for hospitalizations the united states ranks well below the oecd and is roughly comparable in terms of length of hospital stays the intensity of service delivery is different story the united states uses more of the newest medical technologies and performs veral invasive procedures such as coronary bypasses and angioplas ties more frequently than the average oecd country in terms of price the oe cd has stated that there is doubt that us prices for medical care commodities and services are significantly higher than in other countries and serve as key determinant of high er overall spending what does the united states get for the money it spends said slightly differently does the united states get co rresponding value from the money it spends on health care the available data often do not provide clear answers for example among oecd countries in 2004 the united states had shorterthanaverage life expectancy and higherthanaverage mortality rates does this mean that the us system is inefficient in light of how much is spent on health care or does this reflect the greater prevalence of certain di seases in the united states the united states has the highest incidence of cancer and aids in the oecd and less healthy lifestyles the united states has the highest obesity rates in the oecd these are some of the issues that c onfound international comparisons however research comparing the quality of care has not found the united states to be superior overall nor does the u s population have subs tantially better access to health care resources even putting aside the issue of the uninsured although the united states does not have long wait times for nonemergency surgeries unlike some oecd countries americans found it mo re difficult to make sameday doctors appointments when sick and had the most difficulty getting care on nights and weekends they were also most likely to delay or forgo treatment because of cost the oecd data and other research provide some insight as to why health care spending is higher in the united states than in other countries although many difficult research issues remain this report presents some of the available data and research and concludes with summary of study

countries how much does the united states spend on health care in 2004 health care spending in the united states averaged 6102 per person according to data from the organization for economic cooperati on and development oecd the oecd consists of 30 democracies listed in table 1 most of which are considered to be the most economi cally advanced countries in the world1 as shown in figure 1 and table 1 us per capita health care spending was well over double the average of oecd c ountries which was 2560 in 2004 health care made up 153 of the us economy in 2004 as measured by gross domestic product gdp up from 51 of gdp in 1960 other oecd country devotes as much of its economy to health care also shown in table 1 figure 2 shows the relationship between h ealth care spending and gdp the trendline in the figure suggests based on simple bivariate comparison that 90 of the variation in health care spending across the 30 oecd countries may be attributable to gdp per capita the two outliers are luxembourg and the united states luxembourg appears below the tre ndline because of its high gdp per capita which is inflated by its international financial services2 the united states appears above the trendline because of its high h ealth care spending specifically us health care spending per capita is 60 higher th an might be expected based on gdp us health care spending is high even when ta king into account how rich the country is the next section of this report examines the volume intensity and price of us health care and assesses the potential impact of each on us spending the following section discusses some structur causes affecting health care spending such as the underlying health of countries populations which may be partially linked to demographics although such structural factors can affect health care spending substantially quantifying that impact for international comparisons is difficulthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34175crs2 finally this report looks into the

united states spend so much on health care the standard economic approach to analyzing health care spending is to break it into two parts price and quantity because spending is calculated by multiplying the volume of units purchased by the unit price however health care spending is more complicated because for particular unit eg hospital admission or doctor visit total spending will vary by the intensity of care for example two hospitals may charge the same price for particular services following heart attack when individuals are admitted to the hospitals total spending is going to vary according to the intensity of care whether patients undergo expensive surgeries or are simply given certain dications and monitored to understand us010002000300040005000600070008000 0 10000 20000

the oecd defines per capita doctor visits as ambulatory contacts with physicians both generalists and specialists divided by the entire population the number of contacts normally includes visits of patients at the physi cians office in primary care clinics and in outpatient departments of hospitals and visits made to the patients homehealth care spending in an international context this section examines the volume or utilization of certain types of health care the intensity of care and the price of care volume do americans use health care more often when comparing us utilization of hos pital care with other oecd countries the united states is well below the average as shown in figure 3 the united states experienced 121 hospital discharges per 1000 people in 2004 compared with the oecd average of 161 one possible expl anation for the low us utilization of hospital care is that services that are available in outpatient settings in the united states are available only in inpatient hosp ital settings in some european countries diseases of the circulatory system were the largest single cause of hospitalizations in the oecd accounting fo r 13 of all discharges the united states had the highest proportion of hospital discharges because of diseases of the circulatory system 17 although the us proportion was the highest in the oecd the us number of hospitalizations for circul atorysystem diseases per 1000 people in the population 21 per 1000 people was the same as the oecd average as shown in the righthand portion of figure 3 this is because of the low us hospitalization utilization generally in 2004 physician services made up 22 of us health care spending second only to hospital care when comparing per capita doctor visits in 27 oecd countries the united states is the seventh west consumer of doctor visits as shown in figure 4 3 among the four countries with th highest overall spending after the united states luxembourg switzerla nd norway and iceland their average number of doctor visits was also below th oecd average countries with higher rates of doctor visits tende d to have lower overall hea lth spending the number of doctor visits per capita may be influenced by whether patients are required to get referral in order to see specialist in the united states such gatekeeping has subsided in recent years whereas some eu ropean countries rely on this practice great deal the nextlargest component of health car spending in the united states in 2004 was prescription drugs according to the oecd data the united states spent roughly twice as much on prescription dr ugs 752 per person as the average oecd country in 2004 figure 18 but because overall health spending per capita is even higher than in the average oecd count ry prescription drugs ended up comprising smaller portion of total us health spending 123 compared with the oecd average 178 figure 19 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34175 crs6 source oecd health data 2006 october 2006 notes

provided in hospitals the other type of hospital care measured in oecd data is longt erm care usually provided in nursing homes 5 in the oecd data the united states ranked n ear or at the bottom in terms of its average length of hospital stays for most diagnostic categories the notable exceptions were for perinatal conditions eg conditions requiring care in neonatal intensive care unit nicu in which the us ranked 7th and congenital abnormalities in which the us ranked 10th although the united states had the seve nthhighest length of hospital stay for continuedintensity when amer icans receive care is it more involved the intensity of health care refers to the amount of resources used in given health care encounter for example wh similarly situated people are admitted to the hospital for given condition how many days do they remain in the hospital how many tests do they undergo are the an cillary services costly do they require highly trained personnel do patients undergo surgery are those surgeries resourceintensive even when facilities charge the same price for services the quantity of services provided during h ealth care encounter can have huge impact on total spending quantifying and comparing the intensity of health care particularly across countries is not simple ideally one w ould compare the intensity of care 1 for similarly situated people 2 for each type of health care event and 3 according to the cause of the event some countries have much older population that may require more intense care countries may also vary in terms of the prevalence of certain diseases in their populations moreover intensity should be assessed by differentiating the cause of the health care event for example two similarly situated women may be admitted to hospital but if one is coming for normal childbirth and the other is coming for heart transplant the intensity of that hospital visit will be quite different in the absence of such detailed data the available aggregate measures though less than ideal are generally used intensity of hospitalizations one indicator of intensity is average length of acute care hospital stay shown in figure 5 4 such measure does not control for how the populations vary nor for the causes of those hospitalizations some analysts prefer to use this measure as an indicator of efficiency that shorter stays mean less health care spending however the servi ces provided in those shorter stays could be much more intense compared with places where length of stays are longer thus length of stay is far from an ideal measure of either intensity or efficiency moreover if hospital stays are too short that is if sufficient inpatient treatment was not provided then adverse health outcome s may result along with potentially more health care spending in 2004 the average length of hospital stay in the united states was the same as the oecd average of 56 days figure 6 shows the average length of stay following heart attack acute myocardial infarction the united states average 55 days was the lowest in the oecd figure 7 shows the average length of stay for normal childbirth delivery the united states had the thirdlowest ra 19

2003 in terms of the number of transplants performed per 100000 people in the population 8 the conditions that the united states performed more frequently were coronary angioplasties including stenting coronary bypass grafts cardiac catheterizations implanting pacemakers hysterectomies and kn ee replacements the conditions that the united states performed less frequently were appendectomies prostatectomy hip replacements and mastectomies the united st ates performed more organ transplants than the oecd median for all six types of transp lants bone marrow heart liver lung kidney and functioning kidney medians are used in these cases because single outlier cases substantially skew the averages 9 note that some countries calculate this measure based on number of fulltime equivalent staff while others use head count data for the united states use fulltime equivalent staff but do not match the oecd definitionalthough us hospital stays are genera lly fewer and shorter the services provided during those stays ma be particularly intensive some evidence suggests this is the case figure 8 shows that the united states has the fifthhighest rate of caesarean section childbirths in addition the united states has one of the top five highest rates of performing organ transplants another particularly intensive type of procedure for all but one type of organ7 for all four types of heart procedures on which the oecd collects data the united states consistently has one of the top five highest rates of performing such procedures figures 9 illustrates the use of two intensive surgical coronary revascularization procedures coronary artery bypass grafts cabgs and coronary angioplasties ptcas in 2003 these pr ocedures were performed on 587 out of 100000 people in the united states mo re than double the oecd average that said crossnational comparisons do not always indicate consistently high levels of us service intensity the united states ranks 2nd in its rate of knee

other conditions8 for acute care hospitalizations other broa d measures of intensity are the number of staff and the number of nurses per hospital bed in 2003 the united states averaged five staff members for each occupied acute care hospital bed this is 61 greater than the oecd average and second only to the united kingdom 65 staff per bed as shown in figure 10 9 when looking at the rate of nurses per occupied bed the united states is closer to the oecd average as shown in figure 11 although the intensity of hospitalizati ons in the united states measured by number of staff per bed and

important measures of hospital car intensity are usage rates of resource intensive technologies inte rnational comparisons of the usage of technologies such as computerized tomography ct scanne rs and

twice as many ct scanners figure 12 and three times as many mri machines figure 13 per capita as the oecd average in fact the united states has the secondhighest number of both ct s canners and mri machines per population in the oecd second only to japan where w reimbursement rate s have driven the development and widespread adoption of inexpensive vers ions of these machines10 widespread use of advanced medical t echnology can contribute to higher health spending in number of ways through the cost of the equipment or machines themselves by keeping people alive long er and thereby increasing the opportunity for them to use health care through even tual expansions in the populations being treated with these technologies and becau competition between hospitals can lead to an oversupply of machines which in turn can lead to increases in health spending11 intensity of doctor visits the number of doctor visits per capita in the united states was well below the oecd average in 2004 figure 4 yet the united states spent much more per capita on outpa tient care than any other oecd country the united states spent 2668 per capita on outpatient care alone in 2004 three andahalf times the oecd average and twi ce as much as the secondhighest spender in this category as mentioned earlier this discrepancy could be partially due to the tendency to provide more types of procedures in

is major amount of variation in health care intensity within the united states for example research by john wennberg and his colleagues at dartmouth college found that age sex and raceadjusted spendi ng for traditional feeforservice ffs medicare in the miami hosp ital referral region in 1996 was 8414 nearly two and half times the 3341 spent that year in the minneapolis region12 they ruled out utilization of surgical procedures and price as the main drivers of these differences instead they concluded that endoflife care makes miami truly exceptional patients in their last six months of life see more physicians and spend more time in intensive care than is the case virtually anywhere else13 thus to the extent that one concludes th at us spending levels are the highest in the world because of the intensity of car it should be noted that level of intensity is not nationwide and is not consistently high for all services and for all similarly situated individuals within the united states price do americans pay more for health care services as previously discussed americans do not lead the world in per capita doctor visits or hospitalizations when american s receive health care services they appear to receive higherthanaver age amount of certain surgi cal procedures and advanced medical technologies but generally do not have the highest levels in the oecd this leaves price as the last remaining factor in the equation to explain the high level of us health care spending in assessing what drives the difference between us health care spending and the rest of the world some leading health economists responded this way its the prices stupid14 put more formally report from the oecd declared that there is doubt that us prices fo r medical care commodities and services are significantly higher than in other countries and serv as key determinant of higher overall spending15 while there is little disagreement that prices are key determinant of higher us health care

example what index among the various exchange rates and purchasing power parities ppps should be used for currency conversion price comparisons are quite sensitive to these assumptions what are the units to be priced for example the average cost of an entire surgical procedure or the charges for components of the procedure hourly rate of the health professionals charges for equipment usage etc by choosing the former intensity is inappropriately subsumed into the price however the latter is difficult to ascertain for all the components of the procedure certainly such price information is rare in an aggregate form that is compar able across multiple countries this section of the report presents some price comparisons of certain health care goods and services these comparisons ar by means exhaustive in covering the entire health care system and require some of the methodological caveats alluded to earlier salaries of health professionals standard economic theory teaches that the production of any good or service require s labor andor capital health care is particularly laborintensive requiring the involvement of many individuals including numerous highly trained profe ssionals such as doctors and nurses total health care costs therefore will partly be function of the price of labor doctors and nurses salaries for instance as it turns out us health care professionals specialists general practitioners and nurses are among the highest paid health professionals in the world as shown in table 2 specialists are the third highest paid and general practitioners and nurses are the highest paid within their profession among reporting oecd countries it is necessary to note however that hi gher education in most of the oecd is much less expensive or even free compar ed with the united states as result health care professionals in the rest of the oecd generally begin their careers with considerably smaller educational debts compared with those

of the secondhighest spender in this category sweden 1381 however the high level of us outpatient spending may be driven partly by methodological issues in the united states it is common for phy sicians to provide inpatient hospital care while not being employees of the hospital for categorizing us spending these physician services ar considered outpatient serv ices even though they are provided in an inpatient setting the result is that the united states appears to have higher proportion of outpatient spendi ng and lower proportion of inpatient spending than it otherwise woul d combined however outpatient and inpatient services account for 71 of spending in the united states compared with 69 of spending in the median oecd country qu ite similar percentages even so total us health spending per capita is still twice as high as the oecd average if independently billing physician costs in th united states could be recategorized as inpatient spending it is quite plausible that the united states would rank first in both outpatient and inpatient spending in table 4 with proportions of spending inline with the other countries this highlights yet again the care that must be taken when comparing international health expenditure data26 spending on health administration and insurance in the united states 465 was seven times that of the oecd median 66 based on the 21 countries reporting the information in 2004 as percentage of total health care spending the united states 76 was far above the oecd dian 25 the united states was outspent by only one country luxembour

insurance policies which cover 75 of the population yet pay out benefits worth only 22 of those paid out by the statutory plans27 spending on health insurance and adminis tration can be broken into three parts the largest part at least in the united states comprises the difference between earned premiums and incurred be nefits of private health insurers this difference accounts for insurers administrative costs ne t additions to reserves rate credits and dividends premium taxes and profits or losses the next largest part comprises the administrative expenses of government prog rams the smallest part comprises the expenses associated with health activities of philanthropies the complexity of the us system may cause greater administrative costs within the other categories but this is

care spending relative to most of the leading industrialized democr acies the discussion presented what information is available on the trad itional components of spending quantity specifically health care utilization in the form of volume and intensity and price however price and quantity themselves are driven by even more fundamental factors many of which have been alluded to already for example the populations health and income rather than dealing with few of these factors piecemeal this section uses what data are available to l ook more comprehensively at the factors that affect health care spending with couple of exceptions that will be discussed health care is similar in many respects to other goods and services that people purchase for example as prices drop people tend to consume mo re using the classic supplydemand construct health care has its suppliers doctors hospitals pharmaceutical companies etc and those who have demand or desire to use health care patients consumers etc this section describes many of th factors that can change the supply and the demand of health care along with discussion of their impact on price and utilization where possible this section co mpares the impact of these factors in the united states with other oecd countries factors that affect demand health populations health can affect the amount of health care they use determinants of health that are included in the oecd data are age discussed in the next section obesity diet and alcohol and tobacco consumption the incidence of certain diseases in population can affect nations health care spending compared with others however the oecd data provide such information only for cancer ie malignant neoplasms and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids in both cases the united states has the highest incidence in the oecd in 2002 th incidence of cancer in the united states was 358 per 100000 population compared with the secondhighest rate of 331 in new zealand and the oecd average of 266 in 2002 the incidence of aids in the united states was 147 per 100000 population compared with the secondhighest rate of 97 in portugal and the oecd average of 19 using the available oecd data if peopl in one country have greater rates of obesity than in another one might expect them to have higher average health care spending although the oecd data provi estimates of the percentage of the

not provide estimates of how this might compare with other countries age structure of the population because the incidence of many of the most costly diseases tends to increase with age the age structure of population may also affect its per capita health care spending as compared with other nations in the oecd countries the percentage of the population aged 65 and older ranges from 6 in

edition 1997 p 602 for sometime it has been questioned whether the increased care resulting from reduced outofpocket payments continuedas an explanation for this countrys high health care spending relative to the rest of the world income changes in peoples income shifts their demand for health care as income increases people tend to consume gr eater quantities of goods such as health care and are willing to pay higher prices if peoples incomes rise and the supply of products is not increased then the price of those products would be expected to rise as discussed earlier and illustrated in figure 2 simple bivariate comparison suggests that varying gdp levels may account for 90 of the variation in per capita health care spending across the 30 oecd countries thus one might expect the united states to have high level of per capita health care spending compared with countries with lower per capita gdp alt hough us health care spending is still 60 higher than its gdp would predict33 insurance the presence of insurance also affects demand for health care because health insurance reduces people s outofpocket costs of care people with health insurance will generally use more health care than people who lack insurance the rand health insurance experiment which took place in the 1970s and 1980s found that those with health insurance plan that covered all costs would seek nearly twice as much care as those with health insurance plan that covered only 5 of the costs with total spending directly related to the level of costsharing individuals faced34 the phenomenon of people seeking more or any health care because they face lower outofpocket costs from insuran ce is referred to in health economics as moral hazard35 if the vast majority of americans had health insurance

states has the lowest percentage of its population enrolled in health insurance among those countries reporting the us health care system is unique in the oecd area the united stat does not have national insurance program and 14 percent of the popul ation has insurance coverage36 twentytwo oecd countries provided 98 to 100 of their residents with public health insurance covering at least hos

buckingham uk 2002 available at httpwwweurowhointdocumente74485pdf it is worth noting that high rates of costsharing do not always result in low total health spending for example switzerland has the

insurance and expenses overview of cu rrent law and legislation by bob lyke and julie m whittakerfactor affecting moral haza rd besides simply coverage americans pay less out of pocket for care on average than the popula tions of most other oecd countries which one might expect to lead to greater health care spending specifically as shown in figure 21 132 of us health care costs were paid by individuals out of their own pockets in 200440 this is the fifthlowest average rate of costsharing in the oecd even including the effect of the uninsured however this is based on the average amount paid out of pocket which obscures the variation in individuals cost sharing eg some people who might be uninsured and face 100 costsharing versus those with generous coverage who face little or costsharing more analyses are needed on the distribution of costsharing among countries populations to more fully appreci ate the impact of costsharing on overall health care spending41 tax treatment health insurance increases health care spending to the extent that it reduces the cost of services to individuals the same is true for the tax treatment of health care costs and health insurance premiums in the united states wages set aside by employers to pay for h ealth insurance are not subject to personal income tax as result more money is available to pay for health insurance compared with the amount if it were paid out to workers taxed and then used to purchase coverage when payments for health insurance premiums receive tax advantages individuals tend to purchase richer health insurance benefits than they would in the absence of those tax benefits42 in addition to tax preferences for employersponsored health insurance premiums outofpocket health care cost s are tax deductible once they exceed 75 of adjusted gross income agi for those who itemize their tax returns however taxadvantaged accounts for example hea lth savings accounts may enable some individuals to exempt all of their outofpocket health care costs from income tax regardless of the amount of those expenses or whether or not individuals tax returns are itemized premiums for nongroup heal th

addition researchers looking at the seemingly une xplained variation in medicare spending across geographic areas came to the following conclusions regions and academic medical centers with greater overall spending rates is largely the result of the providers in these regions using more supplysensitive care more physician visits hospitalizations stays in icus and diagnostic testing and imaging the remarkable variation in the frequency of use of these services among regions demonstrates the role capacity plays for example rates of primary care visits vary by factor of about three visits to medical specialists by more than six and hospitalizations for cancer chronic lung disease and congestive heart failure by more than four60 over the years these researchers have consistently shown positive association between the supply of staffed hospital be ds and the rate of hospitalization for conditions that do not require surgery similar relationship can be seen between the supply of physicians and visit rates par ticularly for those specialties that spent most of their time treating chronic illness61 research also indicates that on average the additional utilization and spe nding do not necessarily lead to better health outcomes62 one study suggests that areas with new doctorowned specialty cardiac hospitals see 200 faster growth in the number of h eart procedures compared with areas with new cardiac programs at general hospitals this research suggests that doctors financial stakes in specialty hospitals cause them to refer more patients for surgery especially relatively healthy patients63 there is also an extremely strong correlation between the number of acute hos pital beds per capita and the number of acute care bed days per capita64 even so it is

factors one group of researchers remarked that it is the relative roles of primary care physicians and specialists rather than their number that makes the difference in health outcomes66 another study suggests that an increase in the number of general practitioners per population is associated with an increase in the quality of health care and reduced costs per patient67 one study comparing elderly medical care in the united states and canada found that canadian seniors received 44 more evaluation and management services but 25 fewer surgical proce dures than american seniors68 study comparing

quantifying the specific effect of defensive medicine on health spending is more difficult to measure the most widely cited study on this issue indicated that stat that adopted malp ractice tort

reforms are sometimes associated with higher health spending sometimes lower spending and sometimes effect on health spending73 structure of health system the structure of count rys health system and providers bargaining power has major effect on countrys level of health spending in the united states many hospitals and hospital systems have consolidated in the past several years enabling them to

pays directly for health expenses but employs the doctors and nurses that provide the care as well as owns and operates most of the sites where that care is given various estimates put the uk national health service at the third or the fifth largest employer in the world75 as shown in table 2 in 2004 uk general practitioners were the second bestpaid in the oecd its nurses the third bestpaid and its specialists the sixth bestpaid health care makes up 81 of gdp in the united kingdom compared with 153 in the united states as one oe cd researcher noted countries with singlepayer systems or integrated public financing and deliv ery national health services found spending control easier76 for the nhs this has been done using administered pricing controls on the s upply of health care and speci fic budget limits however simon stevens the british prime ministers health policy adviser from 1997 to 2004 said that the nhs had overly effective cost containment as consequence uk health care infrastructure was outdated with old buildings and inadequate equipment britain had relatively few health professionals two practicing physicians per 1000 population versus 28 in the united st ates and 33 in france and germany and it was undersupplying appropriate care causing long waits for routine surgeries these facts were reinforced by the growing tendency of the british media to substitute its longstanding stereotype of the nhs good versus the us health system bad with an equally polemical comparison of the nhs bad with continental europe good as result taxes were raised in 2003 in the uk with the explicit goal of raising the percentage of gdp attributable to health care77 it is beyond the scope of this report to delve into specific comparison of the uk and us health care systems

survival rate but the lowest kidney transplant survival rate in terms of preventable diseases the united states had the highest prevalence of measles but the lowest prevalence of hepatitis b in terms of process indicators the united states had the highest rate of cervical cancer screenings80 another survey found that higher proportions of americans reported receiving recommended preventive services for diabetic and hypertensive patients compared with five other oecd countries it also found that americans were the least likely to have had the same doctor for five years or more were most likely to complain that their doctor did not spend enough time with them and were most likely to have left an ppointment without getting impor tant questions answered81 sixcountry comparison found that the united states was the best provider of preventive care but had the worst rating in terms of medical errors this international survey of practitioners also found that th united states was fifth out of the six countries in terms of the patientcentere dness of care and the coordination of care between multiple providers patients in the united states were most likely to visit an emergency department for condition that could have been treated by regular doctor however once disc harged patients in the united states were less likely to be rehospitalized because of complications than patients in four of the other countries in the united states records or test results were the least likely to reach doctors office in time for an appointment and us patients were more likely to be

waiting times for elective surgery are reported to be low meanwhile wait times are considered serious health polic issue in 12 oecd countries83 in these 12 countries wait times of 1 to 1½ months are common for procedures such as invasive heart surgery whereas wait times for proce dures like hip or knee replacement cluster around five months in recent survey qua rter to third of respondents in canada the united kingdom and australia reported waiting more than four months for nonemergency procedure compared with only 5 of americans84 wait times are usually tied to capacity of the health care system with low numbers of hospital beds and physicians typically associated with long wait times interestingly the united states is the exception to this rule here low levels of beds and health care providers figures 15 and 22 have not been accompanied by long wait times for elective surgery international trends suggest that wait times are also associated with low total health spending however the exception to this rule is japan which spends only 2249 on health per capita compared with 6102 in the united states yet does not have wait time problem wait times are more common in countries where physicians are paid by salary such as in the united kingdom instead of on feeforservice basis as in the united states85 although the united states does not ve long wait times for nonemergency surgical procedures this does not appear to be the case for primary care doctor visits in survey of five oecd countries in 2004 us respondents were the secondleast able to make sameday doc tors

1000 people the top three causes of death in oecd countries are heart disease cancer and respiratory disease89 death rates for heart disease in the united states are the 17th worst in the oecd despite the fact that the united states performs substantially more invasive heart procedures than all other countries in the oecd figure 9 however since the oecd data do not provide the incidence of heart

the amount the united states spends on health care is too much so economists have produced costbenefit analyses finding that increased life expectan cy and better health have been worth the increased cost of care92 researchers also determined that with respect to the seven years of additional life expectancy gained between 1960 and 2000 an average of 19900 was spent per year of life gained they concluded that the increases in medical spending since 1960 have provided reasonable value93 however the amount spent per year of life gained va ried depending on the decade and the age cohort for example the av erage cost of each year of life gained for individuals 65 and older was 145000 between 1990 and 2000 wh ich the authors indicated fails to meet many costbenefit criteria94 others have argued that just because benefits exceed costs does not mean us health dollars are being spent as efficiently as they could be because the average oecd country experienced larger gains in life expectancy than the united states between 1960 and 2000 while spending less th an the united states on health care these countries would presumably have rger benefitcost ratios using the above methodology some economists have pointed to studies finding that highercost higherintensity care is not associated with better health outcomes for medicare patients95 several have used the term flatofthecurve medicine to characterize much of the care provided in the united stat referring to the practice of providing extra medical care that provides little or additional health benefit96

required white is cbo analyst but his vi ews do not necessarily reflect those of cboproviders should be required to practice more costeffective medicine based on an independent organizations assessments of the costeffectiveness of clinical interventions97 finally another group of economists have argued that increases in health spending can actually be harmful to national health because as spending rises the cost of health insurance premiums so go up making it harder for people to afford coverage and to get access to care98 rising health spending is occurring not only in the united states but also in the vast majority of oecd countries us growth in health spending was more than double inflation in 2004 at 69 but this was not much higher than the oecd average rate of growth at 62 over th longer term health spending between 1970 and 2002 grew slightly faster in the unite d states 43 annually than the average oecd country 38 annually among 20 highincome oecd countries studied one study by an analyst from cbo broke down growth in health spending into three parts growth resulting from countrys population aging growth resulting from increases in economic growth and excess growth99 that analysis suggested that from 1970 to 2002 the united states had belowaverage aging growth and economic growth but nearly double the excess growth compared with the 20 country oecd average figure 27 over time the rate of annual excess growth had remained essentially unchanged in the united states according to that analysis but had dropped substantially in ot her oecd counties the author stated the following those countries using publicintegrate d and publiccontract financing models might have had more success in constraining spending than the united states has had the united states outsi of medicare does not use centralized authority to set health spending budgets or negotiate prices with providers and this could contribute to relative lack of spending constraint perhaps because of their relative success in constraining costs the health care reforms currently under way in the oecd are longer generally focused on cost constraint and are instead focused on quality of care output and efficiency in the production of health care services and responsiveness to patients needs100httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34175crs57 source chapin white health care spending

united states has been accompanied by increases in the share of health spending that is publicly financed from 25 in 1960 to 45 in 2005 and lowering of the proportion of health spending that is paid outofpoc ket from 47 in 1960 to 125 in 2005101 it may be reasonable to expect these trends to tinue if growth in h ealth spending persists at its current pace conclusion summary of findings total spending in 2004 the united states spent more than twice as much on health care as the average oecd c ountry at 6102 per person compared with the oecd average of 2560 health car spending comprised 153 of the us gdp in 2004 compared with an average of 89 for the average oecd country figure 1 although countrys health expe nditures are highly correlated with gdp figure 2 us health spending is nevert heless 60 greater than its gdp alone would predict health care resources the united states has fewer hospital admissions figure 3 and doctor visits figure 4 than the average oecd country the united states has belowaverage number of hospital beds figure 22 and practicing physicians per population figure 15 but its number of nurses per population is roughly the same as the oecd average the united states has higher than average number of staff per hospital bed figure 10 and nurses per bed figure 11 the length of hospital stays in the united states are the same as the oecd average figure 5 the united states spent per capita average of 2668 on outpatient care in 2004 threeandahalf times the oecd aver age in most oecd countries visits to general practitioners outnumber visits to specialists but not in the united states the united states has greater supply of advanced technolog ical equipment than other oecd countries with nearly twice as many ct scanners per capita as the oecd average figure 12 and three times as many mri machines figure 13 the united states also performs far more heart procedures per population than the average oecd country figure 9 and an aboveavera ge amount of organ transplants per capita but does not perform more of all types of surgical procedures pharmaceuticals the united states spends more on prescription drugs per capita than any other oecd country figure 18 the united states also consumes more prescription drugs than most oecd countries according to ninecountry study figure 17 that study found that the unite d states paid more for brand name drugs but less for generic drugs than other oecd countries figure 16 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34175crs59 102 association of american medical co lleges 2006 medical school graduation questionnaire all

states in 2004 which was seven times that of the oecd median figure 20 americans pay less outofpocket for health care as percentage of total health care spending than residents of most oecd countries figure 21 prices although oecd data does not comp are prices of medical care other studies have found that the united states pays higher prices for medical care than countries such as canada and germany pa rt of the reason for this may be that us general practitioners and nurses are the highest paid in the oecd and us specialists are the thirdhighest paid in the oecd table 2 health professionals in wealthier countries earn higher sala ries than those in poorer countries figure 14 but even accounting for this us health professionals are paid significantly more than the us gdp would predict for example specialists are paid approximately 50000 more than would be expected howe ver us health care professionals also enter the careers with substantially more educational debt than in other oecd countries for example in 2006 62 of new us medical sc hool graduates had educational debt exceeding 100000102 population risk factors the united states had lower than average proportion of the population that is elderl in 2004 and lower than average rates of smoking and drinking the united states consumes more calories and sugar per capita than any other oecd country the united states consumes 156 pounds of sugar per person per year compared with 99 pounds in the average oecd country in 2004 34 of americans were overweigh t and an additiona l 32 were obese obesity is associated with 77 increas in consumption of medications and 36 increase in inpatient and outpatient spending according to one study quality in terms of quality of health car fivecountry study found

care on nights and weekends and were the most likely to forgo care because of cost health outcomes the united states has the thirdhighest percentage of the population that reports their health st atus as being good very good or excellent figure 23 however the united states has belowaverage life expectancy figure 24 and mortality rates table 5 the united states has the thirdhighest rate of deaths from medical errors figure 25 and the highest infant mortality rate among the eight countries that report this metric similarly figure 26 however such measures are often subjective or limited by differing measurement methodologies they may also reflect fundamental populati on differences in underlying health for example rather th an differences in c ountries health care systems these are just some of the difficult research issues facing international comparisons like those used in this report
