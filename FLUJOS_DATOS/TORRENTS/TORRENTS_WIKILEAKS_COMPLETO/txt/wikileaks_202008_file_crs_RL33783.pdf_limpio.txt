and nomination in the first stage the white house selects and clears nominee before sending the formal nomination to the senate there are number of steps in this stage of the process for most senate confirmed positions first with the assistance of and preliminary vetting by the white house office of presidential personnel the president selects candidate for the position interested parties includi ng members of cong ress may have input during this process it could be argued that senators are constitutionally entitled by virtue of the advice and consent clause noted above to provide advice to the president regarding his selection the extent of this entitlement is matter of some debate5 as practical matter in general nomination is likely to fare better if the administration has first consulted senators on th committee of jurisdiction during the clearance process the candidate prepares and submits several forms the public financial disclosure re port standard form sf 278 the questionnaire for na tional security positions sf 86 and the white house personal data statement ques tionnaire the office of th counsel to the president oversees the clearance process which often includes background investigations conducted by the federal bureau of inves tigation fbi intern revenue service irs office of government ethics oge and an ethics official for the agency to which the candidate is to be appointed if conflicts are found during the background check oge and the agency ethics officer may work with the candidate to mitigate the conflicts once the office of the c ounsel to the president has cleared the candidate the nomination is ready to be submitted to the senate the selection and clearance stage is ofte n the longest part of the appointment process there can be lengthy delays pa rticularly if many candidates are being processed as they are at the beginning of an administration or if conflicts need to be resolved candidates for higherlevel positions are often accorded priority in this process in an effort to reduce the elapsed time between new presidents inauguration and the appointment of his or her national security team amendments to the presidential transitions act of 19636 enacted at the end of 2004 encourage presidentelect to submit for security clearance potential nominees to highlevel national security positions as s oon as possible after the election7 s p r t provision of law enacted as part of the federal vacancies reform act of 1998 lengthens during presidential transitions the potential length of temporary appointment by at least 90 days8 although this provision mig ht give some additional flexibility to an incoming president it might also lengthen the appointment process for some positions by in effect extending the deadline by which permanent appointment must be completedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33783crs3 9 pl 105277 div c title i 151 5 usc 33453349d for more on the vacancies act see crs report 98892 the new vacancies act

role some senateconfirme d positions such as many of those in the executive departments may also be temporarily filled under the vacancies act9 senate consideration in the confirmation or second stage the senate alone determines whether or not to confirm nomination10 the way the senate acts on nomination depends largely on the impor tance of the position involved existing political circumstances and policy implications generally the senate shows particular interest in the nominees views and how they are likely to affect public policy11 two other factors may also affect the scrutiny with which nominees personal and professional qualities are examined whether or not the presidents party controls the senate and the degree to which the president becomes involved in supporting the nomination the senate confirmation process is centered at the committee level committee nomination activity generally includes inve stigation hearing and reporting stages as part of investigatory work committees may draw on information provided by the white house as well as information collected by the committees hearings provide public forum to discuss nomination and any issues related to the program or agency for which the nominee would be res ponsible even if confirmation is thought to be virtual certainty hearings may provide senators and the nominee with an opportunity to go on the record with

circumstances discharge the committee from further consideration of the nomination in order to bring it to the floor12 the senate historically s confirmed most but not all executive nominations rarely
