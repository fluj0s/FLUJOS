penalties at least once every four years thereafter and make any required penalty adjustments in 2003 the general accounting office gao now the government accountability office said that several elem ents of the inflation adjustment act had prevented federal agencies from fully adjusting their civil penalties for inflation 1 10 cap on agencies initial penalty adjustments even if the penalties would have to have been adjusted by hundreds of per cent to maintain their original deterrent value 2 the exemption of 238 penalties under the internal revenue code of 1986 the tariff act of 1930 the occupational sa fety and health act of 1970 and the social security act from the inflation ad justment acts covera ge and 3 rounding formula and other procedures in the act that can prevent agencies from adjusting their penalties for as much as 15 years gao recommended that congress consider changing the inflation adjustment act to address these issues and also said congress should consider giving one or more fede ral agencies the authority and responsibility to monitor the acts implementation and provide guidance to the agencies to date congress has taken action on gaos recommendations proponents of the adjustment of civil penalties for inflation assert that in addition to maintaining the penalties deterrent effects the adjustments could increase federal revenues by hundreds of millions of dollars each year all from individuals and organizations that gao described as the worst offenders of health safety environmental and other statutes guilty of the most egregious violations of fede ral laws in 2007 gao reported that if the fixed dollar amounts of just four civil tax penalties had been adjusted for inflation the estimated poten tial increase in collections would have ranged from 38 million to 61 million per year from 2000 to 2005 given the reported inability of federal agencies to adjust all or in some cases any of their civil penalty maximums fo r inflation under the inflation adjustment acts procedures congress curre ntly appears to have at least three general types of legislative options 1 maintain the st atus quo 2 adjust certain civil penalty maximums

introduction civil monetary penalties are one way agencies enforce federal laws and regulations the maximum size of civil penalties may be established administratively by federal agencies or may be established in statute large civil penalties can be assesse d to punish the most serious violations deter others from committing similar offenses or both over time however inflation can reduce the original punitive and deterrent value of civil penalty maximums for example in 1958 congress blished 1000 maximum penalty for possession of firearm discovered at baggage security checkpoint by 1996 in order to keep up with inflation as measur ed by the consumer price index cpi and have the same punitive and terrent value that it had in 1958 that penalty maximum would have to have been increased by more than 400 to 52771 however the penalty was unchanged as of 1996 so it had lost more than 80 of its value until 1996 agencies generally did not have the authority to adjust civil penalty maximums that were established in statute that year congress amended the federal civil penalties inflation adjustment act of 1990 hereafter the inflation adjustment act and required federal agenci to adjust each of their covered civil penalties for inflation2 the stated purpose of the orig inal inflation adjustment act was to establish mechanism that shall 1 allow for regular adjustment for inflation of civil monetary penalties 2 maintain the deterrent effect of civil monetary penalties and promote compliance with the law and 3 improve the collection by the federal government of civ il monetary penalties the 1990 act established set of reporting requirements but did not give agen cies the authority to adjust their civil penalties for inflation the 1996 amendments to the act established relatively automatic penalty adjustment process agencies were to make their first penalty adjustments within 180 days after enac tment ie by october 1996 and were required to examine and if necessary adjust their civil penalties for inflation at least once every four years thereafter the amendments also specified how the adjustments were to be calculated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34368crs2 3 us

purpose3 this report provides information on the use of civil penalties as an enforcement procedure the inflation adjustment acts adjustment procedures gaos findings and recommendations and the effects that the act has had on certain civil penalty maximums the report concludes by discussing legislative options that congress could consider civil penalties as form of regulatory enforcement in the enforcement of federal statutes and regulations agencies can impose various forms of legal sanctions as cost of noncompliance section 55110 of the administrative procedure act defines sanc tions as including the imposition of penalty or fine4 gao has concluded that civil penalties play key role in regulatory enforcement by deterring violators and by ensuring that regulated entities are treated fairly and consistently so that one gains competitive advantage5 news reports indicate that civil penalties are assessed with some regularity during the regulatory and statutory enforcement process for example in september 2007 the department of justice announced that hunt refining company and hunt s outhland refining company had agreed to pay 400000 civil penalty to settle allege d violations of the clean air act6 in october 2007 the consumer product safety commission announced that tap enterprises inco rporated had agreed to pay 100000 civil penalty for failing to re port to

virginia11 agencies investigate possible violations of statutes and associated regulations and determine the amount of any civil penalty to be sought based on variety of factors including the severity of an incident wh ether the individual or organization involved has previous history of violations and the individuals or organizations ability to pay the fine civil penalty maximums are generally reserved for the most egregious cases eg those involving willful intent to violate the law fatalities or both gao has criticized certain regulatory agencies for not using civil penalties more forcefully as part of their enforcement processes12 during the administration of president william j clint on the national performance review npr recommended that civil monetary penalties be adjusted for inflation13 specifically npr recommended that catchup penalty adjustment be made to bring civil penalties up to date and that the need for additional inflationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34368crs4 adjustments be automatically reassessed every four years npr estimated that doing so would increase federal receipts by nearly 200 milli on in the fy1994 through fy1999 period procedures established by the inflation adjustment act as amended the inflation adjustment act requires agencies to follow specific procedures when making civil penalty adju stments for example section 5 of the act defines costofliving adjustment as the following the percentage if any for each civ il monetary penalty by which 1 the consumer price index for the month of j une of the calendar year preceding the adjustment exceeds 2 the consumer price index for the month of june of the calendar year in which the amount of such civil monetary penalty was last set or adjusted pursuant to law therefore if an agency made its first round of penalty adjus tments in october 1996 and the penalty was last t or adjusted in october 1990 the agency was required to calculate the unrounded costofliving adju stment by comparing the june 1995 cpi with the cpi for june 1990 if the ag ency made its s econd round of penalty adjustments in october 2000 four years after the first round the agency was required to calculate the unrounded costof living adjustment by comparing the june 1996 cpi with the cpi for june 1999 the inflation adjustment act also provides specific criteria for how agencies should round any penalty increase secti on 5 of the act says the following any increase determined under this subsec tion shall be rounded to the nearest 1 multiple of 10 in the case of penalties less than or equal to 100 2 multiple of 100 in the case of penalties greater than 100 but less than or equal to 1000 3 multiple of 1000 in the case of penalties greater than 1000 but less than or equal to 10000 4 multiple of 5000 in the case of penalties greater than 10000 but less than or equal to 100000 5 multiple of 10000 in the case of penalties greater than 100000 but less than or equal to 200000 and 6 multiple of 25000 in the case of penalties greater than 200000 for example if maximum civil penalty of 5000 was last t in 1990 and there had been 17 inflation from june 1990 th rough june 1995 the relevant time frame for an adjustment in 1996 the unr ounded increase would be 850 5000 times 017 because the 5000 penalty was gr eater than 1000 but less than 10000 the statute indicates th at the 850 increase should be rounded to the nearest multiple of 1000 which is 1000 therefore the adjusted penalty after rounding would be 6000 however section 6 of the inflation adjustment act states that the first penalty adjustment under these procedures may not exceed 10 percent of such penalty therefore in the above example the 1000 rounded increase would be limited to 10 of the 5000 penalty amount or 500 as result the adjusted penalty after the 10 cap would be 5500httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34368crs5 14 us general accounting office civil penalties agencies unable to fully adjust penalties for inflation under current law gao03409 mar 14 2003finally the inflation adjustment act exempted all penalties under the internal revenue code of 1986 the ta riff act of 1930 the occupa tional safety and health act of 1970 and the social security act the legislative history of the inflation adjustment act does not explain why congress exempted these penalties established the 10 cap on initial adjustments or required the use of the adjustment procedures delineated in the act gao recommends changes to th inflation adjustment act in 2003 report on the implementation of the inflation adjustment act gao said that several elements of the act had prevented federal agencies from fully adjusting their civil penalties for inflation14 the 10 cap on initial penalty adjustments severely limited agencies ability to maintain the original deterrent value of certain penalties particularly if the penalties had not been adjusted for decades and inflation had increas ed several hundred percent during that period for example the abovementioned 1000 penalty for possession of firearm in baggage security area that was last set or adjusted in 1958 could only be increased in 1996 by 100 to 1100 more than 4000 ss than the amount needed to fully account for inflation several agencies with penalties covered by the act told gao that because of the 10 cap their penalties had lost effectiveness and their enforcement options had been limited the acts exemption of all pe nalties under the internal revenue code of 1986 the tariff act of 1930 the occupational safety and health act of 1970 and the soci security act prevented the adjustment of total of 238 civil penalties gao said that many of these exempted penalties had not been adjusted for decades and more than half would have been at least 50 higher if fully adjusted for inflation the acts requirements on how the penalty adjustments should be calculated and rounded prevented agen cies from capturing all of the inflation that occurred between adjustments and prevented agencies from increasing certain penalties until inflation had increased by 45 or more specifically gao sai d the act requires agencies 1 to lose year of inflation each time penalties are adjusted because it requires use of the cpi from june of the previous year and that lost year of inflation can never be recovered and 2 to round based on the size of the penalty rather than the size of the penalty increase thereby sometimes resulting in long periods of time between adjustments because of these two factors at recent rates of inflation gao said agencies might not be able to adjust some of their penalties for 15 years or mo re gao reported that eliminationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34368crs6 15 see 44 usc 3504 16 see 5 usc 612 of the cpi lag and rounding based on the size of the penalty increase would yield results that more closely track inflation agency officials frequently told gao that these provisions in the act were unclear and produced undesirable eff ects and each agency said that it supported changes to the act to allow more timely and accurate penalty adjustments gao also reported that severa l other provisions in the inflation adjustment act were unclear for example although the act clearly covers civil penalty maximums that are set in statute it is not clear whether agencies are required to adjust penalties that are administratively set by the ag encies also gao said it was not clear whether the term last set or adjusted refers to the date when an adjustment was last published in the federal register or the date when the penalty adjustment took effect finally gao said it was unclear whether agencies second rounds of penalty adjustments were to be made within four years of the initial deadline ie by october 2000 or within four years of the initia l adjustments whenever they occurred some agencies still had not made their first rounds of adjustments when gao issued its report in march 2003 congress did not give any federal agen cy the authority or responsibility to monitor agencies compliance with the inflation adjustment act or to provide guidance on how the act should be implement ed in contrast other crosscutting regulatory reform statutes assign these tasks to particular executive branch agency for example the paperwork reduction ac t gives the office of management and budget the authority and responsibility to approve agencies proposed information collections and to provide guidance to the agencies on how the act should be implemented15 the regulatory flexibility act requires the small business administrations chief counsel for advocacy to monitor and report at least annually on agencies compliance with the act16 gao said that an oversight agency for the inflation adjustment act c ould have taken number of actions that might have improved the acts implementation eg developing data base that could automatically determine when penalties require adjustment and notify the agencies of their responsibilities under the act gao recommendations as result of these findings gao made several recommendations that it said could help ensure that agencies will keep their civil penalties in pace with inflation first gao said that if congre ss wants federal civil penalties to retain their original deterrent values it should consider amending the inflation adjustment act to require or permit agencies to make catchup adjustments accounting for all of the inflation that occurred since congress last set or adjusted those penalties second gao said that if congress wants agencies to make timely and accurate adjustments of thei r civil penalties congress shouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34368crs7 17 us general accounting office civil penalties agencies unable to fully adjust penalties for inflation under current law gao03409 mar 14 2003 p 37consider amending the calculation and rounding procedures in the act to be more consistent with changes in inflation third gao said that if congress finds that currently exempted penalties should be adju sted it could amend the statute to permit or require agencies to make the adjustments finally to improve compliance with the statute gao said congress could give one or more entities in the executive branch the authority and responsibility to monitor the acts implementation and provide guidance to agencies even if the other recommendations are not enacted gao said improving compliance with the existing act could prevent the loss of millions of dollars in lost penalties from individuals and organizations that are the worst offenders of health safety environmental and other statutes17 as of the date of this report cong ress has not acted on gaos recommendations effects of the inflation ad justment acts provisions because of the lack of consistent g overnmentwide enforcement data and for other reasons it is impossible to determine the extent to which the civil penalties that are imposed each year have b een affected by the 10 cap on initial adjustments the adjustment procedures or the statutory ex emptions in the inflation adjustment act however the acts provisions appear to have had clear impact on the penalty maximums that could be levied by certain agencies with regard to certain violations 10 cap on initial adjustments for example gao reported that because of the inflation adjustment acts 10 cap on initial adjustments an 800000 national highway tra ffic safety administration nhtsa penalty for violations involving the failure to meet bumper testing criteria that s hould have increased in 1996 by 275 to more than 3 million to fully account for inflation was limited to an increase of 80000 overall nhtsa had 16 civil penalties whose initial adjustments were capped at 10 25000 environmental protection agency epa penalty for violation of the toxic substances control act that should have increased in 1996 by nearly 170 to more than 67000 if fully adjusted for inflation was limited to an increase of 2500 overall epa had 74 civil penalties whose initial adjustments were capped at 10 penalties imposed by the immigration and naturalization service pursuant to the immigration refo rm and

increased by nearly 5018 the 10 cap is still in effect for newly established civil penalties and for penalties that were not initia lly adjusted in 1996 as the inflation adjustment act required for example in february 2007 the minerals manage ment service mms within the department of the interior published final rule adjusting 25000 per day per violation civil penalty that had been authorized by the oil pollution act of 199019 however because it was the first ad justment of the penalty the amount of the increase was capped at 10 raising the penalty to 27500 if not capped at 10 the unrounded penalty would have increased to about 39000 as noted previously the inflation adjustments that are not made because of the 10 cap cannot be corrected through the acts procedures in fact the size of any inflation gap created by the 10 cap grows with each penalty adjustment the inflation adjustment act defines the term cost of living adjustment as the percentage by which the cpi for the year preceding the adjustment exceeds the cpi for the year in which the penalty was last set or adjusted therefore agencies adjustments under the statute can take into consideration only the amount of inflation since the previous adjustment as result any inflation gap that is not captured because of the 10 cap becomes permanen t and because the capped penalties are smaller than they would have been w ithout the 10 restriction the size of subsequent adjustments using that smaller base are also smaller resulting in further widening of the inflation gap rounding rules gao also pointed out in its report that under the acts rounding rules all seven pena lties that had been administe red by the pension welfare benefits administration now the employee benefits security administration and that were adjusted for the first time under the act in 1997 could not be adjusted again until the cpi increased by 455 assumin g 25 annual rate of inflation the average since the inflation adjustment act was passed in 1996 the agency would not be able to increase any of these civ il penalties under the acts procedures for 17 years ie until 2014 other agencies faced similar limitations the federal aviation administration faa increased the 1000 penalty for possession of firearm discovered at baggage security checkpoint by 100 in 1996 which was the maximum allowed under the 10 cap under the rounding rules in the inflation adjustment act faa would not be able to increase the penaltyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34368crs9 20 as noted later in this report in november 2002 congress increased the

other pena lties inflation must increase 228 before an adjustment is possible epa has two penalties that cannot be adjusted until inflation increases 455 and 11 that cannot be adjusted until inflation goes up 228 on the other hand gao also said that wh the penalty adjustments finally do occur the act can require agencies to adjust their penalties much more than the amount of inflation that occurred in th previously mentioned examples although the cpi must increase 455 since they were last set or adjusted before the agencies can make further adjustments the adjus tments that are ultimate ly provided under the acts rounding rules will be twice that amount 909 the inability of agencies to adjust civil penalties for inflation may be having deleterious effect on public policy in certain areas for example in august 2007 gao reported that penalties for violating the corporate average fuel economy cafe standards had not increased ce 1997 when they were increased pursuant to the inflation adjustment acts pro cedures by 10 from 5 to 550 per vehicle for every 01 mile per gallon by which ma nufacturers fleet fell short of the cafe standard since then because of the r ounding rules and other factors nhtsa has been unable to adjust those penalties for in flation several experts told gao that the penalties are not enough of monetary incentive for manufacturers to comply with cafe21 exempted penalties gao also reported that ma ny of the civil penalties in the statutes that had been exempted from coverage by the inflation adjustment act had not been adjusted in years for ex ample gao said that eight penalties under the internal revenue code had not been ch anged since 1954 and that as of june 2002 inflation had increased by 569 six pe nalties under the occupa tional

since 1879 resu lting in an inflation gap of more than 1700 in august 2007 gao reported that so civil tax penalties had been significantly eroded because of inflati on for example 100 minimum penalty

civil tax penalties to account for th decrease in real value over time22 recent agency efforts to adjust civil penalties federal agencies are continuing to examine their civil penalties and where possible adjust them pursuant to the provisi ons of the inflation adjustment act in some cases however the acts provisions have continued to prohibit penalty adjustments in january 2007 the farm

adjusted several of its civil penalties pursuant to the inflation adjustment acts proce dures however the agency said that because of the relatively low rate of inflation and the rounding formulas required by the act most penalties remain unchanged from their previous levels26 congressional options given the inability of federal agencies to adjust all or in some cases any of their civil penalty maximums for infla tion under the inflation adjustment acts procedures congress appears to have at least three general types of legislative options 1 maintaining the status quo 2 adjusting certain civil penalty maximums through separate legi slation or 3 implementing some or all of the recommendations in gaos 2003 report maintain status quo congress could elect to take action in this area for variety of reasons for ex ample congress might view the statutory maximum civil penalties as having been originally set too high and by taking action congress would allow inflation to erode the penalty amounts to what it then would consider to be more reasonable levels congress might also take into account the ability of some agencies to impose substantial penalties under current statutory provisions for example officials from some agencies told gao that certain civil penalties could be compounded monthly weekly or daily resu lting in higher penalty maximums if needed similarly officials at another agency said penalties could be assessed on violationbyviolation basis allowing the amount of the penalty imposed to rise to or even exceed the statutory maximums finally officials at the internal revenue service said that some of the agencys civil penalties contain formulas that implicitly account for inflation eg by basing the pena lty on percentage of the tax due or the amount invested for any or all of these r easons the lack of adju stment of at least some of the agencies civil penalty maximums might not be seen by congress as problematic statute or agencyspecific penalty adjustment legislation from time to time congress enacts legislation that adjusts statutory penalty maximums which can have the effect of compensatin g for the effects of inflation on those penalties for example the usa patrio t improvement and reauthorization act of 2005 pl 109177 amended the interna tional emergency ec onomic powers act and required that the penalties for tw violations

management service oil and gas and sulphur operations in the outer continental shelf and oil spill financial responsibility for offshore facilities civil penalties 72 federal register 8897 feb 28 2007changes to its regulations27 in some cases these statute or agencyspecific adjustments have been more than the amount s needed to maintain the deterrent power of the original penalties for example in november 2002 congress increased the previously mentioned 1000 penalty for possession of firearm at baggage security checkpoint to 10000 as part of the establishment of the department of homeland security pl 107296 sec 1602 if fully adjusted for inflation between 1958 the year the penalty was establis hed and 2002 it would have increased to about 6200 legislation introduced in the 110th congress would adjust certain civil penalties or would give agencies more authority to adjust those penalties for example hr 3691 the safe consumer product act wa s introduced in september 2007 and would among other things eliminate the statutory maximum civil penalty of 1250000 for series of violations and allow the cons umer product safety commission to determine the penalty maximum hr 4626 the cftc reauthorization act of 2007 was introduced in december 2007 and would among other things increase civil penalties that the commodity futures trading commission could impose for violations of the commodity exchange act congress has also established other pro cedures for the adjustment of certain civil penalties for example sec tion 107 of the cons umer product safety improvement act of 1990 pl 101608 tablished fiveyear civil penalty inflation adjustment authority and process that because it is statutespecific supercedes the inflation adjustment acts requirements28 similarly section 8201 of the oil pollution act of 1990 pl 101 380 codified at 43 usc 1350 requires the secretary of the interior to adjust 20000 civil penalty for inflation at least every three years to reflect any increases in the consumer price index however 25000 civil penalty established by anot her section of the same act section 4303 codified at 33 usc 2716a has specifi c adjustment require ment and therefore is covered by the inflation adjustment acts provisions29 amend the inflation adjustment act although congress could continue to enact legislation adjusting particular civil penalties or give particular agencieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34368crs13 their own inflation adjustment procedures if congresss intention is simply to maintain the penalties original punitive and deterrent power this statutebystatute or agencybyagency approach would appear to be less efficient than just amending the inflation adjustment act consistent with gaos recommendations on the other hand though if congresss intention is to r eassess its original decisions with regard to those penalties then amendments to the inflation adjustment act would not accomplish that purpose both approaches are also possible congress could amend the act to better enable agencies to k eep pace with inflation while examining individual statutes for possible changes in the base penalties amendments to the inflation adjustment act could address all or only some of gaos recommendations eg requiring catch up adjustments for penalties affected by the 10 cap and changing the rounding rules but continuing to exempt certain penalties from the acts requirements congress could also continue to allow agency or statutespecific procedures to take precedence over the procedures stipulated in the inflation adjustment ac t or congress could amend the act in such way that it would supersede the particular ized adjustment procedures and schedules and put all civil pena lties under the same ad justment process
