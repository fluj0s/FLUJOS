with developing countries is one of the more troubling globalization issues and has been part of the debate over passage of fasttrack authority extension of the north american free trade agreement nafta and the africa trade bill central concern for many is whether this trade relationship leads to lost jobs or reduced wages for the us labor force particularly unskilled workers over the past three decades us trade with developing countries has expanded markedly from 1987 to 1997 developingcountry trade rose 195 compared to 104 for trade with developed countries increasing its share from 36 to 45 of total us trade us exports to developing countries grew by 243 compared to 135 for developed countries and imports expanded respectively by 167 and 84 imports from developing countries represent only 5 of us gross domestic product gdp the economic implications of these trends are disturbing precisely because trade theory may be seen to support the prospect that trade with developing countries can hurt unskilled us workers developing countries have comparative advantage in the production of goods using unskilled labor accordingly increased us imports from lowwage countries may lead to decline in demand for unskilled us workers reducing their wages and contributing to widening of the differential between skilled and unskilled manufacturing wages however because many assumptions of trade theory are violated in the real world and other factors affect real wages the effects of trade need to be examined carefully economists disagree on the strength of the tradewage inequality relationship with estimates ranging from those that consider trade the primary problem of unskilled workers to those that see trade as virtually blameless or overwhelmed by other factors chiefly technological change most studies suggest that extreme estimates may be overstating their respective cases and that trade is only one of many factors affecting inequality consensus of estimates would put developingcountry trade responsible for between 10 and 20 of the growth in wage inequality since the 1970s economists generally portray this as only modest effect suggesting that most of the inequality problem cannot be explained by trade although economists disagree on the effects of trade they tend to agree on trade policy arguing that protectionist policies do little to help unskilled workers and come at very high price to the rest of the economy alternatives involve helping unskilled workers adjust to trade by upgrading their skill levels helping them transition to higher quality jobs or perhaps providing some type of transitional income assistance or insurance in short whether one is inclined to accept the worst case scenario on the effects of developingcountry trade on the united states or dismiss it entirely in favor of technological change as the greatest threat to the american dream the consensus solution among economists lies with making the work force

integration expanding trade with developing countries is one of the more troubling globalization issues many fear that it leads to lost jobs or reduced incomes for the us labor force particularly unskilled workers1 uncertainties such as these are fully evident in the congressional debate over how to proceed with fasttrack authority and other trade policy legislation one perspective embraces freer trade as promoting productivity economic growth and higher standards of living another argues that even if true trade does little to address and may even compound problems of economic inequality which should also be an integral concern of us trade policy this report focuses on changing us trade relationships over the past decade concentrating on the growing importance of developing country trade and particularly its effects on us workers following short summary of major trends in us trade and the foundations of trade theory the empirical literature on employment and wage effects is evaluated as are policy options patterns of us trade with developing countries2 trade with developing countries has grown briskly over the past decade see table 1 since 1987 total us merchandise trade with developing countries rose from 237 billion to 698 billion or 195 compared to 104 for such trade with developed countries us exports to developing countries increased by 243 compared to 135 for developed countries and imports grew by 167 compared to 84 respectively these trends point to shifting patterns of us trade in 1987 developing country trade made up 36 of total us merchandise trade and 40 of the trade deficit by 1997 developing country trade was 45 of total us merchandise trade and 55 of the trade deficit although this represents significant growth total imports from developing countries amounted to only 5 of us gross domestic product gdp an important point to bear in mind as the effects of trade with developing countries are discussed world imports were 12 of gdp in 1997 1

source table prepared by crs based on data from the us department of commerce although this trade growth was encouraged by the evolving postwar trading environment the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and other trade liberalization efforts changing investment and production patterns also explain much of the increased trade volume between the united states and developing countries hence it is not only the size of trade with developing countries that raises policy issues but also the effects of changing us economic relationships related to this trade an important aspect of trade with developing countries involves specialization below the final product level where different countries manufacture only portion of the whole good developing countries take on the relatively lowskill laborintensive stages of the production process with developed countries such as the united states completing the relatively highskill and capitalintensive portion of the production process us firms have engaged in socalled production sharing for decades the most well known arrangement being the maquiladora program in mexico production sharing allows us firms to send materials or intermediate goods to another country for assembly or manufacture the resulting product is then imported back into the united states for further production or final sale3 lower wages provide the basis for such production differentiation and the developing country trade data presented here serve well as proxy for trade with low wage economies developing countries typically have compensation levels wages and benefits less than half those in the united states for manufacturing production workers in 1996 the asian newly industrialized countries nics hong kong singapore taiwan korea with the highest developing country wages had compensation levels as group equal to 39 of those in the united states mexican and sri lankan production workers by contrast were compensated at only 8 and 3 for more on production sharing see united states international trade commission production sharing use of us components and materials in foreign assembly operations 19931996 usitc publication 3077 december 1997 crs3 3 respectively of their us counterparts these trends partially explain why with the exception of china the developing countries with the highest growth in total trade with the united states malaysia thailand mexico singapore have significant production sharing arrangements with us firms4 the implications of growing us trade with developing lowwage countries is bothersome for many because these changing economic relationships imply that as firms adjust to take advantage of specialization driven by lower costs the us economy undergoes change such change is at the heart of the trade policy debate because of economic implications for those firms and workers who compete directly with foreign lowwage producers and therefore bear the brunt of the adjustment process trade theory and its implications the benefits of freer trade are being embraced by an everwidening group of countries particularly those in the developing world5 trade occurs because it is mutually beneficial for each trading nation and trade theory helps explain why this is so first in an open trading system specialization by comparative advantage suggests that the gains from trade arise from countries producing what they do relatively more efficiently than other countries and trading for those things that are produced relatively more efficiently abroad in other words trade comes about because countries do not produce all things equally well6 second economists recognize that countries export goods that use intensively their most abundant factors of production capital and labor and import goods that use their scarce factors intensively heckscherohlin theorem this concept provides very useful beginning to understand trade between developed and developing countries because they are endowed differently which provides the basis for trade eg the us has relative abundance of highskilled labor compared to developing countries 4 us department of labor bureau of labor statistics

kosters eds trade and wages leveling wages down washington dc the aei press 1994 pp 4246 6 the basis for improved economic wellbeing is not intuitive for many yet most peoples economic lives are based on specialization and trade they perform specific jobs and hire others to do things they do not have the time inclination or skills to do as well this same concept applies to countries in the global economy in addition to comparative advantage economies of scale and product differentiation encourage countries to trade particularly where they have similar factor endowments and production capabilities crs4 third as economies adjust to trade producing goods that use their relatively most abundant factors of production the prices of these products should tend to converge among trading countries to the extent that this occurs the prices of factors labor capital needed to produce these products also tend to converge factor price equalization theorem finally it follows that as demand for the abundant factor used for exports increases with trade so too does its price relative to the scarce factor which in turn raises the real income of owners of the abundant factor income distribution moves in favor of factors used for export stolper samuelson theorem important to the analysis of these propositions discussed in the next section is the critical and generally accepted relationship that trade affects wages one factors price indirectly through the mechanism of relative product prices rather than the volume of goods traded implications of trade theory trade theory it seems does not bode well for the lowskilled worker in the united states developing countries have comparative advantage in certain natural resources and lowskilled labor with trade liberalization they would specialize in exporting goods that use lowskilled labor intensively because lowskilled labor is abundant and less expensive compared to capital and highskilled labor and import from advanced economies goods that use capital and highskilled labor intensively because capital and highskilled labor are scarce and more expensive relative to low skilled labor developing countries for example would export simple manufactures and primary products while importing relatively more sophisticated manufactured goods in developing countries that trade with the united states the demand for low skilled manufacturing workers their relatively abundant factor should rise relative to the united states it follows that wages for lowskilled manufacturing workers should rise in developing countries relative to comparably skilled workers in the united states in other words over time the wage gap between lowskilled workers in developing and developed countries is expected to narrow in fact data since 1975 suggest this is happening with compensation rising faster albeit from much lower base in nearly all developing economies than in the united states7 also wage differentials should widen between lowskilled and highskilled manufacturing workers in the united states because increased competition from imports using lowskilled workers from developing countries would cause us businesses to shift production toward more profitable goods using highskilled workers the demand for lowskilled workers thus falls relative to the highskilled putting downward pressure on the formers wages trade theory then seems to support the prospect that trade with developing countries may hurt lowskilled workers in the united states which is at the heart of the current debate 7 us department of labor op cit p 4 crs5 trade employment and wages empirical evidence trade theory rests on foundation of assumptions that are not observed perfectly in the world empirical studies can help explain how closely theory and practice match when assumptions are relaxed8 in discussing studies that attempt to quantify the economic effects of trade it is perhaps best to establish first that analyses of us trade patterns with developing countries suggest that they do reflect rather strongly what would be expected from economic theory as stated simply in one study in trading with developing countries the united states is net exporter of skillintensive products and large net importer of nonskillintensive products9 but what does this mean for the us economy more specifically the key questions are 1 how has developing country trade affected us employment and 2 is it responsible for the growth in wage inequality between low and highskilled workers the answers to these questions come from vast quantities of recent research of which representative sample is summarized below10 analyzing the problem although lowwage workers have had real wage gains in recent years it is too early to conclude that the united states is experiencing reversal of three trends that have been in place since the early 1970s first the demand for manufacturing labor has fallen particularly for unskilled workers second real wages of unskilled workers have declined relative to skilled workers third real wages of unskilled workers have fallen in absolute terms reducing their standard of living11 real wages are largely determined by labor productivity function of skill levels experience education and training but of recent concern to both trade and 8 few assumptions would be free markets full employment perfect competition transportation costs homogeneous factors of production constant technology these all affect relative factor and product prices high unemployment for example can mitigate traderelated upward pressure on lowskill wages in developing countries 9 for ample empirical evidence supporting their statement see sachs jeffrey d and howard j shatz trade and jobs in us manufacturing brookings papers on economic activity 1 1994 pp 1621 note that this does not imply trade deficit or surplus with particular region or country 10 these studies vary in their use of terminology some using unskilled others lowskilled worker these terms are used interchangeably in this report although the individual studies may be analyzing somewhat different groups of workers

levine finally for complete discussion exceeding 100 pages of the work done in the last few years on this subject see chapter 2 in cline william r trade and income distribution washington dc institute for international economics november 1997 11 these points are accepted without elaboration in this report for detailed evidence supporting these widelyheld claims consult any of the literature cited herein on the effects of trade on us manufacturing see crs report 98440 is globalization industrializing the us economy an analysis by craig k elwell crs6 labor economists are two specific trends suspected of affecting the work force growth in trade with developing countries and the increased use of personal computers and other technological innovations most economists acknowledge that both trends may affect us labor markets by increasing the demand for highskill relative to lowskill workers theoretically technological advancement leads to an increase in demand for relatively higher educated trained and skilled workers increased developing country imports made mostly by unskilled labor by contrast decrease the demand for unskilled labor in the united states the question remains to what extent can labor market trends be linked to trade or technology or both most studies rely on one of two basic techniques to evaluate the role of trade on employment and wages the first is factor content analysis which seeks to determine employment effects of trade by estimating how much skilled and unskilled labor is used for producing countrys exports and how much would be used to produce at home the goods it imports wage effects are then estimated based on some measure assumed or estimated of how sensitive wages are to changes in the supply of labor both skilled and unskilled12 although widely used factor content analysis has ardent critics who believe it is inadequate to evaluate trades effects on wages first and foremost this approach does not link goods prices with factor prices wages which critics argue is an analytical must for lowwage imports to put downward pressure on us wages the prices of lowskillintensive goods must fall relative to highskillintensive goods product prices are ignored however in factor content analysis13 second factor content analysis makes the assumption that wage effects logically follow employment effects even if the employment effects are accepted some factor content analyses point out that wages may not move in predictable magnitude with the employment effects this is due in part to the fact that today only 15 of the work force is employed in manufacturing and only 2 is employed in sectors confronted with serious competition from developing country imports further non manufacturing industries that employ unskilled workers construction retail fast food may have stronger influence than trade in setting unskilled wages economy wide this is not to say that factor content analysis does not have its uses for illuminating the possible employment effects of trade it just does not make the direct link to wages that is inferred except perhaps under very stringent assumptions14 second method very specifically evaluates goods and factor prices to determine if the price of lowskillintensive products has fallen relative to highskill 12 these estimates vary see collins susan m economic integration

richard b will globalization dominate us labor market outcomes in collins imports exports and the american worker pp 11521 crs7 intensive products if this is occurring then trade with developing countries may be following the path predicted by trade theory thereby contributing to employment and wage problems suggested by labor advocates this methodology is also limited in some respects in particular trade prices are not fully reliable in making an assessment about whether lowskillintensive import prices have fallen relative to highskillintensive imports among many drawbacks import price series are very incomplete and precision is lost when various products are aggregated in the trade data there is accounting for differences in quality of goods exported and imported for example or any way to assess reliably different labor skills employed15 keeping in mind these methodological limitations attempts by economists to pass judgement on the employment and wage effects of trade are organized below into three categories first there are those who argue that evidence points to trade as the primary factor causing employment and income problems for the unskilled work force at the other end of the spectrum are those convinced to the contrary that trade plays virtually role both of these positions may be considered minority views today in the middle are gathered many economists who acknowledge that trade with developing counties may affect us labor markets but that it is only one of many factors and not the most important this is by far the largest group trade is the issue labor advocates argue that trade with developing countries directly affects employment and income of lowskilled workers although much of the public policy literature relating trade to labor market problems reflects views that are to large degree unsubstantiated some indepth research has raised to serious level questions over the prospect that as stated by the first economist in this group trade is the main cause of problems of the unskilled workers wood adrian wood represents one end of the debate spectrum using factor content analysis he asserts that as predicted by trade theory in country with relatively few unskilled workers compared with the rest of the world the united states lowering barriers to trade with developing countries will cause production to shift in favor of skillintensive products and away from lessskillintensive goods this occurs because citing textile and apparel for example the relative price of the apparel falls with trade lowering the demand for unskilled labor wood shows that in crosscountry comparison from 1970 to 1990 the fall in manufacturing employment in all developed countries is concentrated in lowskill sectors and correlates strongly with the rise in manufactured imports from developing countries16 to test for the strength of this relationship wood evaluates the factor content of trade but makes some unconventional modifications that have called into question the magnitude of his results first he assumes that if developed economies produced 15 freeman will globalization dominate us labor market outcomes pp 12425 16 this discussion is taken from wood adrian how trade hurt unskilled workers journal of economic perspectives v 9 summer 1995 pp 5780 crs8 at home the lowwage goods they import they would use the amount of labor relatively more consistent with production in developing economy second he argues that developed economies would be more labor intensive if they did not trade with lowwage countries because such trade encourages the adoption of laborsaving technologies to an even greater extent than otherwise would be the case wood therefore makes fairly high estimates regarding the employment effects in developed economies of liberalizing trade with developing countries he argues that trade with developing countries has caused 20 decline in the relative demand for unskilled labor in developed countries as an outside estimate including implied losses the service sector17 it follows that such strong influence on relative employment would have significant downward influence on the wages of lowskilled workers in developed economies many economists do not accept these assumptions and so find his estimates too high borjas freeman and katz this factor content analysis relies on more conventional assumptions asserting that because the united states is net importer of lowskillintensive goods its trade deficit in these goods amounts to indirectly increasing the supply of unskilled labor relative to skilled labor particularly workers with less than high school education making the similar point with respect to employment and wages the authors found that trade was responsible for 1525 of the 11 percentage point increase in earnings inequality between college and high school graduates in the early 1980s18 however in an updated version of this study carrying the analysis forward from 1980 to 1995 the authors found trade responsible for only 5 of the effect on income inequality between high school and college graduates and slightly more 8 of the discrepancy between high school graduates and dropouts19 trade is not the issue at the other end of the debate is the position that trade has nothing to do with employment and income problems in the united states this position is the general finding of various studies that focus on the prices of products exchanged consistent with trade theory as mentioned above trade theory however may not hold up if many of the necessary assumptions are relaxed eg full employment constant technology determination that this type of study attempts to make 17 ibid pp 6168 details of the methodology count to include the possible effect on services industries wood simply doubles his estimate for manufacturing sectors by his own admission other factor content analyses arrive at much smaller estimates 18 borjas george j with richard b

trade affect labor market outcomes brookings papers on economic activity 1 1997 pp 6163 67 the authors found immigration the more pressing problem an issue beyond the scope of this report crs9 lawrence and slaughter this study is representative of the group that strongly disputes the hypothesis that trade is major cause of wage inequality in the united states it argues that there is evidence during the 1980s that the prices of traded goods using lowskill labor abundantly fell relative to those produced with an abundance of highskill labor in addition the authors tested for evidence that technology was critical factor in growing wage inequality by skill level they found that technological progress was concentrated in the skilledlaborintensive industries bidding up the relative wages of skilled labor20 interestingly then this study shows that there was relative increase in demand for skilled workers even as their relative wage increased trade theory would predict counterbalancing increased use of now relatively lowerpriced unskilled labor in support of their principal finding the authors take an added step and cite other evidence that technological change has served to save lessskilled labor in the production process21 in short this study found relationship between growth in productivity and the use of nonproduction highskill labor which given the increase in its relative wage is strong indication that technology and hence the need for highskill labor is the driving force in the wage inequality story effectively overpowering any trade effects the technology argument is summarized on page 13 trade may be the issue there is growing middle ground in the economics literature analyzing both trade levels and prices that is not ready either to dismiss the effects of trade nor elevate them in looking to answer us labor market questions sachs and shatz this factor content study covering the period 1978 to 1990 concludes that the overall effect of developing country trade decline in employment of 57 percent is divided between drop in production lowskill employment of 62 percent and drop in nonproduction highskill employment of 43 percent22 these authors agree with wood that trade theory explains some of the labor market effects following similar logic and methodology but in using more traditional approach to factor content analysis they come to the conclusion that woods implications of greater impact of trade on unskilled employment could not be established specifically developing country trade is shown to affect lowskill employment more than highskill employment but the difference is small23 20 lawrence robert z and matthew j slaughter international trade and american wages in the 1980s giant sucking sound or

lawrence and slaughter international trade and american wages p 204 22 sachs and shatz trade and jobs in us manufacturing pp 29 23 ibid pp 3233 crs10 sachs and shatz verified their factor content analysis with price data finding that the prices of nonskillintensive goods fell in relative termsconsistent with the rise in lowwage trade competition but that the magnitude of the price change was not sufficient to account for significant widening of wage inequalities24 this conclusion points to the difficulty in attempting to explain economywide effects based on select sectoral analysis suggesting that there are more forces at work to explain the wage discrepancy issue the authors assert that combination of technical change and traderelated effects would explain much of the change in relative demand for skilled workers as well as the growing wage gap25 this study has come under criticism for excluding computer prices in its trade sample because relative prices fell dramatically reflecting huge gains in productivity that would overwhelm the rest of the data with computer prices the data would not point to an increase in the relative price of highskillintensive goods and so not provide the evidence that trade may have played role in the wage disparity issue many critics do not accept dropping computers from the sample and further argue even if done the result is still statistically insignificant to condemn trade26 krugman opting for different methodology but again looking at the volume of trade paul krugman argues that developing country trade has had only small effect at most on labor market problems in the developed world he develops computable general equilibrium model to explore how wages and employment in the advanced countries and trade with the third world might be simultaneously determined27 the general equilibrium approach explores the effects of one variable on the economy as whole defining relationships across different markets say the tradeable goods market and the employment market krugmans model suggests that trade growth between developing and developed countries is consistent with 3 rise in the relative wages between skilled and unskilled workers in the united states since the early 1970s 10 of the 30 increase the effect is larger because the trade volume is too small relative to the us economy further the effects of the factorpriceequalization theorem wages converging between low and highwage economies break down with complete production specialization because effectively workers are not manufacturing the same goods and so not truly competing with each other across borders krugman concludes that wages of developed country workers are therefore not seriously threatened by developing country trade he uses the notebook computer as case in point suggesting that although the computer appears to be high 24 ibid pp 3840 25 ibid p 41 italics are the authors 26 this study was updated in 1997 including adding data

fall easily into developing country niche28 leamer edward leamer is critical of labor economists approach to analyzing the factor content and quantity of trade for having solid link to economic theory he does however suggest that they are correct in looking to globalization as one reason for the relative decline in unskilled wages he does this by also critiquing the work of his colleagues on the international economic side suggesting they have not properly assessed the problem29 leamer argues that product prices focusing in particular on data from the apparel and textile industries have moved in the direction that is consistent with an increase in income inequality in the united states this trend occurs however only for the 1970s when prices of apparel fell by 30 as employment and wages in the industry moved in tandem in the 1960s prices employment and wages of all income groups rose and in the 1980s the free fall in apparel and textile prices ceased consistent with other studies finding that trade was not factor in the growth of the wage differential his assessment is that the 1970s were the stolpersamuelson decade where wage inequality is linked with the rise of lowwage imports other economists find otherwise because they focused only on the 1980s leamer suggests however that technology was likely the more important factor affecting wages in the 1980s but that the issue remains unresolved30 leamers work has attracted critics as well many focused on the strict technical limitations of his model in addition broad concerns have been raised regarding facts not addressed in his story for example the fall in real wages during the 1970s also coincided with an overall decline in productivity as the us economy weathered oil shocks inflation and unemployment energy prices and unemployment may well have influenced real compensation in the work force particularly in textiles and apparel31 summary and conclusions trade with developing countries is growing

estimates not find greater role for trade given that economic theory might suggest otherwise there are multiple possible answers to this question 1 trade is only one of many factors affecting wage inequality including productivity rates of investment in capital and labor education technology immigration demographic trends and effective bargaining power of unions 2 imports from lowwage countries compete with goods made by only 2 of the us work force suggesting that their economywide effect on wages is small in addition losses of lowskill manufacturing jobs may be offset by gains in low skill services jobs where the largest portion of unskilled jobs reside crs13 3 factor price equalization breaks down when worker productivity or production technologies differ across countries leading to production specialization in effect the united states longer competes in lowskillintensive goods but specializes in highskill capitalintensive products with links through trade and production sharing 4 protectionism in certain importsensitive sectors textiles and the multifiber arrangement may be keeping the full effect of imports on wages from being felt this is research area in need of elaboration as separate argument some or all of the negative wage effects of trade may be offset by real income gains from cheaper imports lower priced imports eg apparel increase the purchasing power of consumers particularly lowincome consumers who often are the ones also adversely affected by trade in these cases the two effects need to be considered to assess correctly the net effect of trade as closing point if the consensus estimate range on the wage impact of developing country trade is accepted then some 8090 of the issue remains unexplained the common response to this conclusion is that the major problem of lowwage workers arises because their skills longer match the production needs brought about by technological change critics of this response point out that technologys effect on the economy cannot be measured directly in statistical studies and so often is only assumed to be residual effect to the extent other factors are accounted for this measurement problem remains an area of ongoing research for the time being32 policy implications congress has been concerned about trade legislation in part because of concern over trades effects on lowskilled workers even if the consensus is correct and trade accounts for only modest portion of wage inequality in the united states it is widely argued that helping the few hurt by trade is the socially responsible action to take given that the economy as whole may be better off with freer trade crafting effective policy responses has been difficult because there is single easily identifiable quick fix to the predicament of lowskilled workers one option is to support measures that restrict imports the rationale is that if competition from developing countries lowers the real wages of some us workers minimize this competition interestingly although labor groups tend to support this position manifested essentially by resisting efforts to expand free trade agreements few economists agree this extends even to those who believe that developing country trade is serious problem such as adrian wood their reasoning is that trade restrictions have high economywide costs in terms of consumer choice and prices producer input prices and overall efficiency 32 for detailed critique see mishel lawrence with jared bernstein and john schmitt the state of working america 199697 washington dc economic policy institute 1997 pp 21426 crs14 second alternative which has been in place for over 30 years is to include trade adjustment assistance taa as part of any trade liberalizing legislation taa has historically included both cash payments to compensate unemployed individuals who have had their incomes directly reduced because of trade and retraining to help these displaced workers prepare for jobs currently in demand since its inception in 1962 however taa has been criticized for being ineffective and costly job retraining has helped only fraction of affected workers and the program itself can delay benefits while workers go through the process of being certified33 recurring policy option within the taa framework is to offer some type of shortterm earnings subsidy or insurance34 this would encourage workers to take new jobs more quickly even if the new jobs pay less than those lost by providing supplemental income for stated period of time some view this as the best way to provide more complete compensation to those most hurt by trade but as an income transfer entitlement program it is also the highcost option which has limited its appeal in the past the debate continues over how to implement the most efficient and effective policy response as the debate on fast track and other trade issues heats up again the downside of trade liberalization will be discussed as will options to minimize it if history is any guide one response likely to be considered will be whether or how to compensate losers by enhancing or expanding taa regardless of how this facet of the debate is resolved it also seems clear that whether one is inclined to accept the worst case scenario on the effects of developing country trade on the united states or dismiss it entirely in favor of technological change as the greatest threat to the american dream the consensus solution among economists lies with making the work force as competitive as possible 33 for more background see crs
