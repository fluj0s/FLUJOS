and time period over fy2003fy2005 usda expects to spend about 11 billion annually on farm payments in total outlays feed grains receive the most support 29 of the total followed by wheat dairy and cotton 1518 each however using diﬀerent criteria based on the proportion of crop revenue from government payments rice peanuts and wool and mohair receive higher percentage of revenue from the government 4251 than cotton wheat and feed grains 1225 usda also purchases some of these program commodities and other nonprogram commodities and processed products for use in domestic and international food aid programs in fy2003 usda purchased commodities totaling 15 billion for domestic food assistance and 13 billion for international food aid beef was the most purchased commodity

ogram commodities nd other nonprogram commodities and processed produc ts for use in domestic and international food aid programs in fy2003 usda purchased commodities totaling 15 billion for domestic food assistance and 13 billion for intern ational f ood aid beef was the most purchased commodity for domestic programs 15 of the total followed by cheese 14 and chicken 9 the child nutrition and school lunch programs were significant users of these commodities wh eat is the mostpurchased commodity for international food aid pr ograms 33 this report will not be updated the federal government intervenes in agricultural commodity markets most visibly by making income support payments to the growers of certain commodities and purchasing those and other commodities for nutrition assistance programs these actions affect both the supply and dema nd of certain commodities and can be central to debates over equitable or preferentia l treatment by commodity nd food aid interest groups commodityspecific payments and purchases result from combination of statutory directives and administrative determinations by usda in this report payment refers to the income support programs for farmers who grow or have history of growing certain eligible crops commodity purchase refers to the government acquisition of crop or livestock products for food distribution and nutrition programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21872crs2 1 for more on child nutrition see crs report rl31577 child nutrition and wic programs 2 for more information about the farm programs see crs report rs21779

programs is under consideration by the 108th congress hr 3873 and s 25071 payments for farm income support background federal law has authorized fa rm income and commodity support programs for over 70 years using various approaches and covering various commodities congress alters key provisions of these laws through multiyear farm bills or appropriations acts the most recent revision of the commodity payments is title i of the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 the farm secur ity and rural inves tment act of 2002 the program commodities currently include wheat feed grains corn sorghum barley oats cotton rice soybeans othe r oilseeds sunflower seed rapeseed canola safflower flaxseed mustard seed crambe nd sesame seed wool mohair honey dry peas lentils and chickpeas dairy sugar nd tobacco are also eligible for other support2 for example depending on which of the program crops farmers grow or have history of planting farmers can receive three types of payments direct payments are unrelated to decoupled from current production or current market prices the payment is made based on each farms historical number of acres planted and yields countercyclical payments make up the difference between crops statutory target price and the seasonaverage market price if the market price is lower as with direct payments farmers are not obligated to grow the crop to earn countercyclical payments marketing loans provide minimum price guarantees on the crop actually produced through nonr ecourse loans discounted repayment options and loan ficiency payments ldps ranking any ranking of commodity payments depends on the unit of measurement for example payments could be ranked by total dollars spent dollars per bushel dollars per acre dollars per farm or percent of crop receipts table 1 presents net outlays by the usda commodity credit corporation ccc ranked by total dollars allocated to each commodity direct paymen ts countercyclical payments and marketing loan benefits to farmers comprise most of these amounts because spending can vary greatly from year to year as market conditions change the table includes actual outlayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21872crs3 3 the 11 billion figure includes only payments ssociated with single commodity and does not include other activities such as the conservation reserve program crp export programs and disaster assistance ov er fy2003fy2005 usda expects average total spending by the commodity credit corporati on ccc of about 157 billion 4 payment limits restrict the dollar amount of farm subsidy that an individual can receive congress sets the limits most recently in the 2002 farm bill and the issue continues to be controversial among commodity groups for more information see crs report rs21493for fy2003 the first

grain sorghum barley and oats corn accounts for about 90 of the amount 2 excludes peanut quota buyout payments of 12 billion in fy2003 and 19 million in each of fy2004 fy2005 but includes program startup costs such as building inventory and loan portfolio 3 excludes conservation reserve program crp export programs and disaster assistance in total dollars feed grains receive the highest commodity payments over the fy2003fy2005 period accounting for 32 billion or 29 out of 11 billion on average annually3 wheat is second at 2 billion r 18 followed closely by dairy at 19 b illion or 17 and cotton at 16 billion or 15 however this ranking is sensitive to the years chosen using twoyear average of fy2003fy2004 the ranking of the top four commodities changes to feed grains dairy cotton and wheat total outlays reflect the size of the prog ram in the federal budg et but not necessarily the relative impact among commodities for example the program crops are tied to base acreage and can be ranked by the average payment per acre the left side of table 2 reveals much different ranking with rice and peanuts receiving over 200acre in payments followed by cotton at 87acre f eed grains wheat and soybeans all fall below 30acre this ranking helps explain why rice and cotton grow ers are affected more often by payment limitations4 than other commodity growers however it fails to account for costs of production which may be significantly higher fo r certain commodities and may be used to support arguments for higher paymentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21872crs4 table 2 alternative rankings of farm commodity payments average annual amounts for fy2003fy2005 criterion government payment per acrecriterion government payments as percent of gross income program crop acre

source computed by crs using data in the usda commodity estimates book more comparable ranking is the percentage of gross income farm sales plus government payments that comes from the government the right side of table 2 shows that about half of gross income for rice is government payments and over 40 for peanuts and wool and mohair cotton and wheat receive about quarter of their income in government payments feed grains bout 12 dairy about 8 and soybeans 4 thus in the current time period feed gr ains are clearly the largest program commodity in total spending however programs for other commodities that are less expensive in total outlays such as rice pea nuts and wool and moha ir provide the largest shares of gross income nd may have more of an impact on individual growers purchases for food assistance programs the usda buys commodities or donates th em from government inventories to supplement domestic food aid programs and fo r international food re lief in addition such purchases also have the dual role of supporting farm income by increasing demand for the commodity and removing surplus stoc ks from the market this report includes only direct usda purchases of
