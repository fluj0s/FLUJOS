finance division december 4 2008 abstract one of the original purposes of the federal reserve act enacted in 1913 was to prevent recurrence of Ô¨Ånancial panics to that end the fed has been given broad authority over monetary policy and the payments system including the issuance of federal reserve notes as the national currency as with any statutory delegations of authority the feds actions are subject to congressional oversight although the fed has broad authority to independently execute monetary policy on daytoday basis questions have arisen as to whether the unusual events of recent months raise fundamental issues about the feds role and what role congress should play in assessing those issues this report reviews the feds actions since august 2007 and analyzes the policy issues raised by those actionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34427g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

response to the current financial turmoil that began in august 2007 it has sharply increased reserves to the banking system through open market operations and lowered the federal funds rate and discount rate on several occasions as the turmoil has progressed without signs of subsiding the fed has introduced new policy tools to try to restore normality through new credit facilities the fed first expanded lending to the banking system and then extended lending to nonbank financial firms lending to nonbanks is major departure from past policy for it is the first time that financial institutions that are not member banks of the federal reserve system have been allowed to borrow directly from the fed on routine basis as the crisis worsened the fed began providing credit directly to markets for commercial paper and assetbacked securities as result of these programs the feds outstanding loans and private asset purchases have ranged from 05 trillion to 1 trillion in recent months the feds authority and capacity to lend is bound only by fears of the inflationary consequences which have been offset by additional debt issuance by the treasury in march 2008 jpmorgan chase agreed to acquire bear stearns as part of the agreement the fed made 2882 billion loan to limited liability corporation llc it created to buy 2997 billion of assets from bear stearns the fed has also agreed to make loans and purchase assets through an llc from the american international group aig worth up to 1125 billion in november 2008 the fed and federal government agreed to guarantee losses on 306 billion of assets owned by citigroup in all of these agreements the fed is exposed to downside financial risk if the assets purchased or guaranteed fall in value the statutory authority for most of the feds recent actions is based on clause of the federal reserve act to be used in unusual or exigent circumstances that had not been invoked in more than 70 years all loans are backed by collateral that reduces the risk of losses any losses borne by the fed from its loans or asset purchases would reduce the profits it remits to the treasury making the effect on the federal budget similar to if the loans were made directly by treasury it is highly unlikely that losses would exceed its other profits and capital and require revenues to be transferred to the fed from the treasury the primary policy issues raised by the feds actions are the issues of systemic risk and moral hazard moral hazard refers to the phenomenon where actors take on more risk because they are protected the feds involvement in stabilizing bear stearns aig and citigroup stemmed from the fear of systemic risk that the financial syst em as whole would cease to function if either were allowed to fail in other words the firms were seen as too big or too interconnected to fail the feds regulatory structure is intended to mitigate the moral hazard that stems from access to government protections yet bear stearns and aig were not under the feds regulatory structure because they were not member banks httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34427g8g146g151g138g151g140g146g138g149g561

liquidity abruptly dried up for many financial firms and securities markets suddenly some firms were able to borrow and invest ors were able to sell certain securities only at prohibitive rates and prices if at all the liquidity crunch was most extreme for firms and securities with links to subprime mortgages but it also spread rapidly into seemingly unrelated areas1 the federal reserve fed was drawn into the liquidity crunch from the start on august 9 it injected unusually large quantities of reserves into the banking system to prevent the federal funds rate from exceeding its target it has been observed that the most unusual aspect of the crisis is its persistence for more than year over that time the fed has aggressively reduced the federal funds rate and the discount rate in an attempt to calm the waters when this proved not to be enough the fed greatly expanded its direct lending to the financial sector through several new lending programs some of which can be seen as adaptations of traditional tools and others which can be seen as more fundamental departures from the status quo 2 most controversially in march 2008 the fed was involved in the bailout of the investment bank bear stearns which was not member bank of the federal reserve system because it was not depository institution and therefore not part of the regulatory regime that accompanies membership 3 in august fannie mae and freddie mac the housing governmentsponsored enterprises gses were taken into conservatorship by the government4 in september the investment bank lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy it did not receive emergency government assistance and the financial firm american international group aig which was also not member bank received credit line from the fed in order to meet its obligations lending to nonmembers requires emergency statutory authority that had not previously been used in more than 70 years5 in november 2008 the fed and federal government agreed to guarantee losses on 306 billion of assets owned by citigroup one of the original purposes of the federal reserve act enacted in 1913 was to prevent recurrence of financial panics to that end the fed has been given broad authority over monetary policy and the payments system including the issuance of federal reserve notes as the national currency as with any statutory delegations of authority the feds actions are subject to congressional oversight although the fed has broad authority to independently execute monetary policy on daytoday basis questions have arisen as to whether the unusual events of recent months raise fundamental issues about the feds role and what role congress should play in 1 for more information see crs report rl34182 financial crisis the liquidity crunch of august 2007 by darryl getter et 2 current amounts of fed lending outstanding can be found at federal reserve factors affecting reserve balances of depository institutions statistical release h41 updated weekly 3 many of the loans and new programs described below are operated through the federal reserve bank of new york under the authorization of the board of governors this report uses the term federal reserve and does not distinguish between actions taken by the board and actions taken by the federal reserve bank of new york the federal reserve system is composed of the board of governors and twelve regional banks one of which is the new york fed 4 the fed authorized lending to fannie mae and freddie mac on july 13 2008 but this authority was not used at that point as it was soon superseded by the authority granted to treasury to offer the gses financial assistance on september 19 2008 the fed announced that it would also purchase for the first time since 1981 debt obligations of fannie mae freddie mac and the federal home loan banks through open market operations on november 25 2008 the fed announced that it would purchase up to 100 billion of the direct obligations and 500 billion of the mortgagebacked securities issued by fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae however 5 federal reserve bank of new york the discount window fedpoint august 2007

the federal reserve act 38 stat 251 today its primary duty is the execution of monetary policy through open market operations to fulfill its mandate to promote stable economic growth and low and stable price inflation besides the conduct of monetary policy the federal reserve has number of other duties it regulates financial institutions issues paper currency clears checks collects economic data and carries out economic research prominent in the current debate is one particular responsibility to act as lender of last resort to the financial system when capital cannot be raised in private markets to prevent financial panics the next two sections explain the feds traditional tools open market operations and discount window lending and summarizes its recent use of those tools

market operations are carried out through the purchase and sale of us treasury securities in the secondary market to alter the reserves of the banking system6 by altering bank reserves the fed can influence shortterm interest rates and hence overall credit conditions the feds target for open market operations is the federal funds rate the rate at which banks lend to one another on an overnight basis the federal funds rate is market determined meaning the rate fluctuates as supply and demand for bank reserves change the fed announces target for the federal funds rate and pushes the market rate toward the target by altering the supply of reserves in the market through the purchase and sale of treasury securities7 more reserves increase the liquidity in the banking system and in theory should make banks more willing to lend spreading greater liquidity throughout the financial system when the fed wants to stimulate economic activity it lowers the federal funds target which is referred to as expansionary policy lower interest rates stimulate economic activity by stimulating interestsensitive spending which incl udes physical capital investment eg plant and equipment by firms residential investment housing construction and consumer durable spending eg automobiles and appliances by households lower rates would also be expected to lead to lower value of the dollar all else equal lower dollar would stimulate exports and the output of us importcompeting firms to reduce spending in the economy called contractionary policy the fed raises interest rates and the process works in reverse central banks across the world including europe japan and the united states acted quickly to restore liquidity to the financial system following august 9 2007 on normal day the fed 6 some of the feds purchase and sale of treasury securities are made outright but most are made through repurchase agreements which can be thought of as shortterm transactions that are automatically reversed at the end of predetermined period typically lasting few days since the fed must constantly adjust the amount of bank reserves available to keep the federal funds rate near its target repurchase agreements give the fed more flexibility to make these adjustments 7 for more information see crs report rl30354 monetary policy and the federal reserve current policy and conditions by

to keep the federal funds rate within few onehundredths of percent of its target suddenly on august 9 the federal funds rate approached 6 and the fed was forced to purchase 24 billion of treasury securities in order to add enough liquidity to bring the federal funds rate back down to its target of 525 on august 10 the fed needed to purchase an additional 38 billion to keep the rate at its target and issued statement that began the federal reserve is providing liquidity to facilitate the orderly functioning of financial markets the eu ropean central bank provided 156 billion euros 215 billion of liquidity to markets on august 9 and 10 normalcy soon returned to the federal funds market although other parts of the financial system remained illiquid the fed took similar actions on march 7 2008 when it announced that it would be injecting up to 100 billion in liquidity for at least 28 days through open market operations it took similar actions again in september 2008 how should the feds actions in these instances be characterized the feds actions cannot be classified as policy change since it left the federal funds target rate unchangedin the august case for over month 8 nor can it be considered unusual that the fed bought treasury securities to keep the federal funds rate at its targetthe fed does this on daily basis what was unusual about the incidents was the magnitude of liquidity the fed needed to add to keep the rate near its target on september 18 2007 the fed reduced the federal funds target rate by 05 percentage points to 475 stating that the change was intended to forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets since then the fed has aggressively lowered interest rates several times the fed decides whether to change its target for the federal funds rate at meetings scheduled every six weeks in normal conditions the fed would typically leave the target unchanged or change it by 025 percentage points from september to march the fed lowered the target at each regularly scheduled meeting by an increment larger than 025 percentage points at most of these meetings it also lowered the target by 075 percentage points at an unscheduled meeting on january 21 2008 as the financial turmoil persisted the fed became more concerned about rising inflationary pressures although financial conditions had not returned to normal the fed kept the federal funds rate steady from april 30 2008 until october 9 2008 when it again reduced the federal funds rate this time by 05 percentage points to 15 unusually this rate reduction was coordinated with several foreign central banks on october 29 2008 the fed reduced the federal funds rate to 1

directly through discount window lending 9 discount window lending dates back to the early days of the fed and was originally the feds main policy tool the feds main policy tool shifted from the discount window to open market operations several decades ago loans made at the discount window are backed by collateral in excess of the loan 8 although change in the targeted rate was announced the fed allowed the actual federal funds rate to fall below 5 on most days over the next month 9 for more background see james clouse r ecent developments in disc ount window policy federal reserve

generally have high credit rating most discount window lending is done on an overnight basis unlike the federal funds rate the fed sets the discount rate directly through fiat during normal market conditions the fed has discouraged banks from borrowing at the discount window on routine basis believing that banks should be able to meet their normal reserve needs through the market thus the discount window has played secondary role in policymaking to open market operations in 2003 the fed made that policy explicit in its pricing by changing the discount rate from 05 percentage points below to 1 percentage point above the federal funds rate majority of member banks do not access the discount window in any given year since the beginning of the financial turmoil the fed has reduced the spread between the federal funds rate and the discount rate although it has kept the spread positive on august 17 2007 the fed took further actions to restore calm to financial markets when it reduced the discount rate from 625 to 575 since then the discount rate has been lowered several times typically at the same time as the federal funds rate from 1959 to 2007 discount window lending outstanding never surpassed 8 bil lion discount window lending in the primary credit category increased from daily average of 45 million outstanding in july 2007 to 1345 million in september 2007 lending continued to increase to more than 10 billion outstanding per day from may 2008 and has reached as high as 90 billion but was superseded in economic significance by the creation of the term auction facility in december 2007 discussed below g16g142g160g561g22g152g152g149g156g561 the feds traditional tools are aimed at the commercial banking system but current financial turmoil has occurred outside of the banking system as well the inability of traditional tools to calm financial markets since august 2007 has led the fed to develop several new tools to fill perceived gaps between open market operations and the discount window traditionally the lender of last resort function has focused on the banking system and the feds relationship with the banking system is prescribed in detail by the federal reserve act many of the new facilities are aimed at other parts of the financial system however and the federal reserve act is largely silent on the feds authority outside the banking system one exception is the broad emergency authority under section 133 of the federal reserve act which the fed has frequently invoked since the financial crisis began

traditionally been discouraged on the grounds that banks should meet their reserve requirements through the marketplace the federal funds market rather than the fed borrowing from the fed was therefore seen as sign of weakness as it implied that market participants were unwilling to lend to the bank because of fears of insolvency in the current turmoil this perception of weakness could be particularly damaging since bank could be undermined by run based on unfounded but selffulfilling fears ironically this means that although the fed encourages discount window borrowing so that banks can avoid liquidity problems banks are hesitant to turn to the fed because of fears that doing so would spark crisis of confidence as result the fed found the discount window relatively ineffective

supplementary term auction facility taf in response10 discount window lending is initiated at the behest of the requesting institutionthe fed has control over how many requests for loans it receives the taf allows the fed to determine the amount of reserves it wishes to lend out to banks based on market conditions the auction process determines the rate at which those funds will be lent with all bidders receiving the lowest winning bid rate the winning bi d may not be lower than the prevailing federal funds rate determining the rate by bid provides the fed with additional information on how much demand for reserves exists any depository institution eligible for discount window lending can participate in the taf auctions through the taf have been held twice month beginning in december 2007 the amounts auctioned have greatly exceeded discount window lending which averages in the hundreds of millions of dollars outstanding daily in normal times and more than 10 billion outstanding since may 2008 the taf initially auctioned 20 billion every two weeks but this amount was increased on several occasions to as much as 150 billion every two weeks so that the daily loans outstanding have exceeded 100 billion since april 2008 11 like discount window lending taf loans must be fully collateralized with the same qualifying collateral as with discount window lending the fed faces the risk that the value of collateral would fall below the loan amount in the event that the loan was not repaid for that reason the amount lent diminishes as the quality of the collateral diminishes loans mature in 28 daysfar longer than overnight loans in the federal funds market or the typical discount window loan in july 2008 the fed began making some taf loans that matured in 84 days another motivation for the taf may have been an attempt to reduce the unusually large divergence that had emerged between the federal funds rate and interbank lending rates for longer maturities this divergence which can be seen as sign of how much liquidity had deteriorated in spite of the feds previous efforts became much smaller after december in subsequent periods of market stress such as september 2008 the divergence reemerged the evidence on the effectiveness of the taf in reducing this divergence is mixed 12 the taf program was announced as temporary program that could be made permanent after assessment given that the discount rate is set higher than the federal funds rate to discourage its use in normal market conditions it is unclear what role permanent taf would fill unless the funds auctioned were minimal in normal market conditions permanent taf would seem to run counter to the philosophy governing the discount window that financial institutions if possible should rely on the private sector to meet their shortterm reserve needs during normal market conditions 10 for more information see olivier armantier et the federal reserves term auction facility

definition to swap treasuries of different maturities or attributes with the fed on an overnight basis through program called the system open market account securities lending program to help meet the dealers liquidity needs while all treasury securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government some securities are more liquid than others mainly because of differences in availability securities lending has effect on general interest rates or the money supply since it does not involve cash but can affect the liquidity premium of the securities traded since the loans were overnight and collateralized with other treasury securities there was very little risk for the fed what is primar dealer primary dealers are abo ut 2 0 larg financial institutions who are th counter parties with w hich t he fed undertakes open market operations b uying and selling of treasury curities to be primary dealer an in stitution must among other things meet relevant basel or sec capital req uirements and maintain good trading relationship with t he fed on march 11 2008 the fed set up more expansive securities lending program for the primary dealers called the term securities lending facility tslf under this program up to 200 billion of treasury securities could be lent for 28 days instead of overnight as of september 2008 initially loans could be collateralized with us treasuries government agency debt including debt issued by fannie mae and freddie mac mortgagebacked securities mbs issued by government agencies or private labels with an aaaaaa rating agency commercial mortgagebacked securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations on september 14 2008 the fed expanded acceptable collateral to in clude all investmentgrade debt securities given the recent drop in mbs and other asset prices this made the new lending program considerably more risky than the old one but the scope for losses is limited by the fact that the loans are fully collateralized with haircut ie less money is loaned than the value of the collateral and if the collateral loses value before the loan is due the fed can call for substitute collateral the first auction on march 27 involved 75 billion of securities in august 2008 the program was expanded to allow the primary dealers to purchase up to 50 billion of options with prices set by auction to swap for treasuries through the tslf the tslf was announced as temporary facility the facility was subsequently extended most recently until the end of april 2009 by allowing the primary dealers to temporarily sw ap illiquid assets such as mbs for highly liquid treasuries the tslf is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally according to the fed 13 given the timing of the announcementless than week before the failure of one of its primary dealers bear stearnscritics have alleged that the program was created in effect in an attempt to rescue bear stearns from its liquidity problems but it should be noted that the new program did not involve bear stearns most illi quid and devalued assets as will be discussed below the fed would take much larger steps to aid bear stearns later the same week 13 board of governors of the federal reserve system press release march 11

creation of the primary dealer credit facility pdcf new direct lending program for primary dealers very similar to the discount window program for depository institutions loans are made through the pdcf on an overnight basis at the discount rate limiting their riskiness acceptable collateral initially included treasuries government agency debt and investment grade corporate mortgagebacked assetbacked and municipal securities borrowing from the facility has been sporadic with average daily borrowing outstanding above 10 billion in the first three months hitting zero in august 2008 and above 50 billion following the financial deterioration in september 2008 on september 14 2008 the fed expanded acceptable collateral to include certain classes of equities many of the classes of eligible assets can and have fluctuated significantly in value fees will be charged to frequent users the program was announced as lasting six months or longer if events warrant the program is authorized under paragraph 3 of section 13 of the federal reserve act the facility was subsequently extended most recently until the end of april 2009 although the program shares some characterist ics with the discount window and the term securities lending facility the fact that the program was authorized under paragraph 3 of section 13 of the federal reserve act suggests that there is fundamental difference between this program and the feds normal operations the fed is referred to as the nations central bank because it is at the center of the banking systemproviding reserves and credit and

term assetbacked securities loan facility talf in response to problems in the market for asset backed securities abs according to the fed new issuance of abs declined precipitously in september and came to halt in october at the same time interest rate spreads on aaara ted tranches of abs soared to levels well outside the range of historical experience reflecting unusually high risk premiums14 the talf is intended to stimulate the issuance of new securities backed by pools of student loans automobile loans credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the small business administration the fed announced that the talf may later be expanded to other classes of abs such as mortgagerelated securities the fed fears that if lenders cannot securitize these types of loans eventually households will be forced to reduce consumption spending which would exacerbate the economic downturn for security to be eligible for use as collateral its issuer not the borrower must follow the executive compensation policies under section 111b of the emergency economic stabilization act pl 110343 15 rather than purchase abs directly the fed will make nonrecourse loans to private individuals to purchase newly issued abs receiving the highest credit rating using the abs as collateral if the abs lose value the losses will be borne by the fed and the treasury through the tarp program instead of by the borrower the fed will lend less than the current value of the collateral so the fed would not bear losses on the loan until losses exceed the value of the haircut the loans will have term of one year but can be renewed the amount lent and the interest rate on the loans will be determined by an auction process with maximums and minimums set by the fed the total amount lent will not exceed 200 billion any us citizen or business may borrow from the fed via primary dealer under this program since the fed is lending to nonbanks the facility is authorized under section 133 of the federal reserve act the facility is scheduled to cease making new loans at the end of 2009 if the loans are not repaid the treasury will bear the first 20 billion in total losses on the underlying collateral and the fed will bear any additional losses the treasurys losses will be financed through the troubled assets purchase program tarp authorized by pl 110343 talf has some similarities to tarp as it was originally envisioned with the primary differences being that the fed is lending to purchase rather than purchasing assets and the assets backing the loans are newly issued as opposed to troubled existing assets since the treasurys funds will finance loan losses rather than asset purchases the 20 billion will support much larger volume of assets than would be possible through direct purchase

routinely issue commercial paper which is shortterm debt purchased directly by investors that matures in less than 270 days with an average maturity of 30 days there are three broad categories of commercial paper issuers financial firms nonfinancial firms and pass through entities that issue paper backed by assets the commercial paper issued directly by firms tends not to be backed by collateral as these firms are viewed as large and creditworthy and the paper matures quickly individual investors are major purchasers of commercial paper through money market mutual funds and money market accounts the securities and exchange commission regulates the holdings of money market mutual funds limiting their holdings to highly rated shortterm debt thus investors widely perceived money market mu tual funds as safe and low risk on september 16 the reserve fund which is money market mutual fund broke the buck meaning that the value of its shares had fallen below face value this occurred because of losses it had taken on shortterm debt issued by lehman brothers which filed for bankruptcy on september 15 money market investors had perceived breaking the buck to be highly unlikely and its occurrence set off run on money market funds as many investors simultaneously attempted to withdraw their investments this run greatly decreased the demand for new commercial paper firms rely on the ability to issue new debt to roll over maturing debt to meet their liquidity needs fearing that disruption in the commercial paper markets could make overall problems in financial markets more severe the fed announced on september 19 that it would create the assetbacked commercial paper money market mutual fund liqu idity facility amlf this facility would make nonrecourse loans to banks to purchase assetbacked commercial paper because the loans were nonrecourse the banks would have further liability to repay any losses on the commercial paper collateralizing the loan in its first week of operation there were daily loans of 152 billion outstanding through the amlf the temporary facility was subsequently extended until the end of april 2009 although the creation of the amlf and the treasurys temporary guarantee of money market mutual fund deposits had eased conditions in th commercial paper market the market remained strained for example commercial paper outstanding fell from more than 2 trillion outstanding in august 2007 to 18 trillion on september 7 2008 to 16 trillion on october 1 2008 the yield on 30day aarated assetbacked commercial paper rose from 27 on september 8 2008 to 55 on october 7 2008 because of the importance of commercial paper for meeting firms liquidity needs the fed decided to take stronger action to ensure that the market was not disrupted 16 on october 7 it announced the creation of the commercial paper funding facility cpff special purpose vehicle spv that would borrow from the fed to purchase all types of threemonth highly rated us commercial paper secured and unsecured from issuers the interest rate charged by the cpff was set at the three month overnight index swap plus 1 percentage point for secured corporate debt 2 percentage points for unsecured corporate debt and 3 percentage points for assetbacked paper the cpff can buy as much commercial paper from any individual issuer as that issuer had outstanding in the year to date any losses borne by the cpff would ultimately be 16 financial firms experiencing any disruption to their liquidity needs in the commercial paper market were already eligible to borrow from the fed on collateralized basis httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34427g8g146g151g138g151g140g146g138g149g561 g22g158g155g150g152g146g149g497g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g20g142

manage the spvs assets the facility is authorized under section 13 3 of the federal reserve act its emergency authority it will operate until april 2009 subject to renewal by the fed the fed argued that the assurance that firms will be able to roll over commercial paper at the cpff will encourage private investors to buy commercial paper again the cpff is notable on several grounds first it is the first fed standing facility in modern times with an ongoing commitment to purchase assets as opposed to lending against assets technically the fed is lending against the assets of the spv but the spv was created by the fed and is controlled by the fed the arrangement is similar to the feds creation of maiden lane limited liability corporation to purchase bear stea rns assets discussed below but that involved onetime purchase second in the case of nonfinanc ial commercial paper it is the first time in several decades that the fed is providing financial assistance to nonfinancial firms17 third in the case of commercial paper that is not asset backed it is unusual for the fed through the spv to purchase uncollateralized debt on october 21 2008 the fed announced the creation of the money market investor funding facility mmiff and pledged to lend it up to 540 billion the mmiff will lend to private sector spvs that invest in commercial paper issued by highly rated financial institutions each spv will be owned by group of financial firms and can only purchase commercial paper issued by that group these spvs can purchase commercial paper from money market mutual funds facing redemption requests to help avoid runs such as the run on the reserve fund the treasury has already guaranteed existing money market deposits to avoid further runs the fed hopes that if money market mutual funds in turn do not have to worry about how to finance redemptions they will become more willing to purchase commercial paper financial firms have an incentive to participate in these spvs since mutual funds will be more willing to purchase an institutions commercial paper if it is able to sell it back to an spv to reduce the risk to the fed its lending will be equal to 90 of the value of the commercial paper the spv purchases the other 10 of financing will be provided by the money market fund and done with recourse on an overnight basis at the discount rate since the spvs are not member banks of the federal reserve system the fed authorized the mmiff under section 133 of the federal reserve act the mmiff is scheduled to wind down by the end of april 2009 upon winding down the spvs will receive fixed profit with any additional profits accruing to the fed

temporary reciprocal currency agreements known as swap lines with the european ce ntral bank and the swiss central bank these agreements let the fed swap dollars for euros or swiss francs for fixed period of time since september 2008 the fed has extended similar swap lines to central banks in several other countries in october 2008 it made the swap lines unlimited in size the swap lines are currently authorized through the end of january 2009 the swap lines are intended to provide liquidity to banks in nondomestic denominations for example many european banks have borrowed in dollars to

market as banks have become reluctant to lend to each other through this market central banks at home and abroad have taken much larger role in providing banks with liquidity directly but through

meet daily cashflow needs and requirements imposed by the fed at times over the past year the fed has faced conflicting goalsit seeks to ensure that banks have enough reserves to remain liquid but it also seeks to maintain its target for the federal funds rate to meet its economic goals the federal funds rate is the market rate in the private market where bank with excess reserves lends them overnight to other banks at times ensuring that all banks have adequate reserves has resulted in an overall level of reserves in the market that has pushed the federal funds rate below its target in other words the only way for the fed to make sure that each bank has enough reserves has been to oversupply the banking system as whole with liquidity at the given federal funds target to avoid this problem congress authorized the fed to pay interest on bank reserves in the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 hr 1424pl 110343 by setting an interest rate on bank reserves close to the federal funds rate the fed would in effect place floor on the rate in theory the federal funds rate would not fall below the interest rate on reserves because banks would rather hold excess reserves to earn interest than lend them out to other banks at lower interest rate 18 paying interest on reserves may also encourage banks to hold more reserves overall which may somewhat reduce banks liquidity problems during the current period of heightened uncertainty the interest rate on excess reserves was initially set at 075 percentage points less than the federal funds rate immediately after the fed began paying interest the federal funds rate was still falling below the target and some days was even below the interest rate on reserves in response the fed subsequently changed the interest rate most recently in november 2008 to 01 percentage points less than the federal funds rate even after this change the actual federal funds rate continued to fall below the target rate paying interest on reserves does not encourage banks to increase overall lending to firms and households however because it increases the attractiveness of holding reserves thus it is not policy that stimulates the economy at least in any direct sense on the contrary it prevents the increase in liquidity to banks from stimulating the economy by preventing the federal funds rate from falling pl 110343 gave the fed permanent authority to pay interest on reserves once financial conditions return to normal the liquidity benefits from paying interest will be less important since banks will again be able to meet reserve needs through the federal funds market and the primary remaining benefit would be reduction in the volatility of the federal funds rate the fed previously intervened in the

from banks devoting resources to activities that minimize reserves such as sweep accounts paying interest on reserves reduces the feds profits and thus reduces its remittances to the treasury thereby increasing the budget deficit all else equal it can be viewed as transfer from the federal government to the banks although in the long run competition makes it likely that the banks will pass on the benefit to depositors in the form of higher interest paid on deposits from congresss perspective the benefit of less volatile target rate and less resources spent minimizing reserves would have to be weighed against the lost federal revenue over time the decision to pay interest on required as well as excess reserves also increases the cost of the policy without any additional benefit to liquidity or reduced volatility because banks must keep required reserves even if incentive is offered

the investment bank bear stearns came under severe liquidity pressures in early march in what many observers have coined nonbank run 20 on friday march 14 jpmorgan chase announced that in conjunction with the federal reserve it had agreed to provide secured funding to bear stearns as necessary through its discount window the fed agreed to provide 13 billion of backtoback financing to bear stearns via jpmorgan chase it was nonrecourse loan meaning that the fed had general claim against jpmorgan chase in the event that the loan was not repaid and the outstanding balance exceeded the value of the collateral bear stearns could not access the discount window directly because at that point only member banks could borrow directly from the fed this loan was superseded by the events of march 16 and the loan was repaid in full on march 17 on sunday march 16 after negotiations between the two companies the fed and the treasury jpmorgan chase agreed to acquire bear stearns as part of the agreement the fed will purchase up to 30 billion of bear stearns assets through maiden lane new limited liability corporation llc based in delaware that it has created and controls after the merger was completed the loan was finalized on june 26 2008 two loans were made to the llc the fed lent the llc 2882 billion and jpmorgan chas made subordinate loan to the llc worth 19 this section discusses the

by bear stearns on march 14 the fed reported that the portfolio supporting the credit extensions consists largely of mortgagerelated assets in particular it includes cash assets as well as related hedges the cash assets consist of investment grade securities ie securities rated bbb or higher by at least one of the three principal credit rating agencies and lower than that by the others and residential or commercial mortgage loans classified as perfo rming all of the assets are current as to principal and interest as of march 14 2008 all securities are domiciled and issued in the us and

mortgage corporation freddie mac as well as assetbacked securities adjustablerate mortgages commercial mortgagebacked securities nongse cmos collateralized bond obligations and various other loan obligations 23 the ceo of jpmorgan chase testified that jpmorgan chase kept the riskier and more complex securities in the bear stearns portfoliowe did not cherry pick the assets in the collateral pool for the llc 24 these assets are owned by the llc which will eventually liquidate them to pay back the principal and interest owed to the fed and jpmorgan chase the llcs assets purchased from bear stearns are the collateral backing the loans from the fed and jpmorgan chase private company blackrock financial management has been hired to manage the portfolio neither bear stearns nor jpmorgan chase owes the fed any principal or interest nor are they liable if the llc is unable to pay back the money the fed lent it the new york fed explained that the llc was created to ease administration of the portfolio and will remove constraints on the money manager that might arise from retaining the assets on the books of bear stearns 25 jpmorgan chase and bear stearns did not receive the 2882

continue to accrue on the remaining amount of the loan outstanding thus in order for the principal and interest to be paid off the assets will need to appreciate enough or generate enough income so that the rate of return on the assets exceeds the weighted interest rate on th loans plus the operating costs of the llc table 1 shows how the funds raised through the liquidation will be used any difference between the proceeds and the amount of the loans is profit or loss for the fed not jpmorgan chase because jpmorgan chases 115 billion loan was subordinate to the feds 2882 billion loan if there are losses on the total assets the first 115 billion of losses will be borne in effect by jpmorgan chase however as of november 2008 the value of the assets had already been written down by

the ceo of jpmorgan chase testified that we could not and would not have assumed the substantial risks of acquiring bear stearns without the 30 billion facility provided by the fed29 the primary risk was presumably that the value of mortgagerelated assets would continue to decline had the transaction been crafted as typical discount window loan directly to jpmorgan chase jpmorgan chase would have been required to pay back the principal and interest and it rather than the fed would have borne the full risk of any depreciation in value of bear stearns assets the feds statutory authority for its role in both bear stearns transactions comes from paragraph 3 of section 13 of the federal reserve act in his testimony new york fed president timothy geithner stated that the fed did not have authority to acquire an equity interest in bear stearns or jpmorgan chase 30 yet the llc controlled by the fed acquired assets from bear stearns and the profits or losses from that acquisition will

rather than engaging in the transaction directly although the fed did not buy bear stearns assets directly there are certainly important policy questions raised by the feds creation and financing of an llc in order to buy bear stearns assets typically the fed lends money to institutions and receives collateral in return to reduce the risk of suffering loss when the loan is repaid the collateral is returned to the institution in this case the fed made loan but to llc they created and controlled not to financial institution from the perspective of jpmorgan chase or bear stearns the transaction was sale to the llc not loan regardless of whether the fed or the llc was the principal

institution american international group aig had experienced significant decline in its stock price and was facing immediate demands for 14 billion to 15 billion in collateral payments due to recent downgrades by credit rating agencies according to press reports 31 the fed and treasury feared that aig was also too big to fail because of the potential for widespread disruption to financial markets that would result the fed announced that aig could borrow up to 85 billion from the fed over the next two years on september 18 the fed announced that it had initially lent 28 billion to aig 32 the interest rate on the funds drawn is 85 percentage points above the london interbank offered rate libor rate that banks charge to lend to each other aig will also have to pay lower interest rate on any funds that it is does not draw from the facility in return the government will receive warrants that if exercised would give the government 799 ownership stake in aig the fed will name three independent trustees to oversee the firm for the duration of the loan the lending facility is backed by the assets of aigs nonregulated subsidiaries but not the assets of its insurance company in other words the fed can seize aigs assets if the firm fails to honor the terms of the loan this reduces the risk that the fed and ultimately taxpayers will suffer loss the risk still remains that if aig turned out to be insolvent its assets would be insufficient to cover the amount it had borrowed from the fed since aig has been identified as too big to fail it is unclear how its assets could be seized in the event of nonpayment without precipitating failure g21g142g140g152g151g141g561g14g152g138g151g561 on october 8 the fed announced that it was xpanding its assistance to aig and swapping

liquidity from the fed to cover these losses and counterparty withdrawals although this assistance resembles typical collateralized loan the fed receives assets as collateral and the borrower receives cash the fed characterized the agreement as loan of securities from aig to the fed in exchange for cash collateral it appears the arrangement was structured this way because new york insurance law prevents aig from using the securities as collateral in loan 34 the terms of the agreement are unavailable at this time

support aig since the initial loan some notably aigs former ceo maurice greenberg had criticized the terms as overly harsh arguing that the loan itself might be contributing to aigs eventual failure as company as evidenced by the additional borrowing after the september 16 loan aig had continued to see cash flow out of the company particularly to post collateral for the credit default swaps that were arguably the primary cause of the financial problems in the company the revised agreement points to the tension between making the terms of the assistance undesirable enough to deter other firms from seeking government assistance in the future compared to making the terms of assist ance so punitive that it exacerbates the financial problems of the recipient firm it also points to the fact that once firm has been identified as too big to fail government assistance to the firm can become openended as the original amounts offered were quickly revised upward the november 10 restructuring eased the payment terms for aig and had three primary parts 1 40 billion direct capital injection 2 restructuring of the 85 billion loan and 3 525 billion purchase of troubled assets

treasury securities its assets are the loans it makes through the discount window and the new programs detailed above and the private assets it hold through llcs eg for aig and the bear stearns takeover its loans and asset purchases are financed by increasing its liabilities federal reserve notes and does not inherently impose any cost to the treasury indeed if the loans are repaid they would increa the profits of the fed which in turn would increase the feds remittances to the treasury39 even if the loans are not repaid they are fully collateralized in some cases over collateralized so the fed would not suffer losses unless the collateral had lost value in addition some of the loans discussed above are made with recourse which means that the firms are liable if the collateral loses value the fed had net income of 384 billion and remitted 346 billion to the treasury in 2007 in the past most of the feds net income has derived from the interest on its treasury securities holdings not its loans the earnings and any losses the fed took on its loans would increase or reduce its net income respectively if loan losses caused an overall net loss the feds capital the excess of its assets compared with its liabilities would be reduced the fed had capital of 369 billion at end of 2007 half of which was paidin capital of member banks and the other half was surplus the fed has not had an annual net operating loss since 1915 however the feds assets became more risky in 2008 due to the shift in its ssets from us treasuries to direct loans and due to the increase in its assets and liabilities relative to its capital 37 joint statement by treasury federal reserve and the fdic on citigroup joint press release november 23 2008 38 for full discussion see the section below entitled nder of last resort systemic risk and moral hazard 39 assuming that the interest rate on the loans exceeded the rate of return on the treasuries that the fed would have purchased if the

taxpayer dollars unless the losses exceeded the sum of its other earnings and its capital for example in october 2008 the feds capital would be depleted if its realized net losses were equal in value to 35 of its holdings of securities us treasuries and loans however an losses could result in smaller remittance of earnings to the treasury than would have occurred had the fed not made the loans therefore the ultimate cost to the government is the same whether loans to the financial sector are made through the fed or the treasury although the fed has taken steps to minimize the risk that recent activities will result in losses members of congress have raised the question of whether taxpayers should be exposed to additional fiscal risks without congressional approval particularly since some of the feds actions have similarities to those authorized under tarp

as direct loans from the fed have multiplied some observers have questioned at what point the feds lending power will be exhausted the fed cannot run out of money to lend because it controls the monetary base through which it expands or contracts the amount of money outstanding to suit its needs there are statutory limits on the size of the money supply and thus how much it can loan the ultimate constraint on the monetary base and thus its willingness to lend comes from the part of its congressional mandate requiring stable prices ie low and stable rate of price inflation if the fed allows the money supply to become too large then price inflation will become uncomfortably high discussed in the section below on stagflation in the 12 months ending in august 2008 inflation as measured by the consumer price index had risen 54significantly higher than the feds selfidentified comfort zone thus the fed is reluctant to allow its loans to result in significant expansion in the money supply 40 as commodity prices fell later in 2008 the inflation rate also fell when the fed makes loans to private financial firms it increases the money supply unless offset by open market operations namely the sale of treasury securities in practice before september 2008 the fed had kept the monetary base relatively constant by selling enough treasury securities to offset the additional loans it makes when the fed sells treasury securities it removes the money it receives from circulation on the feds balance sheet both treasury securities and loans outstanding are assets thus as loans outstanding have risen its holdings of treasury securities have declined for example in september 2007 88 of its assets were treasury securities held outright and less than 1 were loans to the financial system in november 2008 23 of its assets were treasury securities 32 were loans and 16 were private securities mostly commercial paper some have worried that if this trend continue d the fed would eventually hold too few treasury securities to be able to conduct open market operations 41 this scenario is not imminentas of october 2008 the fed still held about 480 billion in treasury securities although some of those are lent through the tslf nevertheless to safeguard against any risk of this eventuality the treasury announced the supplementary financing program on september 17 2008 under this 40 were the amount of loans to increase significantly b ecause financial c onditions b ecame significantly worse it is unlikely that the fed would continue to fear that larger money supply would have unacceptable consequences for inflation if so the fed could become less concerned about taking steps to offset the loans effects on the money supply 41 it should be noted that portfolio of treasury securitie s is only needed to tighten monetary policy expansionary monetary policy involves the purchase of treasury securities

than it needs to finance government operations and will deposit the proceeds at the fed as of december 2008 about 500 billion had been borrowed by the treasury and deposited at the fed through this program congress authorized this borrowing only indirectly by raising the statutory debt limit most recently in pl 110343 this program has two effects first it supplies more treasuries to investors when there is excess demand because of flight to quality the treasuries issued under the program are indistinguishable to investors from regularlyissued securities second it allows the fed to take on more loans without requiring reduction to its treasury holdings in order to offset the effects on the money supply the increase in the money supply is offset because the money received by the treasury is held at the fed and not allowed to circulate ultimately the program will not affect the treasurys fiscal position however because it will increase the profits of the fed which are then remitted to the treasury the fact that the fed has been sterilizing the effects of its loans on the money supply may be limiting the effects of those loans on financial conditions in essence the fed has two methods for providing the financial system with liquidityopen market operations or direct loans the fed has increased the role of direct loans to directly meet individual financial institutions liquidity needs but the fed has to offset the effects of the direct loans on the money supply to meet its goals for inflation thus the loans do not provide additional overall monetary stimulus to the economy when sterilized 42 since the fed is sterilizing the loans because of its concerns with inflation the utility of the program is fundamentally question of whether the fed has achieved the proper balance between stabilizing the financial sector and providing price stability two topics that are discussed below

g16g152g155g150g138g149g140g162g501g561 the feds actions since 2007 have been primarily focused on restoring liquidity to the financial systemlending to financial firms to convert their illiquid assets into cash or us treasury securities but as financial conditions have deteriorated in spite of increasing fed intervention it has become apparent that the problems facing financial firms are not exclusively related to liquidity the crux of the firms problem stems from the large losses on some of their assets particularly mortgagerelated assets 43 this has caused number of problems for the firms related to capital adequacy which is the difference between the value of their assets and the value of their liabilities first losses and writedowns associat ed with those assets have reduced the firms existing capital according to bloomberg financial firms had written down losses of 501 billion 42 as financial conditions deteriorated after september 2008 and the fed increased its assets to support the financial system the feds liabilities increased significantly because of an increase in bank reserves thus the fed did not sterilize this increase normally this would have been inflationary but it appears that the increase in reserves was caused by desire by banks to increase their reserves rather than their lending if so there may not be inflationary consequences to the increase in the feds assets 43 for more information see crs report rs22963 financial market intervention by edward v murphy and baird webel

compensate as of august 200844 second in the current environment investors and creditors are demanding that firms hold more capital relative to assets than before so that firms can better withstand any future losses third the losses to date have impaired the firms ability to raise enough new capital firms can raise new capital through retained earnings which have been greatly reduced for many firms by the poor performance of their assets or by issuing new capital equity and selling it to new investors but in current market conditions inve stors have been reluctant to inject new capital into struggling firms part of the explanation for this is that current losses have made the firms less profitable but another part of the reason is that investors fear that there will be further losses in the future that would reduce the value of thei r investment and perhaps even cause the firm to become insolvent uncertainty about future losses is partly caused by the opacity surrounding the assets that have been declining in value which makes it hard for investors to determine which assets remain overvalued and which are undervalued the result for companies such as bear stearns lehman brothers aig washington mutual and wachovia was downward spiral in their stock price which had two selfreinforcing characteristics first there was little demand for existing stock since its worth would either be d iluted by new capital raised privately or through government intervention or lost in insolvency second new capital could not be attracted because the fall in stock value had left the market capitalization of the firms so low if firms capital is completely depleted there is longer buffer between its assets and liabilities and it becomes insolvent many large financial firms including the firms that have failed are heavily dependent on short term borrowing to meet their current obligations as financial conditions have worsened some of the firms that have had the problems described above have had problems accessing shortterm borrowing markets that in normal conditions could be taken for granted in an atmosphere where creditors cannot perceive which firms have insufficient capital they become unwilling to lend for even short intervals this is the essence of the liquidity problemalthough the firms assets may exceed their liabilities without access to shortterm borrowing the firm cannot meet its current obligations because it cannot convert its assets into cash quickly enough at least not if it wishes to avoid fire sale prices the fed has always been the lender of last resort in order for banks to avoid liquidity problems during financial turmoil to borrow from the fed financial firm must post collateral in essence this allows the firm to temporarily convert its illiquid assets into cash enabling the firm to meet its shortterm obligations without sacrificing its assets the fed has always lent to commercial banks depository institutions through the discount window 45 as discussed above it has extended liquidity to nonbank financial firms in 2008 through new lending facilities borrowing from the fed increases liquidity but it does not change firms capital position since it now has liability outstanding to the fed so borrowing from the fed cannot solve the problems of undercapitalization that some firms currently face indeed the fed will generally not lend to 44 yalman onaran banks subprime losses top 500 billion on writedowns bloomberg august 12 2008 45 in normal conditions borrowing from the discount window is allowed but discouraged and banks are expected to meet their liquidity needs through private markets soon after the financial turmoil began the fed began to encourage discount window borrowing

liquidity only to firms that are solvent and thus able to repay46 hr 1424 which was signed into law on october 3 pl 110343 created the troubled assets relief program tarp thus far the treasury has announced it would use tarp funds to address the capital adequacy problem directly by providing 250 billion in capital to banks directly through preferred share purchases by tarp47 if tarp proves insufficient to restore financial calm some have asked whether there is any program that the fed could operate to address the financial firms capital adequacy problems all of the feds standing lending facilities involve collateralized lending and as discussed above any program involving collateralized lending would not change firms capital position according to one legal analysis there is express statutory authority for the fed to purchase corporate bonds mortgages or equity 48 but the feds assistance in the bear stearns merger with jpmorgan chase took form that has some similarities to the tarp proposal in the case of bear stearns the fed created limited liability corporation called maiden lane and lent maiden lane 2882 billion maiden lane used the proceeds of that loan and another loan from jpmorgan chase to purchase mortgagerelated assets from bear stearns thus although the fed created and controlled maiden lane the assets were purchased and held by maiden lane not the fed similar to tarp maiden lane plans to hold the assets until markets recover and then sell the assets to repay its loans to the fed and jpmorgan chase maiden lane was created under the feds section 133 emergency authority49 the fed was presumably granted broad emergency powers under section 133 so that it had the flexibility to deal with unforeseen circumstances nonetheless too broad of reading of its powers could provoke displeasure in congress or legal challenges creating tarp within the treasury through legislation rather than the fed through emergency powers avoided the argument whether such program extended beyond the feds intended role

since its early days one of the feds main roles has been to act as lender of last resort to the banking system when private sources of credit become unavailable the lender of last resort function can be seen from the perspective of an individual institution or the financial system as whole 50 from the perspective of the individual institution discount window lending is meant to provide funds to institutions that are illiquid cannot meet current obligations out of current cash flow but still solvent assets exceed liabilities when they cannot access funds from the private 46 in addition the fed faces some statutory limitations on lending to undercapitalized banks under normal circumstances see for example section 10b of the federal reserve act 47 for more information see crs report

howeverbank runs did not cease until the creation of federal deposit insurance the experience of the great depression suggested that bank runs placed intolerably high costs on the financial system as whole as they led to widespread bank failures51 discount window lending is not meant to help insolvent institutions with one exception explained below access to discount window lending and deposit insurance creates moral hazard for financial institutionsthey can take on more risk than the market would otherwise permit because of the government safety net to limit moral hazard institutions with depository insurance and access to the discount window are subject to safety and soundness regulatory regime that includes capital requirements reserve requirements bank examinations and so on the exception to the rule that insolvent institutions cannot access the discount window is when the institution is deemed too big to fail institu tions that are too big to fail are ones that are deemed to be big enough that their failure could create systemic risk the risk that the financial system as whole would cease to function smoothly52 systemic risk episode could impose heavy costs on the overall economy as the bank panics of the great depression demonstrated although too big to fail institutions are not offered explicit guarantees it can be argued that they have implicit guarantees since the government would not be willing to allow systemic risk episode this accentuates the moral hazard problem described above there is official governmental classification of which financial institutions are too big to fail presumably since maintaining uncertainty over which institutions are too big to fail could help reduce the moral hazard problem but the lack of official designation arguably creates vacuum in terms of policy preparedness making the problem more complex as one report described the situation officials grimly concluded that while bear stearns isnt too big to fail it was too interconnected to be allowed to fail in just one day it is unclear how to judge which institutions are too interconnected to fail 53 as the cases of bear stearns fannie mae and freddie mac and aig illustrate some of the modernday financial institutions that are too big to fail are not depository institutions that fall under the strict regulatory umbrella that accompanies membership in the federal reserve system this highlights the shift in financial activity from bankdominated financial system at the time of the feds creation to system whose health now depends on many types of institutions the fed was set up to be lender of last resort to only the banking system in the current crisis it has been able to extend its lender of last resort functions to nonbank financial institutions only because of its section 13 3 emergency powers policy issue going forward is whether the extension of these functions should be made permanent and if so what types of regulatory safeguards should accompany it because section 133 is intended for emergencies it grants authority that is broader and more openended than the feds normal authority it is possible that part of the reason these institutions failed is because they took on excessive risks in the belief that they were too big to fail although that theory can be debated it is clearer 51 in this context it is interesting to note that the bear stearns failure has been described as nonbank run meaning bear stearns was undermined because it was shunned by its counterparties and investors analogous to bank being shunned by its deposit ors the defining characteristic of run is that the fear of failure becomes selffulfilling since it deprives an institution of the resources it needs to avoid failure 52

may strengthen the perception of other institutions and investors that any financial firm regardless of whether it is depository institution will be bailed out in the future if it is too big to fail or merely too interconnected to fail if so it could be argued that the bear stearns episode may have increased moral hazard going forward the governments decision not to intervene to prevent the failure of the investment bank lehman brothers in septem ber 2008 but to subsequently assist aig and citigroup may have created further market uncertainty regarding which institutions the government views as too big to fail lehman brothers was larger than bear stearns and involved in similar business activities others have argued that the decision to let lehman brothers fail proves that lehman brothers was too big to fail since it set off wave of unrest in money markets see above interbank lending markets and the market for credit default swaps54 the government assistance to bear stearns fannie mae and freddie mac and aig all include clauses that significantly reduced the value of existing shareholder equity this was partly justified in terms of reducing moral hazardinvestors would be reluctant to buy equity in too big to fail companies that were taking excessive risks if the government demanded reduction in existing shareholder value but government assistance in all of these cases made creditors and other counterparties whole in these cases the moral hazard problem manifests itself in willingness of creditors to lend to and counterparti to transact with firm they know to be taking excessive risks thereby potentially allowing the firm to take more risks more recent government assistance to citigroup was provided without similar measures to replace management or dilute shareholders market particip ants may view this decision as signal that the government is longer placing emphasis on avoiding moral hazard going forward policymakers must determine whether new regulation is needed to limit moral hazard since there may be credible way to maintain policy that prohibits the rescue of future institutions that are too big to fail even if such policy were desired the current situation raises three broad points about systemic risk first risk is at the foundation of all financial intermediation policymakers may wish to curb excessive risk taking when it leads to systemic risk but too little financial risk would also be counterproductive for the economy indeed some would argue that part of the underlying problem for the financial system as whole at present is that investors are currently too risk averse second many analysts have argued that part of the reason that so much financial intermediation has left the commercial banking system is to avoid the costs of regulation 55 this point applies to future regulatory changes as well an attempt to increase regulation on banks could lead more business to move to hedge funds for example third financial markets have become significantly more complex and fastmoving in recent years many of the financial instruments with which bear stearns lehman brothers and aig were involved did not exist until recently for regulation to be effective in this environment it faces the challenge of trying to keep up with innovation if used prudently many of these innovations can reduce risk for individual investors yet the bear stearns example implies that innovation may also lead to more interconnectivity which increases systemic risk 54 chairman bernanke argued that the fed did not have the authority to assist lehman brothers because lehman brothers could not offer the fed adequate collateral for loan of the size needed which according to bernanke would have been much larger than the assistance for bear stearns see ben bernanke current economic and financial conditions speech at the national association for business economic nnual meeting october 7 2008 55 this problem in relation to investment banking has

influences economic conditions through the purchase and sale of us treasury securities on the secondary market this enables the fed to influence overall economic conditions without favoring any particular financial firm or asset thus minimizing its effect on the market allocation of capital as the fed has shifted to an increasing reliance on more direct intervention in the financial system in 2008 its actions have had growing consequences for the allocation of private capital by purchasing commercial paper and bear stearns assets via passthrough entities the fed has increased the relative demand for those assets in time when liquidity is scarce access to fed borrowing confers an advantage on banks and primary dealers over other types of institutions it may also arguably retard the process of weeding out bad institutions since reputation is needed to access private liquidity but not fed liquidity on the other hand during panic both good and bad firms can be shut out of credit markets other fed programs adopted in 2008 also affect the allocation of capital as discussed above assisting bear stearns and aig after their mistakes may encourage inefficiently high risk taking by other firms that are deemed too big to fail punitive conditions attached to the assistance mitigate but do not eliminate these effects 56 allowing primary dealers to temporarily swap their illiquid assets for treasuries protects those who invested poorly assistance to the commercial paper market confers and advantage to those firms that access that market which are generally large and have high credit ratings the fed has attempted to push down yields on certain assets that it feels have become inefficiently high eg through the term asset backed securities lending facility but it may be that at the height of the boom yields on these assets had become inefficiently low because investors underestimated their riskiness the feds efforts could eventually reintroduce inefficient underpricing of risk the feds shortterm goal is to avoid the downward sp iral in conditions that could lead to panic causing serious disruptions to the credit intermedia tion process for all firms prudent or otherwise but in the long run once financial stability has been restored these distortions to the market allocation of capital could result in economic inefficiencies there is also risk that the feds activities could crowd out private lenders and investors in the market for bank reserves and commercial paper leading to less robust private markets even if some of the feds current programs are allowed to expire if investors believed that they would be revived during the next downturn capital allocation would be altered

the ship although monetary policy is credited with having contributed to an unusual degree of economic stability since at least the mid1980s some argue that it has been rendered ineffective by the current outlook the argument is that lower interest rates will not boost spending because the economy is stuck in credit crunch in which financial institutions are unwilling to lend to creditworthy borrowers because of balance sheet 56 for example the decision to make creditors whole in the case of bear stearns and aig reduces incentives for creditors to curb lending to other institutions deemed too big to fail httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34427g8g146g151g138g151g140g146g138g149g561 g22g158g155g150g152g146g149g497g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g20g142

investment losses in turn financial firms are said to be hoarding capital and unable to access credit markets because of fears of future losses following september 2008 banks greatly increased their reserve holdings which could potentially be troubling sign borrower demand may increase in response to lower rates but as long as institutions are trying to rebuild their balance sheets they will remain reluctant to extend credit this problem is sometimes referred to as liquidity trap liquidity traps are rare in modern times but the decade of economic stagnation suffered by japan in the 1990s after the bursting of its financial bubble is cited as an example interest rates were lowered to almost zero in japan and the economy still did not recover quickly 57 there are some problems with this line of reasoning at present first liquidity traps are seen as an extreme form of recession but while the us economy has entered recession the fall in economic output has so far been mild compared to previous recessions second liquidity traps are most likely to occur when overall prices of goods and services are falling called deflation the fed cannot reduce the federal funds rate below zero when prices are falling real interest rates are higher than nominal interest rates so it is more likely that very low nominal interest rate would still be too high in real terms to stimulate economic activity but inflation has been above average in 2008 although falling more recently 58 inflation would not be expected to be persistently high if the economy were in liquidity trap third there is more benign welldocumented explanation for why the feds expansionary policy has not yet stimulated economic activitymonetary policy always suffers lags between reduction in interest rates and corresponding increases in economic activity while liquidity trap cannot be ruled out it is premature to conclude the economy is stuck in one at this point in time liquidity traps are threat when monetary policy has been kept too tight but the fed has eased monetary policy aggressively since the crisis began g21g157g138g144g143g149g138g157g146g152g151g501g561 other critics have argued that the fed has created the opposite problem of liquidity traprising inflation due to excessive liquidity they argue that the economy has entered period of stagflation where falling or negative economic growth is accompanied by high or rising inflation 59 typically one would expect an economic slowdown to be accompanied by decline in the inflation rate excess capacity in the capital stock and rising unemployment would force firms and workers to lower their prices and wage demands respectively but critics believe the economy is in situation where modest but persistent increase in inflation in recent years has led individuals to come to expect higher inflati on and factor that expectation into their price and wage demands couple those higher inflation expectations with rising commodity prices and the recent unusual large liquidity injections by the fed and critics argue that inflation will rise even if 57 while the term liquidity trap was often applied to japan it is theoretically defined as situation where household demand for money becomes so great that normal sized changes in the money supply do not affect interest rates under this strict definition it is not clear that japan or any other economy has experienced liquidity trap 58 asset prices have been falling lately but they are not includ ed in standard measures of inflation which measures the prices of goods and services 59 see crs report rl34428 understanding stagflation and the risk of its recurrence by brian w cashell and marc labonte httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34427g8g146g151g138g151g140g146g138g149g561

inflationary expectations became so ingrained that inflation continued to rise despite fairly deep recession as potential parallel to the current situation data suggest that the fear of stagflation is prematureboth unemployment and inflation remain relatively low at present it is true that in the long run inflation is primarily monetary phenomenon and if the feds recent monetary stance were maintained for too long it would not be consistent with stable inflation but in the near term if unemployment and excess capacity rose that would be expected to take much of the pressure off of the inflation rate furthermore commodity prices fell in the second half of 2008 reversing the immediate upward pressure on prices ironically if the feds actions succeed in reviving the economy then the probability that its actions would boost inflation would increase the key to maintaining stable inflation rate is finding the proper balance between the disinf lationary pressures of the slowdown and the inflationary pressures of expansionary monetary policy the large amounts of liquidity that the fed has added to the system must be removed soon enough that inflation does not rise but not so soon that nascent financial recovery is stubbed out given the uncertainty facing policymakers at present finding the proper balance is extremely difficult 60

is difficult to make the case that the fed has not responded to the current turmoil with alacrity and creativity the feds inability to restore normalcy is not necessarily sign that its policy decisions have been wrongheadedthe fed can provide the financial sector with additional liquidity but it cannot force institutions to use that liquidity to expand their lending or investing the feds response has raised statutory issues that congress may wish to consider in its oversight capacity namely the feds role in the bear stearns acquisition the aig loan the creation of the primary dealer credit facility sort of di scount window for group of nonmember banks and its intervention in the commercial paper market in volved emergency authorities that had not been used in more than 70 years this authority was needed because the actions involved financial institutions that were not member banks of the federal reserve system ie depository institutions but because the authority is broad and openended the feds actions under this authority are subject to few legal parameters the authority allows lending to nonmember banks but the loan in the bear stearns agreement is to llc that the fed created and controls and is being used to purchase bear stearns assets these actions raise an important issueif financial institutions can receive some of the benefits of fed protection in some cases because they are too big to fail should they also be subject to the costs that member banks bear in terms of safety and soundness regulations imposed to limit the moral hazard that inevitably results from fed and fdic federal deposit insurance corporation protections some policymakers have begun to question whether an institution largely independent from the elected branches of government should be able to indirectly place significant taxpayer funds at risk by assisting the financial sector through us of its emergency powers furthermore without 60 for more information see crs report rl34562
