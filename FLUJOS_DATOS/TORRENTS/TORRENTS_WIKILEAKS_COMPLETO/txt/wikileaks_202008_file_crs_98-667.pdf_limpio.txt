state laws pertaining to exemption from state sales and use taxes for purchases by the united states summary this report compiles and summarizes the provisions in state statutes that contain an exemption from state sales and use taxes for purchases by the federal government briefly state statutes have addressed this in variety of ways in some cases there is simply provision that exempts purchases that are not taxable under the constitution and laws of the united states another common statutory provision specifically exempts sales to the federal government and its agents and instrumentalities from the sales and use taxes the precise wording of these provisions may vary but one fairly common provision of this sort applies to the federal government its unincorporated agencies and instrumentalities and incorporated agencies wholly owned by th united states or owned by corporation wholly owned by the united states this phraseology eliminates questions about the application of the exemption to institutions like the privately owned national banks in many states both these types of statutes exist in some cases the statutes may impose requirements to claim the exemption eg certificate of exemption it should also be noted that these provi sions may not apply where an individual makes the purchase and is reimbursed by th federal government this compilation has been confined to surveying the state statutes cases and state regulations were not examined five states that do not have sa taxes alaska delaware montana new hampshire and oregon are not included all states regardless of the presence or absence of statutory provisions are subject to the constitutional limit on state taxing power that comes into play when state attempts to apply its sales and use taxes to federal government purchases that constitutional limit is of course applicable to all states regardless of the presence or absence of any statutory provisions the particularly significant constitutional limit on state taxing power in this context is the supremacy clause of the constitution found in article vi clause 2 it provides clause 2 this constitution and the laws which shall be made in pursuance thereof and all treaties made or which shall be made under authority of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby

introduction this report compiles and summarizes the provisions in state statutes that contain an exemption from state sales and use taxes for purchases by the federal government briefly state statutes have addressed this in variety of ways some states do not address this in their statutes and are denominated tax exemption in this report in second group of states the survey only found provision that exempts purchases that are not taxable under the c onstitution and laws of the united states these states are listed as constituti onal immunity states in the following summary third group of states have statutory provisions which specifically exempt sales to the federal government and its agents and instrumentalities from sales and use taxes these are listed as having an unqualified tax exemption in the summary the precise wording of these provisions may vary but one fairly common provision of this so rt applies to the federal government its unincorporated agencies and instrumentalities and incorporated agencies wholly owned by the united states or owned by corporation wholly owned by the united states this phraseology eliminates questi ons about the application of the exemption to institutions like the privately owned na tional banks finally fourth group has what has been labeled qualified tax exemption in these states the statutory exemption may be partial sp ecifically detailed or effective only when certain administrative criteria are met eg obtaining taxexempt identification number in some states more than one kind of statutory provision exists further these provisions may not apply where an individual makes the purchase and is reimbursed by the federal government fi nally the practical application of these taxes may not be reflected in the categ orizations based on statutory language this report has been confined to survey ing the state statutes and providing brief overview of the constitutional limit on state taxing power that comes into play when the state attempts to apply its sales and use taxes to federal government purchases such constitutional limits apply regardless of the presence or absence of statutory provisions state cas and regulations were not examined five states that do not have sales taxes ala ska delaware montana new hampshire and oregon are not included in this survey in this area the most significant constitutional limit on state taxing power is the supremacy clause of the constitution f ound in article vi clause 2 it provides clause 2 this constitution and the laws which shall be made in pursuance thereof and all treaties made or which shall be made under authority of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98667crs2 united states shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby anything in the constitution of laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding in 1819 in mcculloch v maryland 17 us 316 the supreme court applied this clause in striking down state tax appli cable to the operations of national bank while the reach of federal immunity from state taxation has been narrowed in the modern era it still serves as limit on the app lication of state taxes to federal institutions and activities the scope of its present application is perhaps best capsulized in the supreme courts opinion in united states v new mexico 455 us 720 735 1982 where the court said that to the extent the immunity was based on the activity taxed the case law limited the application of immunity to those situations where the levy falls directly on the united states itself or on an agency or instrumentality so closely connected to the government that the two cannot realistically be viewed as separate entities at least insofar as the activity being taxed is concerned in this case the legal incidence of the tax fell on govern ment contractor and the court refused to accept the view that immunity should apply because the economic incidence of the tax fell on the federal govern ment it did sound cautionary note however saying the state taxes which applied to federal contractors in manner that discriminated against the federal government or substantially interfered with its activities would be constitutionally invalid id at 735 n 11httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98667crs3 compilation of state laws pertaining to exemptions from state sales and use taxes for
