installations although most prevalent in the army the army rese rves and the national guard gang activity is pervasive throughout all branches of the m ilitary and across most ranks but is most common among the junior enlisted ranks the extent of gang presence in the armed services is often difficult to determine since many enlisted gang members conceal their gang affiliation and military authorities may not recognize gang affiliation or may be inclined not to report such incidences the military enlistment of gang members could ultimately lead to the worldwide expansion of usbased gangs u gang members may enlist in the military to escape their current environment or gang lifestyle some gang members may also enli st to receive weapons combat and convoy support training to obtain access to weapons and explosives or as an alternative to incarceration upon discharge they may employ their military training against law enforcement officials and rival gang members such military
