for higher education expenses government subsidies for education are pr ovided at the federal state and local levels governments mainly employ two types of direct subsidies to help families pay for higher education first direct appropriations are made by many state and local governments to public postsecondary in stitutions majority of this funding is used to minimize tuition charges for instate students second form of direct public subsid is needbased aid to students and families this category represents the largest share of student financial aid current education subsidies provided by the federal government include student loans grants and workstudy programs both of the ma jor federal grant programs pell grants and federal supplemental educational opport unity grants fseog are needbased there are also many specialized grants and scholarship programs offered federally for students at the graduate level the federal work study program and the student educational employment pr ograms allow students to earn money while in school the recipients of benefits through the ta x system can be quite different from the benefits provided through spending programs first because none of these provisions are available to families whose incomes are too low to pay income taxes some low income individuals including indepe ndent students cannot benefit from the provisions even those who pay some income taxes may not receive the full benefit of education tax incentives due to limited tax liabilities by contrast direct spending programs are often directed toward lower income individuals who are more likely to attend public institutions and to qualify for needbased aid this limit on the ability to benefit lower income individuals may limit the incentive effects of education tax provisions at least with respect to college enrollment if lower income individuals are more sensitive to price than higher income individuals who are likely to send their children to college in any case if so the education tax provisions may be largely seen as incentives that provide tax reduction without altering enrollment although perhaps altering ither or both the quality and affordability of education in addition the target of these provisi ons may shift when other unrelated changes are made to the tax code for example the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation ac t of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 reduced marginal income tax rates for individuals resulting in lower tax burdens in providing tax relief that was designed to stimulate the economy hous eholds experienced reduction in their income tax liability which led to decrease in the number of taxpayers eligible to claim education tax benefits these tax re ductions may have caused them to become unable to claim education ta x benefits because they ither had reduced tax liability to offset the education provisions or longer owed any tax httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32554crs2 1 us congress joint committee on

section of this report an overview of education tax incentives in addition to direct spending progra ms administered by the us department of education and other executive branch ag encies government

loan interest was liminated with the passage of the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 which disallowe d all forms of personal in terest deduction in 1996 after the enactment of an exclusion for earnings from qualified tuition programs qtps also known as sec tion 529 plans the number of tax benefits for higher education expenses rose to six five new education tax be nefits were enacted by the taxpayer

deduction for interest on student loans an exclusion for earnings accruing to education iras later renamed coverdell education savings accounts and cancellation of the penalty for early withdrawal

starting in 2002 new abovetheline deduction was created for postsecondary edu cation expenses paid by taxpayers for themselves their spouses or dependents an abovetheline deduction means that it is subtracted from taxable income before deductions or exemptions are claimed and lowers adjusted gross income one of th benefits of this abovetheline deduction is that it reduces the taxpayers adjusted gross income agi7 deductions that reduce agi will often provide greater tax benef it because as agi increases it can cause other tax deductions and credits to be reduced or eliminated the tuition and fees deduction also re ferred to as the higher education deduction is temporary provision in the tax code after its original enactment in 2001 the provision expired in 2005 and was retroactively

qualified education expenses deducted as business expense cl aimed for an education tax credit or paid with earnings from either coverdell edu cation savings account or us education savings bonds cannot be claimed fo r the tuition and fees deduction additionally the use of the deduction is c onditional on the tax status of the student in relationship to the taxpayer if the taxpayer claims an exemption for dependent who is an eligible student the taxpayer can in clude expenses paid for the student in determining the deduction if the dependent pays the qualified expenses and the taxpayer claims an exemption for that student neither the taxpayer nor the dependent can deduct the expenses business expense deduction of workrelated education an individual taxpayer is allowed to deduct education expenditures as business expense if the education 1 maintains or improves skill in the taxpayers present work and 2 is required by the taxpay ers employer to maintain salary status or job

income tax thresholds for selected years 1996 through 2007 by maxim shvedovan economic perspective ultimately education tax benefits for higher education can be evaluated by looking at the impact on econo mic efficiency equity and simplicity education tax benefits provide subsidies to encourage more investment in education than would otherwise be undertaken tax subsid ies for education can enhance economic efficiency if they are successful in incr easing investment in education however education tax incentives may not be effective if they subsidize activities that would have been undertaken in the absence of the tax incentive ie subsidize enrollment that would have occurred anyway or fail to increase enrollment at all education tax incentives can however be beneficial in making college costs more affordable as mentioned previously vertical equity is concept suggesting that tax burdens be distributed fairly among people with different abilities to pay education tax incentives benefit those who have suffici ent income to pay tax those individuals without sufficient income to pay tax do not have the opportunity to benefit from education tax provisions the dispropor tionate benefit of tax expenditures to individuals with higher incomes reduces th progressivity of the tax system which is often viewed as reduction in equity the tax credits are regressive in that the more income taxpayers have the more benefits they receive up to the maximu m phase out limits of the tax provision as result of the fact that the provisions ar not based on need ducation tax benefits move the distributional balance of fede ral aid away from lowincome students towards middle and upperincome students higher income households are more ab and more likely to benefit from education provisions which some view as detracting from equity in the tax code yet the incentives provide needed relief fo r the middle class many of whom may not qualify for any other source of financial ai d education tax bene fits add complexity and cost to the administration of income taxes both for individuals and the federal government but may offer lesscomplicated alternative to traditional financial aid closer examination of that issu is provided later in this report comparison of households some families have income levels so low that they do not have tax liability or even have negative tax liability in these cases families would not be able to benefit from certain educa tion tax incentives for example in 2007 married couple with two dependent children under the age of

the allowance of exclusions and deductions diminishes the progressivity of the federal income tax system because the valu of income tax exclusions increases with marginal tax rates and income that is to say the taxable income of an individual in the 10 tax bracket the lowest federa l income tax rate would be reduced 10 for each 100 of itemized deductions in contrast the taxable income of an individual in the 35 tax bracket the highest fede ral tax bracket would be reduced 35 for each 100 deduction19 while there are specific data to show the income levels of participants in tax preferred education savings programs susan dynarski f ound that the advantages of saving for college in particular the use of qtps and coverde ll rose sharply with income20 the three reasons she cited are that first those with the highest marginal tax rates benefit most from sheltering income gaining most in both absolute and relative terms second the accounts are risky for families for whom college attendance of children is uncertain since account holders are penalized if the accounts are not used for schooling however the current penalty structure leaves most benefits intact for the upper income brackets third finally the co llege financial aid system reduces aid for those families that have any financial assets including an or 529qtps since the highestincome families are unaff ected by this financial aid tax this further intensifies the positive correlation between income and the advantages of the taxadvantaged college savings accounts21 higher income taxpayers may participate more in savings programs than lower income taxpayers because the aftertax return on savings is greater for high income taxpayers given an interest rate r the aftertax return would be 1tr where t is the tax rate if household chose to m ove savings into tax preferred education incentives regardless of the interest rate the benefits would be greater for households facing higher marginal tax rate s for instance household facing 25 marginal tax rate would experience an increase in its aftertax return on savings of 33 from 125r to r while household with lower income in the 15 bracket would

taxpayers generally do not itemize and use the standard deduction amount instead the tuition and fees deduction and the deduc tion for student loan interest which are abovetheline deductions are

simplicity one view of education tax incentives is that they are easier to administer relative to traditional financial aid for families the traditional fi nancial aid process involves the completion of free application for federal student aid fafsa which is submitted to the us department of education ed in order to complete the application the households inco tax return must be completed for the most recent tax year ed processes the application and sends the family student aid report sar the higher education institution receives the financial aid information from ed and uses their own methodology to termine family contri bution and financial need that determination is then communicated to the family the traditional financial ai d process involves the taxp ayer the us department of education and the universitys financ ial aid officers while education tax incentives primarily24 involve the taxpayer and the u s department of treasury to receive education tax benef its the family files an in come tax return which is processed by one agency to receive trad itional financial aid the family files fafsa form which is processed by two ag encies both forms can involve detailed calculations and multitudes of records that have to be made and kept by the taxpayer and verified and assessed by the government agencies25 unlike the education tax incentives traditional financial aid sources are not always known or certain at the time of the students application while the process of completing the income tax forms may be cumbersome the taxpayer knows their eligibility for benefits at the time of completion as long as the taxpayer has met the eligibility criteria and has b een accurate in reporting in formation the tax benefit amounts are known and certain the trad itional financial ai d process typically involves degree of uncertainty about ai d sources and families often have to wait months from the time of application to learn what financial aid will be made available for the student in this respect education tax incentives may be more advantageous than tr aditional financial aid alternatively education tax incentives contribute to the complexity of the tax code and raise the cost of administering the tax system those costs which can be difficult to isolate and measure are rarely included in the costbenefit analysis of tax provisions the complexity of the tax code adds to taxpayers costs either in learning how to claim incentives and doing s or in increased direct costs of paying tax professionals to perform the service for the taxpayer additionally many taxpayers do not know which of the educati on tax benefits may be most effective inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32554crs24 future years the income phaseouts are at different levels and make calculations difficult and the tax w harder to understand another distinction between financial aid and tax incentives is the timing of the receipt of the assistance the benefits of tax incentives for education are realized at the time of income tax return filing which for most taxpayers typically occurs in the spring by the april 15 deadline this is in contrast to most academic tuition and fees payments that are made at the beginning of each academic year or semester typically occurring in the months of august or september and december or january this lagged difference often up to 10 or more months in receiving the tax benefit cannot provide assistance to anyone trying to ra ise enough funds to pay initial college bills in contrast traditional fina ncial aid is applied to th educational account of the student at the beginning of each semester in this respect education tax incentives may be less advantageous th an traditional financial aid
