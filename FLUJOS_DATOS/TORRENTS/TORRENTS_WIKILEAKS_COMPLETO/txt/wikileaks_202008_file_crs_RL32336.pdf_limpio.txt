federal bureau of investigation fbi has been criticized for failing to warn of the attacks of september 11 2001 in sweeping indictment of the fbis intelligence activities relating to counterterrorism and september 11 the congressional joint inquiry into the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 singled out the fbi in significant manner for failing to focus on the domestic terroris t threat collect useful intelligence analyze strategic intelligence and to share intelligence internally and with other members of the intelligence community the joint inquiry concluded that the fbi was seriously deficient in identifying reporting on and defending against the foreign terrorist threat to the united states the fbi is responding by attempting to transform it self into an agency that can prevent terrorist acts rather than react to them as crimes the major component of this effort is restructuring and upgrading of its various intelligence support units into formal and integrated intelligence program which includes the adoption of new operational practices and the improvement of its information technology fbi director robert s mueller iii has introduced reforms to curb the autonomy of the organizations 56 field offices by consolidating and centralizing fbi headquarters control over all counterterrorism and counterintelligence cases he has also established 1 an executive assistant director for intelligence eadi 2 an office of intelligence to exercise control over the fbis hist orically fragmented intelligence elements and 3 field intelligence groups to collect analyze and disseminate intelligence reactions to these fbi reforms are mixed critics contend the reforms are too limited and have implementation problems more fundamentally they argue that the gulf between law enforcement and intelligence cultures is so wide that the fbis reforms as proposed are unlikely to succeed they believe the fbi will remain essentially reactive law enforcement agency significantly constrained in its ability to collect and exploit ef fectively intelligence in preventing terrorist acts supporters counter that the fbi can successfully address its deficiencies particularly its intelligence shortcomings and that the directors intelligence reforms are appropriate for what needs to be done in the most recent iteration of the debate the 911 commission concluded that the fbi has made significant progress in improving its intelligence capabilities and generally endorsed director muellers reforms rejecting the creation of new domestic intelligence agency this report identifies five options for congress to consider including the creation of domestic intelligence agency like great britains mi5 other options include maintaining the status quo transferring such responsibilities to the department of homeland security or to the director of central intelligence or creating national security intelligence service within the fbi meanwhile for variety of reasons the 911 commission has recommended leaving counterterrorism intelligence collection with the fbi and creating an integrated national security workforce within the bureau

september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states have been labeled as major intelligence failure similar in magnitude to that associated with the japanese attack on pearl harbor2 in response to criticisms of its role in this failure the federal bureau of investigation fbi has introduced series of reforms to transform the bureau from largely reactive law enforcement agency focused on criminal investigations into more mobile agile flexible intelligencedriven 3 agency that can prevent acts of terrorism4 fbi director robert s mueller iii initiated changes that were sparked by congressional charges that the intelligence community ic5 including the fbi missed opportunities to prevent or at least disrupt the september 11 attacks on new york city and washington in sweeping indictment of the fbis intelligence activities relating to counterterrorism the joint inquiry into intelligence community activities before and after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 6 jic criticized the fbi for failing to focus on the terrorist threat domestically collect useful intelligence strategically analyze intelligence7 and to share intelligence internally and with the rest of the ic according to the congressiona l inquiry the fbi was incapable of producing significant intelligence products and was seriously handicapped in its efforts to identify report on 8 and defend against the foreign terrorist threat to the united states9 1 while the fbi initially provided the authors access to fbi officials and documents it later declined to do so despite numerous requests although this paper would have benefitted from continued cooperation the authors note with gratitude that some fbi officials continued to share their insights into the current reforms numerous current and former employees of the fbi and central intelligence agency cia as well as state and local law enforcement entities were interviewed for this report some sources wi sh to remain anonymous and

measure on whether the fbi can strengthen what critics have characterized as its historically neglected and weak intelligence program particularly in the area of strategic analysis they contend the fbi must improve its ability to collect analyze and disseminate domestic intelligence so that it can help federal state and local officials stop terrorists before they strike if the fbi is viewed as failing this fundamental litmus test they argue confidence in any beefed up intelligence program will quickly erode critics contend the fbis intelligence reforms are moving too slowly 10 and are too limited11 they argue that the fbis deeply rooted law enforcement culture and its reactive practice of investigating crimes after the fact12 will undermine efforts to transform the fbi into proactive agency able to develop and use intelligence to prevent terrorism for more detailed discussion of the fbis reactive case file approach see appendix d while the british security service mi5 may or may not be an appropriate organizational model for us domestic intelligence for myriad reasons the primacy it accords to intelligence functions over law enforcement interests may be worthy of consideration 13 in justifying their pessimism critics cite two previous failed attempts by the fbi to reform its intelligence program for more detailed discussion see appendix critics also question whether director mueller who has an extensive background in criminal prosecution but lacks experience in the intelligence field14 sufficiently understands the role of intelligence to be able to lead an overhaul of the fbis intelligence operation15 supporters counter that they believe the fbi can change that its shortcomings are fixable and that the directors intelligence reforms are appropriate focused and will produce the needed changes16 they also argue that successful war against terrorism demands that law enforcement and intelligence are closely linked and they main tain that the fbi is institutionally able to 10 see statement of john macgaffin to the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states dec 8 2003 macgaffin testified in the domestic context it is clear that the fbi needs to improve greatly its intelligence collection so that there are meaningful dots to connect and analyze some observers believe the fbi since 911 has made real progress in this direction i and many others do not 11 former senior fbi official stated in an aug 21 2003 interview that if fbi director mueller was serious about achieving more than limited reform he would establish

law enforcement and intelligence functions17 in its july 2004 final report the 911 commission 18 recommended leaving counterterrorism intelligence collection with the fbi and creating an integrated national security workforce within the bureau such an option has been often referred to as creating service within service for variety of reasons the 911 commission rejected the option of creating new domestic intelligence agency like great britains mi5 19 these and other options are discussed in greater detail below as well the 911 commission in its recent contribution to the debate essentially endorsed the fbi reforms noting that the fbi under director mueller has made significant progress in improving its intelligence capabilities20 the commission recommended that the fbi establish specialized and integrated national security workforce consisting of agents analysts linguists and surveillance specialists who are recruited trained rewarded and retained to ensure the development of an institutional culture with ep expertise in intelligence and national security the commission expressed concern that management in the field offices still can allocate people and resources to local concerns that diverge from the national security mission and that this system could revert to focus on lowerpriority criminal justice cases over national security requirements to address this concern the commission recommended that each field office should have an official at the field offices deputy level for national security matters this individual would have management oversight and ensure that the national priorities are carried out in the field 21 following the release of the 911 commissions report fbi director mueller said the fbi embraced most of the commissions recommendations with regard to the commissions recommendation that each field office should have an official at the deputy level to ensure that national security priorities are addressed the fbi stated in july 22 2004 press release our field intelligence groups currently report directly to an asac assistant special agent in charge in some field offices these asacs have broader responsibility for national security matters we will look closely at this recommendation 22 according to the fbi asacs at some field of fices have responsibilities broader than just national security matters raising the question as to whether asacs in each instance will ensure that national security priorities are carried out 17 ibid pp 1617 18 the 911 commission is formally known as the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states and was created by law in late 2002 pl 107306 nov 27 2003 it was chartered to prepare full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks including preparedness for and the immediate response to the attacks the commission also was mandated to provide recommendations designed to guard against future attacks 19 national commission

the fbis intelligence reforms whether lawmakers believe the fbi to be capable of meaningful reform and the directors reforms to be the correct ones could determine whether they accept or modify his

responding to the numerous shortcomings outlined by the jic by attempting to transform itself into an agency that can prevent terro rist acts rather than react to them as criminal acts the major component of this effort is the restructuring and upgrading of its various intelligence support units into formal and integrated intelligence program which includes the adoption of new operational practices and the improvement of its information technology fbi director robert s mueller iii has introduced reforms to curb the autonomy of the organizations 56 field offices by consolidating and centralizing fbi headquarters control over all counterterrorism and counterintelligence cases he has also established 1 an executive assistant director for intelligence eadi 2 an office of intelligence to exercise control over the fbis historically fragmented intelligence elements and 3 field intelligence groups to collect analyze and disseminate intelligence the fbi also has reallocated its resources in an effort to establish an effective and efficient intelligence program the reforms are intended to address the numerous perceived shortcomings including those outlined by the jic inquiry which concluded the fbi failed to focus on the domestic threat the fbi was unable to identify and monitor effectively the extent of activity by alqaida and other international terrorist groups operating in the united states 25 conduct allsource analysis 26 the fbis traditional reliance on an aggressive caseoriented law enforcement approach did not encourage the broader collection and analysis efforts that are critical to the intelligence mission lacking appropriate personnel training and information systems the fbi primarily gathered intelligence to support specific investigations not to conduct allsource analysis for dissemination to other intelligence agencies 27 23 see the gilmore commission fourth annual report to the president and congress pp 4344 24 the congressional research service has recently published related report on the fbi for history of the fbi see crs report rl32095 the fbi past present and future by todd masse and william j krouse 25 see

osama bin laden and alqaida the fbis 56 field offices enjoy great deal of latitude in managing their work consistent with the dynamic and reactive nature of its traditional law enforcement mission in counterterrorism efforts however that flexibility apparently served to dilute the fbis national focus on bin laden and alqaida28 conduct counterterrorism strategic analysis consistent with its traditional law enforcement mission the fbi was before september 11 reactive operationallydriven organization that did not value strategic analysis most fbi consumers viewed strategic analytical

traditional intelligence cycle process through which 1 intelligence collection priorities are identified by national level officials 2 priorities are communicated to the collectors who collect this information through various human and national technical means 3 the analysis and evaluation of this raw intelligence are converted into finished intelligence products 4 finished intelligence products are disseminated to consumers inside and outside the fbi and department of justice and 5 feedback mechanism is created to provide collectors analysts and collection requirements officials with consumer assessment of intelligence value see figure 1 below to advance that effort the executive assistant director for intelligence eadi has developed and issued nine socalled concepts of operations which essentially constitute strategic plan identifying those areas in which changes must be made these changes are seen as necessary if the fbi is to successfully establish an effective intelligence

an essential ingredient of counterterrorism program because it will enable the fbi to strengthen its intelligence program establish intelligence as priority at fbi field offices and improve headquartersfield coordination according to proponents fbi director mueller has centralized authority by making four principal structural changes he has established 1 new position of executive assistant director for intelligence eadi 2 created new office of intelligence to exercise control over the fbis historically fragmented intelligence program 3 established national joint terrorism task force and 4 established intelligence units in each field office to collect analyze and disseminate intelligence to fbi headquarters supporters contend that by centralizing decisionmaking the fbi will be able to address several critical weaknesses which the jic inquiry attributed to decentralized management first central management structure will enable the fbi to more easily correlate intelligence and thereby more accurately assess the presence of terrorists in the us second the fbi will be able to strengthen its analysis capabilities particularly with regard to strategic analysis which is intended to provide broader understanding of terrorist threats and terrorist organization third fbi headquarters will be able to more effectively fuse and share intelligence internally and with other ic agencies finally centralized decisionmaking will provide fbi headquarters means to enforce intelligence priorities in the field specifically it provide means for fbi headquarters to ensure that field agents spend less time gathering inform ation to support criminal prosecutionsa legacy of the fbis law enforcement cultureand more tim collecting and analyzing intelligence that will help prevent terrorist acts supporters contend that employees are embracing centralized management and the fbis new intelligence priorities but caution it is premature to pronounce centralized management

and centralized elements of their operations although the mission of national aeronautics space administration nasa is unrelated to that of the fbi it too has dispersed operations in review of the

agree that if the fbi is to prevent terrori sm it must strengthen its intelligence program establish intelligence as priority at fbi field offices and improve headquartersfield coordination but they question whether centralizing decisionmaking at fbi headquarters will enable the fbi to accomplish these goals and they cite two principal factors which they suggest will undermine the impact of centralized decision making they question whether any structural management changes can 1 change vested and ingrained law enforcement culture and 2 overcome the fbis lack of intelligence experience and integration with the intelligence community

to establish an effective and efficient intelligence program by centralizing decisionmaking at fbi headquarters they point to the historical importance that the fbi has placed on convicting criminalsincluding terrorists but those convictions have come after the fact and skeptics argue that the fbi will continue to encounter opposition within its ranks to adopting more subtle and somewhat unfamiliar intelligence methods design ed to prevent terrorism former attorney general janet reno for example reportedly leaned toward closing down surveillance under the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa if they hindered criminal cases 74 as one observer said law enforcement and intelligence dont fit law enforcement always wins75 some observers speculate that one reason law enforcement priorities prevail over those of intelligence is because convictions that can disrupt terrorist planning in advance of an attack often are based on lesser charges such as immigratio n violations fbi field personnel therefore may conclude that they should focus more effort on prosecuting criminal cases that result in longer jail terms 76 observers also suggest that because of the importance attached to successful criminal prosecutions to the extent intelligence is used it will be used to support criminal investigations rather than to learn more about potential counterterrorism targets77 72 see statement of richard thornburgh chairman academy panel on fbi reorganization national academy of public administration us congress house committee on appropriations subcommittee on

is too entrenched and resistant to change to be easily influenced by fbi headqua rters directives emphasizing the importance of intelligence in preventing terrorism they cite the gilmore commission which concluded the bureaus longstanding traditional organiza tional culture persuades us that even with the best of intentions the fbi cannot soon be made over into an organization dedicated to detecting and preventing attacks rather than one dedicated to punishing them 78

intelligence area has caused it to misunderstand the role intelligence can play in preventing terrorism and they question whether centralized decisionmaking can correct this deficiency specifically they contend the fbi does not understand how to collect intelligence about potential counterterrorism targets and properly analyze it instead skeptics argue that notwithstanding the fbis current efforts to develop detailed collection requirements fbi agents will likely continue to gather evidence to support criminal cases moreover skeptics argue the fbi will undoubtedly run faster and jump higher in gathering even more information at the urging of fbi headquarters to improve intelligence 79 missing however according to critics is the ability to implement successfully system in which intelligence is collected according to strategically determined set of collection requirements that specifically target operational clandestine activity these collection requirements in turn must be informed by strategic analysis that integrates broader understanding of terrorist threats and known and conceptually unknown gaps in the fbis intelligence base critic s fear that fbi analysts instead will continue to spend the bulk of their time providing tactical analytic support to fbi operational units pursuing cases rather than systematically and strategically analyzing allsource intelligence and fbi intelligence gaps g11g150g153g149g142g150g142g151g157g138g157g146g152g151g561g5g145g138g149g149g142g151g144g142g156g561 the fbi is likely to confront significant challenges in implementing its reforms its most fundamental challenge some assert will be to transform the fbis deeply entrenched law enforcement culture and its emphasis on criminal convictions into culture that emphasizes the importance that intelligence plays in counterterrorism and counterintelligence although observers believe that fbi director mueller is identifying and communicating his counterterrorism and intelligence priorities they caution that effective reform implementation will be the ultimate determinant of success the fbi they say must implement programs to recruit intelligence professionals with operational and analytical expertise develop formal career development paths including defined paths to promotion and continue to improve information management and technology these changes they say should be implemented in timely fashion as over two and half years have passed since the attacks of september 11 2001 they also contend the fbi must improve intelligence sharing within the fbi and with other ic agencies and with federal state and local agencies 78 see the gilmore commission fourth annual report to the president and congress pp 4344 79 interview with former senior fbi official

information technology in part contributed to the fbi being unable to correlate the knowledge possessed by its components prior to september 11 according to the congressional joint inquiry80 gao and the department of justice office of inspector general reports conclude that the fbi still lacks an enterprise architecture critical and necessary component they argue to successful it modernization81 in addition to lacking an enterprise architecture plan according to the gao the fbi has also not had sustained information technology leadership and management to demonstrate this point recent gao report found the fbi has had five chief information officers in the last 20032004 and the current cio is temporarily detailed to the fbi from the department of justice 82 one important manifestation of the fbis historical problems with information management is the deleterious effects it has had on analysis for numerous information technology reasons it has historically been difficult for fbi analysts at headquarters whose primary responsibility is to integrate intelligence from open sources fbi field offices and legal attaches and other entities of the us intelligence community to retrieve in timely manner intelligence which should be readily available to them among other factors this is the result of lack of appropriate information management and technology tools and to lesser extent the lack of uniform implementation of policies relating to information technology usage technology alone is not however panacea existing information technology tools must be uniformly used to be effective one fbi official responsible for intelligence analysis stated before the joint inquiry that information was some times not made available to fbi headquarters because field offices concerned about security or media leaks did not upload their investigative results or restricted access to specific cases this of course risks leaving the analysts not knowing what they did not know 83 as mentioned above supporters say that director mueller recognizes the important role technology must play in his reforms and that despite setbacks to the trilogy technology upgrade the director is making important progress84 however the third and arguably most important stage of the trilogy technology update the deployment of the aforementioned virtual case file system did not meet its december 2003 deadline moreover according to the department of justice office of inspector general as of january 2003 the fbi confirmed the inspector generals assessment that an additional 138 million over the

leadership is able and willing to support director muellers reforms critics argue that the lack of national security experience among the existing cadre of special agentsincharge sacs of the fbis field offices represents significant impediment to change according to one former senior fbi official over 90 percent of the sacs have very little national security experience 86 he suggested that lack of understanding and experience would result in continued field emphasis on law enforcement rather than an intelligence approach to terrorism cases supporters counter that director mueller has made it inalterably clear that his priorities are intelligence and terrorism prevention some sacs who have been uncomfortable with the new priorities have chosen to retire but critics also contend that it will require number of years of voluntary attrition before field leadership more attuned to the importance of intelligence is in place

another issue is whether the fbi is effectively implementing its reforms and has established appropriate benchmarks to measure progress critics assert that although the fbi developed various concepts of operations to improve its intelligence program in many cases it lacks specific implementation plans and benchmarks the department of justice inspector general has recommended that an implementation plan that includes budget along with time schedule detailing each step and identifying the responsible fbi official 87 be drafted for each concept of operations supporters say that the fbi recognizes the ne ed for specific implementation plans and is developing them they cite as an example the implementation plan for intelligence collection management almost half of which they estimate is in place88

priorities dollars and people are now flowing to the fbis most critical needs this trend is clearly reflected in the fbis requested resources for fy200492 according to former attorney general richard thornburgh who said in telligence analytic support particularly for counterterrorism has improved substantially93 as mentioned above the department of justice is requesting at least 76 million in support of intelligence and intelligencerelated programs for fy2005 supporters of the ongoing fbi intelligence reform describe dramatic increase in intelligence analysts both at headquarters and in the fieldfrom 159 in 2001 to 347 planned in 2003 and that an initial cadre of about dozen analysts is supporting ttic 94 moreover as mentioned above the fbi intends to hire 900 intelligence anal ysts in 2004 supporters also point to the daily presidential threat briefings the fbi drafts and 30 longerterm analyses and comprehensive national terrorist threat assessment that have been completed95 but even supporters caution that institutional change now underway at the fbi does not occur overnight and involves major cultural change96 they estimate that with careful planning the commitment of adequate resources and personnel and hard work the fbis transformation will be well along in three to five years though it will take longer to fully accomplish its goals 97 gao presents more mixed assessment according to gao the fbi has made substantial progress as evidenced by the development of both new strategic plan and strategic human capital plan as well as its realignment of staff to better address the new priorities notwithstanding this progress however the gao concluded an overall transformation plan is more valuable than cross walks between various strategic plans 98 gao also reports that 70 of the fbi agents and 29 of the 34 fbi an alysts who completed its questionnaire said the number of intelligence analysts was insufficient given the current workload and priorities99 as result many field agents said they have choice but to conduct their own intelligence analysis despite lack of analysts apparent before september 11 if not after the fbi did not establish 90 ibid p

trafficking and infrastructure protection additional intelligence analysts also were hired but they were viewed as poorly trained limited in experience and lacking in needed information technology

foreign intelligence tended to be ad hoc skeptics point to four hurdles that the fbi may have trouble surmounting first given that traditional intelligence tasking from the intellig ence community to the fbi has generally been vague and voluminous the fbi they say must be able to strike balance between directing its collectors to answer questions that are either too nebulous or too specific questions that are overly vague can go unanswered for lack of direction on the other hand collection requirements that are too specific risk reducing intelligence to formulaic science when most analysts would agree the intelligence discipline is more art than science in the final analysis while appropriately drafted intelligence collection requirements are an essential element in the intelligence cycle there is substitute for experienced intelligence professionals who are capable of successfully collecting intelligence in response to the requir ements second they say the fbi will need to dedicate appropriate resources to managing re quirements process that could easily overwhelm headquarters and field intelligence staff with overlapping and imprecise requests for intelligence collection third they say the fbi will have to significantly upgrade its cadre of strategic analysts who will play critical role in identifying intelligence gaps fourth they say the fbi will have to support its requirements process with incentives and disincentives for agent intelligence collectors so that requirements are fulfilled enhanced performance of the intelligence requirements process depends largely on the accumulated successes the fbi has in each of these areas incomplete or ineffective implementation in any one element of the cycle detracts from the overall systems effectiveness

skeptics of the adequacy of fbis reforms agree that collecting intelligence by penetrating terrorist cells is critical to disrupting and preventing terrorist acts supporters argue that the fbi has long and successful history of such penetrations when it comes to organized crime groups and suggest that it is capable of replicating its success against terrorist cells they assert that the fbi has had almost century of experience recruiting and managing undercover agents and informers and that it long ago mastered collection techniques such as electronic surveillance and witness interviews they also argue that the fbi can uniquely use both money and the threat of prosecution to induce cooperation in recruiting human source assets 105 they also cite as evidence of the fbis commitment to improving its human intelligence collection the organizations recent deployment of six teams to examine ways to expand the fbis human intelligence base and to provide additional oversight106 skeptics are not so certain they say recruiting organized crime penetrations differs dramatically from terrorist recruiting as one former senior level intelligence official put it its one thing to recruit tony soprano yet quite another to recruit an qaeda operative107 this official was alluding to the fact that terrorist groups may have different motivations and support networks than organized crime groups108 moreover terrorist groups may be less willing than organized crime 105 see statement of william p barr former attorney genera l of the united states before the house permanent select

they have not known for years and are not members of the same ethnocentric groups or whose bona fides are not directly supported by existing members of the group as alluded to above skeptics also argue that while the fbi is good at gathering information it has little experience collecting intelligence based on policy driven strategically determined set of collection requirements109 as one observer commented while the fbi correctly highlights its unmatched ability to gather evidence and with it information there is nonetheless national security imperative which distinguishes intelligence collection from similar but different function found in law enforcement gathering which is not driven and informed by specific focused national security needs is not the same as intelligence collection which means intelligence activities which are dictated by and coupled to policy driven strategically determined set of collection requirements 110 critics assert that the fbis criminal case approach to terrorism produces vacuum cleaner approach to intelligence collection the fbi they say continues to collect and disseminate interesting items from river of intelligence when instead it should focus collection on those areas where intelligence indicates the greatest potential threat 111 but critics contend that there are few evident signs that the fbi has adopted such an approach they are jumping higher faster but not collecting the intelligence they need according to one critic112 as result critics maintain the process turns on serendipity rather than on focused directed analytically driven requirements process another observer put it this way using the metaphor finding the needle in the haystack since september 11 government agencies have been basically adding more to the pile not finding needles finding the needles requires that we undertake more focused rigorous and thoughtful domestic intelligence collection and analysis not collect mountains of information on innocent civilians 113 skeptics also question whether the fbi is prepared to recruit the type of individual needed to effectively collect and analyze intelligence the fbis historic emphasis on law enforcement has encouraged and rewarded agents who gather as many facts as legally possible in their attempt make criminal case because successful case rests on rules of criminal procedure the fbi draws largely from the top talent in state and local law enforcement agencies and the military in short some say those individuals who focus on discrete facts rather than on the connections between them 114 109 interview with former senior fbi official aug 21 2003 110 see statement of john macgaffin iii before the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united

human intelligence is the implementation of formal asset vetting program to assess the validity and credibility of human sources according to informed observers who note that only three to four percent of the fbis human assets are vetted115 they point out the failure to effectively vet its human assets has contributed to serious problems in the fbis criminal and national foreign intelligence programs116 supporters contend that the fbi is currently implementing its national intelligence collections requirements concept of operations and so it may be premature to assess effectiveness critics contend however that it remains unclear what specific performance metrics the fbi is employing to measure the effectiveness of its collection they say that when asked to assess its performance in the war on terrorism the fbi continues to cite arrests and convictions of suspected terrorists117 they further contend that the fbi rarely cites the number of human sources recruited who have provided information essential to counterterrorism or counterintelligence as performance metric118

headquarters has evolved from disjointed group of less than qualified individuals into group of professionals which understands the role analysis plays in advancing national security investigations and operations the majority of intelligence analysts at headquarters possesses ad vanced degrees and has expert knowledge in various functional and geographic areas over the last two decades they also

development plans an increased flexibility to continue working in their areas of expertise or to rotate to other functional geographic or management positions improved midcareer training and improved and more standardized recruitment practices they assert that these efforts will improve retention rates chronic problem119 critics however remain largely unpersuaded and argue that analysis remains serious fbi vulnerability in the war on terrorism the congressional joint inquiry on september 11 urged the fbi among other steps to significantly improve strategic analytical capabilities by assuring qualification training and independence of analysts coupled with sufficient access to necessary information and resources 120 although they applaud the fbis new focus on analysis critics question its effectiveness and point to number of trends for example they cite the continuing paucity of analysts in the fbis senior national security ranks even more than two years after the september 11 attacks this they say reflects the fbis continuing failure to treat analysis as priority and more fundamentally to understand how to leverage analysis in the war on terror 121 they also point to the fbis own internal study that found 66 percent of its analytic corps unqualified and question whether the fbis changes are sufficiently broad to address this legacy problem122 critics support the new gs15 promotion plan but contend that implementation is lacking and that it falls short of senior executive service promotion which they advocate123 according to an fbi official there are currently fbi intelligence analysts at the nonmanagerial gs15 grade level they also are concerned that the fbi has eliminated the requirement that all new intelligence analysts possess minimum of bachelors degree and substituted instead less rigorous requirement in their view of one year of analytic experience or military or law enforcement employment they insist that bachelors degree provides more formal and necessary academic training in research methodologies written and oral communication and critical thinking moreover according to some critics the collapsing of all functional and cross disciplinary analysts into one intelligence analyst position encourages one size fits all approach to analysis that may undermine need for functional geographic and targetspecific expertise 124 119 the fbi has never experienced problems in recruiting educated analysts at least at fbi headquarters the fbi however has from suffered retention problem 120 see the jic inquiry recommendations section errata p 7 121 see daniel benjamin and steven simon the age of sacred terror p 298 random house 122 see the jic inquiry p 340 123 other ic agencies permit analysts to rise to the analytical equivalent of senior executive service or senior intelligence service one such program the senior analytic service sas was established at the cia in the late 1990s by cia deputy director john mclaughlin the sas track allows analysts to rise to the seniormost analytic level without assuming managerial responsibilities 124 this approach is manifested in recent intelligence analyst job announcement 04fo0515 while the fbi used to recruit intelligence analysts according to the functional or geographic area of need it now asks potential candidates to identify one of four areas of interest choosing from counterintelligence counterterrorism criminal or cyber according to the announcement applicants must identi fy the program area or interest however this does not guarantee placement in the particular program see httpswwwfbijobscom jobdescaspsrc001requisitionid1614r021811042620

trying to strengthen strategic analysis it is failing to commit adequate resources the new office of intelligence has strategic intelligence unit but more in name only according to some observers few analysts have been assigned to the unit and those who have are being forced to balance management and executive briefing responsibilities with actually conducting strategic analysis further complicating the situation is the fact that tactical and strategic analysts still physically located in each of the fbis operational divisions are now matrixed to the office of intelligence that is they report both to their own divisions and to the office of intelligence therefore they potentially confront competing prioritiesanalysis largely composed of briefing materials to support fbi executives and tactical analyses to support ongoing cases 125

the fbi continues to be criticized for not sharin g informationa failure that variously has been blamed on variety of shortcomings including culture an absence of information sharing strategy technological problems and legal and policy constraints some of the legal and policy constraints were eliminated by the usa pa triot act126 and more recently by decision to allow criminal and intelligence investigators to work side by side127 fbi supporters give the fbi high marks since the september 11th attacks for sharing threat information building information bridges to the intelligence agencies and state and local law enforcement collaborating with foreign law enforcement components and opening itself up to external reviewers128 but even supporters believe that maintaining this commendable record will be continuing management challenge one which will require constant reinforcement129 they emphasize that the traditional values of fbi agents as independent and determined must give way to include values of information sharing and cooperation 130 sharing within fbi some improvements supporters argue that perhaps the most significant changea sea change according to someis recent decision to tear down the organizational wall that has separated criminal and intelligence investigations since the spying scandals of the 1960s131 as result criminal and intelligence investigators will now physically work as part of the same squads on terrorism investigations all counterterrorism cases will be handled from the outset like intelligence or espionage investigations allowing investigators to more easily use secret warrants and other methods that are overseen by the surveillance court and are unavailable in traditional criminal probes the fbi was able to do so as result of the usa patriot act 125 although these types of analyses are not mutually exclusive they serve two different sets of consumersthe executive who is supporting policymakers

information to be more easily shared within the fbi132 supporters blame congress for creating the wall in the first place they assert that in the wake of the 1960s spy scandals congress weakened the fbis domestic intelligence capabilities by imposing stricter standards the result they argue was dangerous lack of intelligence sharing133 according to the fbi the recent change has resulted in the disruption of at least four terrorist attacks overseas and the uncovering of terrorist sleeper cell in the united states134 although these changes undoubtedly will improve intelligence sharing between fbis criminal and intelligence components the question remains whether the information will be shared with other agencies and state and local law official s some critics do not dispute that director muellers decision will enhance intelligence sharin g within the fbi they agree it will rather they are concerned that more innocent peop will become the targets of clandestine surveillance135 supporters say sharing internally and with othe r agencies is improving for additional reasons advocates assert intelligence sharing both internally and with other agencies is improving for other reasonsthe fbi is better tr aining its personnel and providing them with improved sharing processes in addition they point to the fbis new concept of operations for intelligence dissemination that collapses number of current and different production processes into single one that will be imbedded throughout the fbi 136 supporters also point favorably to director muellers decision to establish the position of reports officers whose responsibility will be to extract pertinent intelligence from fbi collection and analysis and disseminate it to the widest extent possible supporters who believe that sharing with state and local authorities has improved point out that since september 11 the number of joint terrorism task forces which are the principal link between the intelligence community and state and local law enforcement officials has increased from 66 in 2001 to 84 in 2003 the number of state and local participants has more than quadrupled from 534 to over 2300 according to the fbi supporters also finally embrace director mueller for correctly emphasizing technology that emphasizes horizontal rather than vertical flow of information to produce better results director mueller asserts that our move to change the tec hnology in the next two or three years will have dramatic impact on the way we do businesseliminating lot of the bureaucratic hangups giving the agents the tools they need to be interactive pass among themselves the best ways of doing things and we will free up the fbi in substantial number of ways 137 critics still point to number of troubling signs on sharing the fbi concedes that although it has always been great collector of information its sharing of information was primarily 132 ibid 133 see statement of william p barr former united states

activity138 critics point to number of troubling signs that they claim indicate c ontinuing problems according to the gilmore commission the federal government is far from perfecting system of sharing national security intelligence and other information moreover the flow of information remains largely one way from the local and state levels to the fbi the prevailing view according to the commission continues to be that the federal government likes to receive information but is reluctant to share it completely one local law enforcement official said the fbis intelligence sharing practices remain essentially unchanged since september 11 this official suggested that the fbi shares great volume of threat information but little of real value that would help state and local officials prevent terrorist attacks 139 another state office said we dont get anything of value from the fbi140 some skeptics argue that technology problems notwithstanding willingness to share intelligence both within the fbi and with other intelligence community agencies remains continuing problem according to recent report issued by the markle foundation there has been only marginal improvement in the past year in the sharing of terroristrelated information between relevant agencies including the fbi the report states that sharing remains haphazard and still overly dependent on the ad hoc network of personal relations among known colleagues it is not the result of carefully considered network architec ture that optimizes the abilities of all of the players according to the report141 the markle report argues that the existing system of counterterrorism information sharing remains too centralized federal governmentcentric and bound by increasingly tenuous distinctions in us regulations and law regarding domestic and foreign intelligence142 in order to combat decentralized terrorist threat more effectively markle recommends model of information sharing which runs counter to the existing hub and spoke information sharing model the fbi is building advocates envision decentralized peertopeer network in which the various federal state local and private sector entities systematically collecting information relevant to counterterrorism and according to established guidelines protecting civil liberties and privacy share that information directly with one another 143 the department of justices office of inspector general recently reported that despite progress in terrorism information sharing the fbi faces considerable impediments in establishing an effective information and intelligence sharing program including changes to information technology constraints ongoing analytical weak nesses agency origination control procedures144 138 see statement of assistant director

the appropriate processes to be used to share information and intelligence either internally or externally145 some state and local officials also remain dissatisfied with level of sharing some state and local law enforcement officials continue to criticize what they characterize as fbis continuing unwillingness to share intelligence while expecting state and local law officials to share their information with them nevertheless some state and local law enforcement officials concede that there has been some improvement in the sharing relationship since september 11 and there also is growing recognition among some state and local law enforcement officials that there may be misperception that the fbi has more detailed accurate or confirmed information than it actually has 146 while acknowledging some improvement these of ficials insist the exchange of information remains largely oneway147 and although that hasnt prevented them from participating in their local jttfs one official said he believed that the fbi did not consider him an intelligence consumer148 according to another the fbi has shared information through the jttf but made clear it was doing so because he has right to know but not need to know and that the fbi told him not to share the information with anyone else in law enforcement or state government including the governor who he said possesses top secret clearance149 some state and local law enforcement officials complain that although jttfs are intended to be joint enterprises combining federal state and cal law enforcement resources they characterize the relationship as more of one of cohabitation where the fbi clearly is in charge and non federal representatives are viewed as second tier participants despite often having greater knowledge of particular case150 continued another agency it must first request orcon release from the originating agency to share the information with specific third party consumer in terms of providing security clearances to state and local law enforcement officials with need to know the fbi has established streamlined security process that allows law enforcement officials to receive

so often mentioned as challenges for the fbi as it shifts to having more preventative bias state and local law enforcement officials stated that notwithstanding recognition by fbi leadership that the intelligence is in the case the fbi agent on the street still starts with case and has bias in the direction of law enforcement moreover one senior state law enforcem ent official stated that fbi leadership is still being led by individuals who have criminal law mindset151 some states have suggested alternate sharing procedures some state and local law enforcement officials are sufficiently displeased with the current sharing relationship that they have proposed that the department of homeland security establish regional intelligence centers through which classified raw and finished foreign intelligence on terrorism could be disseminated 152 the centers would be staffed by cadre of top secretcleared personnel drawn principally from state police and state dhs offi ces and would

intelligence oversight committees in the 1970s the catalyst for the creation of these committees was public revelations resulting from press coverage and congressional investigations that the intelligence community had conducted covert assassination attempts against foreign leaders and collected information concerning the political activities of some us citizens during the late 1960s and early 1970s 156intelligence committee members are selected by the majority and minority leadership of each chamber of congress and serve terms of eight years on the senate select committee on intelligence and six years on the house permanent select committee on intelligence terms limited were established so that greater number of members could become knowledgeable on intelligence matters over time membership rotation was also viewed as the best way to maintain flow of new ideas committee membership was also structured so that members serving on other committees with interests in intelligence issuesthe appropriations armed services judiciary and committee on foreign relations senate and committee on international relations housewould be represented finally in the senate the majority was given one vote rather than proportional margin to ensure bipartisanship the house apportions its membership using the traditional proportional method one oversight issue is whether the current congressional structure is sufficiently focused to monitor effectively the fbis intelligence reforms in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks the fbi has been criticized for failing to more effectively collect analyze and disseminate intelligence the congressional committees principally responsible for conducting fbi oversightthe intelligence judiciary and appropriations committeeson the other hand have been subject to little or criticism157 some critics argue that those responsible for conducting oversight should be held accountable as well they have questioned the diligence of the committees and in the case of the intelligence committees the committees structure158 ellen laipson former director of the national intelligence council 19972002 suggests while the balance between intelligence collection and analysis is unlikely to be corrected soon what are needed are more radical steps to dism antle the bloated bureaucratic behavior of the large agencies and retool most employees to contribute more directly to the intelligence mission the fault lies both with congress and with the intelligence communitys bureaucrats this is not an argument for less collection but perhaps less collection management less complicated requirements process and more priority given to workforce whose productivity is measured in terms of output of more useful processing of data and creation of more analytic product it seems that even the best intentioned intelligence community leaders cannot effect this change one serious push by the oversight process and the senior customers must take place 159 156 see appendix c for additional information 157 at the beginning of the 108th congress the house select committee on homeland security was established along with the

times has been miserable ive been here 33 years and i have seen times when congress exercised adequate oversight with respect to the fbi and ive seen times when i thought congress actions in that regard were miserable i can recall times when members of the committee seemed to be more interested in getting the autographs of the fbi director than they were in doing their job asking tough questions and i dont think the agency was served by that any more than the country was and i hope that over the next 20 years well see much more consistent and aggressive oversight of the agency because your agency does have immense power 161 some observers agree and have singled out the oversight exercised by the two congressional intelligence committees for particular criticism according to loch johnson former congressional staff member and intelligence specialist at the university of georgia they the intelligence committees didnt press hard enough with regard to 911 theres all the authority they need they didnt press hard enough for change another observer commented they should be held as accountable as the intelligence agencies 162 some members of congress however contend that the congressional committees have their limits our job is to see that the agencies are focused on the right problems as we think them to be and they have the capabilities to meet those mission requirements former senate intelligence committee chairman bob graham is reported to have said 163 one of grahams predecessors seems to agree we can legislate but there is little we can do to compel compliance according to press account of former chairman senator richard shelby who said the committees face an unacceptable choice from security standpoint when it comes to fencing spending in an effort to force change 164 as you examine the record you will discover numerous examples of complete disregard for congressional direction not to mention the law shelby is reported to have said but as

intelligence committee service be eliminated critics of the term limits argue that members often are just beginning to grasp the complexities of the intelligence community by the time their term ends i was at peak of my knowledge and ability to carry out effective oversight graham who already had received two year extension of his eightyear term when he had to leave the committee at the end of the 107th congress in 2002 is quoted as saying166 critics also argue that term limits although seen as wellintentioned efforts to prevent to members from becoming coopted by the intelligence community have outlived whatever usefulness they may have had the community they assert has become technically so complex that effective oversight requires members who are knowledgeable and wellversed in its intricacies term limits work against that goal by robbing the committee of institutional memory knowledge and expertise that outcome can only be avoided if members are permitted to serve on an openended basis of all congressional committees only the intelligence committees are term limited supporters of term limits argue that the eightyear cap still effectively prevents members of congress from becoming too close to the intelligence communityincluding the fbi and this remains an important objective given the sensitive role the intelligence community plays in democracy term limits supporters argue also provide exposure to the arcane world of intelligence to greater number of members finally they argue by ensuring stream of new members with relatively little experience in inte lligence term limits bring more new ideas to the table

some observers argue that congress could more effectively oversee the fbis intelligence operation if the joint jurisdiction now exercised by the intelligence and judiciary committees was eliminated and the sole responsibility given to the intelligence committees they concede however that such an outcome could result only if standalone collection and analysis entity was separate and became independent from the fbi effectively removing the rationale for judiciary committee oversight in recommending ch an outcome they at least imply that the intelligence committees would bring more focused oversight expertise to judging the effectiveness of domestic intelligence analysis collection and dissemination they further suggest that putting the intelligence committees in char ge would provide an even better mechanism for protecting civil liberties than do current structure and processes 167 however opponents of consolidation argue that the intelligence committees are illquipped to focus on questions of civil liberties in connection with domestic intelligence agency they also could argue that the sensitivity of such issues re quires the transparency that comes with regular

options on fb i reform centers on two fundamentally opposing views on how best to prevent terrorist acts and other clandestine foreign intelligence activities directed against the united state before they occur adherents to one school of thought believe there are important synergies to be gained from keeping intelligence and law enforcement functions combined as they are currently under the fbi they argue that the two disciplines share the goal of terrorism prevention that prevention within the us will invariably require law enforcement to arrest and prosecute alleged terrorists and that the decentralized nature of terrorist cells is analogous to that of organized crime168 second school of thought counters that the chasm between the exigencies of the two disciplines both cultural and practical is simply too broad to effectively bridge and therefore that the two should be bureaucratically separated these two opposing views raise several options for congress including the following option 1 support director muellers reform package option 2 create semiautonomous national security intelligence service within the fbi option 3 establish separate domestic intelligence agency within the department of homeland security option 4 establish separate domestic intelligence agency under the authority of the dci but subject to oversight of the attorney general option 5 create an entirely new standalone domestic intelligence service g17g153g157g146g152g151g561g343g497g561g21g157g138g157g158g156g561g19g158g152g561 under this option congress would continue to s upport director muellers reforms with necessary funding proponents of this could argue that dire ctor muellers reforms constitute the most effective way to address weaknesses and improve the fbis intelligence program and ultimately to prevent terrorism in the us they could also argue that the reforms accomplish three important and interrelated goals first the fbi w ould continue to benefit from the synergies that integrated intelligencelaw enforcement provid in the war on terror second by keeping the intelligence program within the fbi and under the wa tchful eye of the department of justice the attorney general would be better able to reassure the american people that the fbis use of intelligence will not be allowed to infringe on their civil liberties third the reforms would improve the fbis intelligence capabilities while minimizing the bureaucratic disruption confusion and resource constraints that would result if the fbis intelligence program were re established in new standalone entity separate from the fbi more specifically they could maintain that director muellers changes are improving daytoday collection analysis and dissemination of intelligence 168 for treatment of the

necessary but insufficient while applauding director muellers new focus on the intelligence some could contend that his reforms are too limited and that intelligence still and always will be undermined by its arguably second class status in an fbi that has long been proud of its law enforcement culture they could cite past instances when additional resources were provided to the fbis intelligence program only later to be siphoned off to support criminal priorities or they could also go further arguing that the disciplines of intelligence and law enforcement are so different that they must be separated and the fbis intelligence program housed in and directed by new agency

g160g146g157g145g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g8g4g11g561 under this option congress could establish semiautonomous national security intelligence service nsis within the fbi and provide it with sufficient staff and protected resources the service would have its own budget to ensure sustainable resources the services principal responsibility would be to develop and nurture an integrated intelligence program and to establish welldefined career paths for special agents and analysts that would hold out realistic promise of advancement to the highest levels of the fbi and the intelligence community169 current fbi employees who decide to join the service could be protected from mandatory transfers to the fbis criminal programs the service director experienced in allsource domestic and foreign intelligence would be presidentially appointed and senateconfirmed regional service squads could be established to focus intelligence resources in the field there are multiple ways such an organization could be structured one such construct however would pull all investigative operational and analyticalheadquarters and field of the fbis international terrorism foreign counterintelligence jttf and security countermeasures resources into the nsis while the nsis director would report to the fbi director and the attorney general and operate under the attorney general guidelines the nsis director would also be tasked to ensure seamless coordination with the director of central intelligence on issues for which the distinction between foreign and domestic intelligence are increasingly blurred such as terrorism analysts within the nsis would have access to all the fbis intelligence relevant to national security including criminal intelligence moreover formal analytical working groups could be established to ensure analytical integration across counterterrorism counterintelligence and criminal programs finally field intelligence groups could be fewer in number to ensure focus and deployment of experienced human resources and could report to both the nsis deputy director and local special agent in charge in its july 2004 final report the 911 commission recommended leaving counterterrorism intelligence collection with the fbi and creating an integrated national security workforce within the bureau 170 the commission recommended further that such workforce should consist of special agents analysts linguists and surveillance specialists who would be recruited trained rewarded and retained to ensure the development of an institutional

recommendations made by the commission see appendix h proponents could argue this option would enhance the fbis focus on intelligence without building any walls between the various types of intelligence the fbi collects analyzes and exploits they could contend that the fbi could build more effectively leveraged intelligence program on the foundation that the director is currently putting in place and that it could do so without severing the connection with law enforcement and the fbis 56 field offices and 46 legal attaches 171 serving in us embassies such an approach would also ease efforts to establish intelligence career paths and strengthen the role of intelligence some proponents of service within service also argue that it may serve as an interim or bridge solution to the eventual creation of an autonomous domestic intelligence agency see option 5 creation of new domestic security intelligence service below 172 opponents could argue that this option is still too limited and that intelligence and law enforcement should be separated they could also contend such an effort could be bureaucratically confusing as the new service seeks to build its independence while the fbi continues to exert control opponents could also argue that this option would disrupt director muellers current reforms at the very time they are taking hold

third option could be to establish separate domestic intelligence service and house it in the department of homeland security173 the service would be member of the intelligence community and its authorities would be limited to collecting and analyzing foreign intelligence inside the united states including the plans inte ntions and capabilities of international terrorist groups operating in the us as envisioned the agency like great britains mi5174 would not have arrest authority proponents of this option could argue that folding the new entity into dhs as opposed to creating new standalone agency would av oid creating more bureaucracy while also establishing an organization unencumbered by the fbis law enforcement culture they could argue that such an entity would be able to more sharply focus on intelligence while also better safeguarding the rights of citizens provided new checks on its ability to collect intelligence against innocent people were put in place opponents could counter that placing the new organization in dhs would undermine its ability to play the role of an honest broker that could produce intelligence products not only for dhs but 171 fbi legal attaches serve in overseas posts and are declared to the host country legal attaches serve as the fbis link to foreign law enforcement and security services while legal attaches conduct overt liaison

authorities they could also argue that placing the new entity within dhs would force it to compete with other dhs offices for scarce resources175 they also could oppose the idea for the same reason they might oppose new entity separate from the fbithat the essential synergistic relationship between intelligence and law enforcement would be severed finally opponents could argue that establishing separate agency is tantamount to creating an mi5like agency which may be unworkable in the us context for political cultural and legal reasons despite any efforts to mold it to conform to american experience 176

the director central intelligence either as separate entity reporting directly to the dci in that capacity177 or incorporated into the cia the attorn ey general would retain the authority to establish and enforce rules to assure that the rights of americans would be preserved supporters of this option could contend that providing the dci additional operational capability would improve the integration of analysis and collection and would ensure that security rather than criminal concerns would be emphasized178 opponents could argue that legal policy perception and cultural concerns militate against expanding dci control over domestic intelligence collection and analysis they could assert that there is risk that the ic could misuse information it collected on american citizens 179 they could also argue that as practical matter if decision was made to incorporate this entity into the cia it like the fbi simply may not up to the task of reorienting its efforts quickly enough to take on this added responsibility180

fifth option could be to create an entirely new agency within the icbut one which is independent of the fbi cia and dhs the new agency would fuse all intelligencefrom all sources domestic and

collection units which would be authorized to collect domestic intelligence on inte rnational terrorism threats within the united states the new organization would be prohibited from collecting intelligence unrelated to international terrorism counterterrorism intellig ence collection outside the united states would continue to fall under the purview of the cia nsa and other foreign ic components182 it also would lack arrest authorities but would provide actionable intelligence to those entities such as the fbi with authority to take action the new entity would have authority to task the ic for collection it would be overseen by policy and steering committee comprised of the new agencys director the dci the attorney general and the dhs secretary the steering committee would ensure that the new entity adheres to all relevant constitutional statutory regulatory and policy requirements proponents of this option could argue that because of its law enforcement culture the fbi is incapable of transforming itself into an agency capable of preventing terrorist attacks 183 and even if it could proponents could argue that failing to separate intelligence collection from law enforcement could give rise to the fear that the us was establishing secret police184 proponents also could assert that the federal government artificially distinguishes between foreign and domestic terrorist threats when those distinctions increasingly are blurred and they could contend given the historical record that the fbi and cia are incapable of changing direction quickly enough to work together effectively to bridge that divide185 in its july 2004 final report for variety of reasons the 911 commission rejected the option of creating new domestic intelligence agency like great britains mi5 these reasons included the following the fbi is well positioned within the department of justice to carry out sensitive domestic intelligence operations in comp liance with the law while maintaining civil liberties and constitutional norms the creation of new domestic intelligence agency would divert attention from and disrupt ongoing counterterrorism efforts at time when the threat remains high the creation of new domestic intelligence agency would require allocating scarce resources in terms of both infrastructure and personnel which are already committed to ongoing investigations the creation of new domestic intelligence agency would require the new agency to establish close working relationships with state and local law enforcement the us intelligence community and foreign intelligence and law enforcement agencies counterterrorism as well as foreign intelligence investigations often evolve into criminal investigationsthe fbi currently enjoys the fullrange of investigative authorities to handle such matters and 182 ibid p 44 183 ibid pp 4344 184 ibid p 44 185 ibid p 41

of other criminal investigations such as money laundering or contraband smuggling186 opponents could also contend that establishing another agency will simply create more bureaucracy they could argue that it would take years for new organization to be fully staffed and become effective in the fight against terrorism and that pushing for better ciafbi cooperation is more practical approach187 they also could argue that establishing separate domestic intelligence service like mi5 is impractical in the us context188 and would move the country in the wrong direction by creating more stovepiped bureaucracy that would undermine the countrys ability to wage an integrated war on terrorism189 and they could argue that the fbi has never been solely law enforcement agency but rather an investigative and domestic security agency that is well prepared to collect and analyze intelligence and they could cite the fbis successes against organized crime as proof190 opponents could also counter that the fbi in the pa st has effectively collected intelligence but that its ability to do so over time has been eroded former us attorney general barr and others argue that historically the fbi has been effectiv in the collection of domestic intelligence but that it was undermined by policymakers such as congress and the courts through the placement of legal constraints on the fbi over the past 30 years191 finally opponents could argue that britains mi5 has mixed record of effectiveness192 g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 congressional policymakers face fbi intelligence reform options in dynamic context the fbi has made or is in the process of making substantial organizational business process and resource allocation changes to enhance its ability to deter detect

threats he further argues that more than any other kind of threat there is an interrelationship between law enforcement and intelligence in dealing with the problem of terrorismwe need investigative capability and intelligence collection capability as well as those who go through the bits and pieces and fill in the dots 189 see statement of william p barr former united states attorney general in

intelligence from the fbi and creating new domestic spy agency akin to britains mi5 i think this is preposterous and goes in exactly the wrong direction artif icial stovepiping hurts our counterterrorism efforts what we need to do now is meld intelligence and law enforcement more closely together not tear them apart we already have too many agencies and creating still another simply adds more bureaucracy spawns intractable and debilitating turf wars and creates further barriers to the kind of seamless integration that is needed in this area 191 ibid p 14 192 see center for

national securityrelated cases enhanced intelligence training for agents and analysts increased recruitment of intelligence analysts and the development of formal and integrated intelligence cycle are all appropriate and achievable other experts are more critical of the current intelligence reforms believing that the culture of the fbi including its law enforcementor iented approach to intelligence may prove to be an insurmountable obstacle to necessary inte lligence reforms some argue that the pace and scope of reform may be too slow and not radical enough one of the central points of distinction betw een supporters and critics of the current fbi intelligence reforms is the extent to which they believe that the two disciplines of law enforcement and intelligence are synergistic that is that the commonalities among them would benefit from continued integration in general those believing that law enforcement and intelligence should be integrated argue for the status quo however other experts believe that given the conceptual and operational differences between law enforcement and intelligence the national interest would be best served by having them located in separate organizations with systematic and formal mechanisms in place to share information and protect civil liberties should the congress choose to influence the direction andor outcome of the fbis intelligence reform numerous options from support of the status quo to the establishment of an autonomous domestic security intelligence service are available for consideration

cispes who the fbi believed violated the foreign agent registration act205 although congressional investigators concluded that the fbis investigation did not reflect significant fbi political or ideological bias its activities resulted in the investigation of domestic political activities protected by the first amendment that should not have come under governmental scrutiny 206

fbi abuses the department of justice imposed domestic intelligence collection standards on the ic including the fbi for example in 1976 attorney general edward h levi issued specific guidelines governing fbi domestic security investigations congress also established house and senate intelligence oversight committees to monitor the ic and president carter signed into law the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 which established legal procedures and standards governing the use of electronic surveillance within the us critics argue that until congress approved the usa patriot act granting the fbi additional authority to investigate suspected terrorists increased oversight and overregulation had seriously weakened the fbis intelligence capabilities some thought that not only had regulations curtailed the fbis surveillance authorities but that they had undermined the risktaking culture thought to be essential to successful intelligence work 207 the levi guidelines208 were singled out as being particularly onerous209 some observers blamed the restrictions for discouraging domestic intelligence collection unless the fbi could clearly show that its collection was ed to specific alleged crime they also said the restrictions led the fbi to transfer responsibility for parts of its counterterrorism program from the fbis former intelligence division

categorize each of its investigations each case receives an alphanumeric indicator signifying the target country or issue and the level of priority some observers have criticized this approach as reactive case is opened only after crime has been committed traditionally ex post investigation is the fbis greatest investigative strength it can deploy thousands of agents as it did after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 to track domestic and international leads conduct witness interviews and develop story board about how the act and the events surrounding it took place although well suited for assembling criminal case this operational approach is illsuited for terrorism prevention while the fbi reacts to crimes after the fact it adopts proactive approach in some counterintelligence cases for example fbi c ounterintelligence agents working with their ic counterparts may open case to recruit human asset usually foreign national who may have access to information which would fulfill an existing intelligence gap the fbi says it is attempting to adopt proactive approach to counterterrorism fbi director mueller says that the new usa patriot act has helped according to fbi director mueller the fbi can now move from thinking about intelligence as case to finding intelligence in the case 211 while the reactive opening criminal case such as those against cigarette smugglers may yield intelligence relevant to counterterrorism it is generally serendipitous occurrence extracting preventative and predictive intelligence from case arguably presupposes first that the case was opened proactively and not necessarily in response to some adverse event second in order to extract intelligence from any case welltrained and experienced reports officers and intelligence analysts must be integrated into the flow of intelligence resulting from investigations and be able to sift the signal from the noise in the sea of raw intelligence to which they have access according to one local law enforcement official the fbi is unable to strip the intelligence from their own cases much less share that inte lligence with state and local law enforcement officials 212 finally for the fbi to succeed in using this new approach it will likely have to implement successfully all the complex and interr elated elements of the intelligence cycle

first twice beforein 1998 and then again in 1999the fbi embarked on almost identical efforts to establish intelligence as priority and to strengthen its intelligence program both attempts are considered by some to have been failures213 both previous attempts were driven by concerns that fbis intelligence effectiveness was being undercut by the fbis historically fragmented in telligence program the fbis three operational divisions at the timecriminal counterterrorism and counterintelligenceeach controlled its own intelligence program214 as result the fbi had trouble integrating its intelligence effort horizontally between its divisions in intelligence world parlance the programs were stove piped in 1998 the fbi attempted to address the stove pipe problem by consolidating control over intelligence under the authority of newly established office of intelligence it also took steps to improve the quality of its intelligence analysis particularly in the criminal area which was viewed as particularly weak dissatisfied with the results the fbi launched second round of reforms the following year aimed at more thoroughly integrating fbi intelligence analysis in support of investigations new investigative services division isd was established to replace the office of intelligence and to house in one location all fbi analysts that until then had been owned by fbis operational divisions although the isd was intended to provide each of the divisions onestop shopping for their intelligence needs it was never accepted by the operational divisions which wanted to control their own intelligence analysis programs in the wake of september 11 the fbi concluded that analysts would be more effective if they were controlled by the operational divisions isd was abolished and analysts were dispersed back to the divisions in which they originally served although observers blame the failure of both prior reform efforts on several complex factors they put the fbis deeplyingrained law enforcement mentality at the top of the list as one observer described it efforts to integrate intelligence at the fbi were substantially hampered because resources dedicated to intelligence were gradually siphoned back to the fbis traditional counter crime programs moreover there was also little sustained senior level support for an intelligence function that was integrated with the intelligence community 215 213 interview with former senior fbi official oct 2 2003 214 fourth divisioncyber crimewas established in apr 2002 until the appointment of the eadi it

national foreign intelligence program responsibilities are counterterrorism and counterintelligence some observers of fbi intelligence reform have suggested that these two disciplines be integrated but not necessarily under the control of the fbi217 numerous interviewees indicated their belief that of the fbis nfip responsibilities the counterintelligence program was most closely integrated into the intelligence community historically the fbi has shifted its organization to counter both terrorist and clandestine foreign intelligence activity directed against the united st ates although the fbi in the past has integrated both missions as part of the same division currently the fbi has separate counterterrorism and counterintelligence divisions the assistant directors for each division report to an executive assistant director having responsibility for both functions in debate that mirrors the ongoing discussion about the appropriate relationship between law enforcement and intelligence some observers believe counterterrorism and counterintelligence should be reintegrated 218 they make the following arguments commonality of adversary methods of operation matter whether the threat the united states is confronting is that of loosely affiliated foreign terrorist group or centrally controlled foreign intelligence service the method of operation is consistenta covertly organized set of activities designed to undermine us national security as such the countermeasures are similar primarily the penetration and surveillance of the inimical activity up to and until the point at which action may be taken against the united states linkages between foreign intelligence services and terrorist groups some argue that there are linkages between foreign intelligence services and terrorist groups 219 information documenting these links should they exist are likely to be classified supporters of the status quo argue the following similar disciplinesdifferent time lines and pressures while the damage that can result from successful espionage operation directed against the united states by foreign power can be just as damaging to national security as the terrorist attacks of september 11 counterintelligence moves at different pace than counterterrorism building counterespionage cases can sometimes consume months if not years of monitoring actions of those suspected of passing national defense information to an unauthorized third party or committing economic espionage in the case of potential terrorist act there is pressure to collect actionable intelligence and to act quickly to prevent terrorists from striking 216 according to executive order 12333 counterintelligence includes international terrorist activities see appendix 217 see spying

counterintelligence of the fbis two principal national foreign intelligence program priorities the counterintelligence program arguably has been accorded lower priority in the wake of the cold war counterterrorism has become the fbis first priority reintegrating the two could lead to situations in which particularly from an fbi human resources perspective counterintelligence personnel serve as reserve pool of educated labor for counterterrorism such an occurrence may result in diminished strategic focus on counterintelligence function which requires longterm outlook and commitment the law enforcement nexus with count erterrorism and counterintelligence given the decentralized nature of the terrorist threat and criminal activities engaged in to provide financial support for such activities there is close relationship between the fbis criminal programs and its counterterrorism program while there is also nexus between the fbis counterintelligence activities and its criminal programs arguably given that very few counterintelligence cases ever go to trial for espionage or economic espionage prosecution the nexus is weaker

application includes certification by an appropriate national security official that significant purpose of the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information224 among the other criteria which must be met for an application for electronic surveillance to be approved under fisa court must find that the surveillance is not conducted solely upon the basis of activities protected by the first amendment to the constitution225 moreover the intelligence authorization act of fy2004 authorized the enhanced use of administrative subpoe nas also known as national security letters by the fbi in order to gather information from financial institutions226 the usa pa triot act has had substantial impact on fbi intelligence gathering and sharing for example foreign intelligence surveillance act authorizations for electronic surveillance increased 213 during the twoyear period 2000 to 2002227 according to fbi director mueller the act has been extraordinarily beneficial in the war on terrorism our success in preventing another catastrophic attack on the us homeland would have been much more difficult if not impossible without the act228 the usa pa triot act also has provided legal framework that makes it easier for the fbis four investigativeoperational divisionscriminal counterterrorism counterintelligence and cyberto integrate their intelligence efforts as result the fbi has adopted new strategy known as the model counterterrorism investigations strategy which permits the fbi to treat counterterrorism cases as intelligence cases from the outset making it easie r to initiate electronic surveillance special agent john pistole fbi executive assistant director for counterterrorism and counterintelligence stated were still interested in the criminal violations that many people may be involved in but in many cases we are going to put that in the back seat and go down the road until we have all that we need 229 if implemented and institutionalized the new policy may significantly enhance the effectiveness of the fbis intelligence program the question becomes whether the fbi can implement the policy and stay within constitutional limits some civil libertarian advocates say they are concerned that by making it easier for the fbi to employ surveillance under fisa the usa pa triot act might lead the fbi to use such fisa 224 the requirement and standard was changed from the purpose to significant purpose section 218 of the usa patriot act of 2001 pl 10756 codified at 50 usc 1804a7b 225 50 usc 1805a3a see numerous references to this standard in usa

at the fbi those recommendations231 include the following the president by executive order or directive should direct the fbi to develop this intelligence cadre recognizing that crossfertilization between the criminal justice and national security disciplines is vital to the success of both missions all new agents should receive basic training in both areas furthermore new agents should begin their careers with meaningful assignments in both areas agents and analysts should then specialize in one of these disciplines and have the option to work such matters for their entire career with the bureau certain advanced training courses and assignments to other intelligence agencies should be required to advance within the national security discipline in the interest of crossfertilization all senior fbi managers including those working on law enforcement matters should be certified intelligence officers the fbi should fully implement recruiting hiring and selection process for agents and analysts that enhances its ability to target and attract individuals with educational and professional backgrounds in intelligence international relations language technology and other relevant skills the fbi should institute the integration of analysts agents linguists and surveillance personnel in the field so that dedicated team approach is brought to bear on national security intelligence operations each field office should have an official at the field offices deputy level for national security matters this individual would have management oversight and ensure that the national priorities are carried out in the field the fbi should align its budget structure according to its four main programs intelligence counterterrorism and counterintelligence criminal and criminal justice servicesto ensure better transparency on program costs management of resources and protection of the intelligence program the fbi should report regularly to congress in its semiannual program reviews designed to identify whether each field office is appropriately addressing fbi and national program priorities the fbi should report regularly to congress in detail on the qualifications
