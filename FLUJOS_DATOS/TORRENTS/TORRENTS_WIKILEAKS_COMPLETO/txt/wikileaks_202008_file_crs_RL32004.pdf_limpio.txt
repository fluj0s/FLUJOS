illegal aliens residing in the united states and the totalization agreement with mexico have fostered considerable interest in the eligibility of noncitizens for us social security benefits the social security program provides monthly cash benefits to qualified retired and disabled workers their dependents and survivors generally worker must have 10 years of social securitycovered employment to be eligible for retirement benefits less time is required for disability and survivor benefits most us jobs are covered under social security noncitizens who work in social securitycovered employment must pay social security payroll taxes including those who are in the united states working temporarily or without authorization there are some exceptions generally the work of aliens who are citizens of country with which the united states has totalization agreement coordinating the payment of social security taxes and benefits for workers who divide th eir careers between two countries is not covered if they work in the us for less than five years also by statute the work of aliens under certain visa categories is not covered by social security the social security protection act of 2004 pl 108203 requires an alien whose application for benefits is based on social security number ssn assigned january 1 2004 or later to have work authorization at the time an ssn is assigned or at some later time to gain insured status under the social security program aliens whose applications are based on ssns assigned before january 1 2004 may count all covered earnings toward insured status regardless of work authorization the social security act also prohibits the payment of benefits to aliens in the united states who are not lawfully present however under certain circumstances alien workers and dependentssurvivors may receive benefits while residing outside the united states including benefits based on unauthorized work in june 2004 the united states and mexico signed totalization agreement in early 2007 copy of the agreement was made publicly available but it has not been transmitted to congress for review the agreement has not been finalized currently since mexico meets the social insurance country definition mexican worker may receive us social security benefits outside the united states family members of the mexican worker must have lived in the united states for at least five years to receive benefits in mexico the agreement does not waive the requirements that aliens in the united states must be lawfully present to receive benefits in the united states and that aliens must have work authorization at some time to gain insured status but would allow payment of benefits to alien dependents and survivors who have never lived in the united states the social security administration reports that the projected cost of the agreement would average 105 million annually over the first five years but the government accountability office reported that the cost of the totalization agreement is highly uncertain due to the large number of unauthorized aliens from mexico estimated to be living in the united states this report will be updated as legislative activity occurs or other events warrant httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32004g21g152g140g146g138g149g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g156g561g143g152g155g561g16

united states working temporarily and those who may be working in the united states without authorization4 there are some exceptions generally the work of aliens who are citizens of country with which the united states has totalization agreement see below is not covered by social security if they work in the united states for less than five years in addition by statute the work of aliens under certain visa categories such as h2a agricultural workers f and m students5 is not covered by social security currently there are official published data on the amount of money paid into the social security system by aliens either legal or unauthorized it is important to note that an alien may be authorized to be in the united states but not authorized to work therefore an alien who does not have work authorization is not necessarily an illegal alien6 the social security administration ssa maintains an earnings suspense file that represents an estimated 520 billion in wages that cannot be posted to individual work records because the names and social security numbers ssns on wage reports submitted by employers to ssa w2 forms do not match ssas records7 the mismatched information may be due to typographical or other clerical errors such as misspelled name or an individuals failure to report new married name to ssa as well as to the use of invalid or stolen social security numbers by aliens who are working in the united states without authorization there is official published data on the amount of wages posted to the earnings suspense file that is directly attributable to aliens who are working in the united states without authorization based on fraudulent documents however ssa inspector general patrick p ocarroll stated in testimony before congress that we believe the chief cause of wage items being posted to the earnings suspense file instead of an individuals earnings record is unauthorized work by noncitizens 8 ssas office of the chief actuary estimates that about 56 million unauthorized immigrants are working and paying social security taxes in 20079 continued population surveys cpss for 2006 the cps does not include variable on immigration status 4 for social security payroll taxes to be withheld from wages worker must provide social security number ssn to hisher employer an alien who is working in the united states without authorization 1 may have an ssn b ecause heshe worked in the united states legally and then fell out of status or 2 may have obtained an ssn fraudulently 5 most of these nonimmigrant visa categories are defined in 101a15 of the ina these visa categories are commonly referred to by the letter and numeral that denotes their subsection in 101a15 eg b2 tourists e2 treaty investors f1 foreign students h1b temporary professional workers j1 cultural exchange participants or s4 terrorist informants 6 for example an alien present in the united states on b2 tourist visa may remain in the united states for six months but is not legally permitted to work in addition the spouses of most temporary noncitizen workers do not have employment authorization for more information on which categories of noncitizen are entitled to work in the united states see crs report rl31381 us immigration policy on temporary admissions by chad c haddal and ruth ellen wasem 7 annually ssa reviews w2 forms and credits social securitycovered earnings to workers if name or ssn on w2 form does not match ssas records the earnings credits go into an earnings suspense file while ssa attempts to reconcile the discrepancy the figure shown here

insured status and age requirements specified in the social security act10 they become entitled to benefits when they have met all of the eligibility requirements and filed an application for benefits because social security is an earned entitlement program there are few restrictions on benefit payments once worker becomes entitled to benefits the social security act does prohibit the payment of benefits to individuals residing in certain countries 11 individuals confined to jail prison or certain other public institutions for commission of crime most individuals removed from the united states ie deported12 aliens residing in the united states unlawfully and in some cases aliens residing outside the united states for more than six months at time

the social security protection act of 2004 pl 108203 hr 743 among other changes pl 108203 restricts the payment of social security benefits retirement survivors and disability benefits to certain noncitizens who file an application for benefits based on an ssn assigned on or after january 1 2004 specifically noncitizen who files an application for benefits based on an ssn assigned on or after january 1 2004 is required to have work authorization at the time an ssn is assigned or at some later time to gain insured status under the social secur ity program see section 214c of the social security act 13 if the individual had work authorizati on at some point all of hisher social securitycovered earnings would count toward insured status if the individual never had authorization to work in the united states none of hisher earnings would count toward insured status and social security benefits would not be payable on hisher work record ie benefits would not be payable to the worker or to the workers family 14 noncitizen who files an application for benefits based on an ssn assigned before january 1 2004 is not subject to the work authorization requirement under pl 108203 all of the individuals social securitycovered earnings would count toward insured status regardless of hisher work authorization status the treatment of unauthorized earnings for social security purposes is an issue of current legislative interest in june 2007 the senate approved an amendment to the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2007 that would preclude earnings credits based on work performed without authorization in 2004 or later with resp ect to individuals who are assigned an ssn in 10 in the case of disability benefits worker is eligible fo r benefits when heshe has met insured status requirements and established period of disability 11 us treasury department regulations or social security restrictions prohibit payments to individuals living in cuba democratic

violations ie removed from the united states because they are illegally present not because they have committed crime 13 the 2004 law provides exceptions to the work authorization requirement for certain noncitizens ie noncitizens who are admitted to the united states under b visa for business purposes or d visa for service as crew member at the time quarters of coverage are earned 14 before

when the social security program began paying benefits in 1940 there were restrictions on benefit payments to noncitizens in 1956 amid concerns that noncitizens were working in the united states for relatively short periods and returning to their native countries where they and their family members would collect benefits for many years congress enacted restrictions on benefits for alien workers living abroad restrictions did not apply to alien dependents and survivors the social security amendments of 1956 pl 84880 required noncitizens to reside in the united states to receive benefits and suspended benefits if the recipient remained outside the united states for more than six consecutive months with broad exceptions see table 1 in 1983 congress placed restrictions on benefit payments to alien dependents and survivors living abroad the social security amendments of 1983 pl 9821 made dependents and survivors subject to the same residency requirement as workers described above and further required that they or their parents in the case of childs benefit must have lived in the united states for at least five years with broad exceptions see table 2 and table 3 several factors led to the enactment of tighter restrictions on benefit payments to alien dependents and survivors living abroad in 1983 including the large number of dependents that were being added to the benefit rolls in some cases under fraudulent circumstances after workers had returned to their native country and become entitled to benefits and difficulties associated with monitoring the continued eligibility of recipients living abroad at the time the general accounting office gao now named the government accountability office estimated that of the 164000 dependents living abroad in 1981 56000 were added to the benefit rolls after the worker became entitled to benefits of that number an estimated 51000 or 91 were noncitizens 19 two years earlier the social security commissioner stated that ssa investigators had found evidence that some recipients living abroad were faking marriages and adoptions and failing to report deaths in order to cheat the system at the time the commissioner stated that such problems were particularly acute in greece italy mexico and the philippines where large numbers of beneficiaries were residing he stated further that in some countries there is kind of industry built up of socalled claimsfixers who for percentage of the benefit will work to ensure that somebody gets the maximum benefit they can possibly get out of the system 20 in 1996 congress enacted tighter restrictions on the payment of social security benefits to aliens residing in the united states the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 prwora21 prohibited the payment of social security benefits to aliens in the united states who are not lawfully present unless nonpayment would be contrary to totalization agreement or section 202t of the

united states are subject to different rules regarding federal income tax treatment of social security benefits us citizens and resident aliens24 pay federal income tax on portion of their benefit if their income exceeds specified thresholds specifically they pay federal income tax on up to 50 of their benefit if their modified adjusted gross income adjusted gross income agi plus taxexempt interest income plus 50 of social security benefits is more than 25000 but more than 34000 for single person or more than 32000 but more than 44000 for married couple filing jointly they pay federal income tax on up to 85 of their benefit if their modified agi is more than 34000 for single person or more than 44000 for married couple filing jointly these thresholds do not apply to married couples who live together and file separate returns currently about onethird of social security recipients pay federal income tax on their benefits noncitizens who live outside the united states pay federal income tax on their benefits without regard to these thresholds section 871 of the internal revenue code imposes 30 rate of tax withholding on the us income of noncitizens who li ve outside the country unless lower rate is established by treaty because there is practical way for the us government to determine the income of such persons under the withholding noncitizens who reside outside the united states pay 30 of the maximum taxable amount of social security benefits 85 in federal income taxes for example the tax withholding on an an nual social security benefit of 12000 would be 3060

while living outside the united states if they are citizen or resident of country with which the united states has totalization agreement26 section 233 of the social security act authorizes the president to enter into totalization agreement with foreign country to coordinate the collection of payroll taxes and the payment of benefits under each countrys social security system for workers who split their careers between the two countries for example without totalization agreement an individual who is sent by us company to work in foreign country and his or her employer must contribute to the social security systems in both countries resulting in dual social security coverage and taxation based on the same earnings with one exception italy totalization agreements allow workers and their employers to contribute only to the foreign system if the worker is employed in that country for five or more years or only to the us system if the worker is employed in that country for less than five years totalization agreements also allow workers who divide their careers between the two countries to combine earnings credits under both systems to qualify for benefits if they lack sufficient coverage under either system 27 while worker may combine earnings credits to qualify for benefits under one or both systems hisher benefit is prorated to reflect only the number of years the worker paid into each system the same trea tment applies to foreign workers in the united states totalization agreements are subject to congressional review section 233e of the social security act requires the president to submit to congress the text of the agreement and report on 1 the estimated number of individuals who would be affected by the agreement and 2 the estimated financial impact of the agreement on programs established by the social security act section 233e2 of the social security act specifies that totalization agreement automatically goes into effect unless the house of representatives or the senate adopts resolution of disapproval within 60 session days of the agreements transmittal to congress it should be noted that the provision of section 233e2 that allows for the rejection of totalization agreement upon adoption of resolution of disapproval by either house of congress is an unconstitutional legislative veto this conclusion is compelled by the holding in ins v chadha where the supreme court struck down provision in the immigration and nationality act that gave either house of congress the authority to overrule deportation decisions made by the attorney general 28 the court declared that legislative veto constitutes an exercise of legislative power as its use has the purpose and effect of altering the legal rights duties and 26 social security regulations 20 cfr 4041928 specify that totalization agreement may provide that person entitled to benefits under title ii of the social security act may receive those benefits while residing in the foreign country party to the agreement regardless of the alien nonpayment provision 27 this applies to social security retirement and disability benefits generally minimum of 40 credits is required to qualify for social security retirement benefits fewer credits are required to qualify for disability benefits depending on the workers age at the onset of the disability in some cases worker may qualify for disability benefits with minimum of six credits 28 462 us 919 1983 shortly after its decision in chadha the court without opinion and with one dissent summarily affirmed lower

the court invalidated the disapproval mechanism holding that congress may exercise its legislative authority only in accord with single finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure namely bicameral passage and presentation to the president30 given that the disapproval mechanism in section 233e2 authorizes the exercise of legislative authority outside the strictures of bicameralism and presentment it is likewise unconstitutional31 congress has never rejected totalization agreement as result the fact that the mechanism under section 233e2 is unconstitutional has not been an issue congressional utilization of the mechanism in section 233e2 to reject totalization agreement could give rise to judicial challenge potentially resulting in an invalidation of the disapproval mechanism and determination that the agreement is effective specifically in considering the effect of the unconstitutional disapproval mechanism reviewing court would consider whether the remainder of section 233 is valid or whether the entire statute must be nullified the supreme court has held that unless it is evident that the legislature would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power independently of that which is not the invalid part may be dropped if what is left is fully operative law 32 in westcott v califano the court noted that the existence of broad severability clause in the social security act reflects the congressional wish that judicial interpretation of the act leave as much of the statute intact as possible33 the existence of this severability clause coupled with the fact that the operative provisions of section 233 would remain fully functional absent the disa pproval mechanism in subsection e2 gives rise to the likelihood that reviewing cour t would invalidate any attempt to utilize the disapproval mechanism while giving effect to an otherwise properly executed totalization agreement34 legislation has been introduced in the 110th congress that would amend the congressional review process for totalization agreements specified in section 233e of the social security act in january 2007 senator ensign introduced s 43 the social security totalization agreement reform act of 2007 and representative cubin in troduced companion bill hr 279 among other provisions the bills would require the president to notify each house of c ongress of

corporation commission 286 us 210 234 1932 33 460 fsupp 737 d mass 1978 in califano the court was referring to 42 usc 1303 which states if any provision of this chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid the remainder of the chapter and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby 34 in light of the courts holding in chadha it is apparent that any congressional action taken to restrict or control executive authority to enter into totalization agreements or to invalidate any such agreements must be accomplished through bicameral passage and presentment to the president accordingly congressional options in this regard would appear to be limited to imposing additional requirements on the adoption of totalization agreements restricting authority to enter into such agreements unless approved by both congress and the president on case by case basis or to pass law disapproving particular agreement

immigration policies are designed to discourage and punish those unauthorized to work in the united states on the other hand under social security rules there are certain circumstances when an unauthorized alien can collect social security benefits as result of this perceived inconsistency some oppose paying social security benefits to such aliens arguing that aliens who violate immigration law should not be rewarded by receiving social security benefits others contend that aliens who work in social securitycovered employment ie had payroll taxes withheld from their earnings should be eligible for benefits whether or not they had employment authorization

the provision was included as 526 of pl 110161 the consolidated appropriations act 200841 the announcement in 2004 that an agreement with mexico had been signed revived debate that began in december 2002 following media reports that negotiations were underway on potential totalization agreement between the united states and mexico42 among the approximately 72 million mexicanborn workers in the us labor force in 2006 approximately 56 million 80 were noncitizens 43 and 15 million 20 were naturalized citizens44 the effects of the totalization agreement with mexico depend on the specific terms and language of the agreement which have not been finalized the following discussion pertains to the version of the agreement that ssa released on january 4 2007 in response to the freedom of information act foia request from the trea senior citizens league45 as in most totalization agreements the totalization agreement with mexico would waive the five year us residency requirement for alien dependents and survivors to receive benefits outside the united states see table 2 and table 3 under current law an alien worker entitled to social security benefits based on work performed with or without auth orization in the united states may receive benefits outside the united states if heshe is citizen of mexico because mexico meets the definition of social insurance country an alien dependent or survivor entitled to social security benefits may receive benefits outside the united states only if heshe had lived in the united states previously for at least five years and the family relationship on which benefits are based existed during that time unless heshe meets one of several exceptions the totalization agreement with mexico would allow alien dependents and survivors in mexico who have never lived in the united states to receive social security benefits outside the united states as discussed above section 202y of the social security act prohibits the payment of benefits to aliens in the united states who are not lawfully present although some observers have expressed concern that totalization agreement with mexico could allow unauthorized aliens to receive payments in the united states the version of the agreement signed in june 2004 does not waive this requirement 46 similarly another concern has been that the totalization agreement would waive the provision of law that requires an alien whose application for benefits is based on an ssn assigned in 2004 or later to have work authorization at the time an ssn is assigned or at any later time to gain insured status under the social security program ie the alien must have work authorization at some point to count work credits for insured status purposes reportedly in 2006 ssa sent diplomatic note to the mexican go vernment clarifying that the agreement would not waive the work authorization requirement ssa has not received response from the mexican government still others express concern

mexico to come to the united states in addition given the social security systems projected longrange funding shortfall some question the feasibility of adding potentially large number of recipients to the rolls in the absence of structural social security reform others argue that an agreement that precludes payments to unauthorized aliens in the united states could be beneficial to the united states and that the cost could be reasonable47 they argue that there could be substantial savings for certain us workers and employers by removing the burden of double taxation for example without totalization agreement us citizens and legal permanent residents lprs48 sent by us companies to work in mexico must contribute to both the us and mexican social security systems moreover some workers may not qualify for us or mexican social security benefits because they do not have enough earnings credits under either system in addition proponents of totaliza tion agreements argue that such

social security system associated risks should be assessed and mitigat ed during the negotiati on process overall gao found that the procedures followed by ssa in the development of the totalization agreement with mexico and all other agreemen ts are not well documented gao goes on to state ssa provided information showing that it assessed the reliability of mexican earnings data and the internal controls in place to ensure the integrity of information that ssa will rely on to pay social security benefits 52 records on which ssa would rely to determine workers and family members initial and continued eligibility for benefits include birth death and marriage records in addition gao found that totalization agreement with mexico would increase the number of mexican workers and their family members eligible for social security benefits for two reasons first mexican workers who otherwise would not have enough earnings credits to qualify for benefits in the united states could combine us and mexican credits to qualify for partial us social security benefit second more family members in mexico would qualify for us social security benefits because totalization agreement generally exempts dependents and survivors residing outside the united states from the fiveyear us residency requirement in terms of the potential cost of totalization agreement with mexico gao evaluated march 2003 cost estimate prepared by ssas office of the chief actuary ssa projects that an agreement with mexico would cost 78 million in the first year and 650 million constant 2002 dollars by 2050 the cost estimate assumes an initial increase of 50000 new beneficiaries in mexico based on the number of persons us citizens and others in mexico currently receiving us social security benefits and projects that the number of additional beneficiaries under the agreement would increase to 300000 over time ssa projects that the totalization agreement with mexico would have negligible effect on the longrange actuarial balance of the social security trust funds 53 gao found that the cost of totalization agreement with mexico is highly uncertain even more so than for previous agreements because of the large number of unauthorized immigrants from mexico estimated to be living in the united states according to gaos assessment the base used for the number of initial new beneficiaries in mexico under totalization agreement 50000 does not take into account the estimated millions of current and former unauthorized workers and family members from mexico and appears small in comparison with those estimates 54 furthermore gao points out that the cost estimate does not take into account the potential change in behavior by mexican citizens under totalization agreement gao notes that an agreement could provide an additional incentive for unauthorized workers from mexico to come to the united states in regard to the number of unauthorized immigrants from mexico currently living in the united states gao cites range of estimates for example the pew hispanic center estimates the number to be between 34 and 57 million while the urban institute estimates the number to be more than 4 million the federal government estimates that there are about 5 million 52 gao031035t p 2 53 ssas march 2003 cost estimate of totalization agreement with mexico and gaos evaluation do not incorporate the effects of pl 108203 discussed above however ssa has stated that the cost estimate is still appropriate following enactment of the work authorization requirement in pl 108203 to clarify ssa

states as of january 2000 and that the number is expected to increase by 240000 each year according to federal government statistics unauthorized immigrants from mexico make up an estimated 69 of unauthorized immigrants in the united states by comparison the number of unauthorized us immigrants from all of the other totalization countries combined is estimated at less than 3 in regard to the potential number of former unauthorized workers who have returned to mexico gao points out that fewer than onethird of immigrants from mexico stay in the united states for more than 10 years the minimum number of years of social securitycovered earnings generally needed to qualify for social security retirement benefits given the limited information regarding the age work history social security coverage and number of dependents of these former unauthorized workers the potential cost of totalization agreement with mexico is considered even more difficult to predict as mentioned previously the ssa cost estimate shows that totalization agreement with mexico would have negligible effect on the longrange actuarial balance of the social security trust funds however sensitivity analysis performed by ssa at gaos request shows that 25 or more increase in the number of initial new beneficiaries ie 13000 or more above the base estimate of 50000 would result in measurable impact on the longrange actuarial balance of the trust funds gao found that error rates in estimating the number of initial new beneficiaries under previous totalization agreements often exceeded 25 based on the large number of unauthorized workers from mexico in the united states gao considers the estimated cost of totalization agreement with mexico more uncertain than cost estimates for previous agreements in its report gao states that totalization agreement with mexico is both qualitatively and quantitatively different than any other agreement signed to date 55

comments on draft of the gao report ssa disagreed with the gao evaluation on number of issues56 specifically in regard to ssas estimate of the number of persons who initially would receive totalized benefits under the agreement 50 000 ssa maintains that the estimate is based on the best available data and includes potential benefits for both documented and undocumented workers in the us in the past 57 furthermore ssa notes that the unprecedented sixfold increase in this number 300000 by 2050 takes into account recent increases in immigration and visas ssas response includes but is not limited to the following not all unauthorized mexican workers work in social securitycovered jobs those who are employed on an unofficial basis ie paid cash in the underground economy do not qualify for benefits with or without totalization agreement because their earnings are not reported for social security purposes ssa notes that the percentage of unauthorized workers who could become eligible for benefits is more limited than gao suggests because gao does not include this group of workers in their discussion 55 gao03993 p 17 56 the full text of ssas comments are provided in appendix ii of

initially would receive totalized benefits under the agreement ie the number of social security recipients currently living in mexico seems low and bears direct relationship to the estimated number of current and former unauthorized mexican workers in the united states and their family members ssa maintains that this is reasonable proxy and points out that the 50000 social security recipients currently living in mexico include mexican citizens who qualified for benefits based on unauthorized work in the united states gao points out that the agreement could provide an additional incentive for unauthorized mexican workers to come to the united states in ssas view this type of behavioral effect would be very small ssa contends that most mexican citizens who come to the united states to work without authorization are young and more likely to be motivated by current earnings than the prospect of future social security retirement benefits in evaluating whether the number of social security recipients currently living in mexico is reasonable proxy for the number of individuals who initially would receive totalized benefits under an agreement with mexico ssa used comparison data for canada country with which the united states has had totalization agreement for 20 years because it too is nafta trading partner and shares border with the united states by applying the same ratio of totalized to nontotalized fully insured canadian beneficiaries to the number of current nontotalized mexican beneficiaries ssa came up with an estimate of 37000 initial new beneficiaries under the agreement and determined that the 50000 proxy was reasonable according to gao such comparisons between canada and mexico are problematic because of the much higher estimates of illegal immigration from mexico while ssa acknowledges the large number of unauthorized mexican citizens estimated to be in the united states it contends that these individuals tend to be young and would become eligible for totalized benefits well into the future ssa points out that the purpose of the canadamexico comparison is to provide current estimate of totalized beneficiaries under an agreement with mexico gao states that error rates associated with ssas projections of new beneficiaries under previous agreements frequently have exceeded 25 ssa acknowledges that for six of the 11 agreements that became effective between 1985 and 1994 the number of individuals receiving totalized benefits in the fifth year after implementation exceeded their estimates ssa further points out however that estimates for recent agreements have been high for example ssa overestimated the number of individuals receiving totalized benefits for the four agreements that became effective between 1992 and 1994 overall for the 11 agreements ssa estimates that their projections have been within 3 of the actual number g16g152g556g15g138g157g140g145g561g14g142g157g157g142g155g156g561 over the past few years policy change

fraudulent ssn the discrepancy could be the result of clerical error for tax years 1993 through 2000 an employer received match letters only if more than 10 employees had discrepancies and the number of employees with mismatches equaled more than 10 of the employers workforce58 for the 2001 tax year ssa implemented new policy of sending nomatch letters to every employer with at least one employee with discrepancies on their w2 for tax year 200059 ssa sent out approximately 110000 nomatch letters60 compared to approximately 950000 for tax year 200161 employers are not required to respond to or act on the letters however under the ina employers are subject to penalties for hiring or retaining unauthorized alien workers62 additionally the internal revenue service can penalize employers for providing incorrect information on wage forms w2s63 ssa maintained that the letters were sent to employers to ensure that workers are properly credited with their earnings because of the co ntroversy surrounding the increase in the number of nomatch letters ssa currently sends nomatch letter to an employer only if more than 10 employees have discrepancies and the number of employees affected equals more than 05 of the employers workforce in 2005 ssa sent 127652 nomatch letters for tax year 200464 some argue that ssa should not reduce the number of nomatch letters that are sent to employers they contend that ssa should coordinate with other agencies to locate unauthorized alien workers and that nomatch letters can be tool to help reduce the unauthorized population in the united states additionally the nomatch letters may help employers who do not know that the employees documents are fraudulent but would be liable if they were caught employing unauthorized aliens others contend that ssa has immigrationrelated enforcement powers and it is not ssas job to enforce laws in addition immigration advocates contend that tens of thousands of immigration aliens left their jobs or were fired as result of the letters 65 they argue that nomatch letters do little to combat unlawful employment as those who use false documents simply find employment in another company increasing the risk of workplace exploitation additionally they contend that some firms may have experienced loss of revenue caused by worker shortages or by terminated employees who do not have employment authorization moving to competitors the letters also raised concerns that employers were discriminating based on alienage ie that an employer who received nomatch letter for noncitizen would fire the noncitizen worker without ascertaining if they have employment authorization 58 social security nomatch letter interpreter releases vol 80 april 7 2003 pp 508509 59 nomatch letters for tax year 2000

relating to the unlawful hiring or continued employment of aliens who lack work authorization66 the regulation creates safeharbor procedures for employers who receive match letter to follow to ensure that dhs would not find the employer guilty of knowingly hiring or continuing to employ an alien who lacks wo rk authorization ie that the employer had violated 274a of the immigration and nationality act under the rule the employer has to take reasonable steps within 93 days of receipt of the nomatch letter to resolve the discrepancy these steps include checking records for clerical errors and if such errors are found informing ssa of the correct information or asking the employee to confirm the name and ssn and if they are correct requesting that the employee resolve the discrepancy with ssa
