guidelines in the face of arguments that they constituted an unconstitutional delegation of authority and an aﬀront to the separation of powers thereafter the court held that due process and the right to criminal jury trial require that any fact other than the fact of prior conviction that increases the penalty for crime beyond the statutory maximum must be submitted to the jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt and for this reason the court in blakely v washington found constitutionally wanting state sentence imposed by operation of legislative sentencing guideline procedure even though the ﬁnal sentence fell beneath the maximum penalty assigned to the crime of conviction now in booker and fanfan the court has agreed to decide what impact these principles have on the federal sentencing guidelineshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code rl32573 united states sentencing guidelines

idelines and the supreme court booker fanfan blakely apprendi and mistretta summary for fifteen years sentencing in federa l court had been governed by the united states sentencing guidelines during that time the supreme court has upheld the guidelines in the face of various cha llenges in the meantime however it had decided series of cases which called into question past assumptions relating to the role of the jury in the sentencing process in apprendi the court held that any fact that increases the penalty for crime bey ond the statutory maximum assigned for that offense must be submitted to the jury and found beyond reasonable doubt the federal sentencing guidelines were considered beyond the r each of apprendi because they only govern sentencing beneath the maximum penalty assigned to the crime of conviction in blakely however the court held that the statutory maximum for apprendi purposes constituted the applicable statutory sentencing guideline maximum not the higher statutory max imum assigned to the crime of conviction this raised questions as to the constitutional validity of the federal sentencing guidelines which the court agreed to address in two consolidated cases booker and fanfan together the cases presented two issues 1 was the judicial factfinding that was central to the operation of the federal sentencing guidelines unconstitutional in light of the principles announced in apprendi and blakely 2 if so was the taint severable or did it doom the sentencing guidelines and perhaps the sentencing reform act that authorized them the court concluded that the answer to the first question was yes but that the solution was to convert the guidelines to advisory standards by severing only those sections of the sentencing reform act that made the guidelines binding on the lower federal courts the alignment of the justices in the twopart booker decision is such that the prediction of future developments is even more perilous than usual some may find clarification in the courts later decision in united states v shepard thus far the court has exempted the fact of prior c onviction from the facts that must be found by the jury in shepard plurality of the court declined to allow the lower federal courts to make factual determinations concer ning the existence of the fact of prior conviction for purposes of the armed career criminal act

recently the united states sentencing guidelines governed sentencing in federal court the supreme court had upheld them in the face of arguments that they constituted an unconstitutional delegation of au thority and an affront to the separation of powers mistretta v united states 488 us 361 1989 ye t thereafter the court held that due process and the right to criminal jury trial require that any fact other than the fact of prior conviction that increases the penalty for crime beyond the statutory maximum must be submitted to the jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt apprendi v new jersey 530 us 466 2000 and for this reason the court found constitutionally wanting state senten ce imposed by operation of legislative sentencing guideline procedure even t hough the final sentence fell beneath the maximum penalty assigned to the crime of conviction blakely v washington 124 sct 2531 2004 then the court agreed to decide what impact th principles had on the federal sentencing guidelines united states v fanfan 125 sct 12 2004 united states v booker 125 sct 11 20041 more precisely it agreed to consider two questions whether the sixth amendment is violat ed by the imposition of an enhanced sentence under the united states sentenci ng guidelines based on the sentencing judges determination of fact other th an prior conviction that was not found by the jury or admitted by the defendant if the answer to the first question is yes the following question is presented whether in case in which the guidelines would require the court to find sentenceenhancing fact the guidelin as whole would be inapplicable as matter of severability analysis such that the sentencing court must exercise its discretion to sentence the defendant within the maximum and minimum set by statute for the offense of conviction the court answered the first question yes united states v booker 125 sct 738 7462 different array of justices respondi ng to the second question for the

75657 background of the united states sentencing guidelines the sentencing reform act of 1984 which established the united states sentencing commission and authorized it to issue sentencing guidelines brought about striking changes in federal sentencing law3 sentencing under earlier law was considered inconsistent and uncertain different federal statutes set different maximum penalties for th same misc onduct co mmitted under different jurisdictional circumstances in 1976 the house judi ciary committee identif ied over 20 separate federal murder statutes 12 criminal restraint statutes 38 property destruction statutes 15 blackmail statutes and 134 theft statutes subcomm on criminal justice of the house comm on the judiciary impact of s 1437 upon present federal criminal laws pt2 commprint 9271264 1976 among these the criminal restraint provisions featured 9 different maximum penalties and the maximum penalties available under the property destructi on and theft provisions were only more consistent by degree id see also srept 98225 at 39 40 n9 1983 recounting sentencing variations among th eft and embezzlement statutes at the same time federal judges enjoyed virtually unlimited discretion to impose any sentence beneath the maximum established by statute once imposed sentences were ordinarily beyond appellate review gore v united states 357 us 386 393 1958 moreover time actually served was produc t of the parole laws in spite of facially longer sentence federal prisoner became eligible for parole and thus eligible for release after serving the s horter of 10 years one third of his sentence or the term set by the sentencing court 18 usc 4205 1982 ed at the discretion of the parole commission prisoner might be paroled at any time after becoming eligible up to and until his mandatory release date generally pegged at service of twothirds of his sentence or 30 years of each consecutive sentence of 45 years or more 18 usc 4206 1982 ed many in congress came to conclude that the system did not work in the federal system today criminal sentencing is based largely on an outmoded rehabilitation model the judge is supposed to set the maximum term of imprisonment and the parole commission is to determine when to release the prisoner because he is rehabilitated yet almost everyone involved in the criminal justice system now doubts that rehabilitation can be induced reliably in prison setting and it is now quite certai n that one can really detect whether or when prisoner is rehabilitated since the sentencing laws have not been revised to take this into account each judg is left to apply his own notions of the purposes of sentencing as result every day federal judges mete out an unjustifiably wide range of sentences to offenders with similar histories convicted of similar crimes committed under similar circumstances onehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs3 4 as consequence of the demands of the constitutions ex post

subject to return to prison for service of the remainder of his term for breach of the conditions of hi s parole 18 usc 4209 4214 the act abolished the first feature early release but it retained the second in the form of an additional term of supervised release imposed as an additi onal component of defendants sentence 6 frcrimp 32c 18 usc app 1982 ed now frcrimp 32c and 18 usc 3552a 7 congress

imprisonment the maximum of the range established for such term sha ll not exceed the minimum of that range by more than the greater of 25 percent or six months ex cept that if the minimum term of the range is 30 years or more the maximum may be life imprisonment 28 usc 994b2offender may receive sentence of probation while another convicted of the very same crime and possessing comparable criminal history may be sentenced to lengthy term of impr isonment srept 98225 at 38 1983 congress responded with the sentencing reform act the act abolished parole4 and replaced it with supervised rel ease term of conditional release imposed in addition to rather than in lie u of time to be served in prison 18 usc 35835 it retained the probation officers presentence report to the court6 and the exemption of sentencing courts from the re strictions of the rules of evidence 18 usc 3577 1982 ed now 18 usc 3661 it articulated series of purposes of sentencing and directed courts to weig h them when imposing sentence 18 usc 3553a both the prosecution and defendant were given authority to appeal the courts sentencing decisions 18 usc 3742 but the acts most dramatic change was the creation of the united states sentencing commission 28 usc 991 and th acts insistence that federal courts impose sentences within the ranges dictated by the commissions sentencing guidelines except in those cases marked by circumstances that the guidelines failed to take into consideration 18 usc 3553b the commission was placed in the judicial branch of the ited states as an independent entity 28 usc 991 with the advice and consent of the senate the president was to appoint the commissions seven members at least three of whom we re required to be mbers of the federal bench id7 the act gave the commission rather exact instructions as to the nature of the guidelines it was to issue 28 usc 994 the guidelines for instance were to establish sentencing range for each category of offense involving each category of defendant 28 usc 994b1 and each of these was to be assigned sentencing range in which the maximum term of imprisonment was to be at most six months more than the minimum term for the range8 the guidelines and subsequenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs4 9 one of the most important questions fo r the commission to decide was whether to base sentences upon the actual conduct in which the defendant engaged regardless of the charges for which he was indicted or convicted real offense sentencing or upon the conduct that constitutes the elements of the offense with which he was convicted charge offense sentencing bank robber for example might have used gun frightened bystanders taken 50000 injured teller refused to stop when ordered and r aced away damaging property during escape pure real offense system would sentence on the basis of all identifiable conduct pure charge offense sy stem would overlook some of the harms that did not constitute statutory elements of the ffenses of which the defendant was convicted ussg 1a11 cmt 4a 10 petitioner argues that in delegating the pow er to promulgate sentencing guidelines for every federal criminal offense to an i ndependent sentencing commission congress has granted the commission excessive legislative di scretion in violation of the constitutionally based nondelegation doctrine we do not agree the statute outlines the policies which prompted establishment of the commission explains what the commission should do and how it should do it and sets out specific directiv to govern particular situations 488 us at 371 379 11 in sum since substantive judgment in the field of sentencing has been and remains appropriate to the judicial branch and the thodology of rulemaking has been and remains appropriate to that branch congress consider ed decision to combine these functions in an independent sentencing commission within th judicial branch does not violate the principle of separation of powers 488 us at 39697amendments to them were to go into eff ect 180 days after they had been presented to congress 28 usc 994p the first sentencing guidelines went into effect on november 1 1987 without congressional deletion or amendment they called for scoring system under which broad categories of offenses homicide assault theft etc were assigned an initial score base offense level and points offe nse levels were added or subtracted to account for various aggravating and m itigating circumstances the aggravating circumstances included not onl the offense with which the defendant was charged but all misconduct releva nt to the charged offense ussg 1b139 the 43 possible final point totals final offense levels were each given 6 different ranges calibrated according to the defendants criminal record criminal history category the score card was prepared first as part of the probation officers presentence report ussg 6a11 the prosecution and the defendant were allowed to contest the presentence reports sentencing recommendations and the court was to resolve any disputes ussg 6a12 6a13 in 1991 without congressional objection the commission expre ssed the view that the court should resolve disputed issues of fact by pr eponderance of the evidence ussg 6a13 cmt the sentencing commission faced its first constitutional challenge in mistretta v united states 488 us 361 1989 there the court rejected arguments that the commission was the beneficiary of an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority10 that the commissions placement within the judicial branch offended constitutional principles of separation of powers11 that required j udicial service uponhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs5 12 participation of federal judges on th sentencing commission does not threaten either in fact or in appearance the impartiality of the judicial branch 488 us at 407 13 we simply cannot imagine that federal j udges will comport their actions to the wishes of the president for the purpose of rece iving an appointment to the sentencing commission 488 us at 410 14 if defendant objects to sentence enhancement resulting from her trial testimony district court must review the evidence and make independent findings necessary to establish willful impediment to or obstruction of justice or attempt to do the same when doing so it is preferable for district court to address each element of the alleged perjury in separate and cl ear finding 507 us at 95 15 the guidelines state that it is appropriate that facts relevant to sentencing be proved by preponderance of the evidence ussg 6a13 cmt and we have held that application of the preponderance standard at sentencing generally satisfies due process mcmillan v pennsylvania 477 us 79 912 1986 we acknowledge divergence of opinion among the circuits as to whether in extreme circumstances relevant conduct that would dramatically increase the sentence must be based on clear and convincing evidence the cases before us today do not present such exceptional circumstances and we therefore do not address that issue 519 us at 15657 16 the court in koon held that district court departur decisions were entitled to deference and consequently should be reviewed under an abuse of discretion st andard 518 us at 96 100 congress later subjected certain depart ure decisions to novo review 18 usc 3742ethe commission likewise offended those principles12 and that the presidents power to appoint and remove memb ers gave further offense to the notion of separation of powers13 few years later the cour t found merit in the conten tion that the application of the sentencing guideline enhancement for defendants perjur at trial undermined the accuseds implicit constitutional righ t to testify on her own behalf united states v dunnigan 507 us 87 98 199314 then it turned deaf ear to arguments that the sentencing guidelines use of r elevant conduct raised double jeopardy concerns either when defe ndant was later tried for conduc t that formed the basis for an earlier sentencing enhancement witte v united states 515 us 389 403404 1995 or when the conduct for which defendant had been acquitted was later considered relevant c onduct for sentencing enhancement purposes following conviction on other related charges united states v watts 519 us 148 157 1997 in both instances the rationale was th same sentencing enhancements do not punish defendant for crimes for which he was not convicted but rather increase his sentence because of the manner in which he committed the crime of conviction 519 us at 155 citing witte 515 us at 402403 at least on the facts before it the court in watts also endorsed the guidelines us of the preponderance standard15 between witte and watts the court emphasized the disc retion of district court to depart from guidelines sentencing range in the presence of unaccounted circumstances and the defere nce due such departure koon v united states 518 us 81 199616 then in edwards defendants charged with conspiracy involving both powdered cocaine and crack were convicted after the trial court instructed the juryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs6 17 thus the sentencing judge here would have had to determine the total amount of drugs determine whether the drugs consisted of cocaine crack or both and determine the total amount of each regardless of whether the judge believed that petitioners crackrelated conduct was part of the offense of conviction or the judge believed that it was part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or pl an the guidelines sentencing range on either belief is identical 523 us at 51415 18 there is one post apprendi case united states v cotton 535 us 625 2002 the defendants in cotton were convicted following jury trial which heard overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted evidence that they were involved in conspiracy to deal at least 50 grams of cocaine base crack 535 us at 633 an offense for which they could be sentenced to prison for any term of years or for life and for which they were in fact sentenced to 30 years 535 us at 628 the indictment under which they were convicted however simply charged conspiracy to tra fficking in detectable amount of crack an offense which carried maximum term of 20 years id the defendants argued that the fifth amendment right to grand jury indictment and apprendi required that they be sentenced more severely than the crime of indictment allowed yet the court ruled that by operation of the plain error rule they had forfeited the objection by failing to raise it at trial 535 us at 63135 in the course of its opinion the cour t suggested that the sentencing guideline did not provide the apprendi triggering prescribed stat utory maximum respondents challenged the presentence reports assignment of base offense level of 38 which is applicable to 15 kilograms or more of cocaine base but they never argued that the conspiracy involved less than 50 grams of cocaine base which is the relevant quantity for purposes of apprendi as that is the threshold quantity for the penalty of life imprisonment in 21 usc 841b1a 535 us at 633 n3 19 other than the right to grand jury indictment hurtado v california 110 us 519 538 1884 these rights are binding upon the states with equal force usconst amend iv 1 duncan v louisiana 391 us 145 153 1968that the prosecution needed to show conspiracy involving powdered cocaine or crack edwards v united states 523 us 511 51213 1998 the defendants were sentenced as charged with conspiracy involving both powdered cocaine and crack they argued that it must be assumed that the jury only found them guilty of the less severely punishable powdered co caine conspiracy not so said the court since the sentence imposed fell beneath the statutory maximum for the less severely punishable powdered cocaine conspiracy it did not matter whether the trial court based its sentence upon the jurys verdict or upon its own finding of relevant conduct17 all of these cases however predate blakely and apprendi 18 blakely apprendi and related matters with disarming simplicity the united states constitution declares that person shall be held to answer for capita l or otherwise infamous crime unless on presentment or indictment of grand jury nor be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law u sconst amend v moreover in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjo the right to speedy and public trial by an impartial jury usconst amend vi19 only surprisingly late in our constituti onal history did the court find occasion to point out that due process demands th at the guilt of criminally accused be found beyond reasonable doubt that the due process clause protects the accusedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs7 20 the mcmillan procedure exposed anyone convicted of various designated offenses to mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for five years if the sentencing judge found by preponderance of the evidence that the defe ndant had brandished firearm during the commission of the offense 21 subsection of 8 usc 1326 makes it crime for deported aliens to reenter the united states without special permission offenders are subject to imprisonment for not more than two years unless prior to deportati on they had been convicted of an aggravated felony in which case they are subject to imprisonment for not more than 20 years 8 usc 1326b2 almendareztorres had entered plea of guilty to charge of violating subsection 1326a but argued that the sentencin g factor of prior conviction must in fact be considered an element of separate crime which the fifth amendment required to be charged in the indictment th court did not agree we conclude that the subsection is penalty provision which simply authorizes c ourt to increase the sentence for recidivist it does not define separate crime conse quently neither the statute nor the constitution require the government to charge the factor that it mentions an earlier conviction in theagainst conviction except upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged in re winship 397 us 358 364 1970emphasis added conviction cannot be had the court subsequently ex plained upon the defendants failure to prove the absence of one of the elements of the crime with which he is charged thus for example state may not require an accused to prove that he acted in the heat of passion ie with an absence of malice aforethought and therefore is not guilty of murder for wh ich malice aforethought is an element but only of manslaughter mullaney v wilbur 421 us 684 698701 1975 due process in this context is focused upon the prosecutors responsibility to prove each of the crimes elements bey ond reasonable doubt due process is not offended if the defendant must prove the ex istence of lesser included offense rather than the more serious offense with which he is charged so state may outlaw the intentional killing of another as murder but allow the accused to claim guilt under less severely punished crime when he can show by preponderance of the evidence that he acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance patterson v new york 432 us 197 205207 1977 still focused upon the prosecutors bur den to prove each of the crimes elements the court held that once the prosecution has done so denial of due process occurs simply because the defendant convicted of the crime is subject to mandatory minimum sentence based upon the pros ecutors proof to the court not the jury of an additional sentencing fact or by preponderance of the evidence mcmillan v pennsylvania 477 us 79 93 198620 moreover at least when the sentencing f actor is the fact of prior conviction the sentencing factors might be used to enhance maximum penalties as well as to establish minimum penalties thus majority of the court saw constitutional impediment in statutory scheme that raised the maximum penalty of crime from two years to 20 years based on the presence of prior conviction established to the courts satisfaction by pr eponderance of the evidence almendareztorres v united states 523 us 224 22627 199821 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs8 indictment 523 us at 22627 22 since the apprendi majority consisted of the four dissenting justice in almendarez torres and justice thomas it might be more accurate say that four justices remained uneasy and pivotal fifth justice began to question the wisdom of almendareztorres 23 whoever with the intent to cause deat h or serious bodily harm takes motor vehicle that has been transported shipped or receive d in interstate or foreign commerce from the person or presence of another by force and viol ence or by intimidation or attempts to do so shall 1 be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 15 years or both 2 if serious bodily injury as defined in section 1365 of this title including any conduct that if the conduct occurred in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states would violate section 2241 or 2242 of this title results be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 25 years or both nd 3 if death results be fined under this title or imprisoned for any number of years up to lif or both or sentenced to death 18 usc 2119logical though it may have been in light of the courts precedents majority of the courts members became uneasy with the implications of almendareztorres almost immediately22 they began with an arguably strained statutory interpretation in which they characterized various statutory factors as elements rather than sentencing factors they did so they explained because otherwise the statutes might be considered constitutionally suspect jones v united states 526 us 227 1999 presented facts similar to those in almendareztorres jones was indicted and convict ed of carjacking in violation of 18 usc 2119 conviction carried sent ence of imprisonment for not more 15 years 18 usc 21191 but the maximum ntence was increased to 25 years if the offense resulted in serious bodily injury 18 usc 21192 and to life imprisonment if the offense resulted in death 18 usc 2119323 neither the indictment nor the instructions to the jury made any mention of bodily injury but the presentence report did and recommended sentence of 25 year s which the trial court imposed the court of appeals affirmed united states v jones 60 f3d 547 9th cir 1995 the supreme court in 54 decision reversed the court reasoned that th statute did not create single crime with three possible sentences instead it created three separate crimes each with its own penalty ie simple carjacking not more than 15 years carjacking where serious bodily injury results not more than 25 years and carjacking where death results life imprisonment the court observed however that while we think the fairest reading of 2119 treats the fact of serious bodily harm as an element not mere enhancement we recognize the possibility of the other view any doubt that might be prompted by the arguments for that other reading should however be resolved against it under the rule repeatedly affirmed that where statute is susceptible of two constructions by one of which grave nd doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided our duty is to adopt the latter 526 us at 239 to find otherwise the court believed might bring it into conflict with the principle that under the due process clau of the fifth amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the sixth amendment any fact other than priorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs9 24 only few weeks prior to appr endi near unanimous court announced castillo v united states 530 us 120 2000 another elementsorsent encingfactor decision in which it appeared hesitant to pursue jones broad implications the statute in question 18 usc 924c prohibited the use or carrying of fire arm in relation to crime of violence and increased the penalty dramatically when the weapon used or carried is for example machinegun 530 us at 121 internal quotation marks omitted in doing so the court concluded subsection 924c created series of crimes in which the presence of machinegun or one of the other sentenceescalating weapons was an element id although some might not find this construction more compelling than the one produced in jones the court did this is stronger separate crime case than either jones or almendarez torres cases in which we were closely divide d as to congress likely intent 530 us at 131 other than possibly this reference to jones castillo neither speaks nor hints of construction driven by the specter of unconstitutionality the court might have confirmed jones in castillo but apprendi state case provides broader baseconviction that increases the maximum penalty for crime must be charged in an

due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments embody principle that insists that other than the fact of prior conviction any fact that increases the penalty for crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximumhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs10 25 this case turns on the seemingly simple stion of what constitutes crime all of the constitutional protections turn on termining which facts constitute the crime that is which facts are the elements or ingr edients of crime historic authority establishes that crime includes every fact that is by law basis for imposing or increasing punishment in contrast with fact that mitigates punishment 530 us at 499501 26 i do not believe that the courts incre ase in the maximum penalty rule is required by the constitution last term in jones

which drove punishment beyond the applicable statutory maximum they seemed to leave unscathed the federal sentencing guidelines that operate only up to that maximum ussg 5g11a the apprendi dissenters however sensed conflict with apprendi s underlying rationale the actual princi ple underlying the courts decision the dissent opined may be that an fact other than prior convi ction that has the effect in real terms of increasing the maximu m punishment beyond an otherwise applicable range must be submitted to jury nd proved beyond reasonable doubt 530 us at 54344 oconnor j dissenting if so the dissenters speculated the principle thus would apply not only to schemes like new jerseys under which factual determination exposes the defendant to sentence beyond the prescribed statutory maximum but also to all determinatesentencing schemes in which the length of defendants sentence within the stat utory range turns on specific factual determinations eg the federal sentencing guidelines 530 us at 544 emphasis added httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs11 27 the principal dissent in addition treats us to lengthy disquisition on the benefits of determinate sentencing schemes and the effect of todays decision on the federal sentencing guidelines the guidelines are of course not before the court we therefore express view on the subject beyond what this court has already held see eg edwards v united states 523 us 511 515 1998 opinion of breyer j for unanimous court noting that of course petitioners statutory and constituti onal claims would make difference if it were possible to argue say that the sent ences imposed exceeded the maximum that the statutes permit for cocaineonly conspiracy that is because maximum sentence set by statute trumps higher sentence set fort h in the guidelines 530 us at 497 n21 28 it is likewise unnecessary to consider whether and if so how the rule regarding elements applies to the sentencing guidelines given the unique status that they have under mistretta v united states 488 us 361 1989 but it may be that this special status is irrelevant because the guidelines have the force and effect of laws id at 413 scalia j dissenting 530 us at 523 n11 29 i feel the need to say few words in re sponse to justice breyers dissent it sketches an admirably fair and efficient scheme of cr iminal justice designed for society that is prepared to leave criminal justice to the stat judges it is sometimes necessary to remind ourselves are part of the state and an increasi ngly bureaucratic part of it at that the founders of the american republic were not prep ared to leave it to the state which is why the jurytrial guarantee was one of the least controversial provisions of the bill of rights it has never been efficient but it has always been free 530 us at 498 scalia j concurring 30 the walton court thus characterized the finding of aggravating facts falling within the traditional scope of capital sentencing as choice between greater and lesser penalty not as process of raising the ceiling of th sentencing range available 526 us at 251and they added justice thomas conc urrence appeared to endorse this construction when he essentially concedes that the rule outlined in his concurring opinion would require the invalidation of the sentencing guidelines id in fact neither justice stevens in his opinion for the court nor justices thomas nor scalia in their concurrences offered great deal to allay the dissents concerns the court noted that the issue was not before it and that guideline sentences must fall within the maximum prescribed by statute27 justice thomas observed that the impact on the guidelines need not be addressed but sounded ambivalent on the merits of the issue28 justice scalia who joined in justice thomas concurrence wrote separately to emphasize the constitutional necessity of jury factfinding rather than the guidelineassisted judicial factfinding which he saw favored in justice breyers dissent29 there followed apprendi two rather unusual cases in one ring v arizona 536 us 584 2002 the court revers ed one its earlier decisions walton v arizona 497 us 639 1990 when the arizona supreme court asserted that walton was based on misunderstanding of ariz ona law in the second harris v united states 536 us 545 2002 the court upheld mcmillan on the votes of the four apprendi dissenters joined without written concurrence by justice scalia the court in jones explained that walton was premised on the understanding that defendant found guilty of capital ffense became subject to imposition of the death penalty without the need for any further judici fact finding30 the court inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs12 31 this court has previously considered and rejected the argument that the principles guiding our decision today render invalid state capital sentencing schemes requiring judges after jury verdict holding defendant guilty of capital crime to find specific aggravating factors before imposing sentence of death walton v arizona 497 us 639 647649 1990 id at 709714 stevens j dissenting for reasons we have explained the capital cases are not controlling neither the cases cited nor any other case permits judge to determine the existence of factor which makes crime capital offense what the cited cases hold is that once jury has found the defendant guilty of all the elements of an offense which carries as its maximum penalty the sentence of death it may be left to the judge to decide whether that maximum penalty rather than lesser one ought to be imposed the person who is charged with actions that expose him to the death penalty has an absolute entitlement to jury trial on all the elements of the charge almendareztorres 523 us at 257 n 2 scalia j dissenting emphasis deleted see also jones 526 us at 250251 530 us at 49697 32 any person who during and in relation to any crime of drug trafficking for which the person may be prosecuted in

that in fact arizona law permitted imposition of capital punishment only following judicial f act finding revelation that placed walton and apprendi clearly in conflict 536 us at 609 the clarification doomed walton which the court overruled to the extent that it allows sentencing judge sitting without jury to find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death penalty id in light of what was to follow ring may be understandable harris may be perplexing harris confirmed the continued vitality of mcmillan and appeared to confirm that apprendi does not govern sentencing beneath the canopy set by the statutory maximum for the crime of convi ction harris was c onvicted of selling drugs with pistol visible at his side 536 us at 550 by operation of 18 usc 924c1a he became subject to ma ndatory minimum sentence of imprisonment for not less than five years for carrying th pistol or not less than seven years for brandishing it or not less th an 10 years for discharging it32 the indictment under which he was convicted simply noted th at harris carried firearm during and in relation to drug trafficking mention was made of brandish ing but the court at sentencing found by preponderance of the evidence that subparagraph 924c1aii applied 536 us at 551 harri s argued that imposition of the judge found brandishing minimum rather than the grandjurycharged and juryfound carrying minimum contravened apprendi in the eyes of four members of the court justices kennedy oconnor and scalia and chief justice rehnquist mcmillan and apprendi are consistent because there is fundamental distinction between the factual findings th at were at issue in those two cases apprendi said that any fact extending the defendants sentence beyond the maximum authorized by the jurys ve rdict would have been considered anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs13 33 blakely v washington 124 sct 2531 2547 n1 2004 oc onnor j dissentingprior to today only one court the kansas supreme court had ever applied apprendi to invalidate application of guidelines schemeciting cases from each of the us courts of appeal see also united states v caba 241 f3d 98 101 1st cir 2001 apprendi simply does not apply to guideline findings including inter alia drug weight calculations that increase the defendants sentence but do not elevate th sentence to point beyond the lowest applicable maximum united states v white 240 f3d 127 136 2d cir 2001 apprendi does not alter this conclusion as again we read it to apply only when sentencing courts findings increase the penalty faced by the fendant above the statutory maximum for given count and not when they merely affect th length of sentence within the statutory range united states v kinter 235 f3d 192 199200 4th cir2000this contention essentially boils down to an argument that apprendi renders much if not all of the current sentencing practices under the sentencing guidelines unconstitutional the apprendi court however did not paint w ith the broad brush that kinter now offers us on the contrary the majority opinion explicitly limited its holding to factual determinations that increase the penalty for crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum the government contends and all of the courts of appeal to have considered the issue have thus far agreed that to find the prescribed statutory maximum as contemplated in apprendi one need only look to the language of the statut criminalizing the offense and further united states v doggett 230 f3d 160 166 5th cir 2000to the extent that doggett argues apprendi prohibits the trial court from determining the amount of drugs for relevant conduct purposes under the sentencing guidelines this argument is rejected the decision in apprendi was specifically limited to facts which increase the penalty beyond the statutoryelement of an aggravated crime and t hus the domain of the jury by those who framed the bill of rights the same cannot be said of fact increasing the mandatory minimum but not extending the sentence beyond the statutory maximum for the jurys verdict has authorized the judge to impose the minimum with or without the finding as mcmillan recognized the state may reserve this type of factual finding for the judge without violating the constitution 536 us at 557 the fifth justice justice breyer agreed with the result but could not see the distinction between mcmillan and apprendi yet his view that the sixth amendment accommodated judgefound sentencing f actors left him unwilling to extend apprendi to mandatory minimums given his percep tion of the consequences of such an extension 536 us at 569 the dissenters justices thomas steven s souter and ginsburg found in the constitution demand that if statute annexes higher degree of punishment based on certain circumstances exposing defenda nt to that higher degree of punishment requires that those circumst ances be charged in the i ndictment and proved beyond reasonable doubt 536 us at 576 blakely through all of this the lower federal appellate courts either implicitly or explicitly had as one held that the prescribed statutory maximum that triggered apprendi concerns was the maximum penalty assigned to the cr ime of conviction not the top of the range assigned to the ntencing guidelines base offense level for the crime of conviction33 the courts blakely decision raised questions about thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs14 maximum and does not invalidate courts f actual finding for the purpose of determining the applicable sentencing guidelines united states v corrado 227 f3d 528 542 6th cir 2000in this case defendants faced maximum sentence of twenty years on the rico conspiracy counts be cause the district court did not sentence either defendant to term of more than twenty years on the rico counts apprendi is not triggered hernandez v united states 226 f3d 839 841 7th cir 2000in so arguing however he overlooks the distinction between the prescrib ed statutory maximum and the various levels of punishment authorized by th sentencing guidelines the fact that different levels under the statutory maximum depe nd on proof of various aggravating facts is not enough to make those facts elements of the offens rather than sentencing factors united states v lewis 236 f3d 948 950 8th cir 2001defendant ar gues that the district court violated apprendi when it used the firearms seized dur ing the search to enhance his guidelines offense range this argument is misplaced because the enhancement did not affect the statutory maximum united states v ochoa 311 f3d 1133 1134 9th cir 2002pursuant to ussg 5g11c any application of 1b13 may not exceed the statutory maximum for the underlying offense of convic tion and therefore does not violate apprendi united states v heckard 238 f3d 1222 1235 10th cir 2001after apprendi judges may still ascertain drug quantities by preponderance of the evidence for the purpose of calculating offense levels under the sentencing guidelines so long as they do not sentence above the statutory maximum for the juryfixed crime united states v nealy 232 f3d 825 829 n3 11th cir 2000the sentencing gu idelines are not

strike down state sentencing guideline enhancement that fell well within the maximum sentence provided for the crime of conviction blakely had kidnapped his estranged wife bound her with duct tape stuffed her into wooden crate in the bed of his truck and driven her from washington to montana34 he eventually pled guilty to second degree kidnaping involving domestic violence and use of fir earm class b felony under washington state law35 class b felonies were punishable by imprisonment for maximum of 10 years36 under the applicable washington statutory senten cing guidelines the crime was punishable by imprisonment within the standard range of 49 to 53 months37 second statutory guideline provision however author ized the court to impose more severe sentence an upward departure when it found additional aggravating factors unaccounted for in the standard range38 upon hearing the circumstances of the offense the court found that the crime d been committed with deliberate cruelty and sentenced blakely to 90 month term of imprisonment39 the washington appellate court found blakelys apprendi argument unpersuasive although the enhanced senten ce was based on judicial findings of fact that carried it beyond the ceiling set by the standard guideline range for the crime ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs15 40 id 41 if the washington scheme does not comport with the constitution it is hard to imagine guidelines scheme that would what i have feared most has now come to pass over 20 years of sentencing reform are all but lost 124 sct at 2549 oconnor j dissenting perhaps the court will distinguish the federal sentencing guidelines but i am uncertain how as result of todays decisi on federal prosecutors like state prosecutors must decide what to do next how to handle tomorrows case federal prosecutors will proceed with those prosecutions subject to the risk that all defendants in those cases will have to be sentenced perhaps tried anew 124 sct at 2561 breyer j dissenting 42 as noted earlier although referred to as the booker case the courts decision applies to both booker and fanfan conviction sentence of 90 months was still well within the 10 year 120 month maximum established for such offenses40 the united states supr eme court disagreed blakely v washington 124 sct 2531 2004 the question in blakely was simply did the prescribed statutory maximum that triggered jury trial and proof beyond reasonable doubt requirements refer to the 10 year maximum for second degree kidnaping or to the 53 month maximum of the sentencing guidelines sta ndard sentencing range in the mind of the blakely court the statutory maximum for apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant in other words the relevant statutory maximum is not the maximum sentence judge may impose after finding additional facts but the maximum he may impose without any additional facts 124 sct at 2537 emphasis of the court internal cita tions omitted blakelys guilty plea did not include the facts upon which the senten cing court had relied to enhance his sentence from the maximum 53 months that his plea would have supported the 90 month enhanced sentence the court had imposed thus because the states sentencing procedure did not comply with the sixth amendment petitioners sentence is invalid 124 sct at 2538 the blakely court expressly declined to comme nt on the application if any of this principle to the federal sentencing guidelines the united states as amicus curiae urges us to affirm it notes differences between washingtons sentencing regime and the federal sentencing guidelines but questions whether those differences are constitutionally significant the federal guidelines are not before us and we express opinion on them 124 sct at 2538 n9 as they had in apprendi justices oconnor and brey er in dissent expressed concern for impact of the decision on the federal sentencing guidelines41 fanfan and booker the court addressed that concern in booker 125 sct 738 200542 fanfan and booker were each convicted of controlled substances offenses united states v fanfan 2004 wl 1723114 2 dme june 28 2004 united states v booker 375httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs16 43 according to blakely and im quoting directly here now our precedents make clear however that the statutory maximum for apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence judge may impose solely on the basis of the fact s reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant in other words the relevant statutory ma ximum is not the maximum sentence judge may impose after finding additional facts but the maximum he may impose without any additional findings when judge inflicts puni shment that the jurys verdict alone does not allow the jury has not found all the facts which the law makes essential to the punishment and the judge exceeds his proper authority moreover the blakely court in adhering to the principles of its earlier apprendi decision states at an nother point and i quote apprendi carries out this design by ensuring that the judges authority to sentence derives wholly from the jurys verdict without that restriction the jury would not exercise th control that the framers intended and one other quotation near the end of the opinion as apprendi held every defendant has the right to insist that the prosec utor prove to jury all facts legally essential to the punishment 2004 wl 1723114 12 44 i see basis upon which to avoid the reasoning of blakely just because im applying federal guidelines rather than washington state guidelines indeed i note that the solicitor general of the united states the top government lawyer for the supreme court expressed his concern to the supreme court that holding such as the court came up with in blakely would jeopardize the federal sentencing guidelines returning back to the quotation from the s olicitors brief such rule would have profound consequences for the federal guidelines as explained more fully below facts other than the elements of the offense enter into almost all of the calculations under the guidelines beginning with the most basi c calculations for determining the offenders presumptive sentencing range decision in favor of petitioner the solicitor general goes on of course thats exactly what blakely did he says could thus raise serious question about whether apprendi applies to myriad factual determinations under the guidelines so although the blakely court did not address the federal guidelines i do conclude that the solicitor general was exactly corre ct in his briefing that decision like blakely applies to the federal guidelines 3 4f3d 508 509 7th cir 2004 in both instances application of the sentencing guidelines would require sentencing with in ranges beyond those supported by the jury verdict alone in fanfans case 15 to 16 years 188 to 235 months rather than five to six years 63 to 78 months and in bookers case 30 years to life 360 months to life rather than 17 to 21 years 210 to 262 months the lesson of blakely for the district court in fanfan was clear judge may not sentence defendant other than on facts found by the jury43 the court agreed with suggestions in the solicitor generals blakely amicus brief and in the remarks of the dissenters in blakely that for purposes of constitutional analysis the federal sentencing guidelines were i ndistinguishable from those in blakely 44 majority of the appellate panel in booker concurred that the lesson of blakely is that the statutory maximum for apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant 375 f3d at 510 quoting blakely 124 sct at 2536 and therefore that blakely dooms the guidelines insofar as they require that sentences behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs17 45 the defendants in edwards v united states 523 us 511 1998 sought to avoid the consequences of judicial sentencing determ inations through the doctrine of constitutional avoidance in judge easterbrook s view the courts opinion in edwards acknowledged that constitutional contentions have been advanced edwards held that judge nonetheless may ascertain using the preponderance standard the type and amount of drugs involved and impose sentence based on that conclusion as long as the sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum 375 f3d at 516 based on facts found by judge 375 f3d at 511 although the ppellate panel did not rule on severability it did comment upon the consequences of severance to summarize 1 the application of the guidelines in this case violated the sixth amendment as interpreted in blakely 2 in cases where there are enhancements that is factual findings by the judge increasing the sentence there is constitutional violation applying the guidelines unless the guidelines are invalid in their entirety 3 we do not decide the severability of the guidelines and so that is an issue for consideration on remand should it be made an issue by the parties 4 if the guid elines are severable the judge can use sentencing jury if not he can choose an sentence between 10 years and life and in making the latter determination he is free to draw on the guidelines for recommendations as he sees fit 5 as matter of prudence the judge should in any event select nonguidelines alternative sentence 375 f3d at 515 judge easterbrook cited two reasons for hi s dissent to the panels decision 1 the supreme courts decision in edwards overshadows the field to an extent that only the supreme court by overturning edwards would permit the lower courts to apply blakely to the federal sentencing guidelines 375 f3d at 51617 and 2 blakely is inapplicable to the sentencing guidelines because unlike the washington scheme in federal law there is only one maximum statutory sentence and that is the maximum sentence assigned the cr ime of conviction 375 f3d at 5172145 the court granted certiorari for expedite d consolidated review of the cases in order to consider two ques tions 125 sct 11 12 2004 did apprendiblakely apply to the federal sentencing guidelines and if so how much if any of the guidelines or the sentencing act under which they were created remained viable the answers were easily stated but splintered the court yet again the principles announced in apprendiblakely apply to the federal sentencing guidelines 125 sct 746 as consequence the statutory provisions which made the guidelines binding on federal trial courts and those whic h directed federal appellate courts to ensure their binding applica tion must be severed from the sentencing reform act 125 sct 75657 the answers required an opinion of two separate parts each written and with one exception espoused by different array of the justices justice ginsburg joined the four apprendiblakely jury right justices steve ns scalia souter and thomas in the part of the courts opi nion devoted to the issue of apprendiblakely s application to the federal sentencing guidelines and she then joined the four apprendiblakely judicial sentenci ng factor dissenters rehnquist oconnor kennedy and breyer in the part of th courts opinion devoted to the issue ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs18 46 regardless of whether the legal basis for the accusation which brings with it penalty increase is in statute or in guidelines promulgated by an independent commission the principles behind the jury trial right are equally applicable 125 sct at 753severance other than justice ginsburg each of the justices wrote or joined dissenting opinion on the question of application justi ce stevens opinion for the court rather quickly dispensed with the counterappli cation arguments it was said that apprendiblakely does not apply to the guidelines because 1 the guidelines are the work of commission rather than legisla tive body they are guidelines not statutes they establish guideline maximum penalties not statutory maximum penalties 2 the courts past treatment of the guide lines belies the possibility of any sixth amendment infirmities as matter of stare decisis and 3 to elevate the guidelines to the status of legislation for sixth amendment purposes w ould offend separation of powers principles to whic h the court responded 1 the cr itical defect in apprendi blakely and booker is the intrusion upon the function of the jury not the name given the intrusive mechanism46 2 none of the court s earlier cases addressed the sixth amendments application to the guidelines there is conflicting stare decisis 125 sct at 754 and 3 mistretta made clear that the guidelines constitute the exercise of constitutionally valid delegation of authority 125 sct at 755 the court repeated the ways in which it has described the basic apprendi principle that puts these objecti ons to rest other than the fact of prior conviction any fact that increases the penalty for crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt 125 sct at 748 quoting apprendi v new jersey 530 us at 490 if state makes an increase in defendants authorized punishme nt contingent on the finding of fact that fact matter how the state labels it must be found by ju ry beyond reasonable doubt 125 sct at 749 quoting ring v arizona 536 us at 602 the statutory maximum for apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant 125 sct at 749 quoting blakely v washington 124 sct at 2537 the opinion ends with view of the principle from yet fourth angle any fact other than prior conviction which is necessary to support sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by plea of guilty or jury verdict must be admitted by the fendant or proved to jury beyond reasonable doubt 125 sct at 756 of course while at least since almendareztorres the five justice who joined in justice stevens opinion for the court have rather consistently identified this principle as an unavoidable ttribute of the sixth amendment right to jury trial the other four members of the cour t have just as consistently objected that the principle cannot be found there 125 sct at 802 b reyer j with rehnquist chj oconnor and kennedy jj dissentingciting dissents in various cases to that effect the courts treatment of the second ques tion may have come as surprise to some there were arguably three more predictable remedies assuming in response to the first question that the guidelines operated to impermissibly permit judges byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs19 47 we answer the remedial question by looking to the legislative intent we seek to determine what congress would have intended in light of the courts constitutional holding hence we must decide whether we would deviate less radically from congress intended system 1 by superimposing the constitutional requirement announced today or 2 through elimination of some provisions of the statute while reasonable minds can and do differ about the outcome we conclude that the constitutional jury trial requirement is not compatible with the act as written and that some severance and excision are necessary in essence 1 why congress would likel have preferred the total invalidation of the act to an act with the courts sixth amendm ent requirement engrafted onto it and 2 why congress would likely have preferred the exci sion of some of the act namely the acts mandatory language to the invalidation of the entire act id internal citations and quotations omitteda preponderance of the evidence to make sentencing decision constitutionally reserved for the jury beyond reasonable doubt the infirmity might prove fatal to the guidelines as whole or it might only prove fatal to those guidelines provisions that set the preponderance standard and made the impermissible factfinding assignment or it might simply require that the judge and the guidelines act only upon those factual determin ations found by the jury beyond reasonable doubt or conceded by the defendant the second part of the courts opinion embraced none these options justice stevens in part one of the courts opinion gave hint of what was to come when he observed that the constitutional defect in the manner which the guidelines had been operated was product of their mandatory nature if the guidelines as currently writte n could be read as merely advisory provisions that recommended rather than required the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts their use would not implicate the sixth amendment we have never doubted the authority of judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing sentence within statutory range indeed everyone agrees that the constitutional issues presented by these cases would have been avoided entirely if congress had omitted from the sra sentencing reform act the provisions that make th guidelines binding on district judges it is that circumstance that makes th courts answer to the second question presented possible for when trial j udge exercises his discretion to select specific sentence within defined range the defendant has right to jury determination of the facts that the judge deems relevant 125 sct at 750 this suggested the remedy congress woul d have preferred nd consequently the remedy the court adopted only the statut ory provisions that made the guidelines mandatory need be pruned from the system so concluded the second part of the courts booker opinion which also explained how the court anticipated the modified federal sentencing system would operating thereafter nd how the opinion applied to booker and fanfan the court writing through justice breyer with the concurrence of chief justice rehnquist and justices oconnor kennedy and ginsburg reasoned that congress would have preferred the demise of the sentencing reform act to guidelines system in which the jury made the factual decisions which the guidelines had originally assigned to the judge and it would have preferred an advisory guidelines system over the loss of the sentencing reform act 125 sct at 7575847httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs20 48 the statutes text states that the cour t when sentencing will consider the the nature and circumstances of the offense and the hist ory and characteristics of the defendant in context the words the court mean the judg without the jury not the judge working together with the jury the further statut ory provision by removing typical jury trial evidentiary limitations makes this clear see 3661 ruling out any limitation on the information concerning the offenders background character and conduct that the court may receive the acts history confirms it see eg srep 98225 p 51 1983the guidelines system w ill guide the judge in making sentencing decisions emphasis added id at 52 before sentencing the judge must consider the nature of the offense id at 53 the judge must consider comprehensive examination of the characteristics of the particular offense nd the particular offender 125 sct at 759 49 congress basic statutory goal system that diminishes sentencing disparity depends for its success upon judicial efforts to determine and to base punishment upon the real conduct that underlies the crime of conviction 125 sct at 759 empha sis of the court 50 congress would not have enacted sentencing statutes that make it more difficult to adjust sentences upward than to adjust them downward 125 sct at 763 emphasis of the court this assumes that the sixth amendment right ttaches only with regard to fact finding that increases the otherwise applicable sentence 51 except as provided in paragraph 2 th court shall impose sentence of the kind and within the range referred to in subsection 4 unless the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of kind or to degree not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in sentence different from that described in determining whether circumstance was adequately taken into consideration the court shall consider only the sentencing guidelines policy statements and official commentary of the sentencing commission in the absence of an applicable sentencing guideline the c ourt shall impose an appropriate sentence having due regard for the purposes set forth in subsec tion a2 in the absence of an applicable sentencing guideline in the case of an offense other than petty offense the court shall also have due regard for the relationship of the sentence imposed to sentences prescribed by guidelines applicable to similar offenses and offenders and to the applicable policy statements of the sentencing commission 18 usc 3553b1 for whatever reason the court did not address 18 usc 3553b2 which binds sentencing courts to the guidelines in child and sexual abuse cases even more tightly than does b1 and whose continued vitality some may question see eg united states v starpley f3d n3 2d cir feb 16 2005 booker excises 18 usc 3553b1the court inferred these preferences 1 from the language of the statute48 2 from congressional purpose in passing the act49 3 from the fact that the sentencing statutes read to include the courts sixth amendment requirement would create system far more comple x than congress coul d have intended 125 sct at 761 4 from the fact that reduced judicial role and an increased jury role would exacerbate the problems inherent in plea bargaining 125 sct at 76263 5 from the fact that congress would not have intended system that encumbered the imposition of more severe sentences but not of more lenient ones50 and 6 from the fact that most of the act and most of the guidelines could continue to function effectively and constitu tionally by severing but two provisions of the act 125 sct at 764 the court then described the sentencing system that remained after severing 18 usc 3553b1 which required trial c ourts to follow the dictates of the guidelines51 and 18 usc 3472e which instruct ed the appellate courts to makehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs21 from the sentencing reform act which makes the guidelines generally binding on courts but does not excise 18 usc 3553b2 which makes the guidelines binding in sentencing for convictions for certain child crimes and sexual offenses subsection b2 could arguably be read to independently require court to follow the guidelines in convictions for certain child crimes and sexual offenses however we see unique feature of guidelines sentences for child crimes and xual offenses that would prevent them from violating the sixth amendment in the same manner as guidelines sentences for other crimes for this reason we suspect that th supreme courts failure to excise the entirety of section 3553b was simply an oversight 52 upon review of the record the court of appeals shall determine whether the sentence 1 was imposed in violation of law 2 was im posed as result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines 3 is outside the applicable guideline range and the district court failed to provide the written st atement of reasons

court to judge the credibility of the witnesses and sh all accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous and except with respect to determinations under subsection 3a or 3b shall give due defere nce to the district courts application of the guidelines to the facts with respect to determinations under subs ection 3a or 3b the court of appeals shall review novo the di strict courts application of the guidelines to the facts 18 usc 3742e 53 section 3553a provides the court shall impose sentence sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes t forth in paragraph 2 of this subsection the court in determining the particular sent ence to be imposed shall consider 1 the nature and circumstances of the offense and th history and characteristics of the defendant 2 the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense to promote respect for the law and to provide ju st punishment for the ffense b to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct c to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant and d to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training medical care

similar conduct and 7 the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense 54 prior to its repeal in 2003 18 usc 3742 e3 provided that upon review of the record the court of appeals shall determine whether the sentence 3 is outside the applicable guideline range and is unreasonable having regard for the factors to be considered in imposing sentence as set fo rth in chapter 227 of this title eg 18 usc 3553a and b the reasons for the imposition of the particular sentence as stated by the district court pursuant to the provisions of section 3553c 55 rule 52 of the federal rules of criminal procedure provides that any error defect irregularity or variance that does not affect s ubstantial rights must be disregarded but that plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the courts attention in timely manner 56 neither of the two court opinions that decide these cases finds any constitutional infirmity inherent in any provision of the sentencing reform act of 1984 sra or the federal sentencing guidelines it is i ndisputable that the vast majority of federal sentences under the guidelines would have complied with the sixth amendment without the courts extraordinary reme dy under any reasonable read ing of our precedents in way can it be said that the guidelines are or that any particular guidelines provision is facially unconstitutional our severability precedents however ca nnot support the courts remedy because there is provision of the sra or the guidelines that falls outside of congress power there is justifi cation for extending our severability cases to cover this situation the sra and the guidelin can be read and are being currently read in way that complies with the sixth amendment rather than engage in wholesale rewriting of the sra i would simply allow the government to continue doing what it has done since this court handed down blakely prove any fact that is required to increase defendants sentence under the guidelines to jury beyond reasonable doubt 125 sct at 771 776 777 779 stevens j with scalia and souter jj dissentingto appeal by either the government the defendant or both under 18 usc 3742ab 125 sct 765 the standard by wh ich such appeals are to be judged is one of the reasonableness as underst ood from the jurisprudence that arose under 18 usc 3742e3 prior to its repeal with respect to departures and the review of sentences for which there was app licable guideline 125 sct at 7656754 booker applies to all cases on direct review to the extent the sentence imposed gives rise to the constitutional rights announced in booker and within the confines of the plain error rule and the h armless error doctrine 125 sct at 76955 justices stevens souter scalia and thomas dissented from the second part of the courts opinion justice stevens joined by justice souter and in large part by justice scalia pointed out that from his pe rspective none of the sentence reform act provisions or of the guidelines were unconstitutional on their face and thus the question of severability did not arise56 moreover even if this were not the case hehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs23 57 125 sct at 77982 58 the court cannot meet this burden because congress has already considered and overwhelmingly rejected the system it enacts today in doing so congress revealed both an unmistakable preference for the certainty of binding regime and deep suspicion of judges ability to reduce disparities in federal sentence brief examination of the sras history reveals the gross impropriety of the re medy the court has selected 125 sct at 783 it is this legislative history discussion in jus tice stevens dissent that justice scalia declined to join 59 congress stated goal of uniformity is eliminated by the majoritys remedy disparities will undoubtedly increase in disc retionary system in which the guidelines are but one factor judge must consider in ntencing defendant w ithin broad statutory range prior to the guidelines regime the parole commission was designed to reduce sentencing disparities and to provide check for defendants who received excessive sentences today the court reenacts the disc retionary guidelines system that once existed without providing this crucial safety net 125 sct at 78788 60 today the same justices who dissented in blakely wreak havoc on federal district and appellate courts quite needlessly and for the indefinite future will appellate review for unreasonableness preserve facto mandatory guidelines by discouraging district courts from sentencing outside the guidelines ranges will it simply add another layer of unfettered judicial discretion to the sentencing process or will it be mere formality used by busy appellate judges only to ensure that busy district judges say all the right things when they explain how they have exercised their ne wly restored discretion time may tell but todays remedial majority will not 125 sct at 795 scalia j dissenting 61 while i agree with justice stevens pr oposed remedy and much of his analysis i disagree with his restatement of severability principles and reliance on legislative history the constitution prohibits allowing judge alone to make finding that raises the sentence beyond the sentence that could have lawfully been imposed by reference to facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant application of the federal sentencing guidelines resulted in impermissible factfinding in bookers case but not in fanfans thus bookers sentence is unconstitutional but fanfans is not rather than applying the usual presumption in favor of severability and leav ing the guidelines standing insofar as they may be applied without any constitutional problem the remedial majority converts the guidelines from mandatory system to disc retionary one the majoritys solution fails to tailor the remedy to the wrong as this courts precedents require 125 sct at 795 thomas j dissentingwould find the majority view unpersuasive because 1 the reasons offered for its acceptance he found unconvincing57 2 the legislative hist ory argues for different conclusion58 and 3 he believed the goal of the sentence reform act and of the guidelines the reduction of sentencing di versity is more likely to be frustrated than served by the majoritys remedy59 justices scalia and thomas were in general agreement with justice stevens dissent but justice scalia wrote separate dissent to articulate his reservations concerning the possibly uncertain state of post booker appellate review60 justice thomas had somewhat different view of the severability question and like justice scalia was unwilling place any re liance upon legislative history61 and what of mr booker and mr fanfan the court affirmed the court of appeals decision vacating booke rs sentence because the trial court had increased ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs24 based on facts other than those found by the jury on remand the district court should impose sentence in acco rdance with the courts booker opinions and if the sentence comes before the court of ppeals for review the court of appeals should apply the review standards set forth in booker 125 sct at 769 fanfan had been sentenced solely within the fact s found by the jury and consequently below the range called for by the guidelines the court vacated fanfans sentence and remanded his case to permit the parties to seek resentencing consistent with the courts opinion if they elect to do so id the alignment of the justices in booker renders predictions of its legacy even more perilous than usual why did jus tice ginsburg join the four justices who believed booker presented sixth amendment probl em in the part of the courts opinion designed to solve the problem some may find illumination in case the court decided two months after booker shepard v united states 125 sct 039168mar 3 2005 shepard shepard arose out of what might be consid ered unusual circum stances at first glance factual dispute over the existence and status of prior criminal convictions shepard involved the application of the federal armed career criminal act acca 18 usc 924e which requires the im position of minimum 15year term of imprisonment for unlawful possession of firearm 18 usc 922g by an individual with three prior serious drug or violent felony convictions burglaries are numbered among the qualifying violent cr imes for purposes of 18 usc 924e 18 usc 924e2bii the court has interpreted burglary to include any offense consisting of the unlawful or unpr ivileged entry into or remaining in building or other structure with intent to commit crime regardless of how it is captioned taylor v united states 495 us 575 599 1990 shepard had pleaded guilty to possession of firearm in violation of 18 usc 922g1 united states v shepard 348 f3d 308 309 1st cir 2003 at the time he had five prior convictions also following guilty pleas under massachusetts statutes that outlawed breaking and entering into building ship vessel or vehicle with the intent to commit crime id the complaints under which he was charged and pleaded recited the language of the statutes without indicating whether the premises entered were burgl aryqualifying buildings or nonqualifying ships vessels or vehicles id the government offered copies of the back ground police reports and complaint applications to demonstrate th at shepard had previously been convicted of breaking into buildings rather than ships vessels or vehicles id at 30910 the trial court found this called for impermissible judicial factfinding in order to impose the mandatory minimum penalty under 18 usc 924e the court of appeals disagreed id at 31015 the supreme court agr eed with the district court and reversed 125 sct at shepard arguably afforded the court an opportunity to walk away from the almendareztorres prior conviction exception to the apprendi rule justice thomas at least implicitly urged his colleagues to do so they declined 125 sct at thomas j concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in pluralityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32573crs25 62 the constitutional infirmity of 924e1 as applied to shepard makes todays decision an unnecessary exercise nevertheless the plurality today refines the rule of taylor v united states and further instructs district courts on the evidence they may consider in determining whether prior state convic tions are 924e predicate offenses taylor and todays decision thus explain to lower court s how to conduct factfinding that is according to the logic of this courts intervening prec edents unconstitutional in this very case the need for further refinement of taylor endures because this court has not yet reconsidered almendareztorres v united states which draws an exception to the apprendi line of cases for judicial factfinding that concer ns defendants prior convictions almendareztorres like taylor has been eroded by this courts subs equent sixth amendment jurisprudence and majority of the court now recognizes that almendareztorres was wrongly decided the parties do not request it here but in an appropriate case this court should consider almendareztorres continued viability 125 sct at internal citations omitted 63 the sentencing judge considerin g the acca enhancement would on the governments view make disputed finding of fact about what the defendant and state judge must have understood as the factual basis of the prior plea and the dispute raises the concern underlying jones and apprendi the sixth and fourteenth amendments guarantee jury standing between defendant and the pow er of the state and they guarantee jurys finding of any disputed fact essential to in crease the ceiling of potential sentence while the disputed fact here can be described as fact about prior conviction it is too far removed from the conclusive significance of prior judicial record and too much like the findings subject to jones and apprendi to say that almendareztorres clearly authorizes judge to resolve the dispute the rule of reading statutes to avoid serious risks of unconstitutionality therefore counsels us to lim it the scope of judicial factfinding on the disputed generic character of prior plea just as taylor constrained judi cial findings about the generic implications of jurys verdict 125 sct at plurality opinion for the courtopinion five members of the court justi ces stevens scalia souter ginsburg and thomas concluded that in the case of statute permitting conviction for either qualifying generic burglaries or nonqualifyi ng nongeneric burglaries qualification must be shown either in the charging document the terms of plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and fendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the fendant or some comparable judicial record of this information or in the charge to the jury 125 sct at justice thomas would reach the result by constitutional necessity62 the others as matter of statutory construction in constitutional avoidance63 the dissenters justices oconnor kenne dy and breyer felt the result was required neither by the constitution nor by statute 125 sct
