asianonmilitary inducements including culture diplomacy foreign aid trade and investmenthas presented new challenges to us foreign policy by downplaying many conflictin g interests and working collaboratively with countries and regional organizations on such issues as territorial disputes and trade beijing has largely allayed southeast asian concerns that china poses military or economic threat chinas diplomatic engagement compared to the percei ved waning or limited attention by the united states has earned the country greater respect in the region its rise as major foreign aid provider and market for southeast asian goods has also enhanced its relations with southeast asian states many analysts contend that chinas growing influence may come at the expense of us power and influence in the region this report provides evidence and analysis of chinas soft power in southeast asia it does not discuss the considerable us military presence in the region the report describes chinas evolving diplomacy and more active role in regi onal organizations such as the association of southeast asian nations asean although chinas foreign aid to southeast asia as in other regions is difficult to quantify and includes broader range of economic assistance than official development assistance oda offered by major industrialized nations it is believed to be relatively large china is considered to be the primary economic patron of the small but strategically important nations of burma cambodi and laos and also provides considerable economic aid to indonesia and the philippines chinas trade with asean countries is less than us trade with the region 1609 billion compared to 1685 billion in 2006 but is expected to exceed that of the united states in 2007 and beyond furthermore although china runs trade surplus with the world it runs trade deficit with asean countries 182 billion compared to the usasean trade deficit of 539 billion china appears to have moved more quickly than the united states in promoting trade with the region through establishing free trade agreements ftas however although the importance of the united states to asean trade has declined somewhat relative to that of china the united states is still major source of the regions foreign direct investment fdi ranking 4 th from 2002 through 2006 compared to china ranking 10th analysts differ over chinas longerterm intentions in southeast asia and their implications for the united states some observers argue that the consequences of chinas growing soft power and beijings aim is the decline of us influence in the region others contend that the implications of chinas rise are not zero sum and that at least in the next 1525 years beijings priority will be economic development and that chinas leaders as well as the leaders of other southeast asian countries view the united states continuing leadership role in the region as beneficial competing us policy approaches in clude continuing the current level of us political and economic engagement in the region containing chinas rise or bolstering the us diplomatic foreign aid and economic presence in tandem with chinas rise this report will

southeast asia and other parts of the world to its use of soft powerdiplomacy foreign assistance trade and investment and the view of china as vast potential market1 as part of its charm offensive in the region the peoples republic of china prc has projected benign national image through adopting more accommodating foreign policy actively participating in regional organizations providing significant amounts of foreign assistance and boosting its economic ties with considerable benefits accruing to southeast asian states 2 according to some analysts chinas rising soft power has become all the more striking in relation to tepid or inconsistent us attention to the region the term soft power as originally conceived by harvard professor joseph nye jr referred to the ability to affect the behaviors of other countries by attracting and persuading others to adopt ones goals by contrast hard power was described primarily as military might 3 the united states has exerted both hard and soft power in southeast asia in terms of soft power many southeast asian peoples historically have been attracted to us popular culture democratic values and institutions human rights policies free market system high living standards technological advances and internationally renowned institutions of higher learning the united states also remains influential as large market for southeast asian exports however according to some indicators in the past decade many of these forms of us soft power have declined in both absolute and relative terms for many analysts chinas growing influence or soft power in southeast asia and elsewhere is mostly economic rather than military hard power cultural or political chinas growing ability to affect the actions of state actors largely stems from its role as major source of foreign aid trade and investment the prc has also wielded power in the region through diplomacy and to lesser extent admiration of china as model for development and ancient culture and an emphasis on shared asian values in addition overseas chinese communities have long played important parts in the economies societies and cultures of southeast asian states along with offering economic inducements china has allayed concerns that it poses military or economic threat assured its neighbors that it strives to be responsible member of the international community and produced real benefits to the region through aid trade and investment 4 china may be gaining on the united states in the areas of cultural and political soft power as well at least in some countries in the region 2007 pew research poll found that only 29 of indonesians and 27 of malaysians polled had favorable view of the united states as opposed to 83 of malaysians and 65 of indonesians who had favorable views of china americans 1 southeast asia includes east timor and the 10 members of the association of southeast asian nations asean brunei burma cambodia indonesia laos malaysia singapore

hard power may also include economic might the concept of soft power originally appeared in nyes 1990 book bound to lead the changing nature of american power the concept was further developed in his 2004 volume soft power the means to success in world politics 4 in the southeast asian context chinese soft powercan include ec onomic benefits shared norms and values cooperation on nontraditional

having favorable view towards americans in 2007 the figure for indonesia is up slightly from favorable view of only 15 in 2003 but remains well below the 2000 rate of 755 one striking exception to this trend is the philippines which ranks first in the world in trusting the united states to act responsibly in global affairs according to 2007 survey6 such trends in polls led joseph nye to state that although china is far from americas equal in soft power it would be foolish to ignore the gains it is making it is time for the us to pay more attention to the balance of soft power in asia 7

in the past decade the prcs support for various communist insurgencies in the region during the cold war its military response to vietnams incursion into cambodia in 1979 and its forceful claims to disputed islands in the south china sea during the 1990s created strains with its neighbors in the region however since the asian financial crisis of 1997 china increasingly has emphasized mutual benefits or soft power over hard power or the threat of hard power in its relations with southeast asian states in 1997 during the asian financial crisis china won praise in the region when it refrained from devaluing its currency which helped to stabilize the regions economy in 2002 china and other claimants to disputed islands signed an agreement and declaration on the conduct of parties in the south china sea which greatly reduced tensions on this issue while there is general agreement that chinas tactics have changed to more accommodating posture with an emphasis on soft power there is less certainty regarding its implications and whether chinas goals have changed accordingly

asia leads to subregional division between its relatively more influential position with mainland southeast asian states particularly burma cambodia and laos and its relatively less influential position with maritime southeast asian states indonesia the philippines and singapore8 thailand while more independent than burma laos and cambodia and along with the philippines major nonnato ally of the united states appears to be relatively more comfortable with close relations with china than other regional states muslims in the region indonesia malaysia look not so much to china as they do to the rest of the muslim world for models outside their national settings given that muslims represent approximately half the population of southeast asia and are concentrated in maritime southeast asia this should place limits on the extent of chinese soft power influence there vietnams unique historical relationship with china which includes past domination by china and more recent border war will also place limits on the extent to which those two nations will likely come together singapore the most strategic thinking and trade dependent state in the region has promoted balanced approach to the

asia is the organizing principle of their respective approaches both countries foreign policy approaches to the region contain elements of an array of priorities including geopolitical security and trade interests that said the us approach places an emphasis on democracy and related objectives along with its main theme of promoting us security interests by contrast chinas noninterference policy is less intrusive in the domestic affairs of regional states while this approach may not garner widespread admiration it is more palatable to relatively authoritarian regimes in the region and sometimes earns public appreciation because it appears respectful of national sovereignty chinas changed bilateral relations with australia are an interesting parallel to recent dynamics in southeast asia and demonstrate how the economic aspect of soft power can transform bilateral relationship with state that is close treaty ally of the united states australias strong economic growth in recent years has been to large extent based on exports of raw materials to china this has produced reticence to adopt policies that could anger china it has even led to some discussion of whether the australianew zealandunited states alliance pertains to potential future conflict over taiwan australia clearly does not want to be forced to choose between its robust and important security alliance with the united states and its rapidly growing and lucrative trade with china 9 g20g142g144g146g152g151g138g149g561g17g155g144g138g151g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 china has been an increasingly active player in multilateral organizations that include southeast asian states such as asean plus threeasean china japan and south koreaand the east asia summit eas which includes china japan south korea india australia and new zealand as well as the asean states the diplomacy surrounding the formation of the eas in 2005 is particularly noteworthy the lack of u s involvement with the eas contrasts sharply with the central role that the united states s played in the asia pacific economic cooperation apec group 10 the formation of the eas also demonstrated the differing levels of comfort that asean member states have with china some asean states pr eferred bringing in india australia and new zealand as nonamerican balance to chinese influence one factor that appears to be in chinas favor is increased regional support for more asiaoriented grouping this reflects the desire on the part of some regional states for more asiacentered focus rather than transpacific group that would include the united states 11 movement in this direction can be traced back to former prime minister mahathir mohammad of malaysia who advocated an asian stateonly grouping through the east asia economic caucus g5g145g146g151g138g514g156g561g8g152g155g142g146g144g151g561g3g146g141g561g157g152g561g21g152g158g157g145g142g138g156g157g561g3g156g146g138g561 chinas foreign aid has had growing

region china provides relatively little development assistance and lacks formal system for determining development goals and allocating aid13 the prc administers wider range of economic assistance that includes nondevelopment aid and lowinterest loans as well as trade and investment agreements according to some analysts when these kinds of assistance are added china becomes one of the largest bilateral aid donors in southeast asia furthermore because china offers assistance without the conditions that other donors frequently place on aid ie democratic reform market opening and environmental protections it often garners appreciation disproportionate to the size of its aid and thus has large impact on recipient governments14 chinas policy of noninterference in domestic affairs often wins friends not only among southeast asian governme nts but also by many peoples in the region because it is regarded as respectful of their countries sovereignty although prc assistance reportedly is often not carried out as pledged such aid announced at lavish receptions with toasts to the recipient countries often carries great symbolic value15 many prc aid projects such as government buildings infrastructure and energy facilities often funded by loans from the china importexport bank and built by chinese companies are high profile efforts that primarily benefit capital cities or the governments in power many foreign aid experts nongovernmental organizations ngos and local groups have criticized chinese aid for failing to promote democracy widespread

many reports of prc aid in the region focus on burma cambodia and laos the poorest countries in southeast asia and ones that have had relatively unfriendly relations with the united states china is considered the primary economic patron of these countries and provides an implicit security guarantee 16 china also provides considerable assistance to vietnam although its influence upon its former adversary appears limited compared to other countries the united states has major aid presence in cambodia and vietnam17 however according to data of official development assistance which does not include china japan is the largest bilateral aid donor among these countries 12 several reasons are given for the lack of reliable data on chinese aid including the following many forms of prc foreign aid such as loans the building of large public facilities and infrastructure projects and trade and investment agreements are not counted as official development assistance oda the principal form of aid provided by major donor countries chinas aid comes from variety of government sources and is not tracked by single prc agency funding for such assistance follows the prc leaderships diplomatic schedule and is not provided in annual increments beijing is reluctant to reveal aid tota ls because it fears domestic criticism fo r its aid efforts given its own large population of poor 13 the united states differs from other major aid donors in southeast asia such as japan european countries and australia in that it provides not only oda but also cons iderable security and military assistance particularly to indonesia and the philippines 14 chinas conditions on aid are often international rather th an domesticrequiring aid reci pients to support the one china principle regarding

efforts and growing economic integration in southeast asia negate efforts by western nations to promote political and economic reform reduce corruption and protect the environment in mainland southeast asia others counter that on balance chinese aid promot development in southeast asia and that it does not exclude other countries aid programs and objectives furthermore in many cases china

according to some analysts chinas rising influe nce has coincided with period of episodic and inconsistent us attention toward southeast as ia or even developing power vacuum during the past decade56 since september 11 2001 the us government has become somewhat more diplomatically engaged in the region and increased foreign aid funding but with focus largely limited to counterterrorism the perception of us inattentiveness to the region has continued to be reinforced in 2007 secretary of state condoleezza rice bypassed the annual asean regional forum arf gathering and instead traveled to

renewing concerns about the us commitment to the region57 despite possible decrease in relative influence however the united states continues to exert both hard and soft power in southeast asia in term s of soft power for example the united states maintains multifaceted foreign aid programs with clear objectives and large development and humanitarian components the united states was also major contributor to countries hit by the 2004 indian ocean tsunami which affected several southeast asian countries 58 the united states remains aseans 2nd largest trading partner china ranks 5th and its 4th largest source of foreign direct investment china ranks 10th and has sought free trade agreements with several countries in the region while there is general agreement that chinas tactics have changed to more accommodating posture with an emphasis on soft power there is less certainty regarding its implications and whether chinas goals have changed accordingly according to one view china is pursuing zero sum game where expansion of its influence is or will be at the expense of the united states joshua kurlantzick writes that china may want to shift influence away from the united states to create its own sphere of influence kind of chinese monroe doctrine for southeast asia where countries would subordinate their interests to ch inas and would think twice about supporting the united states59 by contrast some analysts argue that on balance chinas growing economic influence of the past decade has been beneficial to the region and not detrimental to us interests regarding chinas goals some observers contend that chinas most pressing concerns at least in the medium term are likely to be domestic focusing on economic growth and social stability and that beijing favors stable periphery and appreciates the dominant us role in helping to maintain regional security regional stability serves as foundation for southeast asian and chinese economic development china may seek to isolate taiwan and to increase its influence in the region but only to forestall the possible tainment of china rather than to replace the united states 60 another view suggests that regardless of chinas intentions in southeast asia its capabilities often are exaggerated its soft power is limited and its friendships in the region are transient in 2007 for example as concerns rose throughout many parts of the world regarding the safety of chinese products officials in indonesia malaysia and the philippines reportedly complained that the prc government was pressuring them not to raise the issue even when such imported goods were found to be dangerous when they banned the sale of unsafe items from china the prc government reportedly threatened andor imposed retaliatory actions causing consternation among many southeast asian leaders 61 57 sheldon simon us southeast asia relations comparative connections october 2007 ralph cossa and brad glosserman regional overview comparative

asia remain wary of the prc or seek to dampen its growing influence in the region for example many cambodians mindful of the prcs former support of the khmer rouge reportedly feel antagonistic towards china the lao government maintains close ties with both china and vietnam while the vietnamese government reportedly has quietly encouraged lao leaders to cultivate better ties with the united states as means to counteract chinese power vietnamese citizens held antichina demonstrations likely with the encouragement of the vietnamese government in hanoi and ho chi minh city in december 2007 to protest chinese military exercises simulating invasions of the disputed spratly islands in the south china sea and the creation of new prc administrative unit that would include the islands

as noted above there is general agreement among analysts and observers that china has move d away from hard power to soft power over the past decade as it has sought to promote its interests in the region it remains unclear if this shift in tactics also connotes shift at the strategic level to more positive sum approaches relative to the united states and its interests in the region concern over chinas rising influence in southeast asia and beyond is leading some in the united states to be increasingly wary of china and its motives out of fear that if chinas power and influence continue to increase beijing will eventually seek to constrain andor undermine americas ability to promote and protect its interests in the region however there also appears to be real danger that american responses could lead to selffulfilling prophesy as hedging strategies evolve into what could be perceived by beijing as efforts to contain or constrain china there are range of options that could be employed to address chinas growing soft power in southeast asia on one side are policymakers who tend to not see chinas rise in zero sum or threatening terms and who would favor policies that are basically status quo oriented they advocate minor changes to refine existing us policy positions furthermore according to these analysts us moves to contain china could be counterproductive if they push regional states away from the united states on the other side are those who are more concerned about chinas increasing regional influence they can be grouped roughly into two schools of th ought one school favors enhanced engagement with regional states as means of maintaining us power while accepting chinas rise another school favors strategies that woul d offset or balance chinese power in the region andor hedge against the possibility that chinas rise may be more aggressive in the future the following are possible policy options place renewed emphasis on reinvigorating americas alliance relationships in the region while not emphasizing policy of containing china while some of americas alliance relationships in asia such as with australia and japan as well as our strategic framework agreement with singapore are relatively robust others in southeast asia such as with thailand and the philippines are not as close as they once were new initiatives to reinvigorate these relationships could not only take into account american interests but also genuinely seek to accommodate our strategic partners concerns

relationships on bilateral basis through trade agreements and other means of engagement increase foreign assistance funding andor develop foreign aid approach that addresses the attractiveness of chinas policy of noninterference in domestic affairs develop new programs to assist emerging democracies in the region particularly indonesia use american soft power as champion of democracy to gain influence with emerging democracies in the region the united states could sign the treaty of amity and cooperation tac and seek to join the east asia summit process the tac binds signatories to peaceful coexistence and respect for the principles of sovereignty territorial integrity and noninterference the united states reportedly has been reluctant to sign the tac for fear that it could constrain us military freedom of action raise the priority given to regional and multilateral engagement the lack of high level diplomatic attention sends the wrong signal to regional states and increases attention paid by regional states to china the united states would have to consistently participate in regional fora to continue to be taken seriously by regional states the united states would also likely achieve more of its regional goals by engaging asean states not onl on american priorities but on asean ones as well establish new dialogue process with china with the goal of reassuring china that the united states does not seek to counter china in southeast asia or to contain china more broadly such an approach could have the effect of diverting china from strategies aimed at neutralizing american regional influence although hedging strategies may be prudent to deter what could possibly be less than peaceful rise by china reinvigorating and expanding confidence building measures and other forms of engagement that seek to reassure china that the united states and its allies are not trying to contain china may be equally important to prevent china from adopting strategic posture that would lead to strategic rivalry between the united states and china in the region and beyond initiate new program aimed at engaging regional muslim states and populations in way that both supports moderate islam in its struggle against radical islam and brings the united states closer to regional muslim states welcome indian japanese and australian involvement in the region where regional states desire such involvement as means of multilateralizing external power engagement and preventing it from being perceived in bipolar terms between the united states and china pursue fta negotiations with asean and or provide greater effort to obtain broad trade agreement within apec pursue more robust hedge strategies through enhanced cooperation among allies and friends some have advocated the use of the trilateral group of australia japan and the united states as starting point for such cooperation others have also suggested the inclusion of india into such group recent political change in australia japan and india make such an approach less likely to gain approval by these states if it appears to be aimed at containing china
