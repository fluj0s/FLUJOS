6204c05 shspec129 asisness people who can and cant asis things that wont asis include 1 things you dont know about 2 things you cant communicate with and that cant communicate with you 3 things that are not asised because there is nothing there to do any asising an operating ge doesnt asis things so any mechanism that makes nothing out of the thetan is nonasisable thetan is nothing only in regard to mest attributes it still has abilities if you had something that made nothing of the thetans ability to look create do cause etc there would be reverse notis where instead of the person notising the item the item notises the the person that of course is the most dangerous valence religions often have campaigns to get rid of all the evil spirits earlier religions often admit the existence of nonmalignant beings spirits like leprechauns etc when religion has been totally successful it manifests itself in society where the spirit is totally unknown and there are spirits beware of that society it is pretty far south it is total overwhelm of you the thetan the soul is something you take care of an otherdeterminism which you send off at your demise to some pieinthesky sanitarium how is this manifested in our present world take the exact science of physics for example the first fundamental of elementary physics is the conservation of energy and mass this is very reasonable we cannot destroy or create energy and mass is really energy the question is how can you have an expanding universe with constant amount of energy why is there conservation of space wonder physicists go nuts they are dealing with something they can neither create nor destroy so it is sacred however you are likely to find times on the backtrack when you violated the conservation of energy if you cant do anything to energy time becomes inexorable time is postulate it is not monitored by the change in space of particles but one becomes aware of time through change of space of particles the physicist is actually just priest gone mad he discovers that the principles he has sworn to conservation of energy etc are bit shaky so he gets to be like boy whistling past graveyard this happens when he studies nuclear physics now he is trying to maintain one set of principles while experimenting with contradictory set so it is wonder that nuclear bombs are the main threat to civilization the first thing fellow who is in the condition the physicist is in would do is to destroy himself he is asking for an executioner we hear of the dedication of science which means all for science nothing for individual should have right to his own inventions patents belong to the university or corporation the scientist will accuse the scientologist of maintaining secrecy person in that condition is defending the sacredness the unreachability of the mind he thinks that there is nothing there to do the asising therefore those valences which you have the most trouble running out are those which deny the existence of the thetan because then there is one there to asis the valence the least asising situation is that of being an object when you look over items to run the emeter will indicate not the toughest to asis but the easiest after it is run and the individual has increased his own beingness to the extent of not being what you have just run out now he can be assessed again and become aware that he is not quite the nothingthere valence it didnt read before but now it will register lots of vegetables and flowers read on the meter the more endurance there is in the plant the mestier it is the less it will register the greater the effort to survive something has the mestier it is tomatoes read more than trees so in the early stages of sorting out 3dxx you will get reaction on those things that should be run the pc is in the condition of notknow about them they are there but he isnt there this adds up to total overwhelm when you start differentiating items and nulling items the pc starts feeling that there is some beingness to them you at least have the pc in pt exterior enough to say yes somewhere on the track there is whizzer up to then he couldnt say whizzer was on the track because he was whizzer without being there at all until then all you had was whizzer not thetan plus whizzer or inspecting whizzer so assessing and differentiating these items leaves person more and more able to inspect and lessens his identification with mest because all these valences are composed of matter energy space and time and trapped postulates ie gpms have trapped postulates in them the person doesnt see himself come out of them he sees the ideas come alive so 3dxx is gradient scale of bailing someone nut the items which the pc cant asis are the ones where there is nothing to asis them with he is just in them but not there in them they just are and look to him like packages of mest when he first looks at them when you first encounter them he is that mest so your approach could be to notice doingness he has and to list who or what would oppose that from this he will get some item which he sees as an actual identity off his own past track you can find what opposed that continually getting him more and more able to observe these identities hence more and more aware of self so he can asis more that is why 3dxx gives constant gain if you are not getting ta action during listing on 3dxx you are not there and they are not there enough to have you there so nothing is asising at this point you can use cchs then the beingness of auditor and pc appear and there can be observation of an identity there is an extreme gradient of case state south 1 picking up future items 2 picking up pt items cchs cut in here 3 picking up present life items north 4 picking up past life items cchs cut the person in on this scale at pt with the identities of the auditor and the pc the pc gets higher and higher ability to differentiate between himself and the auditor op pro by dup run long enough gets the pc out of the body and able to observe the body doing the process op pro by dup shows the pc forcefully that he is not an it exteriorization by some more sudden process can shock him he will go back in into some other valence or something blowing him out of his head on an otherdeterminism is very unstable if you exteriorize someone on your determinism he wont remember it or he will invalidate it because he cant have not being thing 3dxx is an exteriorization process with very gentle gradient the last item to come off is the most sacred the one which was him it is not something that can be in any way characterized described it is just how does person get so interiorized he asserts that an identity or an object will react that is the clue to all future interiorization this is the first gradient on the overt motivator sequence if you do something this paper will react then it will do something to you
