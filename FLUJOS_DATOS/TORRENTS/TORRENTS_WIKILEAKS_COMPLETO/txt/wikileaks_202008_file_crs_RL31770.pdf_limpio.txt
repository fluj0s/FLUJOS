because taxdeductible contributions to retirement plans and deferral of taxes on investment earnings reduce federal income tax collections congress has placed limits on the amount that employers and employees can contribute to these plans each year as the government accountability office has noted these limits exist to prevent partial public subsidies of excessively large retirement benefits through tax preferences 1 to ensure that the tax preferences granted to retirement accounts are used to prom ote retirement income security rather than to subsidize transfers of wealth from one generation to the next congress has required distributions from retirement accounts that are funded with taxdeductible contributions to begin when the account owner reaches age 70½ taxpayer who does not take required minimum distribution is subject to tax penalty equal to 50 of the amount that should have been distributed if these distributions were not required the temporary tax deferrals that congress has authorized to encourage retirement saving would become perm anent tax exemptions for those whose income from other sources is high enough that they do not need to take withdrawals from their retirement savings to help pay their living expenses retirement plans that are funded with aftertax incomelike the roth irado not have required distributions during the account owners lifetime to discourage individuals from taking preretirement withdrawals from retirement savings accounts the internal revenue code irc im poses 10 additional tax on withdrawals taken before age 59½ this penalty is levied in addition to regular income taxes recognizing that some significant events might require people to withdraw money from their retirement accounts earlier than expected congress has

contributions to roth ira consist entirely of income on which income tax has already been paid the full amount of roth ira contributions can be withdrawn at any time without being subject to

has approved three methods for calculating substantially equal periodic payments they are the minimum distribution method also called the life expectancy method the amortization method which amortizes an account balance using life expectancy tables and reasonable interest rate and the annuitization method which divides the account balance by an annuity factor based on reasonable mortality table and interest rate for any individual each of the three methods may produce different distribution amount as its name implies the minimum distribution method will usually result in the smallest annual distribution it is also the only one of the three methods in which the amount of the distribution is likely to vary from year to year the distribution amount varies both because of changes in the remaining account balance and changes in the account owners remaining life expectancy the amortization method and the annuitization method us ually produce distributions that are similar in size because the same economic and demographic variables determine the distribution amounts under both of these methods the distribution amount is calculated annually under the minimum distribution method under the amortization and annuitization methods this calculation is typically performed only before the first distribution and the distribution remains unchanged from year to year one way to receive larger annual distribution th an would result from the minimum distribution method but smaller than the distribution produced by either of the other two methods is to segment ones retirement accounts into two or more iras distributions can then be taken from one or more of them while leaving the others intact according to one authoritative source irs rulings have consistently allowed taxpayers to take periodic payments from one or more plans and not others 17 g22g145g142g561g15g146g151g146g150g158g150g561g6g146g156g157g155g146g139g158g157g146g152g151g561g15g142g157g145g152g141g561 under the minimum distribution method the annual distribution in any year is determined by dividing the account balance for that year by the account owners remaining life expectancy or the joint life expectancy of the account owner and his or her designated beneficiary as published in life expectancy table that has been approved by the irs because the account balance and the account owners remaining life expectancy change from year to year the distribution amount also will change each year under this method although the amount of the distribution will chan ge each year under the minimum distribution method the irs treats the resulting distributions as substantially equal periodic payments for purposes of section 72t once the distributions have begun however the account owner may neither stop receiving payments nor switch to one of the other two methods until the later of 1 five years after the first distribution or 2 the date on which the plan participant reaches age 59½ terminating or altering the distributions before th later of these two dates will result in penalty 16 irs notice 8925 march 20 1989 and revenue ruling 200262 october 3 2002 17 twila slesnick and john c suttle iras

distribution is based on their joint life expectancies in the year of the first distribution under this method the account balance and remaining life expectancy are determined only for the first distribution year the annual distribution is the same amount in each succeeding year the risk to the account owner who chooses the amortization method is that declining account balance might result in the account being exhausted in fewer years than he or she had expected when the distributions began g22g145g142g561g3g151g151g158g146g157g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g561g15g142g157g145g152g141g561 under the annuitization method the distribution amount is determined by dividing the account balance by an annuity factor this factor represents the present value18 of an annuity of 1 per year beginning at the taxpayers current age and continuing for the life of the account owner or the joint lives of the account owner and designated beneficiary the annuity factor must be derived from life expectancy tables published by the internal revenue service and an interest rate that does not exceed 120 of the federal midterm rate19 under this method the account balance the annuity factor and the interest rate are determined only once for the first distribution year the resulting annual payment is the same amount in each succeeding year in private letter rulings the irs generally has allowed the distribution amount to be adjusted annually to account for changes in life expectancy and account balance the irs also has issued private letter rulings that allow the annual distribution to be increased for inflation private letter ruling however applies only to the individual who requested it these rulings cannot be relied upon by other taxpayers as legally binding statements of irs policy

annual distribution amount would be determined by the same processdividing the remaining account balance which may have increased or decreased depending on investment returns by the individuals remaining life expectancy which will decrease each year because the minimum distribution method takes into account changes in both the account balance and remaining life expectancy the annual distribution amount will change from year to year under this method under the amortization method the annual distribution for an individual in the circumstances described above would be 5824 21 the annual distribution under this method is determined the same way that loan repayment is calculated the account balance is analogous to the principal of the loan the term is the persons remaining life expectancy in the year that the first distribution is made and the interest rate is equal to or less than 120 of the midterm federal interest rate in either of the two months immediately precedin g the first distribution under the amortization method the amount of the annual distribution is determined once before the first distribution and it remains the same from year to year under the annuitization method the annual distribution for an individual in the circumstances described above also would be 5824 22 the variables that determine the annual distribution under the annuitization method are as under the amortization method the individuals remaining life expectancy and an interest rate as result the distribution amounts under these two methods are likely to be nearly the same provided that similar interest rates are used the distribution amount is easier to compute under the annuitization method because the interest rate and life expectancy factors have been combined into single number called an annuity factor there is single annuity factor for each possible combination of interest rate and term life expectancy these factors are readily available in published sources such as mcgrawhill s compound interest annuity tables and archer s compound interest and annuity tables to find the annual distribution amount the account balance is simply di vided by the annuity factor appropriate to the individuals age and the applicable rate of interest g20g142g159g142g151g158g142g561g20g158g149g146g151g144g561g344g342g342g344g556g348g344g561 both the amortization method and the annuitization method of calculating substantially equal periodic payments result in distribution amounts that are constant from year to year and that are larger than the initial distribution

method or the annuitization method to the minimum distribution method of calculating the nnual distribution from their retirement plans the smaller distributions that result from this switch will prevent retirement accounts from being depleted as rapidly as would occur und er either of the other two methods revenue ruling 200262 also states that if an account owner takes periodic payments

order to encourage employers to sponsor retire ment plans and employees to participate in these plans congress has amended the internal revenue code to 1 allow employer contributions to qualified retirement plans to be treated as taxdeductible business expenses 2 exclude employer contributions to retirement plans and investment earnings on those plans from employee income and 3 permit qualifying employee contributions to individual retirement accounts and certain employersponsored plans to be excluded from taxable income in the year the contribution is made and to exclude investment earnings on these contributions from annual income these contributions and investment earnings are taxed wh the retirement account is distributed to the plan participant usually during retirement to ensure that taxdeferred retirement accounts that have been established to provide income during retirement are not used as permanent tax shelters or as vehicles for transmitting wealth to heirs congress has required plan participants to begin taking distributions from these plans later than april 1 of the year after they reach age 70½ 23 participants in employersponsored plans who are still working at age 70½ can delay distributions until april 1 of the year after they have retired this exception does not apply to traditional iras 24 in traditional ira the required beginning date for distributions is always april 1 of the year after the participant reaches age 70½ the distributions must be made over the life expectancy of the plan participant or over the joint life

account balance must be distributed by the required beginning date or that distributions must have begun by that date with the amount of the distributions based on the remaining life expectan cy of the account owner or the joint life expectancy of the account owner and designated beneficiary26 for most participants in employersponsored plans the required beginning date for distributions is april 1 of the calendar year following the later of 1 the year in which the plan participant reaches age 70½ or 2 the year in which he or she retires27 if the plan participant owns 5 or more of the company however the required beginning date is always april 1 of the year after the participant reaches age 70½ regardless of whether he or she has retired if required minimum distributions have begun but the account owner dies before the entire account balance has been distributed the remainder of the account must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the distribution method that was being used when the account owner died the account must then be distributed over the remaining life expectancy of the designated beneficiary or if there is designated beneficiary over length of time equal to the remaining life expectancy of the decedent in the year of his or her death if an account owner dies before the required distributions from the account have begun and beneficiary has been designated the entire account balance must be distributed within five years after the death of the account owner any amount that is to be paid to designated beneficiary can be distributed over his or her life expectancy provided that the distributions begin later than one year after the date of the account owners death if the designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the account owner then the required beginning date for distributions is the date on which the account owner would have reached age 70½ 28 the account balance for determining the amount of the required distribution each year is the balance on the last valuation date in the year preceding the distribution29 in most cases this will be december 31 surviving spouse who is the sole designated beneficiary also has the option to roll over the account into an ira in his or her own name in that case the surviving spouse generally will have to wait until age 59½ to begin taking distributions just as if the ira had always been in the surviving spouses name section 634 of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 directed the secretary of the treasury to modify the life expectancy tables under the regulations relating to required minimum distributions so that the tables reflect current life expectancy the irs issued the required regulations on april 17 200230 the new regulations incorporate life tables that reflect increases in life expectancy since the 1980s when the tables were last published consequently the minimum required annual distribution is smaller than under the old life tables because an account balance now will be distributed over longer expected life span required distributions do not compel account owners to sell the stocks bonds or other assets in which retirement account is invested the law requires funds to be withdrawn from the 26 life expectancy may be redetermined annually see 26 usc 401a9d 27 if plan participant retires after reaching age 70½ the employees accrued benefit must be actuarially increased to take into account the period after age 70½ in which the employee was not receiving any benefits under the plan see 26 usc 401a9ciii 28 any distribution required under an incidental death benefit requirement is treated as required minimum distribution 29 26 cfr 1401a95 published in the federal register vol 67 4 april 17 2002 30

withdrawn but this requirement this does not require assets to be sold stocks for example can be transferred from an ira to regular brokerage account if assets that have been transferred from retirement account to regular account later increase in value the increase will be taxed as capital gains which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income if the age at which distributions are required were to be pushed beyond age 70½ future distributions would probably be larger because required distributions are based on both the account value and the account owners remaining life expectancy for any given account balance required distribution beginning at age 75 for example would be greater than distribution beginning at age 71 because the account owner will have shorter remaining life expectancy larger annual distributions could push some retirees into higher tax brackets eliminating required distributions altogether w ould of course provide account owners with the maximum freedom of choice about when to take distributions from their accounts 31 the accounts eventually would be subject to taxation because under current law the designated beneficiary usually is required to take withdrawals over his or her life expectancy some accounts also might be subject to the estate tax in fact however extending the tax deferral period would benefit only those account owners whose income from other sour ces is sufficient to allow them to postpone withdrawals from their retirement accounts retire who need to take distributions from their retirement accounts to supplement their retirement income rather than because they are required by law to do so would not benefit from delaying or eliminating the beginning date for required distributions lower and middleincome retirees who need to take distributions to support themselves in retirement would still have to take distributions from their accounts and pay income taxes on those distributions if their income is above the threshold for taxation one of the attractions of the roth ira is that distributions are required from these plans during the account owners lifetime after the roth ira was authorized by congress in 1997 many owners of traditional iras converted their accounts to roth iras and paid income tax on the amounts that they converted some of those who converted their traditional iras to roth iras might be unhappy if congress were to eliminate required distributions from traditional iras this would grant to current ira owners free of char ge benefit that others purchased by converting their traditional iras to roth iras and paying income taxes on the converted amounts
