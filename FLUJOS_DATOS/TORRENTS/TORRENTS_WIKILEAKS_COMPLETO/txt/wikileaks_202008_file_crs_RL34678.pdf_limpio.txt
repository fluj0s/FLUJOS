revenue service irs guidelines with respect to pension plan contributions benefits and distributions 401k plans are qualified plans that include cash or deferred arrangement under which participants can choose to contribute part of their beforetax compensation to the plan rather than receive the compensation in cash2 the tax code allows employees to c ontribute pretax maximum of 15500 in 2008 to their individual 401k accounts alt hough there are other kinds of dc account plans in addition to 401k plans such as 457 plans for employees of state or local governments and 403b plans for educa

annual fee is charged over the c ourse of 30 years an account holder would pay more than 52000 in fees the comple xity of 401k plan arrangements may provide opportunities for fees to be higher than they otherwise might be particularly if plan sponsors and participan ts are not fully informed of the fees they pay policies that increase the transparency of fee arrangements may result in

other investment options as well including insurance company offerings such as variable annuities and bank or trust company pooled investment trusts source crs employers could purchase these services separately from individual service providers or employers could purchase two or more services from single service provider in bundled arrangement in bundled rrangement service provider offers several services or investment alternatives to the plan for single fee the service provider may contract out the provision of these services to one or more third parties current law does not require the

in most dc plans participants have control over some or all of the assets in their individual accounts although this c ontrol is limited to the investment options made available by the service providers less common are plans in which the participants have contro l over the assets current proposals in congress would require plan sponsors of all dc plans to receive fee disclosures from service providers but only participants in plans in which the participants exercise control over the assets would receive fee disclosures from plan sponsors table 2 indicates that 401k plans where the employee has c ontrol over all or portion of the assets in the plan accounted for 888 of all dc plans in 2005 two of the proposals in congress hr 3185 and s 2473 would pr ovide assistance to small
