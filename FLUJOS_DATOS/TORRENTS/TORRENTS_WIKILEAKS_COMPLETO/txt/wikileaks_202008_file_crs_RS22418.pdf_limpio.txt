for organized crime and money underers and lacks any effec tive safeguards against fraud they also characterize it as particularly addictive and point out that it frustrates state gambling laws and regulations2 the national gambling commission recommended that the explosion of illegal internet gambling be confined and that related financial transactions be outlawed3 most internet gambling operations are already proscribed by federal law but as yet to little avail4 the two most commonly cited obstacles to more effective enforcement are 1 the fact that most internet gambling enterprises operate overseas beyond the effective reach of us authorities5 and 2 questions of whether the wire act perhaps the most effective federal antigambling statute can be used against any form of gambling other than sports betting6 the task of removi ng these obstacles has been complicated by the legalization of various forms of gambling in different jurisdictions by the use of electronic comm unications and other t echnological advances in connection with off track betting and other forms of gambling that are legal in some states and illegal in others by the sugges tion that the countenance of such use while prohibiting offshore internet gambling may be contrary to world trade organization wto obligations of the united states7 and by the shadow of the first amendment8
