agriculture there were 12029 beekeepers with 24 million honey bee colonies and they produced 175 million pounds of honey in 2005 the nationa l average yield was 73 pounds per colony and the farm price averaged 090 per pound as shown in figure 1 honey production stayed near 250 million pounds until the mid1960s then it gradually trended downward and became more variable from year to year beekeeping is heavily concentrated along the us northern border from michigan to washington where there are large areas of alfalfa and clover nectar and in florida california and texas where fruits and vegetables are sources of nectar and the growers need pollination services the four leadin g states nd sd fl ca account for nearly 50 of us honey productionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20759crs2 1 notice

the top five foreign suppliers in 2005 accounting for 80 of total imports were china 28 argentina 22 vietnam 13 canada 10 and india 7 in 2001 the us international trade commission usitc determined that the domestic honey industry had been harmed by imports of honey from argentina and china in addition the international trade admi nistration ita found that honey from these countries was being imported at less than fair value1 and that the honey industry in argentina was being subsidized2 consequently the ita imposed antidumping duties on honey from these countries also countervailing

or more colonies therefore this number understates the producer count by excluding some of the small hobby or parttime beekeepers 6 the threat to fruit and vegetable farmers lies in beekeepers not providing services in areas where the more aggressive africanized bees drive out or breed into domestic colonieshoney i ndustry accused chinese honey exporters of circumventing antidumping and countervailing duty orders however remedial legislation was adopted by the 109th congress that is expected to eliminate those problems4 farm structure while not distinguished by size in the census of agriculture the nations 12029 beekeepers have been classifi ed by usda as hobbyist b parttime or sideliner or c commercial or fulltime5 hobbyist beekeepers own fewer than 25 colonies and keep bees for hobby or for smallscale pollination of orchard or field crops most honey produced by hobbyists is consumed at home given away or sold directly by the beekeeper parttime or sideliner beekeepers each own between 25 and 299 colonies and market their honey either through direct sales to consumers or retail outlets or through bulk sales to honey processors commercial or fulltime beekeepers each own 300 or more colonies and according to the usda are responsible for about 60 of the extracted honey produced in the united states many commercial specialty crops require pollination by insects to bear seeds or fruit in some cases farmers contract with beekeepers for pollination services rather than maintaining their own bee colonies or relyin g on wild insects hobbyist and parttime beekeepers generally do not engage in contract pollination but pollination fees can be an important source of income for some commercial beekeepers for most beekeepers however the receipts from honey and beeswax sales far exceed the fees received from pollination services some fruit and vegetable farmers are concerned because of the decreasing number of honeybee colonies about future pollination services over the past 20 years bee colonies have dropped about 25 from 32 m illion to 24 million in addition to honey import competition other threats to the beekeeping industry include diseases and parasites that are difficult to control inadvertent exposure to insecticides and northward migration of the africanized honeybee6 national honey board the honey research promotion and consumer information act of 1984 pl 98590 author ized creation of 13member national honey board the board receives an assessment of 1 per pound on all domestic and imported honey which it uses to finance and administer national research promotion and consumer information program to ex pand domestic and foreign markets for us honey assessments totaled 36 million in 2005 usdas agricultural marketing service is responsible for overseeing the boards activities and reviewing its programs budgets and expenditureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20759crs4 7 nonrecourse loans allow the borrower to fo rfeit the honey pledged as collateral as full satisfaction of the repayment obligation matter how low the market price of honey additional recourse is available to the lender to recover the full loan principal and interest payment for the difference between the higher loan rate and the lower market price is called loan deficiency payment loan deficiency paym ents give producers the monetary benefit of the commodity loan program and allow them to retain ownership of the honey the advantage to the government is in not taking possession and having to manage and dispose of forfeited honey for more detailed explanations of nonrecourse loans and loan deficiency payments see crs report rl33271 farm commodity programs direct payments count ercyclical payments and marketing loans 8 note that the honey marketing year corresponds to the calendar year whereas program expenditure data are reported by fiscal yearhoney support program history the agricultural act of 1949 pl 81439 section 201 provided permanent authority and made available price suppor t for honey through usdas commodity credit corporation ccc the support program ffered nonrecourse loans to producers who supplied honey as loan collateral effectively this made the loan rate the price received by farmers whenever market prices were below the loan rate as shown in figure 2 from 1982 to 1990 the average loan rate of honey was higher than the aver age market price of honey this caused producers to forfeit honey to the ccc and honey packers and industrial users to import honey encouraged by high loan forfeitures nd by report from the general accounting office gao now the governme nt accountability office sta ting that the honey price support program was not needed to ensure crop pollination the 1985 farm bill pl 99 198 section 1041 reduced the level of suppor t and dropped the escalation formula the 1990 farm bill pl 101624 section 207 allowed producers to choose loan deficiency payments instead of nonrecourse loans7 in the mid1990s congress and the administ ration were trying to reduce the budget deficit and farm programs were one target for spending cuts the usda appropriation acts for fy1994 pl 103111 and fy1995 pl 103330 provided funding for the honey support program then the 1996 farm bill pl 104127 section 171 repealed altogether the honey price support authority subsequent laws instituted recourse loans for

federal support the honey program expires after the 2007 crop the futu re of the program may be decided by the anticipated 2007 farm bill9 unlike periods in the past there appears to be opposition directed specifically at the honey program however it likel would be folded into the overall commodity support issues of economics budget and trade policy two economic considerations affecting ll commodities receiving mandatory support are 1 the effect of subsidies on competitiveness and 2 the equity of concentrating most of the benefits in the hands of small proportion of the farmers economists have determined that for crop farms much of the benefit from commodity subsidies has been capitalized into land prices this raises th cost of production and makes these us crops less competitive in the global marketplace hist orically this has been remedied by larger subsidies this is cycle that some po licymakers want to escape and honey could be impacted50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85

wwwewgorgas consequence of economies of size th roughout agriculture the benefits of farm subsidies are increasingly concentrated in the hands of few large operations specifically for honey one analysis has termined that over the 19952004 period all 29 million in honey subsidies went to 2727 recipients these recipients amount to 23 of the 12029 producers counted in the 2002 cens us furthermore 57 of the money went to 10 of recipients 272 producers10 honey producers counter that this concentration simply reflects the comparatively small number of commercial producers producing most of the honey and large number of hobbyists that produce little honey also it is the commercial beekeepers not th hobbyists that fruit and vegetable growers rely upon for crop pollination large overall federal budget deficit is expected to put pressure on all commodity support program spending this is in the f ace of pressure to broaden assistance to crops that heretofore have not received support namely the fruit and vegetable crops in addition conservation and environmental groups are pressing for greening of farm assistance with increased spending on such programs as the environmental quality incentives program eqip the conser vation security program csp and the conservation reserve program crp without additional funds broadening the uses of commodity support funds would diminish th amount available for commodity support on the trade policy side the marketing loan program is classified by the world trade organization wto as highly production and tradedistorting there is the possibility that competing country could bring dis pute claim to the wto arguing that the marketing loan program effectively displaces imports from the us market and functions as an export subsidy in violation of the agreement on agriculture concern over this possibility could encourage change in policy for all commodities in the next farm bill beekeepers especially the commercial operators see the honey support program as critically import to stabilizing their income in an era of instability recently honey prices have been high but only because of worldwide honey shortage caused by droughts in china argentina and the united states at some point production likely will rebound then according to spokesman for the am erican honey producers association when prices drop not only the beekeepers will be sustained through the hard times by the honey program but also the fruit and vegetable produ cers who would continue to have available the pollination services that are essential to their crops additional public policy initiatives by the beekeepers include petition to the food and drug administration to create standard of identity for honey as countermeasure to adulterati on and labeling problems b establishment of postal service requirement that like its own carriers all of its contract carriers deliver packaged bees and c increased funding for beere lated research at the four federal bee laboratories
