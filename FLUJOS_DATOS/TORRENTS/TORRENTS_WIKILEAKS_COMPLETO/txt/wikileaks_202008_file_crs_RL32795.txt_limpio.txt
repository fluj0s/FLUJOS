jickling specialist in public finance government and finance division governmentsponsored enterprises gses reform legislation in the 109th congress summary fannie mae and freddie mac are governmentsponsored enterprises gses chartered by congress to establish secondary mortgage market to improve the availability of capital for home mortgage financing to help these privatelyowned institutions accomplish this mission congress granted them several statutory benefits not available to other private companies the advantages of gse status have helped the enterprises to grow very large and dominate the secondary mortgage market in 1992 congress established the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo an agency within the department of housing and urban development hud to oversee the financial safety and soundness of the enterprises ofheo is authorized to set capital requirements conduct annual riskbased examinations and generally enforce compliance with safety and soundness standards with the rapid growth of the gses and major accounting scandals at fannie mae and freddie mac the effectiveness of the current regulatory regime has been widely questioned several legislative proposals considered in the 108th and earlier congresses addressed gse regulatory reform but none was enacted however adequacy of gse regulation remains prominent legislative issue while improving supervision of fannie mae and freddie mac is the major focus regulatory reform also involves the 12 federal home loan banks which comprise one collective gse the federal home loan banks lend to lenders their member banks primarily for housing but also for many other purposes under the proposed gse reform they would be brought under single regulatory umbrella with fannie and freddie in the 109th congress hr 1461 and s 190 proposed to restructure the gse supervisor and enhance its regulatory powers hr 1461 was marked up and reported by the financial services committee on may 25 2005 and passed the full house with amendments on october 26 2005 chairman shelby put forward an amendment in the nature of substitute for s 190 which was marked up and approved by the banking committee on july 28 2005 neither bill was finally enacted common provisions of s 190 and hr 1461 would abolish ofheo and establish an independent agency to oversee the housing gses and the federal home loan banks enhance the safety and soundness disclosure and enforcement tools available to the new regulator and increase the budget autonomy of the new agency by exempting its assessments from the annual appropriations process s 190 as reported takes the further step of limiting the type of assets that fannie and freddie could hold in their investment portfolios this report summarizes

gratefully acknowledges the work of loretta nott whose crs report rl32069 improving the effectiveness of gse oversight legislative proposals in the 108th congress provides the basis for the introductory material in this report government sponsored enterprises reform legislation in the 109th congress introduction governmentsponsored enterprises gses are privately owned congressionally chartered financial institutions created for specific public policy purposes they benefit from certain exemptions and privileges including an implied federal guarantee1 intended to enhance their ability to borrow money two of the largest gses are fannie mae and freddie mac herein referred to as the enterprises or gses2 these institutions were created by congress to establish and maintain secondary mortgage market increasing liquidity and improving the distribution of capital available for home mortgage financing3 to help these institutions accomplish this mission congress has provided them with several benefits not available to other financial institutions4 these statutory benefits provide the enterprises with lower funding costs the ability to operate with less capital and lower direct costs5 the advantages of gse status have enabled the enterprises to grow rapidly and become dominant players in the secondary mortgage market 1 although gse bonds are not explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the government market participants behave as if they were believing that the treasury will never permit gse to default this implicit guarantee allows the gses to borrow at lower rates than private financial institutions and to take on greater financial risk without corresponding drop in their credit ratings 2 the other gses are the federal home loan bank system the farm credit system and farmer mac sallie mae former gse has been fully privatized 3 for detailed description of the development of the us secondary mortgage market see office of federal housing enterprise oversight report to congress june 2003 at httpwwwofheogovmediapdfwebsiteofheoreptocongress03pdf 4 these statutory benefits include 1 exemption from state and local taxes 2 line of credit with the us treasury up to 225 billion 3 eligibility of their debt to serve as collateral for public deposits 4 eligibility of their securities for federal reserve open market purchases 5 eligibility for their corporate securities to be purchased without limit by federally regulated financial institutions 6 assignment of mortgagerelated securities they have issued or guaranteed to the secondlowest credit risk category at depository institutions and 7 exemption from the registration requirements of the securities and exchange commission 5 for more information on these advantages see the following reports us department of the treasury government sponsorship of the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation july 11 1996 us congressional budget office assessing the public costs and benefits of fannie mae and freddie mac may 1996 and us congressional budget office federal subsidies and the housing gses may 2001 crs2 congress has always been concerned that the safety and soundness of the enterprises be maintained so that they can meet their public policy mission and not pose risks to taxpayers prior to 1992 oversight was the responsibility of the department of housing and urban development hud and the federal home loan bank board in 1992 congress established the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo an independent agency within hud to oversee the financial safety and soundness of the enterprises the office is authorized to set capital requirements conduct annual riskbased examinations and generally enforce compliance with safety and soundness standards after the creation of ofheo total assets at the gses grew by more than 820 to 19 trillion at the end of 20036 the gses have become two of the largest private debt issuers in the world in 2003 outstanding debt securities of the enterprises totaled 17 trillion an amount equal to nearly half of all publicly held us treasury debt in addition to enterprise debt investors hold about 16 trillion in mortgagebacked securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac7 as result of the rapid growth of these institutions and their implied federal backing there has been an increasing concern that the enterprises may pose problem of systemic risk to the financial system8 many financial institutions around the world hold large quantities of gse debt and default by either gse could have widespread unpredictable and potentially serious repercussions accordingly questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the current regulatory environment events of the past two years have brought new urgency to the gse reform issue in 2003 freddie mac admitted that it had used improper accounting policies to create the appearance of steady earnings growth and issued restatement of financial results revising net income for 20002002 upwards by 5 billion9 ofheo 6 based on 2003 annual reports which because of the accounting scandals is the latest year for which annual financial statements are available for both gses at the end of 2006 both enterprises had reached agreements with ofheo to either freeze the size of their investment portfolios fannie or limit growth to 2 per year freddie 7 for more information see office of federal housing enterprise oversight fy20032008 strategic plan sept 30 2003 at

feb 2003 at httpwwwofheogovmediaarchivedocsreportssysriskpdf furthermore the international monetary fund imf has stated that the gse regulators need to look closely at whether agencies capital adequacy is sufficient especially bearing in mind the questions about internal controls that have emerged in freddie mac it is unclear whether the gses have taken sufficient account of the risk that the market may not be deep enough to allow them to continuously hedge their growing portfolios in times of stress for more information see imf global financial stability report market developments and issues sept 2003 pp 1622 at httpwwwimforgexternalpubsftgfsr200302indexhtm 9 for more information see crs report rs21567 accounting and management problems continued crs3 imposed 125 million fine and is pursuing civil actions against several former freddie executives following the special examination of freddie mac ofheo began to review the accounting policies and practices at fannie mae and published its preliminary findings in september 200410 ofheo charged that fannie mae did not follow generally accepted accounting practices in two critical areas 1 amortization of discounts premiums and fees involved in the purchase of home mortgages and 2 accounting for financial derivatives contracts according to ofheo these deviations from standard accounting rules allowed fannie mae to reduce volatility in reported earnings present investors with an artificial picture of steadily growing profits and in at least one case to meet financial performance targets that triggered the payment of bonuses to company executives11 on december 15 2004 the securities and exchange commission sec essentially endorsed ofheos report and directed fannie mae to restate its accounting results since 2001 after finding inadequacies in fannies accounting policies and methodologies fannie maes ceo and cfo stepped down soon thereafter while problems at fannie mae and freddie mac have provided the main impetus for reform the regulation of the federal home loan banks fhlbs may also be affected by the gse the 12 fhlbs comprise one collective government sponsored enterprise originally chartered by congress to provide liquidity to the nations predominant lenders for home mortgage loans savings and loan associations and savings banks the fhlbs have undergone series of changes over the years as financial institutions have changed still lender to lenders primarily for housing the fhlbs can now lend for many other purposes as well and have special responsibilities for low and moderateincome housing for debts incurred by the federal government in handling deposit insurance crises of the 1970s and 1980s and for some community development projects several bills were considered in the 108th congress that would have restructured ofheo while the proposals took somewhat different approaches to regulatory reform all appeared to abolish ofheo and reconstitute the gse regulator within the department of the treasury or as an independent agency12 9 continued at freddie mac by mark jickling 10 office of federal housing enterprise oversight report of findings to date special examination of fannie mae sept 17 2004 available at httpwwwofheogovmedia pdffnmfindingstodate17sept04pdf 11 for discussion of ofheos findings and its subsequent settlement with fannie mae see crs report rs21949 accounting problems at fannie mae by mark jickling 12 in some versions the new regulator was to have authority over the fhlbs as well as fannie and freddie crs4 increase the budget autonomy of the new office by exempting its assessments from the annual appropriations process and enhance the safety and soundness and enforcement tools available to the new regulator none of these bills whose provisions are summarized in crs report rl32069 improving the effectiveness of gse oversight legislative proposals in the 108th congress by loretta nott and mark jickling were enacted legislative proposals in the 109th congress incorporated most of the features of the 108th congress bills but also include significant new provisions as discussed below and set out in table 1 the bush administration has generally supported gse regulatory reform treasury secretary john snow issued statement following the mark up of s 190 praising the legislation though noting that certain elements the administration wanted were not present in the bill the legislation creates significantly enhanced market discipline and capital requirements for fannie mae freddie mac and the federal home loan banks the legislation strikes proper and prudent balance in ensuring that the activities undertaken by these entities do not engender systemic risk while providing broad access to housing finance13 major differences between house and senate bills the house and senate bills take common approach to the restructuring of the gse regulator there is general consensus that ofheo needs to be strengthened given the importance of the gses to the financial system and the potential risks they pose there is very little support for keeping the gse regulator inside hud both hr 1461 and s 190 give the new agency tools and authorities that resemble those of federal bank regulators where the bills differ most significantly is in their approaches to the business operations of the gses particularly fannie and freddie the house bill seeks to increase gse support for lowincome housing and would permit fannie and freddie to buy larger mortgages than current law permits while the senate bill seeks to shrink the companies portfolios by restricting the kinds of assets they can purchase affordable housing fund section 128 of hr 1461 as passed the house requires fannie and freddie to establish affordable housing funds to increase homeownership among very low and extremely low income families to increase investment in housing in low income and 13 statement of secretary john w snow on senate banking bill to reform housing governmentsponsored enterprises july 28 2005 js2657 available online at httpwwwustreasgovpressreleasesjs2657htm crs5 economically distressed areas and to increase and preserve the supply of rental and owneroccupied housing for very low and extremely low income families each enterprise shall allocate to this fund 35 of its aftertax income during the first year after enactment and 5 in subsequent years had the 5 rate been in effect during the five years ending with 2003 the two firms combined contributions to these funds would have averaged about 620 million per year the senate bill contains comparable provision proponents of the affordable housing funds recognize that fannie and freddie receive valuable subsidy in the form of their gse status which permits them to borrow at lower rates than other private financial firms the affordable housing fund proposal can be viewed as means of capturing some of the value of this subsidy and applying it to worthy policy objective opponents argue that fannie and freddie would likely use the funds to reward political allies during floor consideration of hr 1461 an amendment was adopted that prohibited the use of money disbursed by the affordable housing funds for political lobbying or advocacy purposes other amendments included fiveyear sunset for the fund with the director of the new regulator to recommend to congress whether the fund should be extended and established priority for activities in areas affected by hurricanes katrina and rita and in other areas designated by the president as major disaster areas conforming loan limits current law sets limit on the size of mortgages that fannie and freddie can buy mortgages above the limit called jumbo loans are less likely to be securitized than the conforming mortgages that fannie and freddie are allowed to purchase partly as result mortgage rates for nonconforming loans are slightly higher than conforming loan rates14 critics of the conforming loan limit argue that the limit has disparate geographical effect in some areas of the country the limit which was 417000 for singlefamily homes in 2006 and 2007 covers all but the high end of the market while in other areas such as san francisco or new york city virtually all real estate transactions take place over the limit hr 1461 would raise the conforming loan limit in metropolitan areas where the median home price exceeds the current limit in those areas the limit would be set at the median home price up to ceiling of 150 of the current limit for more information on this proposal see crs report rs22172 proposed changes to the conforming loan limit by barbara miles and mark jickling like the affordable housing fund provision the proposal to raise the loan limit in highcost areas recognizes that gse status confers subsidy on fannie and freddie and seeks to attain more uniform distribution of the benefits of that subsidy in the process raising the limit increases the size of the subsidy allowing fannie and freddie to expand operations into the jumbo mortgage market enhances 14 the difference is in the range of 2540 basis points or hundredths of percent some of the difference might persist even if the loan limits were abolished crs6 the value of the gses funding advantage which is dependent on their gse status the senate bill has comparable provision portfolio limits while the two house bill provisions discussed above seek to redistribute the fruits of the gse subsidy the senate bill contains provision that could dramatically reduce the value of that subsidy both fannie and freddie hold large portfolios of mortgages and mortgagebacked securities which generate interest income they pay for those mortgage assets by issuing debt securities at rates below what the mortgages and mortgagebacked bonds pay the difference between the yield on mortgagerelated assets and the gses cost of funds is profit thus the gses have strong incentive to pursue portfolio growth the two firms together have nearly 15 trillion in portfolio assets leading some observers to describe them as the worlds largest savings and loan institutions the size of their portfolios represents concentration of mortgage market risk that led former federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan and others to urge congress to consider ways to shrink the size of the gses asset portfolios15 section 109 of s 190 as reported enumerates the types of permissible assets that fannie and freddie would be permitted to purchase they would only be allowed to acquire mortgages and mortgagebacked securities for purposes of securitization and for certain other limited purposes under this proposal fannie and freddies business models would be considerably altered instead of very large investment funds they would be transformed into conduits buying mortgages from the original lenders pooling them packaging them into mortgagebacked securities and selling them to bond investors this would greatly reduce their portfolio earnings currently one of the chief sources of their profits proponents of portfolio limits argue that this step is necessary to reduce the cost of the gse subsidy to taxpayers which takes the form not of annual appropriations but of the assumption of risk the potential cost to the treasury of having to bail out either fannie or freddie to avoid the possibility of systemic catastrophe in the financial markets should either firm encounter serious difficulties opponents argue that reducing the gses interest earnings would mean less support for low and moderateincome housing goals the house bill contains similar provision under hr 1461 the new regulator would have authority to cap the size of the gse portfolios as part of its general safetyandsoundness authority however the house bill would not impose statutory requirement that the portfolios be shrunk the table below provides sidebyside summary of legislative proposals introduced in the 109th congress that aim to reform the regulation of the gses the version of hr 1461 that is set out is the one reported by the financial services committee
