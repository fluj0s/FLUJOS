largely favorable reception in congress in the fy2002 budget resolution hconres 83 the house approved the full 239 billion for international affairs the senate added 200 million for hivaids and 50 million for global climate change programs beyond what president bush requested calls for higher international affairs spending have been fueled in recent years not only by appeals from the administration but also by the recommendations of numerous expert commissions that have cited inadequate resources and dysfunctional organizational structures as major impediments to the conduct of us foreign policy1 in real terms takin g into account the effects of inflation international affairs resources proposed for next year are 26 more than for fy2001 figure 1 while higher than any year between fy1995 and fy1998 the fy2002 proposal would fall 48 and 28 short of fys1999 and 2000 respectively2 although the overall size of foreign policy resources would grow in fy2002 most of the increase is concentrated in the area of state department operations with much smaller growth projected for foreign assistance programs and reductions sought for export promotion activities congress

funding issues two trade promotion programs the exportimport bank and the overseas private investment corporation opic are scheduled for reductions in fy2002 representing the only policybased budget cut within the international affairs account the 25 reduced appropriation for the exportimport bank is the result of lower lending risks assumed for fy2002 plus an effort to concentrate bank support on american exporters who cannot access private financing opic according to administration estimates will have sufficient unspent resources from prior years to continue operations at current levels without the need for new appropriations in fy2002 both eximbank and opic have been the target in recent years of some congressional critics who believe that these export promotion activities generally benefit only few wealthy businesses and represent the equivalent of corporate welfare probusiness activists however are likely to challenge the budget recommendation arguing that export subsidies are necessary for american firms to compete with foreignbacked trade subsidies4 foreign aid funding issues funding for nearly all foreign aid programs are included in annual foreign operations spending bills for which the bush administration seeks 4 nominal increase after adjusting for export promotion programs major programs and potential issues for congress contained in this sector of the foreign policy budget include multilateral development bank mdb contributions the fy2002 budget proposes 121 billion for us payments to the world bank and other regional mdbs 58 increase over current levels this amount will fully fund all us scheduled contributions for next year but it will not include resources to clear any of the approximate 450 million american arrears owed to the global environment

aimed at reducing poverty improving health care and education protecting the environment and promoting good governance in developing nations through two primary foreign operations accounts child survival and diseases and development assistance combined these accounts would grow by 73 million or 32 in nominal terms but over twothirds of the increase will fund two priorities hivaids 30 million and basic education 20 million the request for hivaids an area where resources doubled in fy2001 increases resources by 10 to 330 million in fy2002 most other development aid program sectors will remain at approximate current levels population aid will receive the same 425 million allocation as in fy2001 but remains highly controversial issue due to president bushs decision

programs debt reduction and the heavily indebte d poor country hipc initiative although the fy2002 request cuts by nearly half to 224 million fy2001 spending on hipc debt reduction the proposal will fulfill all current us commitments to the multiyear hipc initiative nevertheless some debt relief proponents continue to press the united states and other major creditors to enhance and accelerate hipc terms actions which would require additional resources counternarcotics activities the largest foreign aid increase sought by the bush administration would supplement and broaden the 1 billion colombia counternarcotics program funded in fy2000 with new 731 million andean regional initiative the objective is to address drug production and trafficking problems that may have migrated from colombia to surrounding states it further differs from the fy2000 initiative by providing more funding for alternative development programs securi ty assistance strategicoriented economic assistance provided through the economic support fund esf nonproliferation and military assistance accounts are heavily concentrated in the middle east situation that will continue in fy2002 military aid for israel will grow by 60 million but overall security assistance to egypt and israel will decline by 100 million as part of tenyear plan to reduce aid to these two countries nevertheless israel and egypt will remain the largest recipients of american aid with amounts totaling about 276 billion and 196 billion respectively due to the net aid cuts for israel and egypt plus small increase overall for security assistance esf and military aid would gain about 230 million in fy2002 that could be allocated for new members of nato and selected recipients in latin america and asia state department

float allowing personnel to take leaves of absence for training without leaving position empty initially the state department seeks to hire 360 personnel both in foreign and civil service 186 security professionals and some fsn replacements this hiring according to state department budget officials would be separate from filling positions due to attrition information technology in recent years state department technology acquisition has not kept pace with its needs and with technology advancements this condition was exacerbated by the october 1999 merger of the us information agency usiaan
