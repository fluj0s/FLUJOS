6411c03 shspec45 programs lrh went on flatout research excursion between 22jan63 and april of 1964 skullbuster of up to 18 hours day on the meter this resulted in the material necessary to get someone running on r6 then he saw that the low end of what was to become the grade chart the bridge was starting to get unreal to him he was beginning to pass out of any interest in levels 0iv he was understanding peoples insanity so well that he was just asising everything left right and center he didnt have to do anything about it it was beginning to look silly to him he noted this attitude growing in him he realized that this was not ok that bridge from level 0 to level vi had to be put together this project was completed in the period from april to november of 1964 with the book of case remedies clay table healing and clay table clearing during that period of wrapup lrh realized that the subject of study and education has to be clarified and improved so that the material that he had researched could be communicated study tech started from the viewpoint of what material should be communicated and how it should be communicated lrh never published his notes for this project and he has twice lost and found them all this is why lrh hasnt himself gone totally ot and departed the other recent work that lrh has done has been setting out organizational programming as laid out in recent policies it is based on selling books as dissemination tool the money received from selling books and more importantly memberships goes into sealed account for book advertising the more books are sold the more students and pcs will come in names of book buyers who havent come into the org in three to four months are sent to local franchiseholders they can longer teach hqs unless they become city offices for description of city offices see p 300 above so they will become city offices at which time they will have book accounts this is all based on the idea of pyramiding by 1968 r6 should be getting taught in central orgs training at saint hill would be purely organizational the has course is now one week of pe plus thirty to forty nights of more theory on how it is basic data there will be book of pe lectures with words defined etc the pe evening has one period of reading the text one period of discussing the words with attention to people who have earlier misunderstood words or subjects etc and third period in which the students write up whatever examples of what was in the text that they can give from life this gives quiet people chance to say something the pe textbook covers the whole field of ontology very thoroughly this is applied philosophy that is how you can describe scientology to people your advertising for the pe course is just that people can learn how to get along better in life than they have been people are generally aware that they can get along better the philosophy of man is an animal is saying there is nobody there to do anything about anything how can cell cure cell the book that the pe students are being taught from is available for them to have and read the phenomenon of getting more and more out of lrhs writings each time you reread them instead of going into boredom is only true of fairly searching truths and material in which new thought matter can be found it is not true of books that arent designed around the provocation of thought people go into agreement instead of boredom public presence is created it is not natural lrh also intends to write book telling students and how to study and teach what they are studying and teaching how to handle slow students etc that would answer all academic questions with regard to scientology it would be textbook on study and if it worked for education it would give ue stable datum that some part of scientology worked showing that it is workable subject the only trouble that lrh is having with this project is making the textbook complicated enough for college professors to respect it and use it these people look down on things that are easily understood things like awe and reverence shouldnt be mixed in with education i know that if college professor sees something simply phrased in its totality of simplicity then he will immediately relegate it to the first grade teacher i know better than to use prerogative when i mean right but the professor absolutely dies if he doesnt have an adverbial clause modifying participial phrase of some character which syntaxes itself to death people have the idea that there are certain poses and pretences and styles that are necessary however when you enter falsity into subject it may endure longer but it wont work right if something isnt running right or is overly hard to handle there is lie connected with it if the pcs ptp keeps hanging up and ot handling despite your correct attempts to handle it you can be sure that there is lie connected with it either the pc isnt hung up in ptp or the ptp being put forward by him is known and outrageous lie or it is continuing to be ptp because the pc has told someone some falsehoods connected with it we cannot asis it because it doesnt have in it what it is supposed to have in it anyhow the problem is how much lrh will concede to the professors in order to get the comm line and study tech in without going into too much falsity book of policies is also being published which will help to ensure that organizational expansion can occur in an orderly fashion early on some guys thought that scientology was business where you made lot of bucks scientology is an activity which if done well gives you the additional embarrassment of getting rid of money lrh used to amuse himself at parties by telling peoples fortunes by looking at their banks wearing bath towel on his head with woolworth diamond you cant observe the pc without occupying the viewpoint of the auditor
