when foreign national of signatory state is arrested or otherwis detained appropriate authorities within the receiving signatory state must inform him without delay of his right to have his consulate

arising between nations w ith respect to the vccr prior to us withdrawal from the optional protocol the icj ruled in the lagrand case federal republic of germany v united states and the case concerning avena and other mexican nationals mexico v united states of america that article 36 confers an individuallyenforceable right to consular notification further the icj concluded that procedural default rules should not at least in certain circumstances bar the raising of article 36 claims by foreig n nationals who were not provided with requisite consular information and we re

what judicial remedy if any is available to foreign nationals in us criminal proceedings who are not provided requisite consular information by vote of 53 the court held that 1 suppression of ev idence in criminal proceeding is never an appropriate remedy for an ar ticle 36 violation and 2 federal and state procedural default rules prevent the raising of article 36 claims that were not made on timely basis although the court considered the icjs interpretation of article 36 as deserving respectful consideration it did not deem it to be legally binding or necessarily persuasive the court did not determine whether article 36 creates an individually enforceable right nor did the court assess the legal implications of the presidents 2005 memorandum instructing state courts to give effect to the icjs decision in avena with respect to the 51 mexican nationals at issue in that case on november 15 2006 the texas court of criminal appeals held in the case of ex parte medellin that neither

judicial remedy if any is available to foreign nationals in us criminal proceedings who are not provided requisite consular information background on the vccr and us implementation the vccr is multilateral agreement codifying consular practices which have traditionally been governed by custom nd bilateral agreements between nations the vccr enumerates basic legal rights and duties of signatory states relating to inter alia the conduct of consul ar relations and the privileges and immunities accorded to consular officers and offices the united states ratified the vccr in 1969 and most countries are parties to the agreement when the united states became party to the vccr it also chose to become party to the vccrs optional protocol concerning the compulsory settlement of disputes optional protocol3 parties to the optional protocol agree to accept the jurisdiction of the international court of justice icj to resolve disputes arising between nations with respect to the

of consular notification requirements by michael john garcia hereinafter crs report rl32390 at 1922 9 see id at 45vccr article 36 vccr article 36 provides that when foreign national of signatory state is arrested or otherwise detain ed appropriate aut horities within the receiving signatory state must inform him without delay of his right to have his consulate notified this requirement is potentially beneficial to detained national for example if the consulate of the detained national is given notice of the arrest it might take diplomatic steps to ensure that its national is treated fairly in the receiving state consulate might also arrange for legal repres entation or assist in obtaining evidence or witnesses from the sending state to bolster the nationals defense in any subsequent criminal case us implementation of the vccr article 36 when the vccr was ratified by the united states the agreement was understood to be selfexecuting that is additional implemen ting legislation was required for it to take effect or be judicially enforceable6 under regulations implemented prior to us ratification of the vccr foreign national arrested by federal law enforcement authorities will have his consul advised of his arrest unless the national does not wish such notification to be given7 perhaps due to constitutional concerns related to federalism8 there is federal statutory mechanism to ensure adherence to vccr article 36 by state and local law enforcement though the state department provides informational materials to state and local entities regarding their consular notification obligations under the vccr9 despite these measures foreign nationals detained by state and local authorities are not always provided with requisite consular informa tion additionally state and federal procedural default rules might prevent foreign nationals from obtaining remedy for an article 36 violation when they become aware of the vccrs consular notification requirements after having been convicted of an offense as is the case on the federal level state pr ocedural default rules genera lly prevent the reopening of cases to consider claims that were not raised on timely basis eg before or during trial the rule may preclude the raising of claims based on the violation of treaty or in many cases constitutional right although lower fe deral courts have

november 2 2005 the supreme cour t granted certiorari in two cases concerning article 36 violations moises sanchezllamas v oregon and bustillo v johnson the court consolidated these cases for argument the cases involved review of state convictions of two foreig n nationals who were not promptly informed of their ability under vccr article 36 to have their consul notified of their arrest this was not the first instance where the court was asked to adjudicate matters relating to the enforcement of vccr article 3611 most notably in the 1998 per curium opinion issued in the case of breard v greene 12 the court concluded that among other things article 36 did not alte r or create an exception to traditional us procedural default rules in cases wher foreign national was not provided with requisite consular information13 nevertheless more recent legal developments raised questions regarding the continuing precedential value of breard acting pursuant to the optional protocol germany and mexico brought claims before the icj against the united states in 1999 and 2003 respectively for alleged article 36 violations in the lagrand case federal republic of germany v united states the icj concluded inter alia that 1 article 36 provides covered individuals with righ t to consular notification and violation of that right may require re view and reconsideration of foreign nationals sentence and convic tion in certain instances and 2 the application of procedural default rules to bar the raising of article 36 claims at least in certain instances prevents full effect from being

still party to the vccrs optional protocol and accordingly recognized the icj as having jurisdiction to settle disputes between protocol pa rties regarding the interpretation and application of the vccr although the united states withdrew from the optional protocol several months prior to the us supr eme court granting certiorari in sanchezllamas and bustillo there was some question as to whether the icjs decisions in lagrand and avena would compel or persuade the cour t to overrule its earlier decision in breard case background petitioner sanchezllamas mexican national was arrested for attempted murder and other offenses on account of shootout with oregon police when initially arrested he was informed of his miranda rights but was not told that he could have the mexican consulate notifie d of his detention during subsequent interrogation sanchezllamas made incriminating statemen ts prior to his trial sanchezllamas moved to have these stat ements suppressed b ecause authorities had failed to notify him of his right to consular notification under vccr article 36 this motion was denied by the trial court nd sanchezllamas was convicted the conviction was affirmed by the oregon st ate court of appeals and oregon state supreme court which held that vccr article 36 does not create judicially enforceable right to consular access sanche zllamas appealed this ruling to the us supreme court petitioner bustillo honduran national wa s arrested and charged with murder by virginia law enforcement authorities but only learned of his ability to have his consulate notified after having been convicted follo wing the affirmation of his conviction on appeal he filed habeas petition in virginia state court arguing for the first time that authorities had violated his rights under article 36 the virginia court of appeals dismissed this claim as proce durally barred because bustillo did not raise this argument at trial or on appeal as re quired under virginia law and the dismissal was upheld by the virginia supreme court bustillo appealed to the us supreme court the supreme court granted review to both cases and in an opinion by chief justice roberts joined by justices lito kennedy scalia and thomas denied petitioners claims for relief existence of judiciallyenforceable right under vccr article 36 before considering what remedy if any was available to the petitioners for violation of article 36 the court first considered whether article 36 creates judiciallyenforceable right to consular notification in the previous case of breard the court had only

consular assistance following arrest16 and lower federal and state courts had reached differing conclusions on the matter17 fivejustice majority of the court decided not to definitively resolve this issue concluding that regardless of whether such right existed petitioners were not in any event entitled to the remedies they sought18 in dissent justice breyer joined by justices stevens souter and ginsburg would have definitively held that article 36 grants rights that may be invoked by foreign national in judicial proceeding19 exclusion of evidence as remedy to an article 36 violation the exclusionary rule is used to deter constitutional violations by requiring certain evidence gathered in violation of defendants constitutional rights to be suppressed at trial with respect to th question of whether suppression of evidence is an appropriate remedy fo r an article 36 violation fi vejustice majority held that suppression is never suitable response as an initia l matter the court rejected any suggestion that the vccr requires the suppression of defendants statements to police as remedy emphasizing that the text of article 36 acknowledges that the rights accorded therein are to be exer cised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving state20 asserting that the exclusionary rule as we know it is an entirely american legal crea tion and that the automatic exclusionary rule is still almost universa lly rejected by other countri 40 years after the drafting of the vccr the court concluded it would be startling to read the vccr as requiring suppression of evidence21 petitioner sanchezllamas ar gued that suppression of evidence is nevertheless the appropriate remedy under the us system of law to give full effect to the rights accorded by article 36 he further argued that such remedy should be required by the court under its authority to develop remedies for the enforcement of federal law in statecourt criminal proceedings the court rejected this argument noting that wellestablished precedent left it beyond di spute that the court did not have ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33613crs6 22 id quoting dickerson v united st ates 530 us 428 438 2000 23

2681 26 id at 2682 27 id at 2688 ginsburg j concurringsupervisory power over stat courts but only federal22 accordingly any authority possessed by the court to craft judicial remedy applicable to state courts for an article 36 violation must be derived from the vccr itself where treaty does not provide particular remedy either expr essly or implicitly the court reasoned it is not for the federal courts to impose one on the states through lawmaking of their own23 even assuming arguendo that judicial remedy was required to give full effect to the rights accorded under article 36 an assumption the court viewed with skepticism24 the court concluded that applying the exclusionary rule would not be the appropriate remedy unde r us law the exclusionary rule has traditionally been used to deter constitutional violations under the fourth amendment and fifth amendments eg unreasonable searches and seizures conf essions obtained by police in violation of the right against lfincrimination and due process violations the court found that the rights accorded to foreign nationa l under article 36 are different than those for which the exclusionary rule traditionally applies article 36 only provides foreign national with the right to have his consulate informed of his arrest not substantiv guarantee of consular intervention or prohibition on police interrogation pending consular notice or intervention suppression would accordingly be vastly disproportionate remedy for an article 36 violation25 the court further noted that any cognizab interests the petitioner claimed were advanced under article 36 were already protected by other constitutional and statutory protections including those cerning the right to an attorney and protection against selfincrimination in conclusion the court suggested the availability of other remedies for an article 36 violati on these included diplomatic options and the possibility of raising article 36 claims in judicial proceedings as part of broader challenge as to the voluntariness of police interrogation26 in concurring opinion justice ginsburg ag reed with the judgment of the court finding that suppression was in appropriate in the cases befo re it but would have left open the question of whether suppression could be an appr opriate remedy in different circumstances27 writing in dissent justice breyer joined by justices stevens and souter agreed with the majority that the vccr does not create miranda style automatic exclusionary rule concerning incriminating statements made by foreign national who is not provided with requisite consular in formation but disagreed with the majoritys conclusi on that suppression is never the proper remedy the dissenting justices believed that suppression may be an appropriate remedy when it is the only available remedy to cure prejudi ce related to an artic 36 violation theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33613crs7 28 id at 2691 breyer j dissenting 29 id at 2683 30

granted by the court it was party at the time when the article 36 violations at issue occurredwould have remanded both cases to the stat courts to consider whether suppression was appropriate given the factual circumstances of each case28 application of state proce dural bars to vccr claims the third and final issue considered by the court was whether state procedural default rules may prevent the raising of article 36 claims that are not made on timely basis here the court reaffirmed its decision in breard which held that state procedural default rules pply to article 36 claims in reaffirming breard the court considered the icjs decisions in lagrand and avena and declined to follow the icjs ruling that procedural default should not prevent the consideration of article 36 claims both petitioners and several amici argued that the united states was obligated to comply with the vccr as it had been interpreted by the icj the court stat ed that it found nothing in the structure or purpose of the icj suggesting that its interpretations were intended to be conclusive for us courts while the court noted that the icjs interpretation deserves respectful consideration it di d not deem it to be binding29 the court elaborated that under the us constitutional system if treaties are to be given effect as federal lawdetermining their meaning as matter of federa l law is emphatically the province and duty of the j udicial department headed by the one supreme court established by the constitution30 the court also stated that the us withdrawal from the optional protocol further made it doubtful that our courts should give decisive weight to the icjs interpretation of vccr article 3631 even according respectful consideration to the icjs interpretation of article 36 majority of the court found its readin g to be unpersuasive here the court focused on the language of ar ticle 36 providing that the ri ghts contained therein are to be exercised in conformity with the wsof the receiving st ate specifically the court disagreed with the icjs conclusion in lagrand that procedural default rules could prevent full effect from being given to the purposes of article 36 the court viewed the icjs interpretation as overlooking the importance of procedural default rules in an adversary system such as that used in the united states which relies chiefly on parties to raise significant issues to court in timely and appropriate manner for adjudi cation in contrast to the inquisitorial magistrate directed systems employed by many vccr parties where inquisitors engage in factual and legal investigations themselves under the icjs reading of article 36 the court suggested article 36 claims c ould potentially trump not only procedural default rules but also other requirements on parties to present legal claims at thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33613crs8 32 id at 26852686 33 id at 2687 34 id at 2688 35 id 36 sanchezllamas 126 sct at 2688 ginsburg j concurring 37 sanchezllamas 126 sct at 26992700 breyer j dissentingproper time for adjudication eg statutes of limitations prohibitions against filing successive habeas petitions32 the court disposed of bustillos claim for suspension of procedural default rules by analogizing article 36 to miranda claims33 although failure to inform foreign national of his article 36 rights may prevent him from becoming aware of those rights in time to assert them at trial the same is also true with respect to miranda claims if for example fendant is not informed of his miranda rights and subsequently fails to raise miranda claim during trial procedural default rules can and do prevent him from raising the cla im in postconviction proceeding the court declined to provide an exception to procedural default rules for article 36 claims when similar exception is accorded to almost other right including many of our most fundament constitutional protections34 finally the court stressed that its holdi ng in way disparages the importance of the vienna convention the relief pe titioners requested was extraordinary and there was slight to the convention to deny petitioners claims under the same principles as we would apply to an act of congress or to the constitution itself35 in concurring opinion justice ginsburg ag reed with the judgment of the court concerning the application of procedural default rules to the cases before it but would have left open the ques tion of whether an exception to default rules for article 36 claims might be required in different circumstances36 justice breyer writing in dissent for himself and justices souter and stevens argued that the majority had overstated the breadth of the icjs rulings in lagrand and avena and that the icj understood the vccr only to require an effective remedy for article 36 violations in some but not all cases this could requi re an exception to traditional procedural default rules to permit the raising of an article 36 claim while assuming that the icj opinions were not controlling justice breyer argued that respectful consideration of icj decisions compelled deference to its expertise on vccr issues and adherence to its interpretation of vccr article 36 in the present case accordingly the dissent would have allowe d procedural default rules to give way to article 36 claims when states do not provide any effective remedy for article 36 violations possible remedies could in clude an ineffectiveassistanceofcounsel claim when defendants attorney acts incompetently with respect to vccr rights of which the attorney

consolidated cases of sanchezllamas and bustillo some issues related to interpretation and application of vccr article 36 remain unresolved as mentioned previously the issue of whether the vccr confers an individually enforceable right has not been decided by the court the question of whether such right is conferred by ar ticle 36 and what judicial remedy if any is available for violation of that right will likely be the subject of continued litigation perhaps the most notable unresolved issu concerns us implementation of the icjs ruling in avena with respect to the 51 mexican nationals at issue in that case as previously mentioned in avena the icj ruled that the united states failed to comply with its obligations owed to xico and its foreign nationals under the vccr it further instructed the united states to review and reconsider the convictions and sentences of named mexican foreign nationals awaiting execution who were denied requisite consular information owed under vccr article 36 in 2004 the supreme court granted certiorari in the case of medellin v dretke 38 in which it would have likely ruled on the enforceablity of avena by us courts petitioner medillin one of the mexican nationals named in the avena case argued among other things that his conviction by texas court should be reconsidered in light of the icjs ruling despite such reconsideration bein g barred by texass procedural default rules prior to th supreme court reaching decision on this issue president bush issued memorandum in structing state courts to give effect to the avena decision in accordance with general pr inciples of comity in cases filed by the mexican nationals addr essed in that decision39 the memorandum did not instruct state courts to reconsider article 36 claims by persons who were not named in avena days later the united states wit hdrew from the optional protocol the supreme court subsequently dis missed its writ of certioriari in medellin as improvidently granted as it was longer clear that medellin had exhausted his remedies at the texas state level in light of the presidents memorandum the court in sanchezllamas cites the presidential memorandum only once to indicate that the united states has agreed to discharge its international obligations in having state courts give effect to the decision in avena but it has not taken the view that the icjs interpretation of article 36 is binding on our courts40 accordingly the issue of whether the pres ident may order state courts to provide remedy for vccr violations remains unresolved whether the president may instruct state courts to implement an icj order raises novel constitutional questions concerning fe deralism and the scope of the executives foreign affairs power the supreme cour t has found that executive agreements httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33613crs10 41 eg american insurance association v garamendi 539 us 396 2003 united states v belmont 301 us 324 1937 united st ates v pink 315

disclose holocaustera insurance policies sold in europe was preempted as it conflicted with the presidents foreign policy objectives reflected in various executive agreements concerning the settle ment of claims involving insurance policies confiscated by nazi germany42 however the presidents memorandum ordering state courts to implement the icjs order is not an executive agreement and reviewing court might therefore treat it differently43 further even if state procedural default rules may be preempted to the extent that they conflict with presidents foreign policy objectives relating to the vccr it is unclear whether the president has the constitutional authority to direct state courts to adopt measures to facilitate those foreign po licy objectives although the supreme court has found in veral cases that state law is preempted to the extent that it conflicts with international agr eements or us foreign policy objectives44 these cases have not involved situations in which the federal government instructed state and local institutions to take affirmative steps to advance us foreign policy interests as is arguably the case with the presidents memorandum instructing state courts to give effect to the avena decision ie requiring state courts to reconsider the convictions and sentences of persons who were not provide d requisite consular notification information

could not be sustained under either his express or implied constitutional powers or through any power granted by congress and held that the memorandum violated the separation of power s doctrine by intruding into the domain of the judiciary the court suggested th at texass procedural bar might have been preempted by an executive agreement between mexico and the united states permitting reconsideration of the sentences of mexican nationals by us courts even though state law could not be preempted via unilateral action by the president to achieve settlement though the majority opinion was join ed by all nine members of the texas court concurring opinion w ould have also rejected the legal authority of the presidents memo randum on federalism grounds47 while another would have held that the memorandum did not constitute federal law and was therefore not binding on state courts48 the courts decision is potentially subject to appeal to the us supreme court
