needs thorough definition of the problem to be addressed and an explanation of what the appropriate solution might be solutions may include legislation regulation or media attention clearly defined issue makes the determination of the themes for developing the message and promoting the solution easier to explain to colleagues supporters opponents constituents and the press next time line for solving the problem should be determined is this onesession or one congress or longerterm project is it oneevent or coordinated series of events should the events be held in the members district or state in washington or throughout the country g20g142g156g142g138g155g140g145g561g157g145g142g561g18g155g152g139g149g142g150g561 prior to beginning work on the solution an indep th determination of the extent of the problem needs to be undertaken for example is the problem limited to one district state region or is it nationwide should the solution address the specific issue or the policy in general consultation with local and state officials community leaders and constituents is integral at this stage discussions in washington may include committee and subcommittee leaders the party leadership think tanks and interest groups g6g142g157g142g155g150g146g151g142g561g21g157g155g138g157g142g144g162g561 one of the most important decisions is whether to conduct an inside or outside strategy or possibly combination of the two inside strategy entails work within the legislative process only ie legislation hearings committee and floor amendments floor debate and conference consideration advocates may or may not be involved in any of this activity an outside strategy calls for advocates to generate mail press and office visits often to force an inside strategy to occur combined strategy includes using dear colleague letters coordinated oneminute or special order speeches membertomember lobbying and group press conferences

project or join forces does the political party or state of other members involved influence the decision should it has the project ever been tried in the past if yes what members tried it what was the result is the project still needed are there lessons to be learned from the earlier attempt what other members committees or party leaders should be involved what advocates should be involved which advocates will support and which will actively oppose the initiative g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g21g157g155g138g157g142g144g162g561 is legislation the appropriate remedy for the problem will freestanding measure be necessary or is there vehicle to which an amendment can be offered should the member introduce the legislati on alone or seek original cosponsors should those cosponsors be bipartisan shou ld they be of the same type eg women philosophy state and region or district demographics serving on the same committee should companion measure be introduced in the other chamber should dear colleague letters be sent prior to introduction should they be sent periodically throughout the process identifying status when should the legislation be introduced eg opening day first or second session specific time of year what should the legislation be titled is there useful acronym to be found to assist in publicizing the legislation should particular number be reserved eg hr or s 2020 relating to eye care should working group be created staff only or members only what role should the party leadership play what of committee leadership what type of coalitions
