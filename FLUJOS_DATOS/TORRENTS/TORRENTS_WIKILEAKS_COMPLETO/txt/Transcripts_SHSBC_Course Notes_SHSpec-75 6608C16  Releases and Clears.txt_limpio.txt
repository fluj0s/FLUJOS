6608c16 shspec75 releases and clears the problem that we have had with releases is the problem of overrun we have also had lots of unknown data on the extent of the bank buddha made the same mistake not being aware of the existence of the bank or the mind 2500 years ago 10000 years ago there was monk named dharma dharma made the mistake of believing that you didnt have to do anything but become wise from him comes the basic philosophical assumption that if you become wise you become free this is in the woof and warp of todays culture the idea that an individual can exteriorize and that by doing so he can become free was part of gautama siddhartha buddhas teaching that hasnt become part of the popular culture yet so we are slightly ahead of our time it seems to take 10000 years for such ideas eg dharmas idea given above to become central to culture so buddhas idea see above has 7500 years to go and scientology on the same time table has 10000 minus 16 years to go in other zones of the universe the existence of the mind is known in the galactic confederacy they have psychotherapy that consists of recognition of the fact that at moment of fatal accident to thetan picture is made however they think that it is location not picture they take picture of the location where the thetan was hurt and show it to him with movie clapsticklike thing slapped in front of it then the thetan is supposed to follow suit by doing the same thing to his picture and thus be free of its effects that is their way of making releases that therapy is administered to the releases in that society that pass for ots they are ot releases that is the closest other therapy to scientology todays concentration on education universities etc is result of dharmas ideas on wisdom the idea that education leads to freedom that you cant have freedom and ignorance he had tough time 10000 years ago man was more of an animal than he is today so it was more difficult for dharma to communicate with them it is interesting that education is an outgrowth of desire for wisdom hence scientology is in this mainline this would be an interesting topic for lecture or chapter of book the estrangement of wisdom from education it was terrific advance to get the idea of becoming free by becoming wise across to the savages of this planet 10000 years ago this idea is now so widely accepted that the secondlargest expenditure of taxes after the military is for education at dharmas time there was the knowledge that freedom was attainable but there was tech 7500 years later buddha discovered exteriorization gautama siddhartha buddha first exteriorized under bodhi tree he thought you did it by becoming wise one of gs buddhas other ideas was that you should be civilized and polite and buddhism civilized three quarters of asia but exteriorization was not generally doable to any great degree the tibetan lamas came along later and squirreled trying to develop an explanation of exteriorization or technology to accomplish exteriorization we are the gainers from this history to the extent that there is history and acceptance of the idea that the soul exists our gain is that the idea of the soul has been accepted by many for long time the idea that there is soul that goes somewhere after death has dominated graecoroman and mohammedan thought for 2000 years socrates originated this idea in the present philosophical tradition there is verbal tradition about socrates in greece that socrates held forth for the existence of personal being or thetan buddhism advanced into the west through the essenes and christianity later the nicene creed developed from the dead sea scrolls hundred years after its development it was advanced by jesus of nazareth powerhouse with an already existing philosophy the christian church today has to contend with the embarrassing fact that the dead sea scrolls predate christ and yet contain the new testament this is just the advance of buddhism in the western world christ studied in the east for thirty years by the time gautama siddhartha buddhas ideas had gone from india through greece spain ireland etc they were alterised to man has soul but it is over there and belongs to god etc buddha thought became unrecognizable there has never before been clear only releases the most that was achieved by any of these former philosophies was release 1 dharma release by wisdom 2 buddhism release by exteriorization 3 christianity release by repentance and being good in scientology we just let bodhi ie exteriorization happen it is not even that significant to us because we are going for permanent state however if in the course of auditing someone he goes exterior you stop right there if you go on you bang him back into his body and into his bank and he will be arc broken pc exterior is on harmonic of ot but cant have it he has had bunch of losses in the past bad experiences like deaths associated with exteriorization and he snaps back in very soon scared he is not competent to cope with it he isnt ready for it you can take someone who has been insane and have him go totally sane by exteriorizing him you can also have someone go out come back in and never know it the formula for popping someone out is try not to be three feet back of your head buddhism spread like wildfire because it was such clearcut truth in one fell swoop we have capitalized upon the idea that man who is improved becomes free we have brought buddhisms twenty year effort to exteriorize down to twenty seconds we have found what kept dharmas efforts from perfection and what barriered buddhism in culture that only accepts dharmas idea but not yet buddhas dont be discouraged by failures to get instant acceptance for scientology but notice also that earlier missionaries had bank and therefore havent had pure version of the truth that they were spreading the christians civilized things somewhat but there were too many vias to get very good results with christianity from buddha through socrates through the original form of christianity through organized christianity through various arguments of christianity buddhism spread faster than christianity because buddhas ideas were closer to those of dharma buddha was capitalizing on dharmas idea that wisdom would make you free which was acceptable to his society it carried the implication that it was possible to be free asia knew that there was possibility of man becoming free very hard message to get across matter how information is conveyed if it is conveyed at all and it is truth it will take root so scientology wont really take 10000 years to get across it will be more like fifty years at the outside given how fast buddhism civilized asia and japan and given 1 the result that we can produce 2 modern communication 3 the slightly more barbaric conditions 2500 years ago if you take half century to get scientology around you are really slow man you notice i said you when you first address being then you are capitalizing on the past indoctrination and belief of the being you must take this into account the magna carta is direct result on education in dharma through the church the spanish civil war of 1936 was also the result of the philosophy of dharma because in the decade just before the war paperback books were introduced people read french and english philosophers and got the idea that now that they knew something they should be free they actually resisted freedom though so it backfired where you fail in disseminating is where you run into someone who doesnt have this assumption people have to learn that individuals should be free or educated government that skimps on education is either one that hasnt heard of the philosophy of dharma or one that suppresses this philosophy out of fear in the west you are talking to christian people who unfortunately think of the soul as an owned commodity that they should not play with they are stunned to think of someone exteriorizing they are really not up to the idea of buddha though they have gotten the idea of dharma such people have gone past dharma but havent reached buddha it is to such people that you are trying to teach scientology so dont go in over their heads fortunately they do agree with the gradation scale of release they understand the idea of clear as someone who doesnt have barriers to his thinking or to freedom of his mind but they will not understand exteriorization which is in the realm of ot so talk about clear but dont talk about ot there are many undercuts that you could teach him dianetics is not the lowest undercut only relatively enlightened public will accept dianetics the public will understand the idea of communication release as person who gets rid of his barriers to communication they can get the idea that person can communicate better that person can be released from an inability to communicate wog who cant communicate will think that communications release is great for stammerers and backwards children etc he thinks its great for others in short but he will buy the idea likewise with problems wog will buy the idea that man would be better off if he could handle problems and so on up the line there is high probability that you will make connection somewhere the idea that wisdom leads to freedom is basic on this chain it releases man from imprisonment by ignorance and that is your first form of release teach person that if he learned something he would be freeer and he will be released from the idea that he cant know this is the earliest stage of release you would do well to argue with people on the basis of this first premise the dharmic fundamental because dharmas idea is the direct ancestor of scientology there is lower level of release one you would use in processing animals it is the idea that an animal could get an idea across to another animal this is not communication you have to know youre in something before you can get out of it that is the main difficulty with communicating levels of release and people psychologists etc are not aware of the mind they see another bloke they dont see any mind so he says there is such thing as mind only brain which can be seen but in fact the brain is just sort of neural shock absorber looking at scientology as philosophy is agreeable to people when you put it this way you are in agreement with the idea that person can become freer released from some of his travail by becoming wiser so use dharma in dissemination your next level of release that is acceptable to the world at large is that man is spiritual being buddhas idea however dont use this wundt of leipzig wiped out buddha in the west in 1879 when he introduced the idea that man was an animal so it was ok to kill him this is like the christian philosophy advanced in the second or third century ad that man was conceived in evil and was evil so it was perfectly ok to kill maim etc it was and is justification for overts the christian has not found out that the psychologist is an atheist this is partially due to the inarticulateness of the psychologist the populace thinks that psychology is silly but suppressives and governments support it because it prevents releasing sps support sp subjects and technologies that is why the government supports psychology and psychiatry in disseminating you could say you are christian arent you then he has admitted that he is spiritual being reincarnation was only barred in christianity in the last few hundred years the former idea was that guys who hadnt been good enough had to come back and live it all over again if you can get someone to buy the idea that he is spiritual being he is released from truth that could trap him possibly this is where you could introduce the idea of exteriorization but i dont advise it dianetics can give one release from this one lifetime that is terrific release you have made an immortal the terrible consequences of death go away you can start with the idea that there is mind looking at b doesnt see bs mind so he doesnt know that b has mind he may think that b only has brain you have to put across the idea that because this fellow the fellow that you are talking to has mind that that person has mind with dianetics it would follow that he is immortal then he is released from the idea that man is matter and that he only has one life fortunately people do know that there is such thing as mind and mental things they havent gotten totally sold on the psychologists theory that mind brain so you can move in and introduce the idea of the mind being composed of pictures with little dianetic auditing the person will realize that he is immortal and you will have released him from the idea that he is matter so you should be aware that you can release people just by talking to them up to point but remember always stop at the fn vgis dont try to just communicate the data up the chart to do so overwhelms people they have to come to realize it as you progress up the grade chart it becomes progressively more impossible to talk them out of what they are sitting in at levels vi and vii it would be fatal an ultimate release would be release from the universe when we say release we mean freeing we can free someone from an idea that entraps him ideas are the only real traps and one can get released from them there are many grades of release below zero at zero and up we are starting to free someone directly from his reactive mind treating him as spiritual being at level 0 we are pulling him out of mass that tells him that he cant communicate so we have to pull him out of mental masses as well as out of ideas at level vii and up we dont pull him out of mental mass we erase it we turn around and eat the tiger that is form of release that we call clear but this being at this level is still in the universe and associated with the body there are therefore grades of release above clear not many people below the level of clear look any higher though because clear is pretty triumphant level when you get an fn shut up because you have just released the pc from something you have to know why he got the fn to get him through qual ie you have to know what he is released on get this data from the auditing notes not from the pc most stages of release have only relative degrees of stability but release never unreleases to the same degree of stygian darkness that he was in before the release clear is someone who has erased the barriers to his postulating freely he can at this point easily postulate bank and some have done so not realizing that that was what they were doing clear can postulate bank and then not realize that he has done so or that he can simply blow it we are making dianetic clears the trouble we had doing it earlier came only from overauditing people also dont ever try to teach guy something that he already knows it is an overrun released person doesnt tend to relapse but he may run into the next higher levels sticky plaster they havent unreleased they are just enterprising and speculative and this drives them into the next level someone who has been released and comes in the next day with fn has just gotten into the next mass that he is going to confront releases want others to be released and cleared but dont release people to make them better for others sakes being released is something that is reward not right
