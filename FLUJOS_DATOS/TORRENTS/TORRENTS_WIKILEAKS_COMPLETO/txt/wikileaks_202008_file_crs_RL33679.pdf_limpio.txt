than the coverage of victims of crime under the laws of the district of columbia the definition is by and large the same definition found in the general federal restitution statutes 18 usc 3663 3663a commentators have suggested that courts will be able to draw upon the case law developed under the two restitution statutes to determine who qualifies as victim under section 377121 recourse may be somewhat complicated however by the presence of additional language in the restitution definitions22 or by the references in the restitution statutes to specific persons23 and the types of harm that qualify for restitution24 g20g142g156g157g146g157g158g157g146g152g151g561g5g138g156g142g561g14g138g160g497g561g7g151g157g146g157g146g142g156g561 nevertheless the courts do seem likely to consult their experience under the restitution statutes when construing section 3771s definition of victim section 3771 and the restitution statutes speak of victims who are persons crime victim means person although in common parlance this might be thought to restrict the class of victims to human beings general usage within the united states code is to the ry unless the context suggests another intent the word person as used in the united states code is understood to include corporations companies associations firms partnerships societies and joint stock companies as well as individuals 1 usc 1 earlier cases rejected arguments that only human beings could be victims qualified for restitution 25 perhaps because the question is considered settled the argument has disappeared 21 eg cassell recognizing victims in the federal rules of criminal procedure proposed amendments in light of the crime victims rights act 2005 b righam young university law review 835 857 22 for the purposes of this chapter the term crime victim means person directly and proximately harmed as result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered including in the case of an offense that involves an element of scheme conspiracy or pattern of criminal activity any person directly harmed by the defendants criminal conduct in the course of the scheme conspiracy or pattern in the case of crime victim who is under 18 years of age incompetent incapacitated or deceased the legal guardians of the crime victim or the representatives of the crime victims estate family members or any other

legal entities without commenting upon their want of human status26 the universal definition in 1 usc 1 does not mention governmental entities but they too have been found qualified for restitution

an earlier version of the restitution statutes authorized restitution for injuries and losses resulting from certain offenses but made mention of direct and proximate harm 18 usc 3579 3580 1982 ed this earlier language suggested persuasively that congress intended restitution to be tied to the loss caused by the offense of conviction the supreme court said in hughey v united states 495 us 411 418 1990 thus restitution order might be based only upon the offenses to which the defendant had plead and not upon the additional offenses for which he had been initially indicted id at 422 after the restitution statutes were rewritten to include the direct and proximate language some courts have continued to hold to the proposition that restitution is only available for harm directly related to the crime of conviction or provided for in some explicit exception such as that available for conspiracies and plea bargains 28 other courts have permitted restitution based on proximate harm if it is not too remote from the crime of conviction and if there are unrelated intervening causes or contributors to the harm29 thus for continued 1988 united states v sunrhodes 831 f2d 1537 1545546 10 th cir

the offense of conviction since the statute at issue in hughey and the cvra use similar definitions of victim it appears that the same reasoning would exclude victims of uncharged conduct from the

restitution statutes section 3771 states that in the case of deceased victim the legal guardians of the crime victim or the representatives of the crime victims estate family members or any other persons appointed as suitable by the court may assume the crime victim s rights this suggests that family members of the deceased are not themselves considered victims it implies that one of the parents and other relatives of an adult homicide victim may assume the victims rights but otherwise are entitled to none of the rights found in section 3771 the restitution cases may lend some credence to this view32 early case law construing section 3771 seems to leave the question unsettled in discussing whether court appointment of representative for deceased actual victim was necessary one court appears to have assumed that family members of homicide victim are not themselves victims per persons other than actual victims where the actual victim is deceased minor incompetent or incapacitated the legal guardians of the crime victim or the representatives of the crime victims estate family members or any other persons appointed as suitable by the court may assume the crime victims rights under this chapter 18 usc 3771e the provision appears to mean that where surrogate is required and one is available that person will automatically assume the crime victims rights

violates federal or dc law the specific inclusion of only the district of columbia in section 3771 in light of the specific inclusion of the territories in some of the past proposals to amend the constitution might be seen as evidence that congress did not intend section 3771 to cover victims of crimes committed in violation of the various territorial codes which often have their own extensive

the right to be reasonably protected from the accused 18 usc 3771a1 section 3771 lists the right to be reasonably protected from the accused first among its victims rights most of section 3771s components can be traced to comparable provision in the 108 th congress proposed constitutional amendments this one is little different the constitutional amendment proposals spoke of right to have judicial decisions made with an eye to victim safety 40 the previous language focused on adjudicative decisions the new language has such limitation the earlier language seemed to impose an obligation to guard against threats to victim safety from whatever source the new language establishes right to the victim to be protected against the accused use of the term accused and portions of the scant legislative history might be read to imply that the right expires with the conviction of the accused at which point he would ordinarily be referred to as the offender41 nevertheless the colloquy on the floor between two of the principal senate sponsors ende d with the comment that they considered the term accused in 3771 to mean convicted as well42 but earlier in their discussion they summarized the right simply using trial protection example43 the clause appears to have been the subject of little if any judicial attention one commentator has observed that the legal significance if any of these general provisions is unclear44 at the very least the section provides an explicit justification for compatible judicial action taken in the interest of victim safety 45 39 united states v lm

some implicit the section explicitly excuses failure to notify victims of the release of an accused when to do so might be dangerous47 and it permits the courts to seek reasonable accommodations when the number of victims in given case precludes strict compliance with the sections demands48 the implicit limitation is constitutional in some circumstances the manner in which notice is provided may intrude upon the rights of the accused to an impartial jury trial or other constitutional rights of the accused49 under such circumstances the statutory rights of the victim must yield continued new

the right to notification of their rights it merely imposes an obligation upon government officials to make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of them50 this notification of the rights established was component of the early constitutional amendment proposals51 which followed the lead of several state constitutions and statutes52 it was originally seen as victims counterpart to the miranda warnings enjoyed by an accused and as prerequisite if the proposed amendments were to function effectively53 there were objections however that the warnings were out of character with the other rights conveyed by the constitution and might pose implementation problemsobjections that ultimately prevailed apparently54 since the provision was not included in later proposals55

necessity and wisdom of providing that covered victims shall have right to reasonable notice of the rights established by the amendment other constitutional provision mandates that citizens be provided notice of the rights vested by the constitutionnot even the courtcreated miranda warnings are constitutionally required in an analogous context justice connor noted that the free exercise clause is written in terms of what the government cannot do to the individual not in terms of what the individual can exact from the government this clause in the proposed victims rights amendment would create an affirmative duty on the government to provide notice of what rights the constitution provides turning this formulation on its head moreover i do not believe that sufficient consideration has been given to the practical aspects of the requirement which governmental entity would be required to provide the notice would it be the police when taking crime report the prosecutor prior to seeking an indictment or filing an information or perhaps the court at some other stage in the process at what point would the right attachwhen the crime is committed when an arrest is made does the term presume that the government entity providing notice must have assimilated the supreme courts latest jurisprudence interpreting victims rights when giving notice finally congress will be empowered to enforce its provisions presumably including the question of how governmental entities must provide victims notice will this permit congress to micromanage the policies

of their rights under the section and to inform them that they consult an attorney concerning those rights 57 the notice clause has several distinctive features the notice rights apply only with

the breadth of the phrase involving the crime used to describe the public proceedings covered by the notification right may raise questions too the phrase clearly contemplates more than trial pretrial and posttrial hearings involving motions to dismiss to suppress evidence to change venue to grant new trial and any of the host of similar proceedings that flow to or from criminal trial seem to come within the meaning of the term the senate reports discussion of proceedings related to the crime in earlier versions for instance specifically mention appellate proceedings srept 106254 at 31 srept 105409 at 26 the same reports indicate that at least at one time covered release proceedings were understood to include those involving release from custody of defendant found not guilty of crime by reason of insanity and then hospitalized in custody for further treatment id at 36 and 30 crime relatedness understood in such terms would presumably carry victim notice rights to fairly wide range of civil and quasicivil proceedings eg habeas and civil forfeiture proceedings and extradition hearings to name but few it may be for this reason that the phrase was changed to involving the crime phrase that arguably imposes greater limits on the class of proceedings than might be considered related although not clearly sufficient to excuse notice of habeas forfeiture or the extradition proceedings59 historical proposals were thought to perhaps embody notice rights for the victims of defendants past crimes and victims of charges that had been dropped or dismissed as well as victims of charges that had resulted in acquittal 60 the change might be considered repudiation of that construction as well 59 one witness however thought it more likely to confirm an intent to embr ace civil proceedings senate hearing v at 162 house hearing v at 79 statements of james orenstein some public proceedings involving the crime are civil in nature and normally proceed wit hout any participation by the executive branch of government here again the change in language from sjres 3 106th cong could be problematic that bill used the phrase relating to the crime which the senate judiciary committe noted would typically be the criminal proceedings arising from the filed criminal charges although other proceedings might also be related to the crime senate report at 3031 court interpreting the current bill might conclude that the change from relating to to involving was intended to make it easier to apply the amendment to proceedings outside the criminal context see also senate hearing iv at 122 house hearing iv at 50 60 frequently criminal defendants are suspected to have committed crimes for which they are never charged or for which charges are later dropped even though significant evidence may exist that the defendant did indeed commit the crime do the victims of these crimes have rights under the proposed amendment if so are they the same as the rights of the victims of charged counts or of the defendant such victims of course would have the same rights to notice and allocution relating to conditional release the acceptance of negotiated pleas perhaps substantially complicating plea bargains and sentencing srept 105409 at 42 additional views of sen hatch under existing federal law sentencing courts are to consider relevant conduct that is part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction ussg 1b13a2 that includes misconduct for which the defendant has never been charged or even for which he may have been acquitted united states v

repudiation was intended in the case of the proposed constitutional amendment and stated simply that the public proceedings are those relating to the crime srept 108191 at 34 in doing so it might be thought to have embraced earlier descriptions of proceedings related to the crime even though the committees examples in the 108th congress were much more modest in some places id the right applies not only to initial hearings on case but also rehearings hearing at an appellate level and any case on subsequent remand 61 the colloquy on the floor between senate sponsors of section 3771 is somewhat ambiguous but seems to confirm that the proceedings as to which notice is due include appellate proceedings62 by confining the proceedings covered to court and parole proceedings section 3771 eliminates the speculation previously possible that the rights might be available in an administrative context such as in administrative immigration proceedings

notice right seems significant because it would appear to greatly reduce the prospect of reasonable but ineffective notice yet the committee report issued after its addition in the constitutional amendment proposal makes note of it and continues to describe the obligation in the same terms used prior to the change63 under pre addition proposals it was unclear whether reasonableness was to be judged by the level of official effort or by the effectiveness of the effort the senate reports noted that heroic efforts were not expected but due diligence was srept 108191 at 34 srept 106254 at 30 srept 105409 at 25 but the obvious purpose for the right to notice was to provide gateway to the amendments other rights even without the addition of the clarifying timely requirement what was reasonable might have been judged by whether the efforts were calculated to permit meaningful exercise of the amendments other rights 64 the senate reports however explained that in rare circumstances notice by publication might be reasonable65 although if judged by existing due process standards such notice might not have been adequate in ordinary circumstances66 notice given after proceeding was conducted might 61 but see srept 108191 at 35 the release which triggers notification requirement must be one relating to the crime this includes not only release after criminal conviction but also

might constitute an effective exclusion from the proceedings or might defeat the right to make victim impact statement67 the addition of timeliness requirement seems to reduce the possibility of reasonable but untimely notification68 the same might be said for the new demand that notice be accurate it might seem difficult to imagine how notice could be cons idered either timely or reasonable if for want of accuracy it effectively defeated victims opportunity to exercise his or her rights one court has suggested that the accuracy modification was made to ensure that victims are kept advised of schedule changes 69 in the context of release notifications the most vexing reasonableness questions may arise should the right extend both to the accused and to the convicted as discussed below in some instances such as the right to notification of the release of prisoner following full service of his sentence section 3771 may require notification of victims who would not previously have been entitled to notification and whose identity and location are therefore unknown to custodial authorities 70 application may be challenging in the area of bail as well the section grants both right to consideration of the victims safety and right to reasonable notice attendance and comment under earlier circumstances it might not be unusua l for an accused to be released on recognizance or bail before authorities could reasonably be expected to provide victims with timely notice it may be that the section contemplates postponement of the accuseds initial judicial appearance continued to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action nd afford them an opportunity to present their objections mullane v central hanover bank truest co 339 us at 314 as mullane made clear the due

reasonable period of time to prepare and present their views early constitutional amendment proposals seemed to explicitly anticipate that failure of timely notice in bail context could be rectified by recourse to the provision in the amendment that permitted the bail decision to be revisited at the behest of victim71 the section contains such explicit provision but nothing in the section precludes revisitationother than abandonment of the earlier explicit provision perhaps 72

the implication is that there is right to notice of release or escape following conviction since at that point the defendant is convicted rather than accused if this is the sections meaning the consequences of the change are considerable the administrative burdens associated with notifying victims every time an inmate is released from custody are not insignificant this is especially true if the section is construed to apply to the future release or escape of prisoners convicted of crimes committed prior to its effective date nevertheless the committee report in the 108 th congress suggests that in the equivalent language of the proposed constitutional amendment the senate judiciary committee considered the terms accused and convicted interchangeable and intended change from earlier more generously worded proposals the release which triggers notification requirement must be one relating to the crime this includes not only release after criminal conviction but also for example release of defendant found not guilty of crime by reason of insanity and then hospitalized in custody for further treatment or release pursuant to habitual sex offender statute srept 108191 at 35 71 past proposals had provision which declared nothing in this article shall provide grounds to reopen any proceeding except with respect to conditional release eg sjres 3 106th cong since the amendment has similar prohibition on reopening at the petition of vict im bail exception is necessary of course whether the initial bail hearing is delayed or the accu sed is rearrested following the victim s petition to reopen the result is the samean accused is detained longer than would otherwise be the case in the name of victims rights srept 105409 at 44 additional views of sen hatchthis provision in particular has perhaps the greatest potential to collide with the legitimate right of defendants all defendants and convicts have constitutionally protected liberty interest in conditional release once such release is granted permitting victims to move to reopen such pro ceedings or invalidate such rulings would of course necessitate the rearrest and detention of released defendants and convicts likely implicating their lib erty interest 72 see united states v turner 367 fsupp2d 319 324 edny 2005when it became apparent that the alleged victims here had not been given specific notice of the first two proceedings i considered an adjournment as an alternative to further proceedings in violation of the victims rights another alternative and one that i concluded was preferable under the circumstances was to order the govern ment to provide written summary or transcript of the proceedings to any victim who was denied notice and to make it clear that i would hear any victim with respect to whether the decision i made in the victims absence should be reconsidered i do not endorse this alternative as routine substitute for conducting such proceedings wit hout notice to victimsthe statute plainly forbids such an approach but where as here the result of the proceeding conduct in the victims absence is one that does not appear to jeopardize any substantive as opposed to procedural right of the victim since the defendant was detained rather than released on bail the relief i ordered here seemed preferable to an order that would require further incarceration of criminal defendant without substantive ruling on whethe r there exist conditions of release that satisfy the requirements of the bail reform act

it is an unfortunate reality that in todays world there are crimes that result in multiple victims the reality of those situations is that court may find that the sheer number of victims is so large that it is impracticable to accord each victim the rights in this bill the bill allows that when the court makes that finding on the record the court must then fashion procedure that still gives effect to the bill and yet takes into account the impracticality for instance in the oklahoma city bombing case the number of victims was tremendous and attendance at any one pro ceeding by all of them was impracticable so the court fashioned procedure that allowed victims to attend the proceedings by closed circuit televison this is merely one example another may be to llow victims with right to sp eak to be heard in writing or through other methods importantly courts must seek to identify methods that fit the case before that to ensure that despite numerosity of crime victims the rights

testimony the constitution promises the accused public trial by an impartial jury77 and affords him the right to be present at all critical stages of the proceedings against him78 it offers victims such prerogatives their status is at best that of any other member of the general public and in fact the constitution screens the accuseds right to an impartial jury trial from the overexuberance of the public79 moreover victims are even more likely to be barred from the courtroom during trial than members of the general public ironically the victims status as witness the avenue of most likely access to pretrial proceedings is the very attribute most likely to result in exclusion from the trial sequestration or the practice of separating witnesses and holding outside the courtroom all but

that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if the victim heard other testimony at trial 42 usc 10606b42000 ed section 3771 also operates in conjunction with 18 usc 3510 which declares

constitutional amendment proposals which with early exceptions afforded general right not to be excluded83 it was suggested that the phrase not to be excluded in the amendment proposals was used to avoid the claims that the proposal would entitle victims to transportation to relevant proceedings or to have proceedings scheduled for their convenience or to free them from imprisonment to attend

proposed constitutional amendments the senate judiciary committee reports answered that the right was not veto but an opportunity to present relevant information91 the later legislative history of section 3771 is silent on the question but any contrary construction would appear to have constitutional implications92 the evolution of the reasonably heard language complicates the method of communication issue at one time the proposed constitutional amendments spoke of right to be heard if present and to submit statement93 when the phrase if present and to submit statement was dropped and the right defined as the right to be reasonably heard one hearing witness expressed concern that the courts would construe the new language to convey an absolute right to make an oral statement i would expect courts to interpret the deletion of submit statement to signal legislative intent to allow victims actually to be heard by making an oral statement nor do i think the use of the term reasonably to be heard would alter that interpretation instead i believe courts would likely reconcile the two changes by interpreting reasonably to mean that victims oral statement could be subj ected to reasonable time and subject matter restrictions if the above is correct then prison officials might face an extremely burdensome choice of either transporting incarcerated victim s to court for the purpose of being heard or providing for live transmissions to the court room related problem would extend beyond prison walls because the difference between the previous and current versions of the amendment suggest that victim must be allowed specifically to be heard rather than simply to submit statement victim might persuade court that the reasonable opportunity to be heard guaranteed by the current version of the amendment carries with it an implicit guarantee that the government will take affirmative steps if necessary to provide such reasonable opportunity this undermines the intent of the amendments careful use of negative phrasing with respect to the right not to be excluded from public proceedingsa formulation designed to avoid government obligation to provide funding

right to make an oral statement95 at least in bail context another district court believes it includes such right and that courts may limit the presentation to written presentations96 and in yet third view an uncertain member of the appellate panel suggests that reason may limit the right in some sentencing contexts97 nevertheless it is certainly difficult to argue that the sponsors of section 3771 believed the right to be heard could be confined to written statement particularly at sentencing in the absence of an overwhelming number of victims this right of crime victims not to be ex cluded from the proceedings provides foundation for the next section section 2 a4 which provides victims the right to reasonably be heard at any public proceedi ng involving release plea or sentencing this

have spoken of the right to be heard in release proceedings101 there seems to be little dispute that the term contemplates the right to be heard at bail proceedings what other proceedings if any the term encompasses is question complicated by the qualifiers with which successive proposals surrounded the release related right past amendment proposals once conveyed right to be heard at public proceedings relating to conditional release from custody and to the extent the inmate enjoyed right to be heard at closed parole hearings102 later versions simply conveyed right to be heard at public release proceedings103 the clear implication was that under the later proposals victims had right to be heard at closed parole hearings regardless of whether the inmate had right to be heard104 on the other hand the new formulation seemed to open wider range of proceedings to victim allocution there was always some ambiguity over whether conditional release proceedings meant proceedings where release might be granted if certain conditions were met before release like acquittal at trial or proceedings where release bound the accused or convicted offender to honor certain conditions after release like bail or both in any event in bygone proposals the senate judiciary committee read conditional in the phrase conditional release from custody as word of limitation the amendment extends the right to be heard to proceedings determining conditional release from custody this phrase encompasses for example hearings to determine any pretrial or posttrial release including comparable releases during or after an appeal on bail personal recognizance to the custody of third person or under any other conditions including pretrial diversion programs other examples of conditional release include work release and home detention its also includes parole hearings or their functional equivalent both because parole hearings have some di scretion in releasing offenders and because releases from prison are typically subject to various conditions such as continued good behavior it would also include release from secure mental facility for criminal defendant or one acquitted on the grounds of insanity victim would not have right to speak by virtue of this amendment at hearing to determine unconditional release for example victim could not claim right to be heard at hearing to determine the jurisdiction of the court or compliance with the governing statute of limitations even though finding in favor of the defendant on these points might indirectly and ultimately lead to the release of the defendant similarly there is right to be heard when prisoner is released 101 hjres 173 104th cong to comment at any such proceeding involving the possible release of the defendant

at 32 srept 105409 at 27 thus by removing the words conditional and from custody the proposals and consequently section 3771 perhaps should be understood to allow victims the right to be heard on most pretrial motions as well as most posttrial preappellate petitions or at least any that might result in release of the accused or the convicted offender from jeopardy for example it might support an argument that the section gives victims the right be heard at trial by the trier of fact judge or jury on whether the defendant should or should not be convicted on any of the charges at issue ie at least limited trial participation although the committee report denied any such intent 105 it may seem more logical to suggest that proceedings to which the right attaches are only those where the issue of whether the defendant should be released is squarely addressedbail proceedings and habeas proceedings under 28 usc 2255and not proceedings where the issues addressed may be resolved in manner that leads the defendants release yet at least one commentator has suggested that the right to be heard in release proceedings includes the right to be heard upon motions to dismiss charges the comment comes in discussion of the changes in the federal rules of criminal procedure appropriate to implement the section under one such proposed change the court would be required to co nsider the views of the victim before it ruled on motion to dismiss charges proposed change which would implement victims right to be treated with fairness and to be heard at any proceeding involving release of the defendant 106 the same logic would appear to support victims right to be heard in suppression hearings and other pretrial motions regardless of how expansively release is construed there are some proceedings that seem beyond the scope of section 3771s participation rights the right attaches to public proceedings in theory therefore it does not apply in grand jury proceedings or proceedings such as those involving juveniles which are closed at the discretion of the court107 the right attaches to public proceedings in the district court in theory therefore it does not apply in appellate proceedings whether relating to bail or otherwise108 even where the right appears to otherwise apply on its face some courts may be reluctant to postpone the defendants initial appearance or release

thus in ch arge bargain the victim wants to insure that the defendant pleads to charge sufficiently serious to allow restitution and in sentence bargain the victim wants to advocate an award of restitution the victims second interest is retribution or revenge the victim feels he or she has been violated and that the criminals punishment should be severe therefore in charge bargain the victim would want the defendant to plead guilty to serious charge and in sentence bargain the victim would want significant sentence imposed walling victim participation in plea bargains 65 w ashington

however described an extensive but more limited right section 2 a5 provides right to confer with the attorney for the government in the case this right is intended to be expansive for example the victim has the right to confer with the government concerning any critical stage or disposition of the case the right however is not limited to these examples i ask the senator if he concurs in this intent mr k yl yes the intent of this section is just as the senator says this right to confer does not give the crime victim any right to direct the prosecution prosecutors should consider it part of

elements of section 3771 the language of this right is reminiscent of the constitutional amendment proposals in the 108th and 107th congresses which spoke of right to full and timely restitution130 those proposals were very different from earlier proposals they did not establish right to restitution in so many words they did not explicitly convey right to have proceedings reopened for failure to accommodate victims right to restitution instead for the first time they spoke of just and timely claims to restitution two concepts which could be subject to several interpretations the first victims rights proposals promised either right to an order of restitution from the convicted offender 131 or right to full restitution from the convicted offender132 subsequent continued victims right in the

proposals appeared to make restitution orders mandatory as matter of right the scope of the right was unstated although the proposals applied to juvenile proceedings the use of the term convicted offender might have been construed to limit their restitution command to criminal convictions and therefore not reach findings of delinquency134 restitution orders in nominal amount or subject to priorities for criminal fines or forfeiture or other claims against the defendants assets might have seemed inconsistent with the decision to elevate mandatory victim restitution to constitutional right their legislative history indicated that these early proposals did not confer on victims any rights to specific amount of restitution leaving the court free to order nominal restitution the right conferred on victims was one to an order of restitution with the order in hand questions of enforcement of the order and its priority as against other judgments were left to the applicable federal and state law srept 106254 at 37 srept 105409 at 31 the committee reports however continuously suggested that the right might include the right to pretrial restraining order to prevent an

congress became the right to consideration of just and timely victims claims appropriate to the circumstances weighed against the interests of others and perhaps only applicable during proceedings on other matters at first glance it appeared that as long as the victims interest in just restitution when asserted in timely manner was recognized the amendment proposals left the law of restitution

to restitution without reference to any other factors yet insertion of the word just for the first time in the restitution component of the amendment proposal presumably called for consideration of such factors when appropriate moreover it probably precluded restitution claims by the rippedoff drug dealer or others victimized in the course of their own illegal conduct at least in some circumstances 136 historic proposals explicitly allowed victims to reopen final proceedings in vindication of their right to restitution that language disappeared and in its place was reference to timely claims to restitution the implications were obvious but the statement quoted above seems to suggest that timeliness may be judged by the date of the injury the date of sentencing or the date on which the offender had the resources to begin paying restitution section 3771 adds the phrase as provided in law to the right and substitutes full and timely restitution for just and timely restitution with the changes the section seems to confirm rather than enlarge existing law in the area of restitution sponsors felt that elsewhere the section bolsters the victims restitution interest by ensuring the victims rights to notice consultation and participation 137 one appellate court has pointed out that the promise of full restitution extends only as far as the law provides fact that

constitutional right is reenforced by statute and rule in the form of speedy trial laws in both the federal and state realms142 ironically however the defendant is often the only person involved in criminal proceeding without an interest in prompt trial delay often works to the defendants advantage witnesses may become unavailable their memories may fade evidence may be lost changes in the law may be beneficial or the case may simply receive lower priority with the passage of time143 until recently victims had comparable rights although their advocates contended they had very real interest in prompt disposition some victims sought to put traumatic episode behind them some wanted to see justice done quickly some hoped simply to end the trail of inconveniences and hardship that all too often fell to their lot as witnesses144 few states have since enacted statutory or constitutional provisions establishing victims right to prompt or timely disposition of the case in one form or another145 the federal statutory victims bill of rights 42 usc 10606 2000 ed did not include speedy trial provision but congress has encouraged the states to include right to reasonably expeditious trial among the rights they afford victims146 section 3771a7 seems to convey more generous right than its predecessors in the proposed constitutional amendments yet in spite of what might appear to be an evolutionary development the right has been described at each stage in mu ch the same terms throughout the years it was suggested that perhaps the standards used to judge the defendants constitutional speedy trial right govern here as well147 in the beginning proposals sometimes actually spoke of victims speedy trial right148 and in other instances preferred to describe it as the right to have proceedings resolved in prompt and timely manner149 proposals in the 105th congress continued the split some focused on the 141 eg ric onst art1 10 scc onst arti 14 142 eg state

proceedings150 in the following congress the proposals all called for consideration of the victims interest in trial free from unreasonable delay151 in this form the right was one relevant only in trial and pretrial context the proposals seemed to carry the implication that the right could only be claimed in conjunction with other proceedings eg considered in the context of defense or government motion for continuance but not defendants motion for new trial but not necessarily provide grounds for free standing victims motion when the question of timing was not otherwise before the court in the 108 th congress the formulation referred to the right to adjudicative decisions that duly consider the victims interest in avoiding unreasonable delay152 some of the words were new the phrase adjudicative decisions replaced trials and proceedings duly consider appeared instead of consideration and avoiding unreasonable delay stood where free from unreasonable delay once was yet at least some of the concepts seemed to remand constant reasonable delays were to countenanced unreasonable delays tolerated only if they are outweighed by other interests the supreme courts speedy trial jurisprudence was to be used as guide for what was reasonable 153 on the other hand the new wording left other questions unanswered were victims to have the right to be heard prior to any decision that might either cause or reduce delay one hearing witness expressed concern that the right to consideration of the interest might include the right to voice the interest on questions other than scheduling does crime victim have the right to object to the admission of evidence on the ground that it might lengthen the trial house hearing v at 81 statement of james orenstein yet the amendments language did not necessarily create right to assert the interest the delay avoidance interest triggered right to consideration interests elsewhere in the amendment triggered right to be heard and the right to be heard related to matters of public release plea sentencing reprieve and pardon proceedings not to the matters of scheduling motions and other pretrial and trial proceedings which were just as likely to produce delay courts might have concluded the differences were significant section 3771a7 continues to describe the right to delay avoidance in limiting terms but apparently more expansively than its forebears the right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay its sponsors suggested than the right was aimed at scheduling delays particularly i would like to move on to section 2 with right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay this provision does not curtail the governments need for reasonable time to organize and prosecute its case nor is the provision intended to infringe on the defendants due process right to prepare defense too often however delays in criminal proceedings occur for the mere convenience of the parties and those delays reach beyond

assert the rights established by this article and person accused of the crime may obtain any form of relief hereunder sjres 1hjres 48 108th cong section 3771d1 expressly authorizes the government to assert rights on behalf of the victim moreover it is not exclusive it seems open to the possibility that the rights may asserted by someone other than the mentioned claimantsvictims victims representatives and the governmentas long as the claimant is not defendant accused of the crime the legislative history confirms the impression that representatives include both victims attorneys and those standing in the stead of legally unavailable victim and it negates somewhat the implication that anyone other than the actual victim enjoys ultimate control of the victims rights 160 some of the cases have already noted the propriety of prosecutors asserting victims rights161 the governments prerogative to assert the rights of victim apparently includes the right to petition for mandamus when they are denied162 g15g138g151g141g138g150g158g156g561g138g151g141g561g3g153g153g142g138g149g561 the rights described in subsection shall be asserted in the district court in which defendant is being

sen fe insteinthis provision allows crime victim to enter the criminal trial court during proceedings involving the crime against the victim and assert the rights provided by this bill this provision ensures that crime victims have standing to be heard in trial courts so that they are heard at the very moment when their rights are at stake and this in turn forces the criminal justice system to be responsive to victims rights in timely way importantly however the b ill does not allow the defendant in the case to assert any of the victims rights to obtain relief the provision allo ws the crime victims representative and the attorney for the government to go into criminal trial court and assert th crime victims rights the inclusions of representative and the governments attorney in the provis ion are important for number of reasons first allowing representative to assert crime victims rights ensures that where crime victim is unable to assert the rights on his or her own for any reason including incapacity incompetence minority or death those rights are not lost second crime victim may choose to enlist private attorney to represent him or her in the criminal casethis provision allows that attorney to enter an appearance on behalf of the victim in the crimin trial court and assert the victims rights the provision also recognizes that at times the governments attorney may be best situated to assert crime victims rights either because the crime victim is not available at particular point in the trial or because at times the crime victims interests coincide with those of the government and it makes sense for single person to express those joint interests importantly however the provision does not mean that the governments attorney has the authority to compromise or coopt victims right the rights provided in this bill are personal to the individual crime victim and it is that crime victim that has the final word regarding which of the specific rights to assert and when waiver of any of the individual rights provided can only happen by the victims affirmative waiver of that specific right 161 in re mikhel 543 f3d 1137 1138 9th cir

proposals were simply silent on the issue164 the sections senate sponsors apparently saw the availability of mandamus as means of appellate review165 in other contexts it is more limited it is drastic and extraordinary remedy reserved for really extraordinary cases166 the second circuit has observed that mandamus petitioner must usually demonstrate 1 presence of novel and significant question of law 2 the inadequacy of other available remedies and 3 the presence of legal issue whose resolution will aid in the administration of justice167 it felt however that since congress had designated mandamus as the principal avenue of review it did not intend to require victims to overcome the hurdles typically faced by petitioner seeking review of district court determination through writ of mandamus168 using for guidance the supreme courts determination of the appropriate standard of review under the equal access to justice act which grants attorneys fees to the victims of governmental overreaching the circuit panel settled on an abuse of discretion standard 169 the ninth circuit agreed170 163 sjres 3 106th congnothing in this article shall provide grounds to stay or continue any

shall take the writ and shall order the relief necessary to protect the crime victims right this provision is critical for couple of reasons first it gives the victim standing to appear before the appellate courts of this country and ask for review of possible error below second while mandamus is discretionary this provision means that courts must review these cases appellate review of denials of victims right is just as important as the initial assertion of victims right this provision ensures review and courages courts to broadly defend the victims rights mr president does senator kyl agree mr k ly absolutely without the right to seek appellate review and guarantee that the appellate court will hear the appeal and order relief victim is left to the mercy of the very trial court that may have erred this countrys appellate courts are designed to remedy errors of lower courts and this provision requires them to do so for victims rights for victims right to truly be honored victim must be able to assert the rights in trial courts to then be able to have denials of those rights reviewed at the appellate level and to have the appellate court take the appeal and order relief by providing for all of this this bill ensures that victims rights will have meaning 150 congrec s4270 daily ed april 22 2004 remarks of sens feinstein and kyl 166 cheney v united states

within 10 days and c in the case of plea the accused has not pled to the highest offense charged this paragraph does not affect the victims right to restitution as provided in title 18 united states

victims rights at first they suggested that relief could only granted prospectively specific judicial decisions could not be postponed or reopened171 later they yielded bit and allowed bail and restitution proceedings to be revisited but otherwise made the prospective nature of relief even more explicit172 finally they simply left the question for legislative resolution except for prohibition on new trials173 section 3771d5 limits the opportunity to revisit plea and sentencing proceedings it says nothing about bail restitution or other trial proc eedings all of which are thus presumably subject to the expedited fiveday stay mandamus procedure of section 3771d3

usc 3771d1 some of the constitutional amendment proposals relied on an assertion that only victim or her representative could claim their benefits174 but most included an explicit disclaimer in one form or another that bar defendants use of the proposed amendment175 the provisions intent is apparent and sparked little debate over the course of its legislative history176 use of the term the crime seems to suggest that the disqualification is itself limited an individual accused or convicted of one crime may none the less be the victim of another this would appear to be so even if the two offenses arose out of the same event such as case of domestic violence in which each of the participants assaulted the other 171 sjres 65 104th cong nothing in this article shall provide grounds for

provide grounds for new trial 18 usc 3771d5 similar clause appears in the proposed constitutional amendments177 but on different footing but for the clause in constitutional amendment victims right to attend trial might be thought to trump the constitutional protection of the accused against double jeopardy on the other hand the absence of such clause in statute such as section 3771 might be construed to mean that the new trial remedy would only be available to victim if it were of benefit to the accused if the accused had been acquitted double jeopardy would bar new trial if he had been convicted new trial would afford him second chance at acquittal 178 g15g138g151g162g561g24g146g140g157g146g150g156g559g17g151g142g561g3g140g140g158g156g142g141g561 in case where the court finds that

amendments did acknowledge that the right to reasonable notice might be honored less thoroughly in cases involving hundreds of victims than in cases involving only few179 the same might have been said but was not of the right to be reasonable heard and the right not to be excluded the amendments instead afforded the courts flexibility to deal with cases involving hundreds of victims or other unusual circumstances180 section 3771d2 deals with the challenge more explicitly although both the language used and the legislative history make it clear that when necessary to invoke the section the courts are expected to adopt alternative procedures in the spirit of the reduced right181 g16g152g561g6g138g150g138g144g142g156g561 nothing in this chapter shall be construed to authorize cause of
