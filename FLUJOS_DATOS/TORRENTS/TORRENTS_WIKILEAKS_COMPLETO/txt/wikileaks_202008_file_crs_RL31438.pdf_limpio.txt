visiting scholar in entrepreneurship and economic growth resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31438patent administration current issues and possibilities for reform summary the united states patent and trademark office uspto examines patent applications to determine whether the subject matter claimed within those applications is sufficiently inventive to rit the award of patent the environment in which patent examination occurs has become increasingly challenging the uspto is facing an escalating rate of patent application filings as well as applications of increasing technical complexity other potential concerns include budgetary constraints and the retention of personnel with appropriate technical and legal qualifications to perform patent examination tasks out of recognition of these challenges the administrative procedures through which the uspto conducts pate nt examination have been subject to renewed public dialogue and congressiona l interest legislati on pending before the 107th congress would introduce reforms to patent adminis tration should congress further consider this issue uspto practices may be reviewed with an eye towards their capability for maintaining acceptable levels of patent quality within cu rrent resource constraints congress may conclude that current u spto practices provide an appropriate level of scrutiny of patent applications in the event that reform is contemplated however widely circulated proposals and the practices of other leading patent granting agencies notably the european patent office epo and the japanese patent office jpo suggest the latest thinking on patent administration reform one set of reform proposals involves augmenting the responsibilities of patent applicants although inventors who seek patent protection are responsible for preparing an application they are currently not required to perform search of public domain information to determine if their t echnology is sufficiently inventive to merit patent some proposals w ould mandate that applicants perform such search or at least state whethe r they have done so others would require applicants to distinguish more carefully their inventions from the state of the art second group of reform proposals involve s an assessment of the contributions members of the general public might make within an optimal patent examination regime interested third parties might be invited to comment upon pending patent applications alternatively they coul d invoke administrative patent revocation proceedings at the uspto known as oppositions finally congress may wish to consider more general workload reduction proposals currently the uspto automa tically subjects each submitted application to detailed substantive examination other possi bilities include deferral of examination or the automa tic registration of every submitted application the uspto might also rely upon the results of fo reign patent offices in reaching its own patentability decisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31438contents patent administra tion fundamentals 2 c n t m p r r p t n t d m i n i s t r t i n c h l l n g s 4the impact of patent quality upon

application fully discloses and distinctly claims the invention14 in addition the application must di sclose the best m ode or preferred way that the applicant knows to practice the invention15 the examiner will also determine whether the invention itself fulfills certain substantive standards set by the patent statute to be patentable an invention must be useful novel and nonobvious the requirement of usefulness or utility is satisfied if the invention is operable and provides tang ible benefit16 to be judged novel the invention must not be fully anticipated by prior patent publica

including examination delays at the uspto and delays in obtaining marketing approval for the patented invention from other federal agenciesdomain17 nonobvious invention must not have been readily within the ordinary skills of competent artisan at the time the invention was made18 if the uspto allows the patent to issue the patent proprietor obtains the right to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or importing into the united states the patented invention19 patent title therefore provides inventors with limited periods of exclusivity in which they may practice their inventions or license others to do so the grant of patent per mits the inventor to receive return on the expenditure of resources leading to the di scovery often by charging higher price than would prevail in competitive market the uspto does not identify or prosecute patent infringers instead each patentee bears responsib ility for monitoring its competitors to determine whether they are using the patented invention or not pa tent proprietors who wish to compel others to observe their intellectual property rights must usually commence litigation in the federal courts an accused infringer may contend that the asserted patent is invalid20 such an argument asserts that the uspto improvide ntly granted the patent however by virtue of having been approved by the uspto each issue patent enjoys presumption of validity accused infringers bear the burden of proving that patent is invalid by clear and convincing evidence21 interested parties possess another mechanism for challenging the validity of an issued patent they may request that the uspto commence an administrative revocation proceeding termed reexa mination in order to provoke reexamination an individual must present the uspto with one or more pertinent patents and printed pub lications if the uspto agrees that these references raise substantial new question of patentability22 the agency will subject the patent to renewed prosecution in light of this additional information the maximum term of patent protection is ordinarily set at 20 years from the date the application is filed23 the patent applicant gains

patented invention without compensation to the patentee contemporary patent administration challenges the uspto currently faces many challenges notably the number of filed patent applications has incr eased significantly in recent years in 1991 the uspto received 178000 applications by 2000 this number had increased by 75 to nearly 315000 applications24 one uspto study estimates that over 500000 patent applications could be file d during the 2006 calendar year25 the increase in patent filings may be due in part to the growth in the range of subject matter eligible for patenting til recently the patent system was generally regarded as concerning the technological inventions of trad itional industry26 modern developments have expanded the range of innovations eligible to be patented27 in particular computer softwa re and business methods may now be subjected to patent protection28 some commentators be lieve that the uspto may face more difficulties while examining applications covering inventions from disciplines with which it was historically unfamiliar29 as technology grows more sophisticate d patent examination tasks may also become more difficult recent growth in filing rates has been more pronounced in complex hightechnology fields such as biotechnology computers and telecommunications30 such inventions may require more time and more technically sophisticated personnel than was require d with predecessor technologies for example one biotechnology application alone arrived at the uspto with 12 cds of accompanying data the equivalent of six million pages of information31 the uspto has also faced staffing issues the task of patent examination sometimes involves subtle legal and technical issues hiring and training individuals to perform these tasks has been recurring issue for the agency the uspto employed 3000 examiners at the close of 2001 but explains that it needs to hire 700httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31438crs5 32ibid 33ibid 34kim coghill

in addition retaining skilled i ndividuals has been difficult given the availability of lucrative intellectual property jobs in the private sector as recently as 2000 the annual exa miner attrition rate was 1433 budgetary pressures have also impacted the uspto the agency budget is supplied entirely from filing and issuance fees with monies taken from the general budget34 in recent years however surcharges fee diversions and other measures have resulted in the reallocati on of portion of uspto revenues into the general budget35 such revenue shortfalls may be impacting the capabilities of the uspto in particular the average time the agency takes to process an application has increased from approximately 18 mont hs in 1991 to its current level of 26 months36 judicial precedents may so be placing more burdens upon the uspto recent decisions from the us court of appeals for the federal circuit the usptos reviewing court have increased the agency s obligations when issuing rejections of patent applications37 the uspto must now articulate in detailed fashion its specific factual findings in order to reject patent application38 the requirement that the uspto explain its reasoning in particularized and thorough manner may increase the time the uspto requires to process applications the impact of patent quality upon innovation some commentators believe that perceived deficiencies in patent administration may negatively impact innovation increases in patent pendenc periods may amount to one such deficiency according to the uspto the average us patent issues about 26 months after an application is filed compared with 21 months in 1996 the uspto reportedly projects that average patent pendency will increase to more than 38 months by 200639 many observers have suggested that delays in processing patent applications can lead to deleterious consequences40 especially in industries where product cyclehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31438crs6 40continued changes chicago lawyer

commen ting about the software industry patent attorney george f wheeler said that by the time we get patent issued the infringers are done and we are already on the next product41 as result patent acqui sition delays may discourag inventors from using the patent system at all inventors might instead prefer to take advantage of the immediate protections available under the trad secret law the incidents of trade secrecy protection ranging from physical secu rity measures such as safes and fences to confidentiality agreements that may limit the ability of employees to interact with one another may in turn lead to co sts that may not be socially productive42 long periods of delay may also create i ndustrial uncertainties enterprises may establish industries based on technologies that are believe d to fall within the public domain years later the uspto might allow patent to issue that covers these basic technologies such pate nts are sometimes termed submarine patents and they potentially grant their owner broad proprietary interest affecting established industries43 in addition to delay trends towards an increasing number of filed applications more complex technologies and less gene rous budgets may result in less rigorous patent examination procedures faced with an increasingly difficult examination environment the uspto may pprove some patent applica tions that do not meet the patentability requirements unde r the patent act some commentators believe that this prospect of low pate nt quality may lead to certain socially undesirable results large numbers of inappropriately granted patents may negatively impact entrepreneurs for example innovative fi rms may be approached by an individual with low quality patent that appears to cover the product they are marketing the innovative firm may recognize that the cost of challenging patent even of dubious validity may be considerable therefore the firm may choose to make payments under licensing arrangements or perhaps d ecide not to market its product at all rather than contest the pa tent proprietors claims some enterprises have also been accused of creating patent thickets or clusters of closely related patents that cover different aspects of particular technology44 for example drug company may own suite of pa tents covering not just the pharmaceutical compound but so various formulations chemicalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31438crs7 45see alfred b engelberg special patent pr ovisions for pharmaceuticals have they outlived their usefulness 39 idea journal of law and technology 1999 389

pharmaceutical some enterprises have been said to cause followon patents to issue as earlier patents are set to expire resulting in an evergreening portfolio that effectively extends patent term be yond the twentyyear statutory period45 improvidently granted patents are also believed to create duplicative transactions costs for example if the patent quality is low private parties must engage in extensive due diligence efforts in order to assess whether particular issued patents are enforceable or not the re sult may be that the innovative community must consistently conduct their own privat patent examinations revisiting the work of the uspto to see if it was done properly poor patent quality may also encourage activity that is not socially productive perhaps attracted by large damages awar ds and potentially porous uspto rent seeking entrepreneurs may be attracted to form speculative patent acquisition and enforcement ventures industry particip ants may also be forced to expend considerable sums on patent acquisition and enforcement46 the net results would be reduced rates of innovation decreased pate ntbased transactions and higher prices for goods and services although low patent quality appears to ffect competitors of patentee patent proprietors themselves may also be negatively impacted patent owners may make managerial decisions such as whether to build producti on facilities or sell product based upon their expectation of exclusive righ ts in particular invention if their patent is declared invalid by the uspto or court the patentee will be stripped of exclusive rights without compensation the issuance of large numbers of invalid patents would increase the possibility that the investmentbacked expectations of patentees become unsettled47 the appropriateness of patent administration reform to the extent there are perceived problems of patent quality potential fiscal technological and staffing challenges to the us patent admin istration regime may prompt consideration of legal reform before considering possible legal reforms further however it should be noted that at least two factors suggest that current patent administration practices should be retained first not everyone agrees that additional resources should be devoted towards augmenting the rigor of patent examination second the uspto may alr eady be engaged in the best practices available to patentgranting agencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31438crs8 48ibid 49mark lemley rational ignorance at the patent office 95 northwestern university law review 2001 1495

acquisition and enforcement public policy challenges and opportunities for innovative firms by john r thomas crs report rl31132 31 august 2001as to the first of these factors the notion that uspto should perform an extremely rigorous examination has been challenged48 some commentators believe that interested private par ties are often able to asse ss the robustness and value of individual patents more easily than the u spto as result uspto hard look during its examination proce dures may be economically in efficient others observe that relatively few patents are believed to be licensed or the subject of litigation49 under this view society is better served if that select number of valuable patents is subject to rigorous review by private parties after their issuance as well the uspto may already employ the best available practices during patent examination survey s of patent applicants indicate that their overall satisfaction rate increased from 52 in 1998 to 64 in 200050 although this largely favorable response suggests some room for improvement it may not motivate significant patent administra tion reforms on the other hand given that applicants are presumably motivated to obtain i ssued patents one might question the appropriateness of surveying applicants to determine whether the uspto is performing its functions at suitable level acceptance of either of these views leads to the conclusion that patent administration reform efforts would be inappropriate unfo rtunately rigorous analytical methods are available to weig h the propriety of these positions the relationship between innova tion and patent rights remains poorly understood current economic and policy tools simply do not allow us to set the appropriate level of patent quality precisely in order to produce an optima l level of investment in innovation51 nonetheless uncertainties i nherent in the patent w reform process should be weighed carefully when considering modifications to the current patent administration regime this report will review several different avenues for patent administration reform in the event that legal reforms are deemed appropriate possibilities for patent

47375practical policy tools for assessing and potentially reforming contemporary patent administration increased applican t responsibilities under current us law the principal obligation of inventors is to prepare truthfully an application fully describing and distinctly claiming the invention for which patent is sought52 inventors must also submit an oath stating they believe themselves to be the orig inal and true inventor53 once an inventor submits patent application the responsibility wholly falls to the patent examiner to identify the state of the art and analyze whether the application claims sufficiently inventive advance to merit patent54 if the examiner cannot provide sufficient reason to reject the application it must be allowed to issue as granted patent55 some commentators have noted the limited role of the applicant during patent examination they have offered reform proposals that have discussed augmenting the responsibilities of patent applicants the following proposals some of which have been implemented in terms of pate nt office programs provide different ways of increasing applicant obligations compelled prior art searches some commentators have suggested that patent applicants be require d to conduct their own searches of the earlier scientific and patent literature56 such documentation of the state of the art is termed the prior art in the patent law57 currently inventors need not conduct prior art search before filing patent application lthough some inventor s probably do conduct such search in order to see whethe r their invention would be considered patentable58 the patent act currently does not compel such search mandatory prior art search could potentially provide certain benefits to the patent examination procedures compe lled search could cause some applications not to be filed at all as inventors realized that their inventions were already within the state of the art those applications that were filed would presumably be more carefully tailored in light of the existing prior art some commentators are less sanguine that compelled prior art search would yield practical benefits sk eptics believe that mandatory prior art search would lead to the disclosure of many prior art documen ts but not necessarily the most pertinenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31438crs10 59thomas supra note 6 60ibid 61hr 1332

it seems more difficult to mandate the quality of the searches60 related approach proposal calls upon an applicant to reveal whether he has completed prior art search or not and if so where the applicant has searched61 although this proposal does not compel s earch it could nonetheless save examiners from redundant efforts when search has ready been completed examiners would be able to move immediately to prior art libraries that were not previously considered by the applicant this proposal seemin gly suffers from the same drawback as compelled prior art search however in that monitoring the quality of disclosed search may be difficult the effectiveness of either of these proposals might be improved if the entire uspto prior art library were readily available to the public the uspto prior art database could for example be made available on the internet in such case an applicant could tell the examiner exactly which databases had been searched as computerized search tools become increasingly prevalent applicants might also disclose search terms and other search ing methodologies this technique might allow the uspto to avoid redundant effort s yet stand in position to assess the quality of applicant searches use of jepson claims inventors are required to claim distinctly the invention they regard as proprietary62 as result patent instruments include one or more claims

within the body of the claim is asserted to be inventive65 many us patent attorneys prefer not to use jepson claims some patent attorneys believe jepson claims tend to portray the invention as limited improvement rather than an elegant combination of diverse elements that together produce an inventive advance66 conversely uspto exa miners generally prefer to receive such claims67 jepson claim format is said to make prosecution more compact for the claim itself identifies the state of the art and the inventors asserted technical contribution the present policy of the epo is to encourage applicants to use jepson claim format68 one possibility is that the uspto do the same drafting claims in the jepson format appears to raise few additi onal costs or inconve niences on behalf of patent applicants on the other hand the benefits of obligator jepson claims may be modest jepson claims are likely most effective when the applicant has completed prior art search and therefore is better able to identify technical features that fall within the state of the art if such search has not been done fully or at all then jepson claims may not be of sign ificant assistance to examiners uspto

former acting under secretary of commerce for intellectual property and acting director of the uspto uspto management is hopefu l that rule 105 will furthe r enable our examiners to perform the best examination possible with applicants assistance73 it is difficult to assess whether uspto examiners have actually made much use of rule 105 because patent applications have traditi onally been maintained in secrecy74 observers are often unable to track the process of individual applications until the date patent issues from the perspective of examiners however rule 105 involves potentially timeconsuming process of drafting statement and parsing the applicants response use of rule 105 ma also not necessarily supply an examiner with additional information the rule provide s that if an applicant states that the requested information is unknown or not read ily available then examiners must treat that answer as complete reply75 focus on the patent systems heaviest users some entities employ the patent system more frequently than ot hers for example fourteen enterprises were awarded 1000 or more u s patents in 2000 an additional 151 obtained at least 100 patents these 165 enterprises r eceived in total 56105 patents about 356 of the 157497 utility patents granted that year76 these statistics reveal that over onethird of the usptos efforts are devoted to 165 large customers the jpo has relied upon frequent filers be fore through the socalled action program for 80 the jpo caused its best cu stomers to devote more resources to the preparation of pate nt applications77 the thinking behind ap 80 was apparently to ease the task of examiners by presenting them with more applications that were amenable to quick review and allowance through ap 80 the jpo

larger applicants might also appear to be the preferred customers of the uspto under such regime encourage third party involvement commentators have proposed that the uspto make more effective use of interested parties to assist in the task of patent examination79 entities outside the uspto may possess certain informational advantages over the corps of examiners current participants in the marketplace may possess better sense of the state of the art for example than the uspto80 by allowing these third parties to play role as private patent examiners the uspto may be able to make better

authorities from the national patent office ppositions often involve wide range of potential invalid ity arguments and ar conducted through adversarial hearings that resemble courtroom litigation although the us patent system does not include oppositions the us patent system has incorporated socalled reexamination proceeding since 1981 some commentators have viewed the reexamination as more limited form of an opposition81 under the reexamination statute any individual including the patentee competitor and even the uspto director may cite prior art patent or printed publication to the

effectiveness86 legislation introduced in the 107th congress would introduce opposition proceedings into us patent law87 supporters of fullf eatured oppositions believe that opposition proceedings

us patent system acted differently from its counterparts overseas the uspto traditionally did not pub licly disclose pate nt applications at all only granted patents we re disclosed to the public upon the day of their issuance this regime was said to advantage patent applicants because it allowed them to understand exactly what the scope of any allo wed claims might be prior to disclosing an invention thus if the applicant was wise enough to maintain the invention that was subject to patent application as trade secret then he could choose between obtaining the allowed patent cl aims and trade secret status93 however this secrecy regime has been perceived as imposing costs as well others might well engage in repetitive research efforts during the pendency of patent applications unaware that an earlier inventor had already staked claim to that technology this arrangement also llows inventors to commence infringement litigation on the very day patent issues wit hout any degree of notice to other members of the technological community94 the domestic publication of foreign filed patent appli cations act of 1999 which was one component of the ameri can inventors protection act of 1999 pl 106113 altered the us regime the domestic publicati on of foreign filed patent applications act allowed inventors to ta ke advantage of secrecy regime where patent filings concerned onl the united states but acknowledged that inventors who sought patent protection abroad were already subject to pregrant publication overseas under this statute us pate nt applications are published after the expiration of18 months from the date of filing there is an excepti on however if the inventor represents that he will not seek patent protection abroad if an applicant certifies that the invention disclosed in the us application will not be the subject of patent application in anot her country that requires pub lication of applications 18 months after filing then the pto will not publish the application95 the domestic publication of foreign filed patent appli cations act of 1999 includes significant qualification protest and preissuance oppositionthe director shall establish appropriate

against pending applications98 in accordance with this statute the uspto established rule 99 new regulation addressing thir d party submissions that pertain to published patent applications the uspto allows interested members of the public to submit prior art patents and publications that pertain to published application however the uspto will not accept argumentation or explan ation of those refe rences as stated in rule 99 submission under this section shall not include any explanation of the patents or publications or any other informa tion the office will dispose of such explanation or information if include d in submission under this section99 in other words the uspto will accept any prior art references submitted by interested members of the pub lic in response to the pre grant publication of pending patent application the uspto will not consider any argument or explanation accompanying those references this compromise seemingly allows the uspto to avoid potentially entangling advocacy by third parties during prosecuti on but it may diminish the effectiveness of public input into patent examination interested mbers of the public may also be less inclined to forward pertinent references to the uspto if they cannot submit accompanying commentary they may reason that the better course is to allow the reference to be considered for the firs t time during litigation where they may offer full argument possibly in front of jury100 workload reduction number of legal reform proposals and existing patent office programs generally relate to workload

of an application stated diffe rently in many other patentissuing states the mere filing of an application does not mean that the patent office will further consider the application inventors who wi sh their applications to mature into an issued patent must submit additional requests in order for the patent office to consider the application such requests must occur within specified time and be accompanied by the appropriate fee in germany an inventor may defer examination for up to seven years101 in japan the maximum deferral period was recently reduced from seven to three years102 if request for examination is made in timely fashion the application is deemed aba ndoned if request for examination is seasonably made the novelty and nonobviousne ss of the application are judged as of the applications filing date supporters of deferred exa mination regimes observe th at they allow applicants the option of deciding to postpone the decision as to whether to obtain patent protection deferred examina tion regimes may also reduce patent office workloads further since all pending applications are published approximately 18 months following their filing dates the public has notice of the prospect of granted patent whether examination is deferred or not103 detractors note that deferred examination system may delay the issuance of fully considered patent instrument and as result substantially increase marketplace uncertainties limited examination tasks the uspto currently operates under an examination regime each patent application presented to the uspto is reviewed to determine whether the invention descri bed therein meets the requirements of the patent laws104 an alternative to examination is socalled registration system under registration regime pa tent applications are simply recorded and issued formal review of the application occurs if patent is asserte d determination of its validity is wholly left to the courts105 early in its history the united states operated under registration system from 1793 through 1839 patents were regist ered without formal review106 various foreign patent systems have also employed registration schemes during their history for example since 1995 the dutch patent sy stem has largely acted as registration system107httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31438crs18 107continued practising law institutepatent 2001 87 151

systems may be less expensive to operate than examination systems at least initially they would appear capable of acting more quickly than examination systems108 however registration regimes provide less certain rights than an examination system and may encourage frivolous filings as result more burdens may be placed upon the courts and private enterprise to determine which registered patents are valid and enforceable109 international worksharing global patent system exists there is mechanism for an inventor to obtain an i nternational patent individuals who wish to obtain patent protection in several countries must inst ead file applications on an individual nationbynation basis110 in turn the patent offices of the world will examine these applications in parallel each providing an independent decision on whether the application shoul d be approved or not for example if an inventor wishes to obtain patent protection in the united states japan and germany essentially the same examination tasks will be performed by three different examiners111 observers have suggested that it is inefficient for multiple patent offices to examine parallel applications112 even absent global patent system the worlds patent offices could respect the examinati on results of their peer agencies once an application was approved by one patent office the other patent offices could provide some level of deference to that result the deference could range from soft look by the uspto at an application that was approved elsewhere to very lenient review that would effectively amount to registration of that application113 some practical difficulties may attend this worksharing proposal the us patent laws differ from those of many fo reign states for example only the us employs firsttoinvent priority principle where patent is awarded to the first actual inventor rather than the first i ndividual to file patent application114 unlike many of its trading partners the us so imposes best mode requirement where inventors must disclose the preferred way of which they are aware to practice thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31438crs19 11535 usc 112 116congressional research service

systems do not116 another potential problem with workshar ing proposals is that the united states may lack the ability to monitor the rigor of foreign examination procedures if foreign patent offices lack stringent exa mination protocols th uspto may have to allow invalid patents to issue to the extent that the uspto would actually monitor issued patents from foreign offices unde r these proposals the benefits of worksharing arrangement may be reduced experience with the patent cooperation tr eaty or pct suggests this possibility the pct provides for the filing of one patent application that can lead to issued patents in many countries117 an inventor may use the pct if he is national or domicile of pct contracting state most often an inventor commences the pct process by filing socalled international application at his local patent office the international application designates all pct member states in which the inventor wishes to obtain patent protection an inte rnational application has the effect of national application in all of the countries that th applicant designates this application will then be sent to one of the individual national patent offices including the uspto epo and jpo that are designated as an international searching authority these patent offices research existing patent documents and other technical literature in order to determine public domain knowledge pertinent to the invention claimed in the patent pplication the applicant then receives an international search report which lists citations of prior art relevant to the claims of the international patent application and gi ves an indication of the possible relevance of the citations to the ques tions of novelty and nonobviousness if the international search report doe s not reveal any public domain knowledge that would defeat the patentability of th claimed invention the applicant may wish to enter the second part of the pct process the socalled national stage here the applicant submits the pct application to various national offices at this time patent examiners in each country exa mine the application based upon their own national laws either allowing or rejecting the patent application the pct framework appears to provide opportunities for the worlds patent offices to rely upon the efforts of their colleagues the uspto could simply accept the international search report and commence with substantive examination experience suggests however that this be nefit may not have been fully achieved perceived difficulty with the pct is th at many patent offices do not appear to respect fully the work product of the intern ational searching authority in fact most patent offices normally repeat the search and examination at the national phase in the same manner as for an ordinary nationa l application possible reason for thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31438crs20 118see markus nolff trips pct nd global patent procurement 83 journal of the patent and

observers these redundant efforts appear to undermine much of the logic behind pct118 concluding observations the technical fiscal and industrial environment in which the patent examination system exists presents number of challenges for the uspto in turn patent administration potentially holds implicati ons for innovative us industry given their lack of market power small busine sses and independent inventors have been perceived to rely more heavily upon th patent system than larger firms119 entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurial firms may therefore possess substantial stake in the rigor of patent examination proceedings to the extent that patent administra tion is believed dese rving of further attention number of existing programs and proposals suggest possibilities for improvement each of these avenues for re form promises benefits but may also lead to costs and complexities selection from this range of possibilities will require careful balancing of the potential
