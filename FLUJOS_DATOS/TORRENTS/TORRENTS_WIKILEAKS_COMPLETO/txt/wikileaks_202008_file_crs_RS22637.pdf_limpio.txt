members of the panel have the right to call witnesses of their choosing to testify on at least one day of that hearing clause 2j1 of h ouse rule xiknown as the minority witness rulestates whenever hearing is conducted by committee on measure or matter the minority members of the committee shall be entitled upon request to the chairman by majority of them before the completion of the hearing to call witnesses selected by the minority to testify with respect to that measure or matter during at least one day of hearing thereon if the minoritys request to call witnesses comes after hearing has begun it will necessitate the continuation of the hearing on an additional day to accommodate minority witnesses1 rule xi however is rarely formally invoked to request an additional day of hearing in practice the rule has largely served as backstop which gives the minority party procedural recourse should the committee majority refuse to invite witnesses they request in the vast majority of hearings the majority does invite minority witnesses after consultation and negotiation with minority members and staff in rare instances however majority of the minority party members of house committee or subcommittee have invoked rule xi to schedule an additional day of hearings for their witnesses including occasions in the 108 th and 109th congresses2

the legislative reorganization act of 1970 3 and was first made part of house rules at the beginning of the 92nd congress 1971 19724 the report of the house committee on rules to accompany the 1970 act said of this provision by custom committees ordinarily honor requests from their minority party members to call certain witnesses section 114b will make this matter of right it provides that during any hearing of committee those members shall be entitled during at least one day of the hearing to call as witnesses persons they select we dont look upon this as an authorization for delaying tactics but rather as good legislative practice 5 the suggestions that the minority party be granted an absolute right to call witnesses of their choosing at hearings had originated five years earlier with the joint committee on the organization of congress jcoc the joint co mmittee on the organization of the congress was established on march 11 1965 to study the organization and operation of congress and 1 rule xi does not prescribe the form of the request but in recent instances where the rule was invoked the request was made by way of letter signed by majority of the minority committee members and presented to the chairman shortly before the conclusion of the hearing 2 see for example us congress house committee on ways and means board of trustees 2004 annual reports hearing 108th

simplifying its operations improving its relationship with other branches of the united states government and enabling it better to meet its responsibilities under the constitution6 in its final report to the house and senate the joint committee argued that the practice of calling minority witnesses should be codified by both chambers of congress their report stated it is normal procedure for witnesses representing both sides of the issue to give testimony at committee hearings in those infrequent instances when witnesses representing the minority position are not allotted time minimum safeguard should exist to protect minority rights the allocation on request of up to 1 day of hearings for witnesses chosen by the minority will furnish the needed protection 7 while the recommendations of the jcoc were not initially enacted their suggestions laid the foundation for those adopted in the legislative reorganization act of 19708

house rule xi gives the minority the right to witnesses of their choosing on one hearing day the committee majority maintains control over the scheduling and logistics of that hearing in addition ordinary house and committee rules governing hearingssuch as those mandating the questioning of witnesses under the fiveminute ruleapply to any hearing in which minority witnesses testify it is up to the chairman of the committee to set the day and location of the requested hearing under reasonable schedule 9 while the committee majority must invite the witnesses chosen by the minority they are not precluded from inviting additional witnesses of their own choosing the chairman maintains control over the logistic s of how the minority witnesses will testify ie individually in panels etc and also determines whether or not to administer the oath to the witnesses 10 as is the case with other witnesses minority witness may decline an invitation to testify the committee can elect to issue subpoena for testimony under the normal procedures of the house and the committee but is not required to do so the scope of an additional day of hearings under the minority witness rule is generally limited by the subject of the hearing committee is not required to permit testimony by minority witnesses or questioning by members or committee staff that strays from the announced subject of the 6 s
