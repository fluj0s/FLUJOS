robert esworthy resources science and industry division january 10 2005 abstract in an eﬀort to strengthen the science underlying epas review of air quality standards congress has provided substantial sums for research on particulate matter over the last ﬁve years because of the signiﬁcant impacts of epas particulate matter standards have on both public health and the economy the current review of the particulate matter standards is likely to be of interest to congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31531congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the

divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31531particulate matter air quality standards background summary the environmental protection agency epa is nearing completion of its review of contentious air quality standard s for particulate matter pm with final action expected in late 2005 the current standards are among the most farreaching regulations on epas agenda promulgated in 1997 but only now being implemented the standards c ould potentially prevent the loss of thousands of lives annually at an annual cost estimate d by the agency to be 86 billion the clean air act caa s ections 108 and 109 requires that air quality criteria used in determining national ambient ai r quality standards naaqs reflect the latest scientific information the act includes provi sions for the periodic review and revision as appropriate of ex isting criteria and standards it is this periodic review process that is nearing comple tion in october 2004 epa released air quality criteria for particulate matter reflecting the agencys synthesis of relevant pm research conducted since the agencys st review completed in 1996 this report referred to as criteria document will provide the scientific basis for assessments and policy decisions regarding the ade quacy of the current pm naaqs further decisions including recommendations regarding the standards are expected early in 2005 following the release of what is referred to as staff paper meanwhile epa is continuing impleme ntation of the 1997 particulate matter standards which had been delayed several years by litigation and other factors on january 5 2005 epa published the final design ations of geographical areas for the fine particulate matter or pm25 particles less than 25 mic rometers in diameter naaqs epa designated 225 counties in 20 st ates and the district of columbia as nonattainment ar eas those areas with or c ontributing to air quality levels exceeding the annual and 24hour pm25 standards congress and wide variety of stakeholde rs have closely followed the evolution and development of pm naaqs in 1997 when the current standards were promulgated congress held 28 days of h earings on the epa rule subsequently more than 100 plaintiffs sued to overturn the standards this litigation went to the supreme court before bein g resolved largely in ep as favor in february 2001 since fy1998 in an effort to expedite research and strengthen the science underlying epas review of the standa rds congress has appropriated funding specifically for pm research annually 62 million for fy2005 the research including reanalysis of key studies u nderlying the 1997 standards has largely confirmed epas earlier conc lusions although new questions have been raised regarding the methodology used in some of the studies the national academy of sciences nas has issued four reports on the state of pm research at epa and epa released report reviewing its fi veyear progress of pm research because of the potential impacts particul ate matter standards could have on both public health and the economy epas rea ssessment of the pm standards will likely be of continued interest to congress this report will be updated as events

standards background introduction under the clean air act caa epa is responsible for protecting public health and the environment from emissions that pollute ambient or outdoor air under sections 108109 of the caa congress manda ted that epa set national ambient air quality standards naaqs for pollutants whose emissions may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare and the presence of which in the ambient air results from numerous or dive rse mobile or stationary sources 42 usc 7408a1 epa has identified and promulgated naaqs for six principal pollutants classified by the agency as criteria pollutants particulate matter pm ozone o3 key measure of smog nitrogen dioxide no2 or inclusively nitrogen oxides1 nox sulfur oxides sox or specifically so2 carbon monoxide co and lead pb every five years according to the statute but less frequently in practice epa is required to review the latest scientific studies and either reaffirm or modify the naaqs the most recent changes streng thening of the particulate matter and ozone standards were pr omulgated jointly in 1997 since they were modified in 1997 the pa rticulate matter sta ndards also referred to as the pm naaqs issued by epa2 and the subsequent review to evaluate whether to revise these standards again have been the source of significant controversy the particulate matter sta ndards have prompted national debate regarding how much scientific information is necessary before regulation can be put in place and the appropriate levels of health protection congress has been especially interested in epas promulgation of th caa standards and has held numerous hearings on particulate matter as required by the caa epa has been reviewing the current particulate matter standards the agency recently finalized its review of the scientific research completed since 1996 and is expected to co mplete its determin ation of whether to increase or decrease the stringency of the standard or reaffirm the current standards by late 2005 or early 2006 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31531crs2 3 given the historical nature of the report portions of the discussion are unchanged from an august 6 2002 report under

impact the implementation and review of the particulate matter standards such as other air quality regulations and propos ed legislation are also discussed in this report recent developments review of particulate matter scientific data in october 2004 epa released air quality criteria for particulate matter referred to as criteria document the report has undergone exte nsive peer review and comment and presents the results of the epas review of numerous studies and related research compiled since the agency completed its pr evious review in 1996 the information in the report will serve as the scientific basis for further assessment by epa technical staff in developing options to be consider ed regarding policy decisions affecting the adequacy of the current pm naaqs promulgated in 1997 the ultimate determination by the epa administrator of whether to change the existing pm naaqs is not expected until late 2005 or early 2006 implementation of current 1997 pm naaqs epa recently completed the process for designating geographical ar eas as attainment or nonattainment with respect to the current particulate matter air quality standard the epa administrator signed final rule on december 17 2004 desi gnating of all or part of 225 counties4 in 20 states as well as the district of columbia for nonattainment of the naaqs for fine particulalte matter or pm25 particles less than 25 micrometers µm in diameter the final rule was published in the federal register on january 5 2005 70 fed reg 9441019 and goes into effect april 5 2005 90 days from the date of publication nonattainment designation begins process in which states and tribes must develop and adopt emission control progra ms sufficient to bring air quality into compliance by an epadefined deadline states are required to submit implementation plans for how they will meet the pm25 naaqs by early 2008 and must be in compliance by 2010 unless they are granted fiveyear extension for more detailed

national ambient air quality standards and proposed regional haze rule july 1997 p es18 available at http wwwepagov ttnoarpgnaaqsfinriahtmloverview similar to the review that led to th establishment of the existing pm naaqs in 1997 epas current review of the nationa l particulate matter standards is expected to be controversial both the health effects of particulate matter and the economic effects associated with particulate matter control are potentially significant on the one hand large concentrations of particulate matter have been known to cause deaths most infamously in londons killer fog which k illed as many as 4000 people in december 1952 smaller concen trations of par ticulate matter have also been linked to health effects pa rticularly for sensitive populations such as children asthmatics and the elderly stri cter controls on par ticulate matter should mean fewer health effects in issuing its 1997 naaqs for particulate matter which included standard for fine particles pm25 for the first time epa projected that attaining the new standard for pm25 would annually reduce deaths in s angeles county by approximately 280 and reduce cases of respiratory symptoms by roughly 200005 for philadelphia county an area with relatively cleaner air attaining the 1997 pm25 standard was estimated to reduce deaths by 40 and cas of respiratory symptoms by 1000 each year6 overall epa estimated that pa rtial attainment of the 1997 pm25 standard would annually result in the avoidance of 3300 to 15600 incidences of premature mortality nationwide7 the 1997 pm naaqs and the supporting scien tific data genera ted significant scrutiny and controversy and were the subject of multiple lawsuits various stakeholders disagreed on whether the st andards were too strong or too weak although the standards were upheld in litigation epa congress the clean air scientific advisory co mmittee mandated by the 1977 c aa amendments and other scientific groups recognized the need to enhance the scientific basis for the pm naaqs the resulting coordinated research effort has advanced the understanding of the potential health effects associated with particulate matter but critical information gaps continue achieving the pm naaqs will entail costs in particular some of the areas expected to be out of compliance with the 1997 pm25 standards have not previously been designated nonattainment for any other naaqs many large industries such as utilities refineries and the trucking i ndustry are concerned that they likely will be affected by the necessary controls on particulate matter emissions to achieve compliance stricter controls on particulate matter will likely mean more costs forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31531crs4 8 epa regulatory impact analysis july 1997 table 131 9

quality standards the decisionmaking process affected industries epa estimated the costs to partially attain the 1997 pm25 standard by 2010 at 86 billion annually8 while industry estimates we re several times higher another concern of areas facing nonattain ment designation pa rticularly of local businesses and governments is that it will have potential negative impacts on an areas economic development nonattainment design ation requires new major sources of pollution to offset their pollu tion by equivalent or greater emission reductions from existing sources and requ ires highway and transit planners to demonstrate that new projects conform to the areas state implementation plans although epa has not analyzed the poten tial economic impact of designating areas as nonattainment for particulate matter recent epa analysis found that ozone nonattainment designati ons had net negative impact on those areas9 due to the significance of these issues congress is likely to remain interested in the outcome of epas ongoing implementation and review of the existing pm naaqs process for setting national ambi ent air quality standards10 the first step in regulating criteria pollu tants is the issuance of what is known as criteria document this document must accurately reflect the latest scientific knowledge useful in indicating the kind and extent of all identif iable effects on public health or welfare which may be expected from the presence of such pollutant in the ambient air 42 usc 7408a2 incl uded in this document is information on variable factors that change public health effects other types of pollutants that may interact with the criteria pollutants to dversely affect public health and known or anticipated adverse effects on we lfare 42 usc 7408a2ac subsequent to the preparation of the criteria document epa has inserted an administrative step into the process know n as the staff paper the staff paper compiled by epa technical staff provides the administrator with report that describes the policy implications of the criteria document and provides recommendations based on these implications emphasis is placed on identifying those conclusions and uncertainties in the available scientific literature that the staff believes should be considered in selecting particulate pollutant indicators forms averaging times and levels for the pr imary health and secondary welfare standards epa particulate matter staff paper 1996 p i1 both the staff paper and the criteria document are reviewed by the clean air scientific advisory committee casac this committee mandated under section 109d2of the caa consists of seve n outside experts who recommend revisions to the documents and comment on the desirability of new standards as appropriatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31531crs5 11 the use of public welfare in the caa incl udes but is not limited to effects on soils water crops vegetation manmade materials animals wildlife weather visibility and climate damage to and deterioration of prope rty and hazards to transportation as well as effects on economic values and on personal comfort and wellbeing whether caused by transformation conversion or combination with other air pollutants 42 usc 7602hthe casac creates panel to review each naaqs each panel consists of the members of the casac plus consultant members to assure full coverage of the expertise needed to assess fully th issues involved the panel recommends improvements and eventually after further meetings that are open to the public and reviews signs off only when they are convinced that each of the two documents accurately reflects the status of the scie nce the casac closure letter represents panel members agreement that the criteria document and the staff paper provide an adequate scientific basis fo r regulatory decision making with the release of the criteria document and the staff paper epa is to issue proposed standards to control the criteri pollutant these standards are known as primary and secondary national ambien t air quality standards naaqs primary naaqs are set at level requisite to pr otect the public health with an adequate margin of safety 42 usc 7409b1 secondary naaqs are set at level requisite to protect the public welfare 42 usc 7409b211 secondary standards are implemented in the same manner as primary naaqs with the key difference that there is federally enfo rceable specified deadline for attainment after epa promulgates nationwide standa rd for criteria pollutant the agency is to designate geographical areas as in attainment or nona ttainment with the standards through federal statestribes cooperative process areas are to be identified as nonattainment when they vi olate or contribute to the violation of national ambient air quality standards naaqs or attain mentunclassified when they meet the standard or the data are insufficient for making determination of compliance with the naaqs nonattain ment designation begins process in which states and tribes must devel op and adopt emissi on control programs sufficient to bring air quality into compliance by an epadefined deadline statutory for the primary standards following designation of an area as nonattainment the state where the area is located must develop state implementation plan sip that demonstrates how attainment with the naaqs w ill be achieved and submit it to the epa within three years of designation section 110 of th caa these plans must include among other items emissions limitations monitoring provisions and enforcement programs designed to achieve compliance with the standard generally within 10year period thus under the statute epa sets only the nationwide standard for criteria pollutants the states are responsible for placing limits on emissions that contribute to criteria pollution and for regulating entities emitting criteria pollutants if states fail to develop an adequate implementation plan epa can impose one reviews and updates of the cr iteria document are to take place at least every five years and standards may be modified on th basis of new information identified and evaluated during the update of the criteria documenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31531crs6 12 according to epa the annual geometri c mean was replaced because it was greatly influenced by days of relatively clean air nd deemphasized the effects of shortterm peak concentrations epa indicated that the annual arithmetic mean did better job of addressing these problems see 52 federal register 24640 july 1 1987 13 epa was under court order entered in american lung association v browner civ93 643tucacm d ariz october 6 1994 to pub lish the final pm standards by july 19 1997history of particulate matter standards epa set the first particulate matter st andards in 1971 the first standards were based on total suspended pa rticulate matter tsp monitors for tsp detected particles up to 45 micrometers m in diameter there were two forms to the primary standards 24hour daily averag and annual geometric mean the primary standards were set at 24hour average not to exceed 260 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter of air gm3 more than once per year and an annual geometric mean of 75 gm3 the secondary standards were set only in the 24hour form at 150 gm3 not to be exceeded more than once per year epa began revising the criteria doc ument for the pm naaqs in 1979 three draft criteria documents were prepared comments were receive d and several public meetings were held in 1984 epa issued its final criteria document and proposed changes to the 1971 standards these ch anges were finalized in 1987 because research indicated that health effects were associated with smaller particles the indicator for particulate matter was changed from tsp to particles with diameter of 10 m or less in 1987 these partic are generally denoted pm10 the form of the annual standard was chan ged from annual ge ometric mean to annual arithmetic mean12 primary naaqs for pm10 were set at 24hour average of 150 gm3 with more than one expected exceedance aver aged over three years and an annual arithmetic mean of 50 gm3 averaged over three years secondary naaqs were set at levels identical to primary naaqs epas announcement of the ne xt round of revi sions to the particulate matter criteria document came in 1994 after drafts of both the criteria document and staff paper were provided for pub lic comment epa issued proposed changes to the 1987 standards in november 1996 during the comment period for the proposed changes epa held four public hearings at locati ons across the nation in addition to two satellite broadcasts epa also developed tollfree national ho tline and an email address to facilita participation by in terested persons epa notes that it received more than 14000 calls and 4000 emails in response to the proposed changes with total of over 50000 comments final naaqs from this second round of revisions were issued july 18 1997 as per court order13 in these new standards epa added the indicator pm25 because of new data showing signif icant public health effects from fine particles this indicator regulates particles with diameter less than 25 m also known as fine particles epa retained the pm10 indicator to regulate coarse particles httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31531crs7 the form of the 24hour standards was also changed in 1997 the previous form was known as the oneexpectedexceed ance form monitoring stations could exceed the 24hour pm naaqs only once averaged over three years with the 1997 final rule epa changed to concentrationbased percentile form this percentile form indicates the percent of the time th at monitoring station can exceed the standard for instance 99th percentile 24hour standard indicates that monitoring station can exceed the standard 1 of th time or 365 days year if monitoring occurs every day the form of the annua l standard remained the same in the 1997 revisions finally epa revised the levels of the pm naaqs the new pm25 indicator was set at 65 gm3 based on threeyear average of the 98th percentile of 24hour pm25 concentrations and at 15 gm3 for the annual arithmetic mean averaged over three years the levels of pm10 remained the same however the form of the pm10 24hour standard was changed to be ba sed on threeyear average of the 99th percentile of 24hour pm10 concentrations by changing the form to concentration based percentile epa allowed more exceed ances than were previously permitted under the 1987 standard thus lthough the level of the pm10 standards was not changed the change in form had the effect of weakening the pm10 standard by allowing more exceedances nonetheless the new pm25 standards would require additional controls seconda ry standards were set qual to these new primary naaqs the changes to the pm naaqs are summarized in table 1 table 1 changes to particulate matter national ambient air quality

including volatile organic compounds vocs nitrogen oxides x are considered pm25 as well as ozone precursors thus the emitters of x such as various industrial processes motor vehicles and other fuel combustion sources will be subject to controls for purposes of meeting two di fferent naaqs in addition many of the areas designated nonattainment with resp ect to the 8hour ozone standards are expected to overlap with those designat ed nonattainment for the pm naaqs in its pm25 guidance for geographical area design ation epa recommended states consider using the same boundaries fo r nonattainment for both pm25 and 8hour ozone implementation of the 8hour ozone sta ndard which currently precedes the pm naaqs implementation as well as challenges or other lays will likely impact the implementation and pot entially the review of the pm naaqs following their joint promulgation in 1997 both the ozone and th pm naaqs were the subject of many of the same challenges and litigation including supr eme court decision in 2001 see discussion later in this report on april 15 2004 epa designated areas in 32 states and the district of columbia 474 counties in ll as nonattainment areas

interprete d 108 and 109 of the caa arbitrarily and capriciously chose pm10 as the coarse particle indicator must consider costs in setting naaqs must consider the financial impact of complying with the naaqs on the abandoned mine reclamation fund must treat pm25 as new pollutant and develop separate criteria document must identify biological mechanism through which particulatematter causes

delegation of legislative power however rather than hold these sections of the caa unconstitutional the court of appeals decided to give the agency an opportunity to extract determinate standard on its own18 in its decision the court of appeals pres ented some options for the intelligible principle epa might use to develop constitutional interpretation of the act as to the second claim the court of appeals agreed that epas use of pm10 as the coarse particle indicator was arbitrary and capricious pm10 includes all particles smaller than 10 m because epa had also chosen pm25 as an indicator of fine particulate matter the choice of pm10 constituted double regulation of pm25 and an underregulation of pm1025 that is particles between 25 and 10 m in diameter19 the court of appeals vacated the pm10 standard and directed epa to select differe nt indicator the challenge to the science behind the pm naaqs the claim that epa had to identify biological mechanism was unsuccessful before this court the petitioners had argued that epa had to prove that particulate matter caused health effects before issuing standards and that there was scientific basis to regulate coarse particulate matter although the court of appeal s found that epas retention of pm10 as an indicator was arbitrary and capricious the court found ample support for epas decision to regulate coarse particulate pollution above the 1987 levels20 the court of appeals decision was 21 w ith the dissenter arguing that sections 108 and 109 did not effect an uncons titutional delegation of legislative power and therefore did not violate the nondelegation doctrine21 for invoking the nondelegation doctrine the decision was variously seen as giving warning to overzealous regulators22 lobbing constitutional time bomb that

completed its work the research was peerreviewed by separate independent team of eight experts hei completed its reana lysis of the two studies in 2000 the reanalysis was divided into two sections first the researchers attempted to replicate the results of the original st udies then researchers used different models and variables to determine the sensitivity of the results that is whether results would change when subjected to different approaches in th first part of the project researchers were able to replicate the results of the two studies using the original data and the same thods

conclusions of their report remain unc hanged namely overall this study provides strong evidence of association between pm10 levels and exacerbation of chronic heart and lung disease sufficiently severe to warrant hospitalization the association cannot be explained by confounding the presence of other pollutants that is ddressed in both stages of the analysis although there is always the

revisions to the 1997 pm naaqs the first suits challenging the ozone and 1997 pm naaqs were filed in the dc circuit court of appeals on july 18 1997 the day the final rules appeared in the federal

standards as well as modifications as result of the current review the 1997 standards have been attacked both as overly stringent and as inadequately protective of health as ig noring costs and as giving costs too much deference as going beyond what is scien tifically conclusive and as failing to behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31531crs26 78 see crs report 978 air quality epas new ozone and

general interpreta tion of the criteria supporting naaqs has been the subject of various cha llenges some have argued and continue to argue that the science does not enable the agency to establish clear threshold and if there is threshold then there cannot be margin of safety as required by the caa as result the whole naaqs process of necessity becomes risk management decision that is one in which the epa administrator balances risks with costs to decide where to set the standard others argue that the lack of threshold justifies the tightest possible standards another continuing debate comes from the view that only in adding margin of safety does the administrator layer policy judgment onto an objective scientifically determined naaqs some ar gue that this judgme ntal aspect means that the margin of safety phrase implicitly endorses the consid eration of costs in setting naaqs as discussed later the lead industry sued epa over lead standards on the basis that the margin of safety required epa to take costs into account in setting naaqs but the court ruled that the statute and its legislative history are against that interpretation lead industries association v

interpretation of the same data in addition the us was among the first to establish standards for particulate matter several other countries are only now considering comparable pm25 standards the lag in establishing partic ulate matter standards by other countries may be part of the reason for the comparable stringency in the pm10 standards other countries that established these standards later than the us had the advantage of expanded information as noted in the study an important consideration with regard to this type of comparison is the implementation and adequacy of enforcement regulations for actually achieving improved air quality according to the study although it varies from country to country epas implementation and enforcement appears to be more successful than most other countries the level at which other countries are setting their particul ate matter standards might be indicative of an emerging international agreement regarding the scientific knowledge about particulate matter health ffects however it is not clear if the comparison of the us particulate matter standards to those of other countries will be factor as epa continues the simulta neous review and imp lementation of the current pm naaqshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31531crs32 conclusions particulate matter standard s have been source of significant controversy epas promulgation of standards for both co arse and fine par ticulate matter in 1997 prompted critics to charge epa with overregulation and spu rred environmental groups to claim that epa had not gone far enough not only was the science behind the pm naaqs challenged but epa was so accused of uncons titutional behavior however epas decision to issue these st andards was upheld for the most part and the science behind the standards was ge nerally vindicated by an hei review epa is proceeding with its review of new information to determine whether further revision of the pm naaqs is necessary congresss provision of significantly more funding for particulate matter research has resulted in an increased number of ongoing studies to determine particulate matter health effects recent scientific findings in the n mmaps and other related resear ch have prompted further concern about the health effects of pa rticulate matter however number of stakeholders still contend that the scie ntific does not ade quately support the pm naaqs as epa evaluates the need to revise current pm naaqs stakeholder interest remains high pm25 standards are expected to affect numerous areas including some that have not previously been design ated nonattainment for naaqs this has raised concerns regarding the potential impacts and triggered numerous questions regarding the specifics of the implementation process epa projects that federal measures such as recent auto and truc k emission standards and controls on power plants will be sufficient to demonstrate attainment in large portion of monitored nonattainment counties by 2015 and help alleviat the development and implementation of local measures some members of congress and others have questioned the agencys predictions regarding the relative magnitude of the emission reductions associated with existin g and proposed air quality controls if epa decides to tighten the pm naaqs again based on the results of its review more areas could be classified as nonattainment and need to implement new controls on particulate matter this woul d require states and local governments to develop and implement new plans for addressing emissi ons in those areas that do not meet any new standards stricter st andard may mean more costs for these transportation and large industries includi ng utilities refineries and the trucking industry impacted by particul ate matter controls in terms of public health stricter standard may mean fewer health effects for the general popula tion and particularly sensitive populations such as children asthma tics and the elderly because both the health and economic conseque nces of particulate matter standards are so potentially significant the pm naaqs are likely to re main prominent issue of interest to many including members of congress actions following the release of the 8 hour ozone designati ons will likely affect certain decisions and the schedule regarding pm25 in addition calif ornia and several countries have established pa rticulate matter standards th at are more stringent than the current us standards whether thes actions can be considered indicative of what epa will decide to do in its curre nt review of the pm naaqs is unclearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31531crs33 the agencys previous review and tablishment of pm naaqs was the subject of litigation and challenges including supreme court decision in 2001 it would not be surprising if interest ed parties return to the cour ts or initiate challenges under the 2000 data quality act in the months ah ead as the agency continues its review and implementation of the pm naaqs thus the final form of the current efforts to implement the pm25 standards and epas response to the current review of pm naaqs and the science information may not be known for some time it could be some time before the final form of th pm naaqs resulting from the current epa review is known likewise the epas current pm25 implementation efforts could also potentially be delayed
