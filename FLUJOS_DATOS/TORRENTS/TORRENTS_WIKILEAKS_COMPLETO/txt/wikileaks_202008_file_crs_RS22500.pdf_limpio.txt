analysis of this issue see crs report rl33863 unauthorized alien students issues and dream act legislation by andorra bruno as noted above federal law currently discourages states and localities from granting unauthorized aliens certain hi gher education benefits sp ecifically section 505 of the illegal immigration refo rm and immigrant res ponsibility act iirir mandates that unauthorized aliens shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within state or political subdivision for any postsecondary edu cation benefit unless citizen or national of the united states is eligible for such benefit in less an amount duration and scope without regard to whether the c itizen or national is such resident1 although there is neither report language nor agency regulations available to provide guidance this provision appears to be designed to prevent states from offering illegal aliens instate tuition at public institutions of higher ducation while section 505 does not explicitly prohibit states from doing so the provision could potentially impose costly penalty on those who do by requiring them to make cheaper instate tuition rates available to nonresidents since the enactment of secti on 505 there has been debate about whetherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22500crs2 2 457 us 202 1982 3 us const amend xiv 4 plyler v doe 457 us at 22731 1982 5 id at 221states and localities may offer instate tuition to unauthorized alien students on some basis other than residency in orde r to avoid violating the law this report provides legal overview of cases involving immigrant access to higher education as well as an analysis of the legality of state laws that make instate tuition rates available to illegal immigrants legal overview the supreme court has on several occasi ons confronted questions regarding access to education for individuals who are neither citizens or legal immigrants but these cases do not directly address whether the govern ment can restrict the access of unauthorized student aliens to instate tuition or to higher education more broadl nevertheless these cases are instructive for purpos of evaluating the legal issues involved in unauthorized student alien eligibility for higher education admission andor instate tuition rates although the supreme court has not direc tly addressed the issue of unauthorized immigrant access to higher education the cour t has considered the issue of unauthorized immigrant access to elementary and s econdary education indeed in the 1982 plyler v doe case the court held that texas stat ute that would have prohibited unauthorized student aliens from receiving free public ementary and secondary education violated the constitution2 in reaching this ruling the court determined that unauthorized immigrants are entitled to protection under the qual protection clause of the fourteenth amendment which provides that state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws3 because the court ruled that unauthorized immigrants are not suspect class and education is not fundamental right both findings would have triggered more intense judicial scrutiny of the texas statute the court evaluated the texas statute under variant of the less stringent rati onal basis standard of review requiring that the statute further substantial state goal the plyler court however ruled that the states interests in enacting the statute namely to conserve the states educational resources to prevent an influx of illegal immigrants and to maintain highquality public education were not legitimately furthere d by the legislation as result the court struck down the texas statute4 although the plyler decision did not explicitly creat an entitlement for unauthorized student aliens to atte nd public elementary and secondary schools the case has in practice had the effect of establishing such access to public education in part because the decision appears to preclude states from justifying legislation similar to the texas statute that was struck down the logic of the plyler case however does not necessarily extend to unauthorized immigrant access to higher education because plyler heavily emphasized the importance of basic elementary and secondary education state could readily distinguish legislation rest ricting unauthorized immigrant access to higher education on the grounds that higher education unlike ementary and secondary education is not essential to maintaining th fabric of our society5 although the supreme court has not ruled on this question the distinction between higher education and elementary and publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22500crs3 6 458 us 1 1982 7 us const art vi cl 2 8 toll v moreno 458 us at 1213 citing decanas v bica 424 us 351

aliens to higher education meanwhile in toll v moreno 6 the court considered challenge to maryland state policy to deny instate status to nonimmigra nt aliens holding g4 visas even if such aliens were state residents who would have otherwise qualif ied for instate tuition rates at state colleges and universities ultimately the court held that the state policy was invalid under the supremacy clause of the constitution which provides that the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land and state laws to the contrary are preempted by federal law7 since immigration regulation is an exclusive power of the federal government state regulation not congressionally sanctioned that discriminates against aliens lawfully admitte d to the country is impermissible if it imposes additional burdens not contemplated by congress8 because federal law allowed g4 aliens to establish residency in the us the c ourt found that the maryland policy to deny residency status for purposes of qualifying for instate tuition rates conflicted with federal law and therefore violated the supremacy clause it is important to note that toll v moreno involved aliens who we re lawfully present in the us and thus may not extend to prot ect unauthorized student aliens who are denied state educational benefits such as admission to state colleges and universities or eligibility for instate tuition rates indeed as long as state policy to deny ch educational benefits to unauthorized student aliens is not found to conflict with federal immigra tion standards it is likely to be upheld by the courts as demonstrated in the equal access education v merten case described below thus far it appears that onl one federal court has addressed the stion of whether it is constitutionally permissible for st ate to prohibit unauthorized immigrants from attending state colleges and universities let alone from r eceiving instate tuition in equal access education v merten the plaintiffs claimed that several virginia public institutions of higher education had viol ated the supremacy commerce and due process clauses of the constitution by denying admission to unauthorized student aliens9 the institutions adopted this policy in response to 2002 memorandum from the virginia attorney general that asserted that unauthorized aliens should not be admitted to virginias public colleges and universities although the cour t dismissed the commerce clause and due process clause claims10 it did allow the supremacy clause claim to proceed at least in part since immigration regulation is an exclusive power of the federal government the court ruled that the supremacy clause would not be violated unless the plaintiffs could show that the virginia institutions were using state not federal immigration standards in order to deny admission to unauthorized aliens11 although the court ultimately dismissedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22500crs4 12 equal access educ v merten 325 f supp 2d 655 d va 2004 13 for

equal ccess education case indicates that unauthoriz ed student aliens might have difficulty in establishing constitutional viola tions on the part of public institutions that deny either admission or instate tuition to unauthorized immigrants legal analysis of state laws that make instate tuition available to illegal immigrants other federal litigation rega rding unauthorized student aliens has revolved around the separate question of whether state laws that make unauthorized aliens eligible for in state tuition violate section 505 of the iiriras prohibition against conferring educational benefits on the basis of state re sidency indeed severa l states have enacted laws with respect to providing instate tuition rates for unauthor ized alien students13 for example california enacted law in 2001 that makes unauthoriz ed aliens eligible for in state tuition rates at certain state community colleges and universities but the state statute bases eligibility on criteria that do not explicitly include state residency to qualify for in state rates student must ve attended high school in california for at least three years and graduated from high school in addition unauthorized lien students are required to file an affidavit stating that they have either filed an application to legalize status or will file such an application as soon as they become eligible14 california officials argue that by using eligibility criteria other than state residency their law does not violate the section 505 restriction on confe rring educational benefits on the basis of state residency in what appeared to be the first deci sion of its kind fede ral court in kansas considered whether state laws that make unauthorized immigrants eligible for instate tuition violate section 505 of iirira the case day v sebelius 15 involved challenge to the legality of kansas state law that makes unauthorized aliens eligible for instate tuition if they attended kansas high sc hool for three years received high sc hool diploma or equivalent from kansas school we re not resident of another state and signed an agreement to seek legal immigration status16 specifically the suit which was filed by nonresident student s or parents who support them who attended kansas state institutions but paid outofstate tuition allege d that the kansas law violated among other things section 505 of the iirira and the qual protection clause of the constitution the court ultimately dismissed six of the seven claims that were asserted in the case including the equal protection claim on the gr ounds that the plaintiffs lacked the standing to bring suit standing requi rements which are concerned with who is proper party to raise particular issue in the federal courts are derived from article iii

2008controversies17 the caseorcontroversy requireme nt has long been construed to restrict article iii courts to the adjudication of real live disputes i nvolving plaintiffs who have personal stake in the outcome of the controversy18 under the supreme courts jurisprudence plaintiffs appearing before an article iii court must show three things in order to meet constitutional standing requirements 1 heshe has suffered an injury in fact that is concrete and particularized not common to the entire public and actual or imminent 2 the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and 3 it is likely that the injury will be redressed by favorable decision19 according to the day v sebelius court the plaintiffs failed to establish standing with respect to most of their claims because the plaintiffs could not demonstrate that they were injured in fact by the kansas statute whic h did not actually apply to the plaintiffs who had paid outofstate tuition rates both before and after enactment of the statute20 furthermore the court noted that even if the plaintiffs had been found to have suffered an injury in fact they had still failed to demonstrate that favorable court decision with respect to most of their claims would have re dressed that injury for example if the court had found that the kansas stat ute violated the equal protec tion clause of the constitution the plaintiffs would not receive any benefit because the invalidation of the kansas legislation would not change the fact that the plaintiffs would still be required to pay out ofstate tuition rates21 although the court rejected six of seven claims on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing the court found that the plain tiffs did have standing to sue with regard to their claim that the kansas statute violated section 505 of iirira the court however dismissed this claim because it f ound that the plaintiffs did not have private right of action which is right that authorizes an i ndividual to sue in court in the statutory context administrative agencies rather than individuals are typically the only party that is authorized to bring lawsuit against entities that violate the law unless the statute expressly or impliedly grants private right of action to individuals to sue to enforce the statute because the day v sebelius court found that iirira neither explicitly nor implicitly gives individuals remedy to enforce immigration laws22 the plaintiffs did not have private right of action and the court dismissed their section 505 claim the district courts dismissal of the claim was ffirmed by federal appeals court23 and the supreme court recently declined to consider an appeal24 lawsuits that challenge state laws that grant instate tuition to unauthorized student aliens may be brought in other states for example california appeals court recentlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22500crs6 25 martinez v regents of univ of califor nia 2008 cal app

dismissal of the suit25 although this decision appears to be the fi rst in which court has found that state tuition statute violates section 505 of iirira litigation in the case is not yet over and plaintiffs in similar lawsuits nevertheless remain likely to face difficulties similar to those of the kansas plaintiffs in tablishing standing or privat right of action to sue given these difficulties individual plaintiffs must overcome significant procedural hurdles in order to successfully challenge such state laws in recognition of this problem legal dvocacy group filed seve ral complaints with the department of homeland security dhs in 2005 in these complaints the group argued that certain state tuition laws viol ate section 505 of iirira and called on dhs to enforce the statute against states that offer instate tuition rates to unauthorized student aliens since it appears that individuals cannot26 thus far dhs does not appear to have responded to these complaints if however the agency were to interpret the states actions to be violation of section 505 its options could include withholdi ng federal funds from the states in question or issuing an order that directs the states to comply with the law such action by dhs if forthcoming could result in legal challenges by the affected states if that were to occur then it would be up to the federal courts to determine whether state programs that authorize instate tuition for unauthorized alien students are violation of federal law in considering such question court woul d likely begin by examining the statutory language at issue the supreme court often r ecites the plain meaning rule that if the language of the statute is clear there is need to look outside the statute to its legislative history in order to ascertain the statutes meaning27 and more often than not statutory text is the ending point as well as the starting poi nt for interpretation on its face the plain meaning of section 505 appears clear unless identical rates are offered to outofstate residents unauthorized aliens are not eligible for instate tuition rates on the basis of residence within state thus the statutory language implies that instate tuition eligibility may be based on factors other than residency including factors that are currently the basis for eligibility under many st ate statutes under th is reasoning court might determine that state programs that authorize instate tuition for unauthorized aliens are legal as long as eligibility for those programs is based on factors other than residency opponents of this interpretati on however are likely to argue that certain state eligibility factors such as high school attendance within the state essentially serve as proxy for state residency in violation of the cong ressional intent reflected in section 505
