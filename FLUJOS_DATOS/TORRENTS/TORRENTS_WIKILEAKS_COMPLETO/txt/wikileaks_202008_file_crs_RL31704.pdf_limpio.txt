trade research credit rural development and other related programs it makes significant changes to commodity conservation and nutrition progra ms and is intended to guide most federal farm and food policies through fy2007 the congressional b udget office cbo estimates using the march 2002 baseline place the tota l cost of the new bill ie baseline plus new funding at just under 274 billion over its sixyear lifesp an the total reflects an increase of 516 billion in federal spending 376 billion of which is projected to be used to increase farm commodity program spending of the 274 billion in total 6year budget au thority for programs under the new law it is estimated that some 99 billion will go fo r direct subsidies to about 600000 farmers just under 150 billion will support the cost of food stamps and commodity assistance for some 17 million lowincome americans the rema ining 25 billion is expected to be spent on conservation 21 billion tr ade 21 billion rural development 1 billion and research forestry and ener gy 25 billion programs the new farm bill has been hailed by supporte rs as corrective to previous policy that was criticized for not providing safety net for farmers and that prompted some 35 billion in ad hoc emergency farm spending laws between fiscal years 1999 and 2002 critics of the new farm law expresse d concern about its cost and its resurrection of old policy mechanisms that they contend encourage overproduction that will further depress farm prices there also is concern that the generous farm subsidies in the new law conflict with us trade agreements andor impede us effo rts to get other countries to cut their farm subsidies the house approved its original farm b ill hr 2646 the farm security act of 2001 on october 5 2001 the senate vers ion of this legislation t he agriculture conservation and rural enhancement act or acre wa s approved on february 13 2002 and was nearly three times the size of the house bill desp ite this the commodity policy changes in both bills reflected similar policy direction both chambers bills maintained marketing loan assistance and fixed decoupled annual farm pa yments although at different levels they both also added target prices and countercyclical income s upport or deficiency payments for major field crops conservation and nutriti on programs were enhanced by both bills although more so in the senate bill ot her differences between the house and senate included the pace of new spending the am ount of new funding for commodity programs versus other usda activities eg conservation food assistance etc how much to fund each of the commodity support programs and th federal caps on farm payments the final law adopted the more evenly paced annual spe nding of the house bill spent most 73 new money on farm commodity programs split the di fferences over funding for each of the three major commodity programs and set new farm payment caps that lowered base limits but maintained rules

consideration of new farm policy began in 2001 more than year before the major provisions of the 1996 farm bill were due to expire the early timing was driven in large measure by the persistence of low prices for many major field commodities and the desire to address farm income problems through changes to underlying farm policy rather than by annual multibillion dollar farm aid packages like those enacted between 1998 and 2001 the economic environment in 2001 was quite different from that existing in 199596 when the previous farm bill was considered in 1995 world commodity supplies were low demand was growing and prices for most program commodities were at near record highs this favorable economic climate along with growing pressure to bring federal spending under control changed party control of the congress and trade agreements to cut back domestic farm support made the time propitious for major policy changes by 1998 however prices for many major commodities had begun to fall as previous growth markets overseas suffered financial crisis and supp lies overtook demand when th house and senate began examining new farm policy options early in 2001 this followed three years of stagnant commodity prices and emergency farm aid packages totaling over 33 billion the economic environment made it easier for the congress to approve congressional budget resolution that cont ained allowances for some 735 billion in new farm bill spending subsequently how ever the rosy budget scenario changed mild recession declining revenues and the mounting costs of the us war against terrorism precipitated by the ev ents of september 11 2001 have combined to deplete the budget surplus some pointed to pending deficits as reason to rethink the wisdom of substantial increases in fa rm spending others mostly farm groups and their legislators pushed for quick farm bill action fearing the loss of the allowed increases still others worried about the implications of not passing legislation in time for farmers spring planting deci sions and about the potentially costly consequences of legislating in an election year different party control of each chamber of congress new administration reluctant to push for an early farm bill and other national events delayed completion of the new farm bill until may 2002 1996 farm law when the previous farm bill was being formulated in 1995 and 1996 the farm economy was enjoying boom prices fo r most commodities were at record highs as was farm income moreover foreign demand for us agricultural goods was expanding particularly in asia nd latin america at that time legislators in the congress were also facing constraints because of severe budget deficits and trade initiatives that added pressure for changes to farm policy that would better control farm program spending and adapt us policies to trade agreements the federal agricultural improvement and reform fair act of 1996 or 1996 farm bill pl 104127 was enacted in april 1996 this followed nearly two years of deliberations and the extension for one year of previous law provisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31704crs3 2 the transition in 1994 from democratic to republican control of the house and senate and new congressional agenda and leaders delayed completion of new farm in 1995 the congress extended the expiring provisions of the 1990 law pl 104624 for an additional year until another farm law could be enacted in 1996 many of the key policy changes made by the 1996 law were authorized through 2002 3 payment levels were decoupled from target prices and production which in the past were used to make payments to farmers when market prices fell below specified targetsbeyond their original 1995 expiration date2 the agricultural market transition act amta title i of the fair act contained commodity program provisions that capped federal spending nded land setasides and target prices for most commodities and created new farm income support system replacing target price supports wheat feedgrain cotton and rice farmers choosing to participate in this new program were to receive fixed gradua lly declining decoupled annual payments socalled production flexib ility contract pfc paym ents sometimes called amta payments3 these were provided each year in lump sums irrespective of market prices or farmers planting decisions th expectation was that over time the amount of amta payments would decline and end completely af ter 2002 by which time farmers would have adjusted to free market and would receive payments only under the capped marketing loan assistance program opponents of this gradual phaseout of fede ral assistance worried about what would happen if prices and markets declined as began to happen in late 1997 and early 1998 proponents pointed out that farmers getting pfcamta payments in good economic times would be able to put th em away for rainy day to soften the impact of losses during low price periods th is point also was made in response to those who objected to giving farmers paymen ts when prices were high as they were in 1996 and economic conditi ons were good moreover bill promoters pointed out that there was still countercyclical income relief in the form of the marketing loan assistance program although it was capped when the 1996 farm bill was enacted pr ices for most major commodities were at record highs demand was high and grow ing and commodity supplies were tight by 1998 however conditions in the farm economy had deterior ated demand for many major commodities began to decline as financial crisis hit asia and latin america two of the fastest growth markets for us goods moreover several years of good worldwide growing conditions had increased supplies and the value of the american dollar was high relative to other countries making us goods expensive compared to competitors farm income began to decline and the congress stepped in the concept of selfsuffi ciency and independence from federal farm programs eroded as the congress appr oved and the president signed seven emergency farm aid bills in 1999 2000 nd 2001 these adhoc emergency spending measures provided some 33 billi on to agriculture primarily to wheat feedgrain oilseed cotton and rice farmers this assistance helped to stabilize farm income for those receiving payments primarily wheat feedgrain cotton and rice farmers it also helped to keep average farm family income higher than the national average for all us households httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31704crs4 4 food and agriculture policy taki ng stock for the new century the 107th congress as the proportion of net farm income drawn from federal subsidies grew many in congre ss and elsewhere began to push for longer term changes to underlying farm policy that would offer more certainty to farmers than does reliance on ad hoc annual financ ial aid packages thus shortly after coming into session in 2001 the 107th congress began to examine agriculture policy and solicit proposals from the various producer groups hearings were held by the house and senate and testimony was presented both in washington dc and in field hearings throughout much of 2001 the h ouse passed bill hr 2646 in october 2001 the senate began debate on its farm bill s 1731 in early december but was unable to reach agreement before the adjournment of the first session on december 19 2001 much revised senate bill wa s passed on february 13 2002 house and senate conferees agreed to compromise bill renamed the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 in april the house approved the conference agreement on may 2 the senate appr oved it on may 8 2002 the president signed the measure on may 13 2002 pl 107171 administration views like its predecessor the bush administration did not put forward new farm bill in its first year 2001 the bush administration took the position that congress s hould give careful considera tion to major farm policy changes before rushing through new legisla tion in other words it contended that new farm bill could wait until 2002 on september 19 2001 as the house agriculture committee prepared to mark up its farm bill the administration issued report that laid out set of principles for farm policy4 these principles focused on 1 the wide differences among farms and farming practices and the need for better tailored policy to reflect these differences 2 the tilt in existing policy toward highly efficient commercial farms with direct relationship between federal benefits and farms financial need and 3 the need to rely on market rather than government forces over the long term with short term aid for unexpected events beyond farmers control in early october 2001 as the house bega n floor debate on its farm bill the office of management and budget omb issued statement of administration policy sap that opposed this legisla tion it contended that the house bill encouraged overproduction of commodities di d not target benefits to farmers most in need jeopardized global markets and increased federal spending at time of economic uncertainty the administration also objected to the senate agriculture committee farm bill s 1731 reported in late november re newing its concerns about stimulating overproduction and poor ta rgeting of farm payments it also expressed concern about the bills potential to undermine us effort s to phase out foreign countries export subsidies and us ability to meet current trade obligations finally the administration took the position that the natereported bill woul d authorize costly and ineffective conservati on programs weaken accountability in domestic nutrition programs and result in unknown budget costs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31704crs5 in early january 2002 usda officials indi cated that they expected congress and the bush administration to agree on farm bill by early march 2002 omb officials informed congress that the president now supported the 735 billion in additional farm spending over ten year s that was permitted by the fy2002 year congressional budget resolution this appear ed to remove some of the concern that failure to enact new farm bill before th next budget resolution could risk loss of new funding for farm bill programs in late february 2002 following passa ge of the senate farm bill the administration indicated that it preferred the house bills more gradual approach to new spending to the quicker expenditure of funds in the senate amendment administration officials feared the sena approach would exhaust federal farm support in the early years and force substa ntial amounts of new spending in later years they also preferred the lower marketing loan rates of the house bill on the other hand usda officials were concerned about th large proportion of new funding in the house bill for farm commodity programs compared to the senate bill and appeared to favor some of the more expansive nutrition program provisions of the senate bill as time went on some usda officials expressed reservations about senate bill provisions that added marketing loan assistance for pulse crops eg dried beans chick peas lentils and to the bills restriction on meat packer ownership of livestock the administration offered public alternatives to the house and senate proposals but continued to press the c onferees on the importance of us trade negotiating objectives eg getting othe r countries to reduce their domestic commodity supports and the risk of exceeding the 19 billi on limit on trade distorting domestic support that the us agreed to under the wto uruguay round agreement the administration also refused to take public position on the controversial payment limitation issue that was debated at length in the senate by the time congress approved the farm bill in may 2002 the spring planting season was already under way moreover midterm elections were rapidly approaching and several farm statesdistricts were viewed as keys to control of the house and senate thus spite earlier reservations by administration officials president bush signed the ne w farm law on may 132002 saying this bill is generous and will provide safety net for farmers and it will do so without encouraging overproduction and depressi ng prices it will allow farmers and ranchers to plan and operate based on mar ket realities not government dictates house and senate action the house agriculture committee farm bill hr 2646 was introduced on july 26 2001 the committee marked up this bill on july 27 and amended and reported it on august 2 it was sequentia lly referred to the house international relations committee which reported it with amendmen ts on september 10 floor debate on hr 2646 began on october 2 and continued th rough october 5 when the bill was passed by vote of 291120 the b ill was engrossed and sent to the senate on october 9 2001 on november 15 2001 the senate ag riculture nutrition and

began debate on motion to proceed to the consideration of s 1731 fforts to speed up consideration and obtain vote for final passage on this measure pr ior to the end of the first session were

the committeereported bill offered on december 11 it was the pending vehicl at the end of the first session several substitutes to the daschle substitute were offered and tabled ie effectively rejected in the first sessi on the rejected alternatives included an amendment offered by senator lugar samdt 2473 that would have replaced and completely revised the commodity provisions of the daschle substitute and substantially increased spending for nutrition programs7 substitute amendment offered by senators roberts and cochransamdt 2671 that would have m odified the daschle substitute to reflect some of the concerns expressed by the administration discussed previously and substitute amendment sadmt 2678 by senator hutchinsonark offering the housepa ssed farm bill hr 2646 as substitute early in the second session of the 107 th congress debate was renewed over the senate farm bill daschle substitute amendment samdt 2471 on february 13 2002 substantially revised bill was

developmen t research and animal hea lth and welfare provisions one formal and several informal meetings of housesenate conferees 9and staff took place prior to the spring recess re solution of the differences was not reached before congress left for the easter and passover holidays however press accounts reported that at that time there was tentative agreement on the amounts of new funding to add to the major farm b ill titles 46 billion for commodity programs 171 billion for conservation programs 64 billion for nutrition programs 33 billion for remaining titles research rural development forestry farm credit trade etc and 26 billion cushion f und assuming some 19 billion in crop insurance program savings this informal agreement kept total new spending in line with the budget resolution allowance 735 billion according to press reports the amounts reportedly allocated by title were not officially substantiated and whatever agreement was reached at that time was s ubject to subsequent change when the conferees resumed conference delibera tions after the spring recess staff meetings during the recess worked out minor noncontroversial differences between the bills and developed options or alternative proposals that the members might consider to resolve major differences when conference negotiations resumed the conference committee formally reconvened on april 9 2002 and many minor differences were quickly resolved less easy to resolve were differences over how spending was to be allocated among the various titles the marketing loan rates and eligibility requirement the pace of ne w spending limits on farm payments new dairy policy and meat packer concentra tion pressure to complete action came from policy analysts who suggested that new bill would have to be enacted quickly if its policies were to apply to crop year 2002 production ther also was pressure from political analysts closely watching contested elections in key agriculture states they predicted that the outcome of the farm bill debate could determine the outcome of the midterm elections and party control of the house and senate and that the legislation could become more expensive in light of the election year timing10 as time passed without legislation the usda began to be pressured to publish the 2002 loan rates this was resisted by the administration and others who recognized the political unacceptability of the existing law rates nd the likely election year repercussions as well as the possibility that putting out the rates might delay congressional action on new law another pressure point came when multibillion dollar farm aid bill for fy2002 was introduced by senator robert s s 2040 in case new farm bill was not enacted in time for the 2002

federal agriculture improvement and reform fair act of 1996 pl 104127 was amended several times to extend the planned expiration date for the dairy price support program congress also temporarily restored federal aid for the honey wool and mohair programs as part of several emergency funding packages enacted to shore up farm incomein late april after several weeks of negotiations the housesenate conferees reached conference agreement the house approved the conference report 107 424 on this bill on may 2 the senate approved it on may 8 and the president signed it on may 13 pl107171 titled the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 the new law provides for 735 billion in new spending for food and agriculture programs based on 2001 baseline estima tes by cbo 11 using 2002 baseline estimates cbo subse quently projected that budget authority added by the new law would total 828 billion over ten year s bringing overall total spending for these programs to 451 billion over the next ten years more recent program cost estimates based on higher than expected commodity prices suggest that the cost might be lower narrative comparison summary although the house and senate proposed farm bills varied from one another in many respects there were common features to both first although farm commodity support was the main focus of each bill nd generally got the most attention the measures proposed and finally approved c ontained much more than farm commodity provisions other titles ad dressed conservation trade nutrition programs credit rural development research and forestry moreover both bills and the final law restored some provisions struck by earlier law eg federal target prices the wool mohair and honey programs and added new programs eg countercyclical payments and payments fo r dairy and pulse crops12 the two chambers bills also substantially increased funding for farm commodity programs but differed over how much of the increased funding should go fo r each of the payment vehicles ie fixed payments marketing loan assistance or countercyclical income support the housepassed farm bill had 10year life span the senate bill authorized its programs for 5 years the time span in the house bill related to provisions in the fy2002 congressional budget resolution h conres 83 that provided room for some 735 billion in additional spending over the period 20022011 for new farm bill the senate 5year authorization reflected mo re traditional timeframe for multiyear farm bills the conferees agreed to six year farm bill both bills proposed changes that utilized the 735 billion in increased funding allowed by the budget resolution although th senate bill was re estimated to spend 61 billion more than that amount when cbo discovered in early march 2002 that it had made an estimating error in its original calculations the senate measure also used up its 10year funding total more quick ly than did the house and added another 245 billion in farm aid for fy2002 although this cost was not counted because ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31704crs9 13 as noted above the senate approved floor amendment to its farm bill that adds 24 billion in emergency farm assistance waiver to the budget rules requiring offsets of additional spending for emergency reasons was approved by voice vote so that this additional spending is not counted against the senate farm bill for fy2002was designated as emergency spending the conferees agreed to more measured pace of new spending than the senate bill and dropped the additional emergency spending the 735 b illion mark allowed for new spending was met by the conference agreement although subsequent updated cost projections by the cbo now estimate over 82 billion in new costs the house and senate bills also continued trend toward increasing federal support for broader array of conserva tion efforts and expanding payments to farmers who engage in environmentally sensitive farming pr actices although the senate provisions were more generous in this regard 213 billion compared to 157 billion in the house bill the conferees agreed to split the difference increasing conservation funding by 171 billion over ten years the senate bill also provided signif icantly more funding for domestic food programs 93 billion than the house 37 billion with much of the difference related to senate provisions restoring food stamp eligibility to certain legal aliens both bills also made changes to the food stamp program to assist states in conforming program rules to those of other welfare programs and increase commodity donations to domestic food programs the conference agreement adopted the senate proposals regarding gal alien eligibility for food stamps this brought new10year funding increases timated at 64 billion for this program and several commodity distribution programs according to cbo 2001 baseline estimates the senate bill also contained extensive energy ethanol provisions that were not in the house version some of th remained in the final version finally the senate bill was more ge nerous than the house with respect to funding for research and rural development in the end funding increases for both of these categories were reduced to shore up sp ending for farm commodity and food assistance programs some of these and other significant differences between the bills are described in more detail below spending the fy2002 congressional budget resolution hconres 83 adopted in 2001 made room for additiona l agriculture spending of 55 billion for fy2001 735 billion in fy2002 and 6615 billion over the following nine years for food and agriculture programs this provided for total of 735 billion in new budget authority for fy20022011above baseline spending the expectation was that this new money would be used to finance new policies and that most of it would go for farm commodity programs although this was not required fy2001 money was spent for emergency assistance the llowable spending for fy2002 and beyond was intended either for emergency farm assistance or new farm bill13 both the house and senate bills origin ally were estimated by cbo to cost

by the senate as part of an amendment samdt 2839 this designation means that the additional funding does not require offsets in spending elsewhere to conform to budget rules 15 this amount assumes the 389 billion originally estimated by cbo plus the 61 billion cbo has indicated it underestimated for the cost of the commodity provisions in that billcommodity programs as well as nutrition pr ograms trade research conservation and rural development among other things it did not reflect the additional 245 billion in farm emergency assistance for fy 2002 that the senate added to its bill14 it also did not reflect some 61 billion in higher co sts that the cbo later said were left out of earlier senate bill projections of commodity progra m costs because of an error in the original calculations the revised estimates brought new spending in the senate passed bill to total of 796 billion th final conference agreement brought additional 10year spending back to the 735 billion total allowed by the budget resolution based on 2001 base line estimates when cb reestimated baseline spending in march 2002 the total new spe nding provided by the new farm bill rose to 828 billion the additional funding in the new farm bill when added to april 2002 baseline estimates ie spending estima ted without any change in previous law will bring total spending for all of the programs in the farm bill to 2739 billion over the next six years the life of the bill according to cbo estimates this represents an estimated 2222 billion in baseline spendi ng and 517 billion in new spending of the 6year total spending baseline plus increases cbo estimated that the new law will provide 989 billion for commodity support programs 213 billion for conservation 1496 billion for nutrition programs mostly food stamps 21 billion for agricultural trade 1 billion for rural development 760 million for research 405 million for energy related provisions and 85 million for forestry commodity programs under both the house and senate bills well over half of the new spending would have gone for commodity programs 488 billion under the house bill and 46 b illion under the senate bill15 however the bills differed with respect to how much of th is commodity program spending should go for fixed annual contract payments new countercyclical income relief or higher marketing loan assistance ie loan deficiency payments based on 2002 baseline estimates the house bill would have added an estimated 251 billion to commodity progra m budget authority over 5 years and 488 billion over 10 years 77 billion more

and just under 46 billi on over 10 years this does not count the additional 24 billion in fy 2002 emergency farm assistance th senate added since this was designated emergency spending and not s ubject to budget offsetting rules for new spending the final law conference agreement increased spending for commodity programs by total of 256 billion and 478 billion respectively over five and ten years more than the 10year added cost of the senate bill commodity provisions 461 billion and slightly less than th house bill 4797 billion based on new 2002 baseline estimates for the sixyear life span of the new law cbo projected that the government would spend 376 b illion more for commodity programs under the new farm bill this represented 73 of the new funding for all of the titles of the new farm law total spending for farm co mmodity programs ie baseline plus new spending will be 989 billion over 6 years according to cbo estimates and represents 36 of spending for all of the programs in the new farm law the house and senate proposed about the same amount of new funding 127 129 billion for fixed formerly called contr act payments to program farmers ie wheat feedgrain cotton rice and oils eed farmers the conferees agreed to less than was proposed by the house nd senate bills 99 billion for fixed payments the new countercyclical pr ogram proposed in the house bill was projected to cost 372 billion over ten year s the senates c ounterpart was less generous 191 billion the conferees mo re or less split the difference agreeing to new spending of 294 billion for c ountercyclical income support more extensive differences were in each chambe rs marketing loan assistance provisions the senate bill would have added to marketing loan assistance proposing changes that would have increased spending by 187 billion over ten years the house on the other hand proposed to reduce spending for marketing loan payments by some 58 billion over ten years the conferees agreed to an increase of 22 billion in marketing loan assistance over ten years nutrition programs the senate proposed to raise spending for nutrition programs primarily the food stamp program by 93 billion over 10 years compared to an increase of 37 billion for these programs in the house bill the conferees compromised on 10year spendi ng increase of 64 billion for these programs 9 of all new spending in th bill and adopted th senate proposal to restore food stamp eligibility to many legal aliens cut off by the 1996 welfare reform law under the sixyear life span of th is legislation nutrition programs are projected by cbo to cost total of 1496 billi on this in cludes an increase of 28 billion 19 in funding over the 6year period the large funding increases for nutriti on programs in the senate bill were derived in part from savings in commodity program spending due to provision that would have substantially lowered the limit on commodity payments to farmers according to cbo estimates the payment limit reduction in the senate bill would have lowered commodity program spe nding by 695 million over 10 years the payment limit is discussed in more detail later in this report in the selected issues sectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31704crs12 selected conference issues commodity programs program crops both the house and senate bills maintained the system of fixed annual payments to wheat feedgrain cotton and rice farmers that replaced target price supports in 1996 both bills so added soybeans and peanuts to the crops that are eligible for these fixed payments the house bill provided more funding for contract payments than did the senate both bills also maintained marketing loan assistance adding peanuts as well but the house bill set loan rates at or slightly below those set by previous law thus reducing spending for this program by 58 billion over 10 years according to cbo the senate substantially raised these rates adding some 183 billion for marketing loan assistance both b ills added new program of countercyclical in come support which also included peanuts in sum the house approach tended to rely more heavily on fixed annual payments and greater levels of countercyc lical income support than th senate which put more of its new funding into substantially raisin g marketing loan assistance in overall spending for commodity programs the c onferees agreed to spend just under 48 billion over ten years coming closer to the house mark 487 billion than the senate 46 billion the conference agr eement approved 10year funding increases among the three commodity programs as follows 99 billion in fixed payments less than both house and senate bills 294 billion for countercyclical income support versus 37 billion in the house bill and 19 billion in the senate bill and 17 billion in marketing loan assistance the house billwould have reduced this assistance by 58 billion the senate bill would have added 183 billion in new spending both bills maintained the 1996 policy changes that provide broad planting flexibility to farmers and re move annual cropland setaside tools formerly used to reduce surplus production andor control federal farm spending to protect the interests of fruit and vegetable producers who do not receive federal subsidies and who worried that some of the subsidized crop producers might plant these alternative crops as well as their subsidized program crops both the house and senate bills maintained the planting restriction on most fruits and vegetables by program farmers although some farm groups supported the types of production controls in place before the 1996 law most did not and these were not restored under the new farm law another commodity proposal was tested by senate bill pr ovision that added pulse crops dried peas lentils chickpeas to the mix of commodities eligible for marketing loan assistance proponents conte nded that these crops should receive thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31704crs13 same benefits as other field crops and that this would encourage production and greater rotation of other crops eg wheat and feedgrains objection to this came from some who saw the addition of new crops as moving in the wrong direction that is expanding federal support and market interference in farm policy provisions in both bills added soybean eligibility for fi xed payments and countercyclical income support restored previously discontinue d farm support payments for honey and wool the senate bill also added mohair and added new direct payment programs for peanuts and fluid milk the conferees adopted provisions adding most pulse crops soybeans peanuts honey wool and mohair to the list of commodities eligible for direct farm payments peanuts both bills terminated the peanut poundage quotas and nonrecourse loans and created compensation plan for peanut quota holders set at much lower loan rate and as noted above made peanut producers eligible for marketing loan assistance and fixed and countercyclical payments the end of the quota program despite the generous buyout provisions 220tonyear for five years in the conference agreement drew objections from some in certain peanut producing districts among the concerns expressed were the impact of this on small growers and on those retired farmers andor spous who relied on leasing quota for their income despite these objections the quota buyout in both bills was agreed to by the conferees dairy disagreement about the extension or reauthorization of the expired northeast dairy compact and its possible ex pansion to other regions of the country split along regional lines the house farm bill did not extend the northeast ne dairy compact which expired september 30 2001 efforts to include an extension of this compact in s 1731 threatened to lay or stop deliberations in the senate and compromise proposal was included in the final senate bill this would have replaced the ne dairy compact with ne w countercyclical payment program for dairy farmers in all states with one quarter of the 2 b illion in funding allotted going to northeast states the earmark of funds for the northeast was intended to offset the loss of the higher farm milk prices permitted by the defunct compact in that region the conferees agreed to revised countercyclical paymen t program for dairy farmers without the setaside for nort heast farmers instead of earmarking 500 million of its 2 billion cost for northeast states as in the senate bill the conference agreement will make payments to all dairy farmers whenever the monthly price of fluid farm milk in boston falls below 694 the payments will be available on up to 24 million pounds of annual production thus targeting benefits to small and mid sized operations this compromise was cr afted largely by northeast legislators representing generally small dairy operations it as well as earlier efforts to extend the ne dairy compact was opposed by many from the midwest who regard this as support system that will continue to encourage pricedepr essing overproduction and continue an unwise policy that favor s regions with small producers to the detriment of midwestern nd western producers those favoring countercyclical income assistance contend that it will benefit all farmers by reducing the impact of volatile prices and that it will be available to all dairy farmers not just those in one region some however are concerned about the budget implications of new uncontrollable farm support pr ogram and its implications for us efforts to get european and other trading competitors to reduce their domestic support programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31704crs14 16 from 75000 to 150000 this followed substantial increases in farm spending enacted under several multibillion

of 80000 to this is added the 150000 limit on marketing loan continuedfarm payment limits current law limits on payments to farmers were revised and applied to new programs under both the hous and senate farm bills the senate limitations which were more stringent than those in the house bill were opposed by many farm groups proponents of lowering the payment cap contend that farm programs benefit most in terms of federal dollars those who need aid the least ie larger wealthier farmers wh ile smaller highrisk farmers or those ineligible for direct payments such as fruit vegetable and livestock producers get little or nothing they also charge that the current system encourages the growth of large corporate farms and helps to drive small and midsized farms out of business some also assert that excessive paym ents undermine the credibility of and popular support for farm policy that purports to be designed to help small and midsized farmers opponents of payment limits w hich include nearly all of the farm commodity groups contend that farm po licy should be based on productivity and efficiency and that payment limits discourage both they suggest that basing farm payments on income or need would m ean rewarding many farmers who are inefficient or unwise in their farm mana gement and would discourage farmers from making profitable efficienci moreover they point out that many of the farms receiving large payments also have simila rly large costs of production and might not operate as efficiently or productively if federa l support was not tied in some way to output the farm payment limits first imposed in 1970 generally have been high enough so that they rarely resulted in any cutoff of farm payments moreover mechanisms for getting around the caps have been availabl in the late 1990s however when it appeared that loan deficien cy payments to some farmers might exceed the limits then in place congress doubled the limit on these payments 16 the doubled levels have been operable for the past several years list of farmer payments released by the environmental working group ewg rejuve nated interest in the farm payment limit issue the ewg data show larg proportion of federal farm payments sometimes in very large amounts going to small numbers of large farms and also to some wealthy absentee landlords this st udy was widely reported by the media and reportedly influenced propos als for the more stringent payment limits that were added to the senate farm bill during floor debate17 the house bill raised the current law overall limit on commodity program payments from total of some 460000 per year per farmer to 550000 but did not apply this limit to the value of commodity certificates18 it also provided

230000 or half the payment allowance for maximum of 460000 per farmer see crs report rs 21138 for more information on payment limits 19 the 1996 farm bill set 75000 as payment limit for ldps but this was doubled by subsequent legislation when the cap would have cut some farmers off payments at that level 20 the senate bill does not contain assistance for mohairseparate payment limit for peanuts the senate bill lowered the current law payment limit to 275000 for all crops including pea nuts and other newly covered crops and included the value of marketing certificat under this limit under the house and senate proposals the limits woul d have worked as follows fixed payments and countercyclical payments the house bill set maximum of 50000 per farmer per year for fixed contract payments and 75000 per farmer per year for newly created countercyclical payments for regu lar program crops grains cotton rice oilseeds thus the house bill set the payment cap for both these programs at 125000 separate 75000 limit for counter cyclical payments applied to the new peanut program the senate bill set combined maximum per person payment of 75000 for both fixed payments and countercyc lical payments and applied this limit to all eligible crops including the newly eligible peanuts marketing l oan payments under the house bill marketing loan assistance would have been capped at 150 000 for wheat feedgrains oilseeds cotton and rice and there would have been separate payment limits of 150000 for each of the peanut honey wool and mohair programs19 the senate bill establishes one limit of 150000 in marketing loan benefits for all of the eligible commodities wheat feedgrains ilseeds cotton rice honey wool lentils dry peas and chick peas20 it also applied this limit to the value of

former law three entity rule and spouse allowance these permit spouse to qualify fo r payments and permit additional payments for up to two additional fa rms at half the first farm cap in effect the

lower payment limits were added during senate floor debate under an amendment sadmt 2826 offered by senators dorgan and grassley 22 these figures changed from the previous report represent the most recent cbo revisions of senate bill costs some senate proponents of the payment limit suggest that these savings estimates are understated because the cbo did not fully account for the savings associated with counting the value of marketing loan writeoffs see httpwwwagwebcom april 10 2002wealthy individuals the senate bill contains language that would prohibit those with adjusted gross incomes above 25 m illion annually from receiving any farm payments this provision was intended to counter media and other critics who often point to receipt of farm payments by wealthy public figures eg professional athletes nd movie stars as an illustration of poor farm policies there is comparable provision in the house bill21 the 10year savings from the senate payment limit provision which was used by the senate bill to help fund food st amp program expansion was estimated by the cbo at 784 million 454 million over 5 years22 most analysts predicted that the impact of the senate payment limit would have been the greatest for large rice and cotton farmers whose federal payments ge nerally tend to be larger than those producing other field crops the conferen ce agreement to allow unlimited gains from commodity certificates helped to reach compromise on payment limits the conference agreement included 1 new payment caps that will apply to the 2003 crops not 2002 crops 2 fixed payments that will be capped at 40000 3 countercyclical payments limited to 65000 4 marketing loans capped at 75000 per farmer per year 5 allowance for payments for up to two additional farms and

budgetconscious policymakers watching budget surpluses turn into deficits expressed concern about the cost of the legislation and their doubts were reinforced when the cbo discovered that it had undere stimated the cost of the senatepassed bill by over 6 billion in the end the conference agreement held to the allowed 735 billion although subsequent cbo estimates using march 2002 baselines project that it will cost over 82 billi on more recent estimates of commodity market prices by the usda suggest that commodity program provisions may cost less than originally estimated efforts in the 107th congress seeking to use the savings from the revised program costs to pay for some 6 billion to additional agriculture spending for disaster relie f this was not approved the administration was concerned that the new commodity program spending in both the house and senate farm b ills might exceed the 19 billion cap on spending for marketdistorting domestic farm support that the us agreed to in the uruguay round wto trade agreements to flect this concern both bills contained provisions adopted in conference that requi re the secretary of agriculture to make adjustments if the spending cap is breached some policy analysts question the mechanics of the adjustment provisions and their practical application strong criticism of the new subsidies in the farm bill has come from some of our trading partners particularly the eu and japan who are being pr essured by us negotiators to substantially reduce their domestic s upport programs other criticism has come from less developed countries and their s upporters who contend that the generous farm subsidies in the us as well as the eu and japan are harming economic development and agricultural productivity in those nations conservation programs both the house and senate bills increased spending on conservation programs as did the finallyapproved version major points of difference between the chambers included how much additional funding shoul d be provided for these programs versus farm commodity programs what portion if any of the funding should be mandatory whether new programs or be nefits should be created and how much funding they should receive the senate bill provided significantly more money some 6 billion for conservation programs than the house bill in the house an attempt kind boehlert amendment to add more spe nding for conservation programs by taking away some of the new funding for comm odity programs was unsuccessful the difference in spending between the house and senate bills for conservation programs was difficult issue in the conference committee and was made worse when cbo discovered that it had underes timated the overall cost of th senate bill by some 6 billion the

the livestock sector livestock packers amendment offe red by senator tim johnson and others was accepted during senate floor debate it would have prohibited meat packers from owning or controlling livestock within 14 days of slaughter designed to help protect livestock producers from price manipulation by large meat packing companies this amendment drew fire from some opposition centered on the fact that the amendment did not apply to poultry strong competitor to beef and pork and that it might endanger the use of marketing contracts some believe that these contracts help producers and pr ocessors plan and market their goods to the benefit of both however there are others who see contracts especially the confidentiality clauses in them as way for processors to unfairly manipulate livestock prices to producers to keep them low the senatep roposed restriction on packer ownership was supported by the american farm bur eau and iowa pork producers association two major farm

that they did not affect livestock under marketing contracts was adopted during senate deliberations the restrictions on packer ownership were s ticking point in conf erence deliberations several
