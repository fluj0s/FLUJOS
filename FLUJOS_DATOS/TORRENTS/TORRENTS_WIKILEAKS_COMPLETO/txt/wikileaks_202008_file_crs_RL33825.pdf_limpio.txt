the financial management of the federal government and recommended potential reforms the napa report moving from scorekeeper to strategic partner improving financial management in the federal government was published in october 2006 section 2 page 21 briefly assessed goals of pars and observed that many pars have grown prohibitively large and excessively detailed7 to increase the effectiveness of pars the napa workgroup recommended that omb issue additional guidelines on pars length and level of detail and consider better ways to streamline information currently in pars specifically the workgroup concluded and recommended the following pars should provide more integrated information such as cost of specific programs related to amount spent on achieving results pars should include an additional chart that compares final budgetary expenditures with congressional appropriations and pars should be available through single online website8 omb should issue better guidelines on the pars ideal length and level of detail g8g27g344g342g342g349g561g18g3g20g561g18g146g149g152g157g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561 in fy2007 by way of memorandum to the heads of executive departments agencies and other entities subject to the chief financial officers act omb announced its fy2007 pilot program for alternative approaches to performance and accountability reporting 9 the pilot allowed agencies to produce an alternative to the consolidated par omb felt that using an alternative format should not in any way reduce the publics access to the detailed financial and performance information available in consolidated par but should make the presentation of performance information more meaningful the pilot had three required components 1 an agency financial report afr 2 an annual performance report apr with detailed performance information that meets gpra requirements and is transmitted with the congressional budget justification cbj and 3 highlights document to provide performance and financial information in brief user friendly format to allow for greater attention to past performance the highlights had to be published later than the friday before the release of the presidents annual budget submission at minimum the highlights were to include the following clear concise and outcomeoriented explanation of what core public benefits the agency was seeking to achieve and its progress or lack of progress toward achieving them data and discussion of key performance measures including trend data 7 national academy of public

the presentation of financial and performance information and to make this information more meaningful and transparent to the public some agencies achieved these goals by including their aprs in their pars and at their discretion they were allowed to continue to use the traditional par format agencies participating in the fy2007 pilot realized however that there were benefits to including their annual performanc report with their congressional budget justification cbj and thus were allowed to do so because the par is published before the release of the presidents budget agencies discussions of future resource allocations were somewhat limited including the apr along with th annual performance plan in the cbj allowed the agency to discuss future programs or resources directed at improving performance more fully agencies participating in the pilot submitted notification to omb and identified improvements in reporting that were expected to be achieved by using the alternative the eleven
