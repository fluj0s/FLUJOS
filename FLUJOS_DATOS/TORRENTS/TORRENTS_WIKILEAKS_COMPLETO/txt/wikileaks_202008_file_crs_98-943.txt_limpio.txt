in copyrighted works and limitations on those rights when copyrighted works are used on the internet or in other digital electronic environments the act is the outcome of several years of congressional consideration of internet copyright policy issues initially these policy issues were considered in the context of development of national information infrastructure within the last two years with the development of two new intellectual property treaties by the world intellectual property organization wipo the focus shifted to implementation of the new treaties the dmca which generally took effect october 28 1998 consists of five titles title i implements the new treaties the wipo copyright treaty and the wipo performances and phonograms treaty the senate gave its advice and consent to united states ratification of the treaties on october 21 1998 the copyright treaty covers copyright protection for computer programs those databases that qualify as intellectual works and digital communications over the internet and other computer networks the performancesphonograms treaty extends protection to performers and producers of sound recordings that is essentially equivalent to the protection afforded copyright subject matter by the copyright treaty both treaties were implemented by amendment of the copyright act to create new protection against circumvention

copyright act p l 105 304 summary and analysis background the internet other computer networks and advances in electronic and digital technologies provide unparalleled opportunities for worldwide communications and economic growth in the judgment of most experts in order to tap fully the potential of these new technologies it is also generally agreed that legislatures will need to confront and resolve many difficult technical and legal policy issues the scope of copyright protection and any limitations on the rights of copyright owners for the use of copyrighted works in digital electronic environments was addressed by the 105th congress in enacting the digital millennium copyright act dmca pl 105 3041 the digital millennium copyright act is the outcome of several years of congressional consideration of copyright policy issues relating to domestic development of the national information infrastructure once called the information superhighway now referred to as the internet and to international development of two new intellectual property treaties working group on intellectual property of the white house national information infrastructure nii task force convened series of conferences exploring the copyright policy issues relating to the nii their september 1995 report led to the introduction in the 104th congress of s 1284 and hr 2441 which would have implemented the working groups recommendations2 hearings were held on the nii copyright policy issues but the bills were not enacted at the international level two new intellectual property treaties were created by diplomatic conference of states in geneva switzerland on december 20 1996 under the auspices of the world intellectual property organization wipo these are the wipo copyright treaty and the wipo performances and phonograms 1 the act of october 28 1998 consists of 5 titles which generally took effect on the date of enactment except for the technical amendments made by title i concerning treaty relationships and miscellaneous provisions in title iv 2 department of commerce intellectual property and the national information infrastructure report of the working group on intellectual property rights of the information infrastructure task force 1995 crs2 treaty3 the wipo copyright treaty covers copyright protection for computer programs for databases to the extent they are intellectual creations and for digital electronic uses of copyrighted works in general the wipo performances and phonograms treaty covers protection for performers and producers of sound recordings called phonograms internationally and generally applies the same or equivalent protection to sound recordings as that applied to other copyright subject matter by the wipo copyright treaty4 the president forwarded the two wipo treaties to the senate for its advice and consent to ratification by the united states and requested the introduction of legislation to implement the two substantive provisions of the treaties which the administration deemed would require legislation to satisfy the obligations of the treaties s 1121 and hr 2281 as originally introduced embodied the administrations recommended minimalist approach to implementing legislation the bills were premised on the assumption that existing united states copyright law was largely consistent with the treaty obligations s 1121 and hr 2281 would have created new legal protection against devices and activities that are primarily designed to circumvent anticopying technologies and against fraudulent removal alteration or provision of copyright management information cmi technical amendments were also included in the bills to update the copyright acts references to treaty relationships after the introduction of the administrations implementation bills alternative implementation bills were introduced s 1146 and hr 30485 that addressed internet copyright policy issues as well as wipo treaties implementation two other bills hr 2180 and hr 3209 proposed amendments solely concerning the copyright liability of online service providers osps 3 for an overview of these treaties see d schrader world intellectual property organization copyright treaty an overview crs report 97444 and d schrader world intellectual property organization performances and phonograms treaty an overview crs report 97523 4 two treaties rather than one treaty were developed because majority of countries do not protect sound recordings as copyright subject matter the united states protects sound recordings as copyright subject matter but other countries and especially the members of the european union protect sound recordings under socalled related or neighboring rights unfair competition or other noncopyright legal theories also the fact of separate treaty for phonograms allows for the extension of protection to performers most of whom are not considered authors within the meaning of the copyright law in those countries that protect sound recordings as copyright subject matter 5 hr 3048 and s 1146 contained the same proposals relating to fair use library reproduction distance learning ephemeral recordings operational copying by computers and protection against removal or alteration of cmi the provisions dealing with anti circumvention of copying technologies were virtually identical except for definition of effective technological measure hr 3048 moreover contained other amendments relating to the first sale doctrine and shrinkwrap licenses not found in s 1146 but did not contain any provisions on online service provider osp liability which were included in s 1146 crs3 the senate judiciary committee held hearings on s 1121 and s 1146 on september 4 1997 the house subcommittee on courts and intellectual property held hearings on hr 2281 and hr 2180 on september 16 and 17 1997 the house judiciary committee on april 1 1998 approved an amended version of hr 2281 which included the core elements of private sector agreement on online service provider liability6 the senate judiciary committee on may 11 1998 approved new bill s 2037 as successor to s 11217 s 2037 which was entitled the digital millennium copyright act of 1998 embodied the full private sector agreement on osp copyright liability made changes in the anticircumvention and cmi provisions and included amendments concerning several other internet copyright policy issues8 the senate passed s 2037 by unanimous voice vote on may 14 1998 hr 2281 under the short title the wipo copyright treaties implementation act was subject to sequential referral to the house commerce committee the subcommittee on telecommunications trade and consumer protection held hearing on hr 2281 on june 5 1998 the full commerce committee made several amendments to hr 2281 and reported the bill on july 22 1998 under the short title the digital millennium copyright act of 19989 this version of hr 2281 generally included the amendments already embodied in s 2037 as passed by the senate the commerce committee made additional amendments especially concerning anticircumvention fair use the first sale doctrine and encryption research the house of representatives passed hr 2281 on august 4 1998 under the short title the digital millennium copyright act of 1998 the housepassed version combined the senate amendments to s 2037 with additional amendments by the house judiciary and commerce committees the floor managers amendment to hr 2281 also added two new forms of intellectual property protection in 6

diminishes the existing doctrines of vicarious or contributory infringement or affects existing defenses such as fair use 2 clarified that electronics manufacturers have obligation to design consumer products to achieve protection against circumvention 3 expanded the exemption of 17 usc 112 for ephemeral copying by broadcasters to apply in digital contexts and to override the new anticircumvention measures under certain conditions 4 expanded the exemption of 17 usc 198 for libraries and archives to preserve copies for their collections in digital formats 5 protected personal privacy interests on the internet 6 provided exceptions from the anticircumvention provisions for computer interoperability for libraries and nonprofit educational institutions in making purchasing decisions and with respect to the right to control access by minors to the internet 7 excepted law enforcement and intelligence activities from the anti circumvention and cmi provisions and 8 directed the copyright office to report on distance learning and on the liability of nonprofit educational institutions and libraries when they act as osps for patrons 9 hrept 105551 part ii 105th cong 2d sess 1998 crs4 separate titles that were not earlier considered part of the wipo treaties implementation process title v incorporated the collections of information antipiracy act which had passed the house earlier as hr 2652 this title would have created 15 years of federal misappropriationstyle protection for databases that are not sufficiently creative to be eligible for copyright protection title vi of the house version of hr 2281 would have enacted the vessel hull design protection act which also passed the house as separate legislation in the form of hr 2696 this title would have created 10 years of design protection for boat hulls larger than rowboat and smaller than 201 feet in length senate and house conferees agreed on common bill hr 2281 which passed the senate on october 8 1998 and passed the house on october 12 1998 the senate consented to united states ratification of the two wipo treaties on october 21 1998 the president signed hr 2281 the digital millennium copyright act into law on october 28 1998 pl 105304 the digital millennium copyright act consists of five titles title i implements the two wipo treaties title ii establishes certain exemptions from copyright liability for online service and access providers title iii exempts computer maintenance and repair companies from copyright liability for the reproduction of computer program that occurs by mere activation of the computer title iv contains miscellaneous provisions relating to ephemeral recordings of digital broadcasts exemptions for preservation activities of libraries and archives new compulsory licenses for making ephemeral recordings and transmissions of digital sound recordings the assumption of contractual obligations in collective bargaining agreements between motion picture producers and artistic contributors and the rank and authority of the register of copyrights and the rank of the commissioner of patents and trademarks title v creates federal design protection for vessel hulls which sunsets after 2 years wipo treaties implementation title i title i of the digital millennium copyright act bears the short title the wipo copyright and performances and phonograms treaties implementation act of 1998 this act amends title 17 of the us code by adding new chapter 12 which creates civil and criminal liability for circumvention of copyright protection technologies and for the knowing provision of false copyright management information cmi or the intentional removal or alteration of cmi the technological protection measures typically include encryption scrambling passwords and electronic envelopes devices to bypass these measures are usually described as black boxes crs5 the act also makes technical amendments to 17 usc 10110 10411 104ah12 411a13 and 507a14 protection against circumvention of anticopying technology the wipo treaties contain substantively identical provisions on technological measures of protection also commonly referred to as the black box or anticircumvention provisions these provisions require contracting parties to provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures15 used by authors and other copyright owners to restrict unlawful access to their copyrighted works basic nature of violations new section 1201 17 usc implements the anticircumvention obligations of the wipo treaties subparagraph a1a provides that person shall circumvent technological measure that effectively controls access to work protected under this title 17 this prohibition is however delayed for two years after the date of enactment in order to allow time for the development of record as to how the implementation of these technologies is affecting availability of works in the market place for non infringing uses16 and for the conduct of rulemaking proceeding by the librarian of congress that proceeding can be repeated every 3 years it is anticipated that the main focus of the rulemaking proceeding will be on whether substantial diminution of that availability is actually occurring in the market for particular classes of copyrighted worksthe rulemaking may also to the extent required assess whether an adverse impact is likely to occur over the time period relevant to each rulemaking proceeding however the determination should be based upon anticipated rather than actual adverse impacts only in extraordinary circumstances in which the evidence of likelihood of future adverse impact is highly specific strong and persuasive 17 10 section 101 defines terms and phrases used in the copyright act 11 section 104 specifies the points of attachment ie the conditions under which works by foreign nationals are eligible for copyright protection in the united states 12 section 104a restored copyright in certain foreign works that fell into the public domain in the united states because of failure to comply with copyright formalities 13 section 411a makes registration with the united states copyright office prerequisite to suit for copyright infringement for works of united states origin but excepts certain works of foreign origin from mandatory registration 14 section 507 is statute of limitations provision 15 conference report on the digital millennium copyright act 105 796 105th cong 2d sess 6364 1998 hereafter dmca conference report 16

importation offering to the public or other trafficking in any technology product service device component or part thereof that is primarily designed or produced to circumvent an anticopying system the 2year delay affecting subparagraph 1 does not apply to violations of this subparagraph 2 the prohibition against manufacture or sale of devices applies if one of three conditions is met 1 the device is primarily designed for circumvention 2 the device has only limited commercially significant purpose other than circumvention or 3 the device is marketed by someone who is trafficking in circumvention devices section 1201b creates another anticircumvention violation that parallels the violation fixed by subparagraph a2 of section 1201 the 1201b type of violation occurs when person who has obtained authorized access to the copyrighted work circumvents the limits of the controls that the copyright owner has placed on lawful access to the work again the prohibition on manufacture and sale etc of black boxes applies if one of three conditions is met the device or service was primarily designed for circumvention has only limited commercially significant purpose other than circumvention or is marketed by someone who traffics in circumvention technologies exemptions from violations in the course of legislative debate on wipo treaties implementation several new or clarifying exemptions were added section 1201c declares that the circumvention provisions do not 1 affect fair use or any other existing limitations on copyright infringement or the existing rights and remedies of the copyright act 2 enlarge or diminish the existing doctrines of vicarious or contributory copyright infringement 3 obligate electronicscomputer manufacturers to design consumer products to achieve protection against circumvention so long as the products or parts do not otherwise fall within the ban of section 1201a2 or b1 or 4 enlarge or diminish free speech or press rights for activities using consumer electronics telecommunications or computer products circumvention for purposes of achieving interoperability of computers and reverse engineering by persons with access to lawful copy are generally permissible under section 1201f unless the activities otherwise constitute copyright infringement law enforcement and intelligence activities are generally exempt from violations of the circumvention provisions18 nonprofit libraries archives and educational institutions are exempt for purposes of making decisions about acquiring copy of the work19 persons engaging in encryption research are generally exempt if they lawfully obtained the encrypted copy made good faith effort to obtain authorization before circumvention and their acts are necessary to conduct encryption research and do not otherwise constitute copyright infringement or violate the computer fraud and abuse act of 198620 similarly section 1201j exempts circumvention for purposes of legitimate security testing of computer or computer 18 section 1201e 17 usc 19 section 1201d 17 usc 20 section 1201g 17 usc crs7 system or network provided the acts do not constitute copyright infringement or violate the computer fraud and abuse act of 1986 in applying section 1201a to component or part the court may take account of the fact that the part has the sole purpose of preventing access by minors to material on the internet21 also it is not violation of section 1201 a1a to circumvent technological measure that also has the purpose or capability of collecting or disseminating personally identifying information about the online activities of natural person22 technological measures for analog vcr as noted the anticircumvention provisions generally do not require the design of consumer electronics or computer products to achieve protection against circumvention in departure from that general principle section 1201k requires that analog video cassette recorders must conform to the two forms of copy control technology that are in wide use in the market today the automatic gain control copy control technology and the colorstripe copy control technology23 the housesenate conferees explained that this provision was included in order to deal with very specific situation involving the protection of analog television programming and prerecorded movies and other audiovisual works in relation to recording capabilities of ordinary consumer analog video cassette recorders before agreeing to include this requirement in the final legislation the conferees assured themselves in relation to two critical issues that these analog copy control technologies do not create playability problems on normal consumer electronics products and that the intellectual property necessary for the operation of these technologies will be available on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms 24 protection for the integrity of copyright management information the two wipo treaties contain substantively identical obligations to protect the integrity of copyright management information cmi ie information which identifies the work the author or the owner of rights or which specifies the terms and conditions of use cmi also includes any identifying numbers or codes basic rights the digital millennium copyright act implements the treaty obligations to protect cmi in the new chapter 12 to title 17 usc the act generally prohibits the knowing provision distribution or importation of false cmi and the intentional removal or alteration of cmi or the distribution or importation of cmi knowing that information has been altered or removed the purpose of the cmi provisions is to facilitate widespread use of cmi by copyright owners in order to make licensing of works or obtaining permission to use 21 section 1201h 17 usc 22 section 1201i 17 usc 23 dmca conference report 105796 at 67 24 id at 68 crs8 works easier and more beneficial both to the public and copyright owners pursuant to the wipo treaties the provisions cannot and are not legislated as formality ie as condition of the exercise or enjoyment of the copyright nor can the cmi requirements prohibit the free movement of goods the new rights to protect the integrity of cmi systems apply both to analog and digital formats in this respect the dmca exceeds the minimum treaty obligations since the wipo treaties require protection only for electronic rights management information the prohibitions do not apply to the ordinary and customary practices of broadcasters or the inadvertent omission of credits from broadcasts of audiovisual works since such acts do not involve the provision of false cmi with the requisite knowledge and intent25 exemptions the lawfully authorized activities of law enforcement and intelligence agencies are exempt from the cmi requirements26 broadcasters cable systems and those who provide programming to these entities are also generally exempt from liability under the cmi provisions if they do not intend to induce enable facilitate or conceal copyright infringement27 the conditions for applying the limitation on liability differ depending upon whether the transmission is an analog or digital one in the case of an analog transmission an eligible person will not be liable if it is not technically feasible to avoid the violation or if avoidance would create an undue financial hardship in the case of digital transmission the exemption is dependent upon the status of efforts to create voluntary standards for transmission of cmi the act contemplates that voluntary standards will be developed until standard is set an eligible person is not liable if the transmission would cause perceptible visual or aural degradation of the digital signal or if the transmission would conflict with an applicable government regulation or industry standard other than cmi standards if voluntary cmi standard has been set the eligible person will not be liable if the cmi was not located in accordance with the industry standard civil and criminal remedies the digital millennium copyright act establishes nearly the same civil and criminal remedies for violations of either the anticircumvention provisions of 17 usc 1201 or the cmi provisions of 17 usc 1202 civil remedies the civil remedies for violations of the anticircumvention and cmi provisions are found in section 1203 17 usc they include injunctions 25 sectional analysis of hr 2281 august 4 1998 at 19 26 section 1202d 17 usc 27 section 1202e 17 usc crs9 impoundment of infringing material or equipment actual damages and any additional profits of the violator not counted as part of damages or statutory damages at the option of the plaintiff the statutory damages for violation of section 1201 range from 2002500 per act of circumvention for violation of the section 1202 cmi provisions the plaintiff may be awarded between 250025000 for each violation if there are repeated violations within 3year period the court may award triple damages the court also has the discretion to reduce or remit damages if the violator proves and the court finds the offender was not aware and had reason to believe that the law was violated under the same circumstances in the case of nonprofit library archive or educational institution the court must reduce or remit damages for innocent violations criminal penalties nonprofit libraries archives or educational institutions are exempt from any criminal liability for violation of sections 1201 or 1202 other violators shall be fined more than 500000 or imprisoned up to 5 years or both for first offenses for subsequent offenses the maximum fines and prison time are doubled title i studies or reports encryption research new section 1201g of title 17 usc in addition to creating certain exemptions for encryption research from the anticircumvention provisions also directs the register of copyrights and the assistant secretary for communications and information of the department of commerce hereafter the assistant secretary for comminfo to report back to the congress on the effect of the legislation on encryption research28 the report which is due 1 year after enactment will also assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the anticopying measures used by copyright owners impact on electronic commerce section 104 of title i directs the register of copyrights and the assistant secretary for comminfo to report back to the congress on the effects of title i on the development of electronic commerce and associated technologies the report must also evaluate the dmcas effect on the operations of the first sale doctrine of 17 usc 109 and the computer program exemptions of 17 usc 117 this report is due within 2 years after enactment effective date the amendments to title 17 usc made by title i of the dmca are generally effective on the date of enactment october 28 1998 the technical amendments relating to international treaty relationships will take effect when the united states becomes bound by the two new wipo treaties the senate on october 21 1998 gave its consent to united states ratification of the treaties the instruments of ratification will be deposited with the director general of wipo in due course the 28 17 usc 1201g5 crs10 wipo treaties will not enter into force however until 30 states have deposited instruments of accession or ratification29 online copyright infringement liability limitation title ii the potential liability of online service and access providers osps for infringing activities of their customers was originally one of the major controversies regarding wipo treaties implementation30 the original implementation bills recommended by the administration did not address the issue on the theory that since the treaties themselves do not address who is liable for any copyright infringements the matter could be left to judicial interpretation that outcome was opposed by many groups including coalitions representing the osps telecommunications entities the electronics industry and library and educational institutions without legislative guidance these groups argued there would be unacceptable business uncertainty and protracted litigation to delineate who is liable for infringements by osp customers the issue of osp liability was resolved by negotiated agreement among the private sector interests most directly affected by use of copyrighted works on the internet31 that agreement formed the basis for most of title ii of the dmca title ii of the dmca the online copyright infringement liability limitation act amends chapter 5 of the copyright act by adding new section 512 relating to limitations on osp liability for online infringements by their customers the limitations on liability benefit persons or entities who act as online service providers32 the act gives twopart definition of the term service provider with respect to digital network communications 17 usc 512a service provider is an entity offering the transmission routing or providing of connections for digital online communications between or among points specified by user of material of 29 three countries belarus indonesia and the republic of moldova have ratified the copyright treaty two countries belarus and the republic of moldova have ratified the performances and phonograms treaty 30 this report uses osp as shorthand for persons and entities who transmit route provide connections or otherwise facilitate computer network service and access for customers without initiating or altering the content of the transmission although osps are the main beneficiaries of the liability provisions in title ii of the dmca entities other than osps can claim the exemption if they meet the statutory conditions 31 the negotiations that culminated in an agreement on osp copyright liability on march 31 1998 were conducted for several years under the auspices of the senate judiciary committee and the subcommittee on courts and intellectual property of the house judiciary committee the private sector negotiators included representatives of copyright owners and authors the telecommunications industry electronics industry and computer equipment industry and online service providers 32 title ii of the dmca took effect upon enactment october 28 1998 crs11 the users choosing without modification to the content of the material as sent or received 33 the term service provider as used in subsections bj and lm of section 512 means provider of online services or network access or the operator of facilities therefor as well as entities that meet the first part of the definition of service provider34 the second part of the definition includes universities that act as service providers and entities that provide internet access email chat room and web page hosting services the digital millennium copyright act basically absolves the osps from copyright liability when they merely act as conduits of information transferred over their networks without having any control over the content of the transmission the dmca creates safe harbors from either direct vicarious or contributory copyright infringement when the conditions of the exemption are met upon receiving notice of infringement that complies with statutory requirements35 an osp is expected expeditiously to remove disable or block access to the extent blocking is technologically feasible and economically reasonable upon receipt of counternotice from provider of the blocked site the osp shall retain the block for 1014 days but longer unless the copyright owner files suit for copyright infringement the exemptions from liability apply both to network service transmissions and to private and realtime communications services the senatehouse conferees reached an agreement on further limits on the liability of nonprofit educational institutions that act as service providers digital network communications an osp is not liable for monetary relief and injunctive relief is carefully circumscribed when an osp acts as mere conduit in transmitting the copyrighted works some of the specific restrictions to qualify for this exemption are the transmission was initiated by someone other than the osp the transmission is provided through automatic technical processes without selection of content by the osp the osp does not select the recipients of the copyrighted material except as an automatic response to provide service 33 section 512 k1 title 17 usc 34 ibid 35 among other requirements the notice must be in writing describe the infringing material give information about location of infringing material on the network identify the copyrighted works contain sworn statement that the notice of infringement is accurate and be signed physically or electronically by an authorized person crs12 the osp does not maintain copy of the copyrighted material that is accessible to recipients for longer period than is necessary for the communications and the material is transmitted without change system caching the osp is not liable for monetary relief and injunctive relief is carefully circumscribed when the copyrighted material is temporarily stored on the system or network as part of an automatic process without change for use in refreshing reloading or other updating in accordance with accepted industry standards for data communications information storage an osp is not liable for monetary relief and injunctive relief is carefully circumscribed when an osp stores infringing material on its network at the direction of system user if the osp does not have actual knowledge of the infringement is not aware of facts or circumstances that make the infringement apparent or upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness acts expeditiously to remove or disable access to the infringing material information location tools the standards applicable to storage of information apply generally to osp liability for referring or linking users to an online location that may contain infringing material that is the osp is not liable without actual knowledge or an awareness of facts that make the infringement apparent or if the osp acts expeditiously to remove or disable access upon obtaining knowledge or awareness of an infringement limitations on liability of nonprofit educational institutions in general university or other nonprofit educational institution is eligible for the same limitations on osp liability as those described above for commercial osps in recognition however of the special nature of the university environment additional limitations on liability were added in section 512e special rules were developed for determining whether universities are liable for the acts of faculty members or graduate students teachingresearch function online infringing activities of faculty members or graduate students which occur when they are teaching or engaging in research will not be attributed to the university if certain conditions are met these conditions are l the infringing activities must not involve online access to instructional materials that are required or recommended for course taught by the infringing instructor within the last 3 years crs13 2 the institution must not have received more than 2 claims of copyright infringement concerning the particular instructor within the last 3 years and 3 the institution must provide to the users of its system or network materials that accurately describe and promote compliance with copyright law when these conditions are met the instructors knowledge or awareness of infringing activities will not be attributed to the university nonteachingnonresearch function the special rules on liability do not apply when faculty member or graduate student is performing nonteachingnon research function for example when the person is exercising administrative responsibilities or is carrying out operational responsibilities that relate to the institutions role as service provider in those cases the knowledge awareness and actions of the employee can be attributed to the university however in those cases the limitations on liability available to commercial service providers would be available to the university nothing in subsection 512e creates any new liability for universities under the doctrines of respondent superior or contributory infringement where liability did not exist before enactment of the dmca also subsection has impact on the fair use section 107 doctrine or the availability of fair use in university setting similarly section 110 of the copyright act dealing with classroom performance and distance learning is not changed by subsection e36 injunctive relief monetary relief is not available against qualifying service provider and injunctive relief is circumscribed section 512 j limits the scope of injunctive relief that may be obtained against qualifying service provider distinctions are drawn between service providers qualifying for the limitations under section 512 digital communications networks and those qualifying under section 512 bd section 512 bd injunctive relief only three forms of injunctive relief may be granted if qualified service provider has cached temporarily stored or unknowingly facilitated the location of infringing material 1 the court may provide for the removal or blocking of infringing materialresiding at specific location on the providers network this is essentially an order to comply with the removalblocking provisions of section 512 c lc 2 the court may order the provider to terminate service to the subscriber who is engaging in the infringing activity 3 in unusual cases if the court considers it necessary the court may grant other injunctive relief than that specified in clauses l and 2 but must 36 dmca conference report 105796 at 7576 crs14 determine that this relief is the least burdensome to the service provider among comparably effective forms of relief section 512a injunctive relief in the case of transmission of infringing material via transitory digital network communications injunctive relief is further narrowed if court determines that any injunctive relief is appropriate it may grant one or both of two forms of relief l the court may order termination of service to the subscriber 2 where the infringement relates to foreign online location the court may enter an order to take reasonable steps to block access to specific identified foreign online location blocking orders are not available against service provider qualifying under section 512a in the case of infringing activity on site within the united states or its territories in granting even this circumscribed injunctive relief the court must first consider new criteria relating to the digital online environment37 the dmca prohibits most forms of ex parte injunctive relief including temporary and preliminary relief against service provider who qualifies for the section 512 limitation on liability an exception is made only for orders ensuring the preservation of evidence or other orders having material adverse effect on the operation of the service providers communications network38 other limitations on liability the digital millennium copyright act also creates penalties for knowing material misrepresentations about infringing online activity absolves osps of noncopyright liability if the osp in good faith acts to disable or remove allegedly infringing material subject to certain requirements for notifying the subscriber of receipt of statutory notice of infringement from the copyright owner confirms that traditional copyright defenses such as fair use are unaffected by an osps blockage of or failure to block access to alleged infringing material and provides that copyright owners who seek the identification of the direct infringer from the osp must obtain subpoena from court computer maintenance or repair exemption title iii title iii of the dmca enacts the computer maintenance competition assurance act which amends section 117 of title 17 usc section 117 contains certain limitations on copyright liability relating to computer programs title iii adds new limitation relating to maintenance or repair of computers by independent service organizations the act overturns decision of the ninth circuit holding that 37 section 512 j2 title 17 usc 38 section 512 j3 title 17 usc crs15 an independent computer servicerepair company infringes the copyright in computer program by causing reproduction of the program through activation of the computer in the course of maintenance or repair work39 under the revised section 117 limitation neither the owner or lessee of machine that makes copy of computer program upon activation of the machine does not infringe the computer program copyright nor does the person authorized to maintain or repair the machine the copy of the computer program must be destroyed immediately after the maintenance or repair work is completed this act has the narrow and specific intent of relieving independent service providers persons unaffiliated with either the owner or lessee of the machine from liability under the copyright act when solely by virtue of activating the machine in which computer program resides they inadvertently cause an unauthorized copy of that program to be made40 this amendment does not affect the liability of persons who make unauthorized adaptations modifications or other changes to the computer program the amendment makes change with respect to the scope of the term reproduction as it is used in the copyright act41 miscellaneous provisions title iv title iv of the digital millennium copyright act contains miscellaneous provisions relating to ephemeral recordings of digital broadcasts exemptions for the preservation activities of libraries and archives in the digital environment new compulsory licenses for making ephemeral recordings and transmissions of digital sound recordings the assumption of contractual obligations relating to motion picture collective bargaining agreements and the rank and authority of the register of copyrights and the rank of the commissioner of patents and trademarks the amendment concerning motion picture contracts is made to title 28 rather than title 17 the miscellaneous provisions also mandate two studies of copyright issues distance education sec 403 and assumption of motion picture contracts sec 406 ephemeral recordings of digital broadcasts ephemeral recordings are copies of transmission programs made by transmitting organization for delayed transmission and for archival purposes under 17 usc 112 of the copyright law in effect before enactment of the dmca commercial and noncommercial broadcasters were given the benefit of an exemption from the reproduction right to make at least one copy of broadcast program for 39 mai systems corp v advanced computer systems of michigan inc 991 f 2d 511 9th cir 1993 40 sectional analysis of hr 2281 august 4 1998 at 41 41 dmca conference report 105796 at 76 crs16 delayed transmission or archival purposes42 this exemption clearly applies to analog transmissions but its application to digital transmissions which are now occurring on an experimental basis has been uncertain the dmca amends 17 usc 112 and 114 to address two issues concerning the scope of the ephemeral recording exemption in digital contexts43 one amendment explicitly extends the section 112 exemption to nonsubscription broadcasts of sound recordings in digital formats subscription music services webcasters satellite digital audio radio services and similar entities who operate under statutory licenses for the performance of sound recordings pursuant to 17 usc 114f are also entitled to make ephemeral recordings of the sound recordings they transmit44 the second amendment concerns the relationship between the ephemeral recording exemption and the anticircumvention provisions of new section 1201 of the copyright act concerns were expressed that if use of copy protection technologies became widespread transmitting organization might be prevented from engaging in its traditional activities of assembling transmission programs and making ephemeral recordings permitted by section 112 for purposes of its own transmissions within its local service area and of archival preservation and security45 the dmca provides that if broadcaster is prevented by the copyright owners anticopying measures from making the permitted ephemeral recordings the copyright owner must make available the necessary means to make the recording provided it is technologically feasible and economically reasonable to do so if the copyright owner fails to provide the necessary means in timely manner in accordance with reasonable business requirements the broadcaster is not liable for violation of the anticopying measures new digital audio transmission license and new ephemeral recording statutory license background the digital performance right in sound recordings act of 1995 1995 digital audio act46 created limited public performance right in sound recordings under existing copyright law public performances of analog sound recordings are not within the control of the copyright owner ie analog sound recordings can be played over radio and television or performed in other public places without the need to obtain license or permission from the sound recording 42 noncommercial broadcasters and governmental entities can make up to 30 copies of broadcast program under certain conditions 17 usc 112b 43 sec 402 of title iv of the dmca 44 dmca conference report 105796 at 79 45 dmca conference report 105796 at 78 46 pub l 10439 act of november 1 1995 which generally took effect on february 1 1996 crs17 copyright owner of course performance of any musical work embodied in the recording must be licensed effective february 1996 however digital sound recordings were granted limited rights of public performance under the 1995 digital audio act public performance rights were granted in subscription transmissions and interactive transmissions the 1995 act exempts nonsubscription digital broadcasts that are not interactive moreover the 1995 act distinguishes between interactive and noninteractive subscription performances noninteractive subscription services may be eligible for statutory license with respect to payperlisten audioondemand and similar interactive services copyright owners are granted an exclusive right interactive services must negotiate with sound recording copyright owners to obtain the right to transmit the sound recordings the 1995 act does however place some strict conditions on the exclusive right relating to interactive services since the enactment of the 1995 digital audio act services commonly known as webcasters have begun offering the public multiple highlythemed genre channels of sound recordings on the internet on nonsubscription basis47 the webcasters and sound recording copyright owners have disagreed about application of the 1995 act48 sec 405 of title iv of the dmca responds to this issue by adding two more statutory licenses for digital audio transmissions of sound recordings and for making multiple ephemeral recordings49 one new license applies to certain nonsubscription and new subscription services that perform digital sound recordings second new license applies to multiple ephemeral reproductions of sound recordings stored in computer system servers in order to facilitate performances the original statutory license of the 1995 act in slightly modified form continues to apply to old subscription services in operation on july 31 1998 provided the preexisting service continues to use the same method of transmission new digital audio transmission license in essence 17 usc 114 is revised to contain two separate statutory licenses relating to digital audio transmissions of sound recordings the new digital audio transmission license applies to webcasters on the internet and other new transmission services not in existence before july 31 1998 preexisting subscription services are grandfathered under the original but slightly modified license of the 1995 digital audio act 47 sectional analysis of hr 2281 august 4 1998 at 50 48 dmca conference report 105796 at 80 49 the details of this second 17 usc 114 statutory license are beyond the scope of this summary of the digital millennium copyright act most of the amendments to section 114 take effect upon enactment but an obligation in clause ix of section 114d2c relating to identification of the sound recording during transmission does not take effect until 1 year after enactment crs18 major distinction between the old and the new digital audio license is that the rates under the new license must be fixed at marketplace value in establishing rates and terms for transmissions by eligible nonsubscription services and new subscription services the copyright arbitration royalty panel shall establish rates and terms that most clearly represent the rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between willing buyer and willing seller50 rates for pre existing subscription services and preexisting satellite digital radio services are fixed under different criteria that basically permit comparison of rates for comparable services but do not require marketplace fees51 the amendments to 17 usc 114 and the statutory licenses created by the amendments are all fully subject to the safeguards for copyright owners of sound recordings and musical works contained in sections 114c 114d4 and 114i and the conferees do not intend to affect any of the rights in section 115 that were clarified and confirmed in the 1995 digital audio act52 ephemeral recording license section 112 17 usc is amended by adding new paragraph which creates new statutory license for making multiple reproductions of sound recordings embodied in an ephemeral recording this new license is intended primarily for entities that transmit sound recordings to business establishments pursuant to the limitation on exclusive rights set forth in section 114d1civ 53 the new 112e license is also available to section 114f licensees who want to make more than the one recording permitted by the 112a exemption webcasters might wish to reproduce multiple recordings for use on different computer servers or to make transmissions at different transmission rates or using different transmission software 54 as was true under the law before enactment of the dmca to avail itself of the ephemeral recording provisions the transmitting organization must have voluntary licenses to perform any music embodied in the transmission contractual obligations related to transfers of motion picture rights sec 406 of title iv of the dmca amends part vi of title 28 usc by adding new chapter 180 regulating the assumption of contractual obligations in collective bargaining agreements between motion picture producers and the craft guilds and unions representing contributors to motion pictures when rights in the motion picture are transferred the guilds expressed concern about their inability to obtain residual payments that are due to their members in situations where the producer of the motion picture 50 section 114f2b 17 usc 51 section 114f1b 17 usc 52 dmca conference report 105796 at 89 53 dmca conference report 105796 at 89 54 id at 90 crs19 fails to make these payments for example where the producercompany longer exists or is bankrupt although the collective bargaining agreements generally require the production company to obtain assumption agreements from distributors that would effectively create privity some production companies apparently do not always do so55 sec 406 of the dmca requires that transfers of motion picture rights negotiated after enactment shall be deemed to incorporate the collective bargaining agreements if the transferee knew or had reason to know about the collective bargaining agreements or if there is an existing court order against the transferor and the transferor does not have the financial ability to satisfy the obligation within 90 days after the order is issued transfers relating to the public performance right alone are however excluded from the assumption of contractual obligations also excluded are transfers related to security interests banks and other financial institutions are not subject to the statutory assumption of obligations in collective bargaining agreements merely because they obtain security interest in the motion picture56 report by comptroller general sec 406h directs the comptroller general in consultation with the register of copyrights to study and report to the congress within 2 years of enactment on the conditions in the motion picture industry that gave rise to the amendment concerning assumption of contractual obligations and on the impact of the amendment on the industry exemption for libraries and archives sec 404 of the dmca amends the library reproduction exemption of 17 usc 108 to allow libraries and archives to take advantage of digital technologies when engaging in certain permitted activities under the law in effect before enactment of the dmca section 108b permitted the reproduction and distribution of one copy or phonorecord of an unpublished work solely for preservation security or deposit for research use in another library or archives with respect to published works section 108c permitted reproduction of an entire copy or phonorecord for the purpose of replacing damaged deteriorating lost or stolen copy if an unused replacement could not be obtained at fair price the amendments in the dmca permit the reproduction of 3 copies or phonorecords rather than the one copy of the former law and delete the limiting reference to reproduction only in facsimile form any reproduction in digital format of an unpublished work must not be distributed in that format to the public outside the premises of the library or archive also in the case of published works storage in an obsolete format is added as another justification for reproduction if replacement copy is unavailable at fair price any digital reproduction of 55 sectional analysis of hr 2281 august 4 1998 at 62 56 dmca conference report 105796 at 92 crs20 published work cannot be made available to the public in the digital format outside the premises of the library or archives in lawful possession of the copy from which the reproduction is made references to the premises of the library or archive mean only physical premises and do not include online websites bulletin boards or homepages57 another amendment eases the burden of reproducing copyright notice as condition of the section 108 exemptions notice already appearing on the copy that is being reproduced should be maintained and not deleted if the copy being reproduced lacks copyright notice the library or archive simply places legend or notation on the copy that this work may be protected by copyright distance education report section 1102 of title 17 usc exempts qualifying instructional broadcasts from copyright liability for the public performance of copyrighted works embodied in the broadcast transmissions nonprofit libraries and educational institutions urged the congress to adapt the instructional broadcasting exemption to the internet environment when enacting the digital millennium copyright act congress deferred this issue for further consideration after receiving report from the register of copyrights sec 403 of the dmca directs the register of copyrights after consultation with representatives of copyright owners and nonprofit libraries and educational institutions to submit report to congress on distance education later than 6 months after enactment the report shall include recommendations on how to promote distance education through digital technologies including interactive digital networks while maintaining an appropriate balance between the rights of copyright owners and the needs of users of copyrighted works58 paragraph b of sec 403 lists 8 factors that the register shall consider in formulating recommendations rank and authority of register of copyrights rank of the commissioner of patents and trademarks sec 401a of the dmca amends section 3d of title 35 section 701e of title 17 and section 5314 of title 5 to create parity in the compensation paid to the commissioner of patents and trademarks and the register of copyrights both officials will be paid at the pay fixed for level iii of the executive schedule under section 5314 of title 5 of the us code sec 401b clarifies the duties and functions of the register of copyrights by adding new paragraph to section 701 of title 17 usc the new subsection sets forth in express statutory language the functions presently performed by the register of copyrights existing subsection 701a addresses some of the legislative and 57 sectional analysis of hr 2281 august 4 1998 at 49 58 sec 403a of the dmca crs21 executive or administrative functions new subsection 701b is intended to codify the other traditional roles of the copyright office and to confirm the registers existing areas of jurisdiction59 the amendment confirms the following areas of authority and jurisdiction of the register of copyrights and the copyright office of the library of congress 1 the longstanding role as advisor to congress on copyright matters and all matters within the scope of title 17 2 the longstanding role in advising other federal agencies such as the state department and us trade representative on the adequacy of foreign copyright laws and as technical consultant in bilateral regional and multilateral negotiations with other countries on copyrightrelated issues 3 the longstanding role as key participant in international meetings of various kinds including as part of us delegations as authorized by the executive branch and 4 the preparation and submission to the congress of studies and reports on various copyright policy issues these statutory functions and duties are illustrative and not exhaustive60 vessel hull design protection title v title v of the digital millennium copyright act creates new form of intellectual property protection for the design of boat hulls the vessel hull design protection act adds new chapter 13 to title 17 usc that protects the design of the hull of boats larger than rowboat and smaller than 201 feet in length against copying protection extends both to the artistic and the utilitarian features the vessel hull design act is however subject to sunset 2 years after enactment background the boat design title enacts design protection proposal that had been considered and rejected in the form of broad design legislation for at least 20 years the boat hull design proposal responds to decision of the supreme court in bonito boats v thunder craft boats61 in which the court held that state law protection of boat hulls was an unconstitutional interference with the federal patent and copyright laws the boat hull design proposal first passed the house of representatives as separate bill hr 2696 and was added as separate title to hr 2281 as passed by the house on august 4 1998 the housesenate conferees compromised by allowing the boat design act to remain in hr 2281 as enacted but subjected the act to termination after 2 years the register of copyrights and the commissioner of patents and trademarks shall submit joint report to the congress not later than 1 year after enactment evaluating the effect of the vessel hull design act 59 dmca conference report 105796 at 77 60 dmca conference report 105796 at 7778 61 489 us 141 1989 crs22 boat design protection is intended to fill gap that some perceive exists between the current design patent and copyright laws the same argument has been made for legislation to enact design right for useful articles in general when general design legislation was considered by earlier congresses objections from the insurance industry consumers retailers and others concerned about possible anti competitive effects were sufficient to prevent enactment basic boat design right new chapter 13 of title 17 usc is headed protection of original designs although the definition of useful article is intended to make clear the protection is limited to designs of boat hulls section 1301 creates new legal protection for the original design of useful article which makes the design attractive or distinctive in appearance design is original if it is the result of the designers own creative endeavor and represents distinguishable variation compared to other designs the distinguishable variation must be more than trivial and not copied from another person the overall shape of boat larger than rowboat and smaller than 201 feet in length can be protected against copying of its artistic or utilitarian features the fact that protection can extend to solely utilitarian design features is departure from gearlier design proposals which would have excluded designs dictated solely by utilitarian function in order to obtain boat hull design protection an application for design registration must be made to the administrator the register of copyrights within 2 years after the design is made public the boat design right is enforced through civil remedies only these remedies include an injunction actual damages or up to 50000 or 1 copy as the court considers just62 the infringers profits destruction of infringing articles and attorneys fees to the prevailing party exclusions from protection the biggest exclusion from protection is achieved by defining useful article to mean only vessel hull including plug or mold also excluded from protection by section 1302 are designs that are 1 not original 2 staple or commonplace 3 different from staple designs only in insignificant details or elements that are common variants or 4 embodied in useful article made public by the designerowner more than 1 year before an application for registration is made to the copyright office63 62 damages of 1 copy would seem to have significance primarily for designs of useful articles other than vessel hulls this damages provision is another example of the way title v of the dmca may lay the foundation for protection of the design of useful articles in general 63 section 1302 actually lists fifth exclusion for designs dictated solely by utilitarian function another clause of the vessel hull design act however specifies that this exclusion does not apply in the case of vessel hull designs crs23 conclusion the digital millennium copyright act pl 105304 amends the copyright act title 17 of the us code to legislate new rights in copyrighted works and limitations on those rights when those works are used on the internet and in other digital electronic environments the act is the outcome of at least 5 years of intensive congressional consideration of internet copyright policy issues initially these policy issues were considered in the context of the development of national information superhighway or national information infrastructure the focus shifted somewhat to international copyright policy issues and the worldwide internet with the creation of two new intellectual property treaties in december 1996 under the auspices of the world intellectual property organization wipo the wipo copyright treaty covers copyright protection for computer programs those databases that qualify as intellectual works digital communications over the internet and use of copyrighted works in digital electronic environments the wipo performances and phonograms treaty extends protection to performers and producers of sound recordings that essentially is equivalent to the protection afforded copyright subject matter by the wipo copyright treaty initially the clinton administration and copyright owners proposed implementation of the wipo treaties through minimalist approach they advocated copyright law amendments to protect against circumvention of anti copying technologies and protection assuring the integrity of copyright management information cmi systems other internet copyright policy issues under this approach would have been addressed in separate legislation at some future time or left for resolution by the courts in copyright infringement cases based on the arguments of online service providers other telecommunications entities the electronics industry libraries and educational institutions congress confronted most of the internet copyright policy issues and made policy choices in enacting the digital millennium copyright act the act which generally took effect october 28 1998 in addition to implementing anticircumvention and cmi protection generally exempts online service providers from copyright liability exempts computer repair service companies broadens the ephemeral recording exemption to apply in digital contexts creates new statutory licenses for multiple ephemeral recordings and transmissions of digital sound recordings and broadens the application of the library reproduction exemption in digital contexts the act also creates new federal design protection for vessel hulls which sunsets after 2 years the senate gave its advice and consent to the ratification by the united states of the two wipo treaties on october 21 1998 the treaties will not come into force however until 30 states deposit their instruments of ratification or accession with the director general of wipo for other
