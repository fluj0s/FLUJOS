think so it wasnt memorable in any way as you say they dont come to the regular meetings like egus agu ams etc i only went to tenerife as the organisers paid for to go citation ratings vary there are several different scalesindicators as well lot from year to year for most journals ive never figured out how the counting is done wrt the highly cited lists that tom w kevin and i are on do only first authorships count for example even with common name like mine people still get it wrong and mistakes persist surprisingly jim hansen doesnt make the above list 1httpwwwhighlycitedcom but then he normally drops his there are few more journals qsr climate change ijc aar to give few where paleo papers also appear cheers phil at 1043 13082003 0400 michael mann wrote i checked this out prior to my senate hearing their science citations in the climate literature are poor as one would hope and expect interestingly they both drop their second initials when publishing in the climate literature so that their names dont turn in up in isi if you do search on their publications in the astronomy literature which use the full initialsapparently they dont want their astronomy colleagues to be aware that theyre moonlighting as supposed climatologists their numbers are better in the astronomy literature though soons numbers even here are mediocre baliunas had some wellcited publications more than decade ago this is her work on the use of sunlike stars as model for solar variability etc which is well referenced in the astrophysics community however most of these appear to be her phd work and appear to have been published w her phd adviser not much evidence however that she has made any useful independent contribution since then there are some additional papers shes published on time series analysis of solar signalslooks like the kind of stuff you might expect to see from graduate student firstyear research project in my opinion its would be mistake to evaluate these on their citations numbers in astronomy we should focus on their numbers in the climate literature which are the only ones relevant when discussing the issue of how their work on climate is received by their fellow scientists mike at 0815 am 8132003 0600 tom wigley wrote might be interesting to see how frequently soon and baliunas individually are cited as astronomers are they any good in their own fields perhaps we could start referring to them as astrologers excusable as oops just typo tom tom crowley wrote hi there we need some data on soon and baliunas one of my concerns is that they only publish in low impact journals and completely bypass the normal give and take of presentations at open scientific meetings for example i think i have probably heard 100 presentations overall from the people on this mailing list it is therefore very important to inquire for the sake or our exchanges with reporterslegislators etc as to how often any of you may have heard soon or baliunas give talk in an open meeting where they could defend their analyses please respond to as to whether you have heard either of them present something on their paleoanalyses i think i heard baliunas speak once on her solartype star work but that doesnt count i will let you know the results of the poll so that we may all be on the same grounds with respect to the data and reporting such information to press inquirieslegislators etc further fyi i list below the journal impact for six geophysicalclimatepaleoclimate journals paleoceanography 3821 j climate 3250 j geophysical res climate 2245 geophysical research letters 2150 the holocene 1852 climate research 1016 science and nature are much higher 2630 but there citation numbers are i believe inflated with respect to our field because their citation ranking also includes many very widely cited biology publications hope to hear from you soon tom ______________________________________________________________ professor michael mann department of
