from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to wshunitecomau subject re tar date mon sep 18 162304 2000 cc ckfollandmetogovuk tkarlncdcnoaagov warwick i did not think i would get chance today to look at the web page i see what boxes you are referring to the interpolation procedure cannot produce larger anomalies than neighbours larger values in single month if you have found any of these i will investigate if you are talking about larger trends then that is different matter trends say in fig 29 for the 197699 period require 16 years to have data and at least 10 months in each year it is conceivable that at there are 24 years in this period that missing values in some boxes influence trend calculation i would expect this to be random across the globe cheers phil warwick been away just checked my program and the interpolation shouldnt produce larger anomalies than the neighbouring cells so can you send the cells months and year of the two cells youve found if i have this i can check to see what has happened and answer 1 as for 2 and 3 we compared all stations with neighbours and these two stations did not have problems when the work was done around 19856 i am not around much for the next 3 weeks but will be here most of this week and will try to answer 1 if i get more details if you have the names of stations that youve compared olenek and verhojansk with i would appreciate that cheers phil at 0513 am 91400 1000 you wrote dear phillip and chris folland with your ipcc hat on some days ago chris i emailed to tom karl and you replied re the grid cells in north siberia with stations yet carrying red circle grid point anomalies in the tar fig 29 global maps i even sent gif file map showing the grid cells barren of stations greyed out you said this was due to interpolation and referred to phillip and procedures described in submitted paper in the last couple of days i have put up page detailing shortcomings in your tar fig 29 maps in the north siberian region everything is specified there with diagrams and numbered grid points 1 one issue is that two of the interpolated grid cells have larger anomalies than the parent cells this must be explained 2 another serious issue is that obvious nonhomogenous warming in olenek and verhojansk is being interpolated through to adjoining grid cells with stations like cancer 3 the third serious issue is that the urbanization affected trend from the irkutsk grid cell neare lake baikal looks to be interpolated into its western neighbour i am sure there are many other cases of this 2 and 3 happening best regards warwick hughes i have sent this to ckf
