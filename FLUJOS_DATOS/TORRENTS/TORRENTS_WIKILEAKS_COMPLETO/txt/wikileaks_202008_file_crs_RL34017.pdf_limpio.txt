amended authorizes the federal government to make grants to states and territories to provide vocational rehabilitation services to persons with disabilities who are interested in seeking employment state and territorial vocational rehabilitation agencies work with clients to determine their optimal employment outcomes and put together packages of services to help them meet these employment goals the authorization for the vocational rehabili tation program expired at the end of fy2003 congress has continued to make appropriations to the department of education to fund the program under the provisions of an extension clause in the rehabilitation act both chambers worked on bills in the 109th congress that would formally extend this authorization through fy2011 but these bills did not result in the enactm ent of law before the end of that congress reauthorization bills may be taken up by both chambers in the 110th congress money for vocational rehabilitation is allotted to states and territories according to complicated formula this formula does not take into account the size of states vocational rehabilitation caseload or its success at finding employment for its clients rather state vocational rehabilitation allotments are based on state allotments in fy1978 state population and state per capita income the allotment formula has been criticized for not suring that each state or territory is given an increase in funding to match increases in the co st of living in addition the formula has been criticized for not including measures related to states or territorys overall performance and for negatively affecting states that have seen large population growth since the mid1970s this report will be updated to reflect any major legislative activity

rehabilitation act of 1973 as amended authorizes the federal government to make grants available to states and territories for the purpose of providing vocational rehabilitation services to persons with disabilities who are seeking competitive employment1 grants may not be used to provide services connected with noncompetitive employment such as sheltered workshops or for jobs that pay below the minimum wage2 v ocational rehabilitation grants are administered by the rehabilitation services administration rsa an agency of the department of education and can be used by designated state or territorial agencies to provide customized supports and services to persons with disabilities with the goal of providing these persons increased opportunities to secure competitive employment and selfsufficiency states and territories may establish single vocational rehabilitation agency referred to as combined agency or establish separate agencies to handle persons with general disabilities and persons with blindness states and territories are required to match portion of their federal grants and contribute 213 of the total cost of providing vocational rehabilitation services in fy2005 states and territories spent over 17 billion on vocational rehabilitation services 3 in 2005 state and territorial vocational rehabilitation agencies worked with nearly 14 million clients and helped over 206000 persons with disabilities achieve employment 4 the authorization for vocational rehabilitation grants to states and territories expired at the end of fy2003 and congress has continued to make capped appropriations to fund the program under the provisions of extension clause in the law the house of representatives and senate each passed bills to reauthorize the vocational rehabilitation program in both the 108th and 109th congresses however these efforts did not become law it is likely then that the reauthorization of the vocational rehabilitation program will be on the agenda of the 110th congress this report provides an overview of the vocational rehabilitation program including discussions on the eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services the types of services provided by state and territorial vocational rehabilitation agencies and the requirements concerning state plans and funding matches that states and territories must meet in order to qualify for federal grants this report also discusses the current authorization for vocational rehabilitation grants and recent legislative attempts to extend this authorization in addition this report describes the formula used to determine each state and territorys allotment of vocational rehabilitation funds several issues surrounding this formula including problems stemming from the use of fy1978 allotments as baseline are analyzed this is the first in series of three reports on vocational rehabilitation under development by the congressional research service during the first session of

significant disabilities even though these people by nature of the significance of their disabling conditions may be the least likely people to become employed after receiving services another future

that used by the social security disability programs in order to receive vocational rehabilitation services person does not need to be eligible for or have applied for social security disability insurance ssdi or supplemental security income ssi7 however section 102a3 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 specifies that any person receiving ssdi or ssi benefits shall be presumed to be eligible

rehabilitation agency feels that it will not have enough resources during given fiscal year to provide services to all eligible persons with disability then it must notify the rsa that it will implement an order of selection plan to determine which persons will have the first priority to receive services regulations require that the order of selection plan must ensure that persons with the most significant disabilities will be able to receive services before other eligible persons 10 other persons not placed in the priority group may be placed on waiting list but are not guaranteed services state or territorial agency is given certain degree of latitude in determining how it will set up its order of selection system and neither the rehabilitation act of 1973 nor the cfr provide firm requirements on how agencies should determine which persons have the most significant disabilities11 while ssdi and ssi beneficiaries are presumed to be eligible for vocational rehabilitation services they may not be deemed to have the most significant disabilities by their state or territorial vocational rehabilitation agency in such case it would be possible for state to deny vocational rehabilitation benefits to persons receiving benefits from social security disability program if ssdi or ssi recipient is participant in the ticket to work program but deemed not eligible for vocational rehabilitation services because of an order of selection rule he or she would not be able to use ticket to work voucher to pay for vocational rehabilitation services from state or territorial agency and would be required to obtain services from private sector employment network 12 states and territories may implement order of selection plans at the beginning of fiscal year or during fiscal year if it becomes likely that they will not be able to provide services to all eligible persons for fy2007 41 of the 80 state and territorial vocational rehabilitation agencies are

consistently called for changes in the formula and the senate has twice attempted to pass legislation that would require the comptroller general to investigate the formula the issues raised by advocacy groups and congress fall into the following four general categories first the current formula does not take into account states ability to pay its share of the funding or spend its allotment and as result states frequently return unspent funds to the rsa for reallotment second the increase in the cpiu that affects the total appropriation is not always passed on to each state or territory as result some states and territories do not receive an increase in funding to keep pace with increased costs due to inflation third the current funding formula does not account for the size of states caseload or its success at rehabilitating clients and assisting them in finding and keeping competitive employment fourth the current formulas use of state or territorys 1978 allotment as baseline lessens the impact of states population on its allotment and tends to negatively affect states with large population growth since 1978

territorys vocational rehabilitation allotment is based on its allotment in 1978 its per capita income and its population the size of state or territorys vocational rehabilitation caseload or its success at returning portion of this caseload to the workforce are not part of the allotment formula and are not factor in determining how much money state or territory will have available for vocational rehabilitation services because the size of state or territorys caseload is not part of the allotment formula state and territorial vocational rehabilitation agencies are often unable to provide services for persons that want them currently more than half of all state vocational rehabilitation agencies are operating under orders of selection which require that they establish waiting lists for vocational services and provide services to persons determined to have the most significant disabilities nearly 40000 persons with disabilities seeking vocational rehabilitation services are currently waiting on these lists in addition to disregarding the size of state or territorys vocational rehabilitation caseload the allotment formula does not take into account state or territorys performance in returning clients to the workforce and helping them maintain comp etitive employment as result the department of education is left without possible tool to encourage compliance with established performance standards and has way to reward state or territorial agencies that are successful at returning clients to the workforce section 107c of the rehabilitation act of 1973 does give the secretary of education the ability to withhold vocational rehabilitation funding from any state or territory that is not in compliance with its published state plan or that is falling below the performance standards established by the department of education for the vocational rehabilitation program however despite the fact that the government accountability office gao identified two cases in fy2003 in which vocational rehabilitation agencies failed to meet these performance standards the department of education has never withheld funding from state or territorial vocational rehabilitation agency because of performance 40 the gao cited the inability of the department of education to establish means to reward successful vocational rehabilitation agencies with increased funding as part of the agencys overall inability to properly monitor and manage the performance of the state and territorial vocational rehabilitation agencies that it provides funding to41 in addition the senate recognized this shortcoming in the current law and section 421 of s 1021 in the 109th congress provided authorization for the department of education to provide incentive grants to states that demonstrated success at returning persons with disabilities to the workforce42 in its report on s 1021 the senate committee on health education labor and pensions stated 40 government

allotment formula is its use of states 1978 allotment as baseline for all current and future allotments while the formula also considers states per capita income and population these variables only affect states share of the excess amount the difference between the total appropriations for the current fy and the total appropriations for fy1978 for fy2007 the excess amount makes up 73 of the total vocational rehabilitation appropriation meaning that 27 of the total appropriation is not affected by the allotment formula but rather is distributed to match each state and territorys fy1978 allotment45 in order to analyze the impact of the 1978 baseline on the vocational rehabilitation allotment formula each state and territorys fy2007 allotment is estimated using modified formula that does not take into account state or territorys allotment in fy197846 table d1 in appendix d shows each state and territorys estimated allo tment for fy2007 under this modified formula and the difference between these amounts and the actual lotments in this table states with positive differences between their actual and modified llotments are benefitting from the current formula and its use of the fy1978 allotment as baseline while states with negative differences are not benefitting from this formula an analysis of the modified allotment formula as compared to the actual fy2007 state allotments shows that states with the largest increases in population from 1976 until 2005 also had the largest reductions due to the use of the fy1978 baseline to actual allotments nevada the state with the largest population growth also had the largest difference in allotments and of the five states with the largest differences in allotments four were also among the top five states in

reauthorization of the vocational rehabilitation program efforts to reauthorize the program wit hout significant changes to the allotment formula or other aspects of the program were unsuccessful in the 108th and 109th congresses if congress does consider reauthorization in 2007 or 2008 it may want to consider making changes to several parts of the vocational rehabilitation program possible areas for reform include the definition of disability used and the order of selection rules that give preference to persons with the most severe disabilities even those this group may be the least likely to return to work this issue is expected to be addressed in future congressional research service report in addition congress may wish to consider some method for increasing the overall success rate of the vocational rehabilitation program currently the rsa has very little ability to give states and territories incentives to improve the return to work rate of their vocational rehabilitation clients or to punish states that fail to meet established expectations for vocational rehabilitation agencies the senates reauthorization bill in the 109 th congress did include program of authorization grants that could be used to reward states that demonstrate success at returning clients to the workforce the overall effectiveness of the vocational rehabilitation program is to be examined in future congressional research service report in its previous two attempts at vocational reauthorization the senate has recognized some of the shortcomings of the allotment formula discussed in this report in both the 108th and 109th congress the senate reauthorization bills would have required the gao to study the vocational allotment formula as demonstrated in this congressional research service report the current formula fails to account for state or territorys ability to pay its share of the costs of vocational rehabilitation or its caseload in addition this report has shown that the current formula does not ensure that funding increases due to changes in the cost of living are passed along to individual states and territories the formula also does not take into account state or territorys success at returning vocational rehabilitation clients to work finally this report has shown the impact of the allotment formula on the vocational rehabilitation funding levels of states that have seen significant population growth since the 1970s each of these concerns with the allotment formula are areas that the house and senate may consider as they prepare to consider reauthorization of the vocational rehabilitation program in the 110 th congress 47 the statistical analyses yielded pearsons product moment correlation coefficient of 07449 and spearmans rank order correlation coefficient of 06968 both coefficients were significant at the level of p00001 these statistical tests measure the correlation between states population growth and the difference between its current and modified allotments but they do not necessarily indicate causal relationship between these variables additional information on the statistical analyses is av ailable from the author of
