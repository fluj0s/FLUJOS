of commenters wanted congress either to maintain or increase the amount of funding available for the tanf block grant there was concern that although welfar reform has succeeded in promoting work jobs have failed to end poverty for some fa milies and have not been possible for others because of personal barriers advocates for lowincome families tended to urge substantial change intanf many wanted to impose more mandates on states they wanted congress to require states to provide cer tain services to certain groups and to adopt certain procedures some proposed repeal of existing ineligibility

ealed the previous aid to fa milies with dependent children afdc program and replaced it with block grant to states for temporary assistance for needy families tanf1 this landmark legislation required that federally funded cash assistance be timel imited and c onditioned on work but also gave states great flexibility in the design of their welfare programs tanf funding was authorized and appropria ted only for six years and expired at the end of fy2002 however congress has tinued the program and its funding at fy2002 levels through series of temporar extensions efforts to enact long term reauthorization of welfare reform began during the second session of the 107th congress and remain an agenda item for the 109th congress during the 108th congress the house and the senate finance committee each passed different versions of longterm reauthorization bill hr 4 but final action occurred2 the tanf block grant is administered at the federal level by the department of health and human services hhs du ring the fall of 2001 in preparation for the debate on reauthorization of tanf hhs solicited public input through two mechanisms first hhs officials conducte d series of regional listening and discussion sessions to which state and local officials and welfare recipients were invited to share their views about imple menting and improving tanf programs wade horn assistant secretary for children and families led these sessions in atlanta chicago dallas philadelphia new york san francisco and washington dc meeting with tribal representatives also was held in san francisco in addition in the october 17 2001 federal register hhs formally invited members of the public to submit comme nts through november 30 2001 either through the mail or electronically through specially created website as stated in the federal register the departments primary inte rest was gathering input about the tanf provisions of the 1996 welfare re form legislation however many other federal programs such as the food stamp program the child ca re and development fund child welfare and child support enfo rcement serve the same needy families as tanf and provide rela ted benefits some of these programs are facinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31371crs2 3readers should go to the current legislativ issues section on the crs home page click on social policy and then on welfare for

will also accept comments on program coordination issues precise count of unduplicated comme nts received by hhs or of the individuals and organizations who submitted them is not obtainable several groups led organize d campaigns and generated hundreds of comments some of which were easily identifiable as part of an organized campaign while others were not the following numbers are offered to give sense of the scope of the tanf comments project through the specia lly created hhs website nearly 700 comments were submitted some may have been duplicates others may have been submitted on different topics by the same individual or organization almost another 4000 comments were s ubmitted through the mail or by other means email hand delivery of these about 3000 re sulted from organized campaigns for example an organization called network national catholic social justice lobby brought in more than 2000 comments other groups that organized comment campaigns included the childrens defense fund grassroots organizing for welfare leadership midwest partners influencing state policy and the welfaretowork partnership this report presents summary of the comments that were received by hhs in response to the departments request and is intended to convey general sense of the views and opinions expressed the repor t begins with an explanation of the methodology used for preparing this summa ry and discussion of the categories of groups and individuals who submitted comme nts followed by general overview of the comments themselves the balance of the report presents summary of the comments organized by topic only limited background information is included on the current law provisions which may be th subject of comments readers should consult other crs reports for background information on tanf law and related programs and for the status of current legislation3 methodology this report summarizes the tanf reauthorization comments by focusing on three major questions who made the comments to place the comments in some perspective it is necessary to descri be who made them what were the most common comments and legislative recommendations who said what what were various types of organizations or individuals interested in were there differences in the types of concerns and recommendations made by different groupshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31371crs3 team of congressional research service crs analysts categorized information about the commenters and th eir comments and entered them into database the comments are qualitative in nature that is they are in essay form and varied widely in both style and conten t though the database afforded analysts structure for categorizing the comments their varied natu re often required crs analysts to exercise considerable judgment categorizing the commenters those making comments were categorized into groups for example ected officials national advocacy organizations local advocacy organizations faithbased groups etc additionally comments and recommendations were received by numbe r of organizations that are nonpartisan research organizations but which expresse d point of view such as the heritage foundation and the center for budget and policy priorities these organizations were placed in their own cat egory researchadvocacy distinction also was made if an organization was invol ved in delivering services to families see appendix table a2 for list of the categories used in this report additionally commenters were categorized by thei r geographical affiliation national organizations were identified as such and organizations at the state and local level were identified by their state the categorization of many commenters pr oved to be difficult some of those making comments identified themselves with an organization but it was unclear whether they were speaking for the organization with mailed comments it could reasonably be determined that those written on letterhead and signed by an official represented the organizations point of vi ew however it was much more difficult to discern whether comments submitted through the internet represented an organizations point of view or an i ndividuals opinion additionally comments submitted through the internet often did not contain enough information to identify commenter as belonging to particular category therefore relatively large number of commenters were classified either as general public or unknown categorizing the comments the comments themselves were also categorized crs primarily focused on legislative recommendations made by the commenters ie those statements that signaled change in policy that could be made by amending federal w however judgment was often required to determine whether comment was making legisla tive recommendation or expressing more general point of view about welfare policy moreover since hhs solicited comments from the public and not just legislative recommendations an attempt was made to capture the flavor of the comments in addition to their recommendations many comments included numerous gislative recommendations each recommendation was placed in the appropriate topical category that is comment from single individual or organization c ould have been entere d into the database under several different cat egories see appendix table a1 for listing of the categories why there are counts of comments though each comment was tallied in the crs database this report does not provide exact numbers of specific comments or recommendations for legislative change it was determined that any attempt to quantify the comments or r ecommendations would pose problems somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31371crs4 comments represented large organizations potentially reflecting the views of many people and some represented individua l views there is objective way to weight such diverse commenters furt her large number of comments were made through organized letterwriting campaigns and again there was objective way to give weight to these comments without ither skewing the results in the direction of those comments generated by letterwriting campaigns or devaluing comments made through such campaigns instead for each particular issue the report presents the scope of the recommendations made as well as the suggestions that were more or less popular among the commenters brief description of the commenters the many persons and groups who re sponded to the hhs call for comments represented selfselected group those who made comments were aware of the opportunity to comment from the federal register notice the hhs press release and each other furthermore for various reasons they were sufficiently interested in the future of tanf to participate in the process many of them had close experience with tanf and had come to some conclusions about how it should be changed if at all though the commenters were selfselecte d they did come from wide range of organizations and backgrounds some of the organizations that commented are familiar from previous debates on welfare reform and have been asked for and given testimony before congress on welfare issues however others who commented were less connected to past federal legislative debates and are active mainly at the state and local level comments on tanf reauthorization were received from elected officials comments were received from several united states senators state legislators and fe w governors moreover there were comments from organizations that represent elected officials among them the national governors asso ciation nga national conference of state legislators ncsl and the us conference of mayors state and local human resource agencies and service deliverypractitioners the american public human services association aphsa and numerous state human resource agencies submitted comments and legislative recommendations these public agencies administer or supervise the administration of tanf at the state level and aphsa is their national advocacy organization in addition there were comments from local human services agencies as well as numerous comments from community service organizations including child care referral agencies comments were also received from the national council of ch ild support directors the national association of social workers and the national association of black social workers national advocacy organizations comments came from national advocacy organizations representing particular constituencies or views comments were received from groups such as the child rens defense fund cdf planned parenthood federation of america the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp national organization forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31371crs5 women now legal defense and edu cation fund national urban league childrens rights council the amer ican bar association and others state and local advoc acy organizations relatively large share of comments came from private state and local advocacy organizations unlike many of the national advocacy organizations which commented on welfare reauthorization while expr essing views on wide ra nge of issues state and local advocacy organizations often were more narrowly focused for example there were several comment s from organizations concerned about protection treatment and services for victims of domestic violence there were also organizations that appeared to focus on tanf reauthorization as their single issue for example washingtons tanf reauthorization campaign the utah reauthorization pr oject few indian tribes made comments faithbased organizations comments were made by both national and local faithbased advocacy and servi ce groups national faithbased groups that made comments included the us conference of catholic bishops evangelical lutheran church in america united jewish communities catholic charities usa nd the national catholic social justice lobby number of comments came from local chapters of catholic charities and local dioceses research organizations comments were received from number of research organizations that tend also to make policy recommendations such organizations included the center on budget and policy priorities cbpp center on law and social policy cla sp the heritage foundation and the progressive policy institute additionally comments were received from professors at universities and students of social work the general public some commenters did not identify themselves as members of any organization some of these comments were likely made by members of the general public few identified themselves as being former recipients fairly large numbe r of comments did not have enough information to identify the commenter with particular organization though the comment might reflect the view of an organization or may have been part of letterwriting campaign overview of comments comments on tanf reauthorization reached hhs in many forms and sizes format was prescribed list of subjects for comment was given some persons submitted long ssay responses mming up their appraisal of tanf achievements and failings some gave long lists of ideas for change some just paragraph some urged comprehensive pr oposals that dealt not only with tanf but with related programs and services it can be assu med that most wrote about what concerned them most reading this outpouring of freeform suggestions about the next round of welfare reform gives this general picturehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31371crs6 because of welfare i was able to work part time and raise my daughter in healthy happy and safe environment our home please make welfare work to ensure lowincome families can work their way out of poverty former welfare motherall categories of commenters wanted congress either to maintain or increase the amount of funding available for the tanf block grant there was concern that although welfar reform has succeeded in promoting work jobs have failed to end povert for some families and have not been possible for others because of personal barriers advocates for lowincome families tended to urge substantial change intanf many wanted to impose more mandates on states they wanted congress to require states to provide cer tain services to certain groups and to adopt certain procedures some proposed repeal of some existing ineligibility rules on the other hand represen tatives of states and statecounty welfare departments generally wanted to keep maximum flexibility to design and operate tanf among commenters on work and time limit rules there wa s strong support for allowing more education and training to be treated as work activities and for suspending the time limit for some persons and under some circumstances child care was widely seen as nece ssary work support and child support as needed source of family income summary of comments on tanf goals and philosophy basic philosophy and program goals attr acted very large block of comments on tanf outnumbered only by co mments on funding and the time l imit majority of the philosophic commenters ur ged that poverty reduction be added as program goal or purpose typical remark was that tanf should strive to reduce poverty not caseloads s upport for ma king poverty reduction an explicit program goal came from advocacy organizations fa ithbased groups research groups some elected officials state legislators u s senators human service agencies community service organizations students of social work and members of the general public including two former welf are recipients few commenters said there should be federal obligation to serve families in need and several said tanfs overall purpose should be expressed as promoting the wellbeing of children and families the next most common goal recomme ndation closely allied to the existing statutory goal of ending dependence on government benefits proposed self sufficiency as key tanf objective noting research findings that many extanf recipients have joined the working poor these groups often urged income supports and better jobs for them along with educa tion and training to enhance their earning capacity some states expressed views about the objectives of tanf one said it found reasonable the existing statutory statement of purposehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31371crs7 welfare reform has begun to improve the old welfare system by promoting work and responsibility these first few years of implementation however have demonstrated that there is much more that needs to be done to help lowincome families achieve selfsufficiency state welfare agencyto increase state flexibility in operating pr ograms designed to achieve 1 support of needy children in their own homes 2 an end to dependence on g overnment benefits 3 reduction or prevention of outofwedlock pregnancies and 4 promotion of the formation and maintenance of twoparent families one said tanf should maintain core elements including entitlement and continued focus on work another state said it would be seri ous mistake to take the focus off work and training remarks about the current family formation goals numbers 3 and 4 above disclosed disagreement most commenters favored efforts to reduce unwed pregnancy especially among teenagers but many opposed the current abstinenceonly education programs aimed at that goal instead favoring more comprehensive education on reproduction and birth control many commenters urged th at government be neutral regarding marriage sample comments gi ve their flavor government should not legislate morals or favor married couples the shift to promoting marriage is dangerous marriage is highly pe rsonal matter common view was summed up by county welfare directors permit but dont mandate marri age promotion on the other hand few respondents urged that portion of tanf funds be set aside for marriage promotion funding the most common recommendations cerned tanf funding in terms of sheer numbers more comments advocating ither maintaining or increasing funding were made than were made for any ot her legislative reco mmendation moreover recommendations not to cut funding or to increase tanf funds were made by all categories of commenters additionally th ere were large number of comments that advocated retaining or even expanding state flexibility in the use of grants retaining state flexibility was major concern of organizations representing state interests but it was theme in other comments as well basic funding levels the 1996 welfare reform law established basic 165 b illion annual block grant to states for fy1997fy2002 congress has continued the program at this funding level through series of shortterm extensions this amount was based on fe deral funding in the mid1990s for tanfs predecessor programs and is not adjusted for inflati on or for states needs the basic 165 billion block grant lost 15 of its value over the fy1997fy2004 period in addition to federal funds t anf programs receive fina ncial contribution from the states under maintenanceo feffort moe requirement like the basic block grant the required moe is based on historical expenditures in tanfs predecessor programs nationa l total of 104 bi llion the number of families receiving cash welfare declined by almost 60 fro m march 1994 to sept ember 2001 and has remained relatively constant through march 2004 but states have used their flexible tanf dollars to provide new types of rvices to welfare and other lowincome familieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31371crs8 even though tanf caseloads have fallen by 50 percent it is clear that the need for tanf supported services has not declined federal data reporting of the tanf caseload reflects only the number of families receiving tanf cash assistance in given state it does not include families that receive tanffunded child care employment and training counseling and other supportive non assistance services national association of state welfare agenciesa large number of those who commented called for increasing the tanf block grant for inflation this was recommendation of the american public human services association aphsa that was also reflected in many comments from state human services agencies as well as other organizations other national organizations that recommended adjusting the grant for infla tion included the childrens defense fund the national association of social workers and the child welfare league of america several senato rs governor lincoln lmond of rhode island the california legislature and the washington state legislature democratic caucus all called for adjusting the basic block grant for inflation others who commented suggested an uns pecified increase in funding some simply argued that funding needed to be maintained they countered arguments that the grant should be cut because of the dec line in the cash welfare caseload by noting the expansion of services beyond cash welf are that has occurred under tanf and the more disadvantaged caseload that remained many organizations and commenters who suggested maintaining or increasing federal tanf funding also recommended ma intaining the moe requirement at least at current levels some organizations including aphsa said that if the tanf block grant were adjusted for infla tion the moe requirement also should be increased few state human services agencies eg maryland followed the lead of aphsa on this point but many were silent virginia under the previous governors administration recommended that an moe ba sed on prior law caseloads be discontinued other grants in addition to the basic block grant tanf includes contingency fund to provide additional funding durin g recessions supplemental grants for certain states with high popula tion growth andor w historic federal funding per poor person and welfaretowork grant pr ogram to help localities provide employment services to certain tanf recipients and other groups including noncustodial parents these grants also were the subject of several comments although not to the degree that basic funding was discussed there was widespread sentiment that th ere should be tanf contingency fund to help states through recession furthe r there was sentiment that access to the contingency fund created by the 1996 law was t oo restrictive the most common proposal was to reduce the amount states n eeded to spend before they could access the fund additional comments requested that the fund be less restrictive but did not specify changes that should be made both supplemental grants and welfareto work grants were the subject of some comments but their constituency was rela tively narrow supplemental grants arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31371crs9 the four purposes of tanf along with the flexibility granted to states resulted in remarkable transformation of welfare programs with an economic downturn evident and caseloads on the rise the last thing states need is more prescriptive program keep the purposes and the flexibility member of the public further identification generally made to states in the south and interior west the west coast states of california oregon and washington did not r eceive supplemental grants most calls for renewing supplemental grants came from those states that r eceived them or from national organizations similarly there were relatively few calls to reinstate welfare towork grants these grants were generally administered locally rather than by the states the major national organization dvocating welfaretowork grant program was the us conference of mayors also supporting these grants was the national child support enforcement association ge nerally state organizations except the iowa department of human services wh ich recommended that they be continued and expanded were silent on whether welfaretowork grants should be renewed regarding additional tanf grants some commenters would establish new bonus for poverty reduction some would re vise the existing high performance bonus that rewards states for certain outcomes and some would eliminate or alter the existing bonus for reduc ing outofwedlock births see additional discussion of bonus funds under state accountability section below flexibility in the use of grants under current law states may expend tanf funds in any way reasonably calculate d to achieve the goals of the program states also may transfer up to 30 of the federal tanf grant to the child care and development fund and the social services block grant ssbg ssbg transfers are limited to 10 of the tanf grant this ce iling was set to decline to 425 starting in fy2001 but congress has maintained the 10 limit through annual appropriations laws states also may carry over funds without fiscal year limit but carriedover funds can only be used to provide assist ance essentially ongoing cash welfare to families common theme running through the reauthorization comments was maintaining state flexibility in the use of grants however some advocacy and public commenters did suggest particular uses of tanf funds and some even advocated legislative restrictions on the use of funds by states organizations representing the states often called for conti nuing the authority to transfer funds with the ssbg transfer limit set at 10 rather than 425 and earmarking of funds for specified purposes the ggestion that portion of tanf funds be setaside for promotion of marriage received more ne gative than positive comments including from advocacy organizations and others it was common to suggest that if congress wished to emphasize particular goal or set of activities additi onal funds rather than setasides from current funds should be provided the states and others sometimes sought more flexibility in the use of funds particularly asking for the ability to use carryover funds for any tanf activity instead of just cash welfare generally this was not opposed however the center on budget and policy priorities commented that states shouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31371crs10 have the ability to reserve only limited amount of tanf funds 50 of the block grant and be required to spend dditional grants within three years the states and advocacy groups sp lit on the issue of s upplantation ie use by states of federal tanf dollars for activities that are allowable under tanf law to achieve its broad goals but which were previously paid for with state funds large number of advocacy organizations nd commenters both national and at the state and local levels recommended legi slation to prohibit supplantation the states by and large opposed this effort as restriction of their flexibility in using tanf dollars there also were some general comment s about the use of funds particularly advocating an increased emphasis on the use of tanf for certain activities these comments were not always phrased as legislative recommendations and sometimes suggested that tanf be used for activities that are already allowable by law or commended states for using funds for thes activities for example there were comments on the expanded use of tanf funds for individual development accounts supplements to the earned income tax credit eitc economic development or job creation developmen t of model programs and services to address the needs of families with barriers to selfsufficiency few urged that tanf grants be allowed to fund foster care and adoption some suggested that tanf funds which now cannot be used fo r medical services be permitted for some medical services payable unde r medicaid such as beha vioral or mental health assessment several commenter s requested that treatment for alcohol and drug abuse be exempted from the defin ition of medical services to facilitate use of tanf funds for them one state said that tanf should pr ovide specific amount for intensive family development services program requirements federal law gives states flexibility in the design of their welfare programs within certain federal parameters for example the welfare law prohibits the use of federal funds to provide ong oing cash welfare to household with an adult who has received benefits for 60 months states may exempt up to 20 of their caseload from this time limit and they also may establish shorter time limits states also can use their own funds to serve recipients beyond the federal time limit states also establish their own eligibility rules however federal funds cannot be used to serve certain categories of individuals eg speci fied groups of noncitizens certain felons unwed parents under 20 unless they comply w ith certain requireme nts furthermore while states design their own programs fede ral law requires states to engage certain percentage of their caseload in work activities referred to as the work participation rules the law specifies which activitie s count toward this requirement and clearly emphasizes work first before ducation and training or other types of activities these and other program requirements were the subject of many comments some of which advocated additi onal federal requireme nts more extensive applicant screening for example in general these comments did not come from states or organizations representing states which tended to favor flexibility at the state levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31371crs11 time limits comments showed overwhelmin g support for liberalization of the current law fiveyear limit on federally f unded ongoing cash aid proposals included suspending the time limit for persons who comply with program requirements increasing the hardship ex emption from the current 20 of caseload limit requiring or allowing states to suspend the time limit for working recipients and allowing or requiring extensions in times of high unemployment some recommended that certain caregivers be categorically exempted from the time limit some proposed to prohibit state time limits shorter than 60 months and few proposed to lengthen the federal limit eligibility rules three categorical eligibility rules received comment the ban on federally funded tanf payments fo r immigrants during their first five years of residence discussed in more detail in the section on noncitizens below the prohibition on tanf for persons convicted of drugrelated felony unless the state opts out by state law and the ban on tanf aid to an unwed mother under age 20 who does not live with an adult with allowance for good cause exceptions those who commented recommended repeal of all these restrictions some also recommended that states be barred from imposing family cap on benefits paying benefit or reduced amount on behalf of new baby born into tanf family existing law is silent on this issue many urged that eligibility and benefit policies not be allowed to discriminate against applicants or twoparent families many proposed that the federal government requ ire that states pay specified minimum benefit and some proposed that states be required to base benefits on real need and to index them for inflation work rules the national governors association was among many commenters who urged that states should ve greater authority to determine work activities that are countable toward fe deral requirements among the numerous persons who commented on tanf work activities there wa s overwhelming support for allowing more human capital activities education and training to be credited toward the work participation requirements and for lifting restrictions on creditable vocational educational training under cu rrent law participation in education completion of high school nd vocational educational tr aining can account for more than 30 of persons credited with work and vocational educational training is countable only for 12 months nume rous persons urged that rehabilitative activities such as participation in treatment for substance abuse mental illness and domestic violence be counted as work activity many recommended that domestic duties caring for disabled or ill family member for example be treated as countable work activity further some ur ged that job search be countable activity for longer than six weeks rhode island and arizona said federa l work participa tion rates should be dropped utah called them administrativ ely burdensome and not instrumental to success virginia and new hampshire and the american public human services association said participa tion rates should be replaced by outcome measures of success another state suggested that pa rtial credit should be allowed for persons working fewer hours than the weekly min imum now 30 for most families some persons urged elimination of the higher participation rate for twoparent families 90 vs 50 for all families many commenters urged that participation rates be suspended or reduced for times and areas of high unemployment some urged thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31371crs12 all states must be required to implement mandatory screening and assessment for barriers to tanf participants especially those related to mental health subst ance abuse and domestic and sexual violence social work student recommendation of national advocacy organization campaignthe caseload reduction credit be ended or modified this credit reduces state work participation rates by on percentage point for each percent reduction from 1995 levels in the states averag monthly caseload its effect in 2002 was to lower to zero the effective participation rates in 21 states few commenters sought to have congress exempt certain persons parents with child under four with child under one with multiple barriers to work from both work requirements and the calculation of participation rates one state recommended that any persons exempted

not completed high school or obtained certificate of high school equi valency and is not attending secondary school on the basis of the assessment the state tanf agency has the option in consultation with the recipient to develop an individual re sponsibility plan for the recipient the manner in which assessments are performed varies across states for example some states simply have form for recipients to fill out others have an indepth questionnaire some have cas eworkers conduct cursory inte rviews with recipients while others use specialized staff such as substance abuse specialist to perform interviews many respondents proposed that states be required to screen all applicants assess their employability and determine whether they have barriers to employment the commenters usually mentioned the following as barriers to employment being victim of domestic or sexual violence mental health problems physical disabilities substance abuse problems and limited english profic iency many of the commenters also wanted to mandate that states provide th appropriate types of services to help recipients deal with their employment barriers many commenters maintained that caseworkers needed more specialized trai ning to properly screen recipients some suggested that qualified prof essionals be used to screen recipients and perform assessments in general the commenters supported requiring states to do more to protect vulnerable families with multiple barriers to employment they urged that states serve and protect the most vulnera ble and provide more help for those with severe work handicaps consistent w ith this concern many commenters wanted states to perform additional assessments before sanctioning family additional comments on this topic were mentioned by only

mana gement classes in general states have considerable flexibility in the design of their sanction policies eg size of the sanction ex emptions from sanctions etc most persons commenting on sanctions urged that congress prescribe sanctioning procedures some recommended that full family sanctions in which the entire cash grant is eliminated be pr ohibited at least for first violation most of the commenters maintained that recipients should be assessed or screened before sanctioning occurred these commenters genera lly said that states should be required to review cases and to acknowledge and address severe or multiple employment barriers before families are allowed to lose tanf benefits moreover some of these commenters argued that vulnerable families with severe work barriers should not be sanctioned as long as they are participating in program or receiving service to ameliorate their barriers many responde nts wanted to ensure that due process concerns eg timely notice reassessm ent fair and nondisc riminatory practices and opportunity for fair hearing were ad equately addressed be fore sanctions were imposed numerous responde nts supported expansion of the existing federal child

lack of transpor tation lack of quality child care and suffering from serious impairment substance abuse mental illness domestic violence or being in treatment fo r the impairment in contrast several commenters stated that strict sanctions such as full family sanctions are needed to ensure that families comply with program requirements one state welfare agency maintained that states should continue to have the right to design penalties as they see fithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31371crs14 additional comments on sanctions men tioned by only one or two groups or persons included support for funding of pr ograms to increase compliance and reduce the need for sanctions such as home visiting programs giving families more opportunities for compliance before sanction is actually imposed using protective payee approach rather than full family sanction ending sanctions immediately after family complies with program requirements and eliminating sanctions altogether treatment of special groups domestic violence victims some commenters urged that the protections for domestic violence victims under the f amily violence option now adopted by 44 tanf jurisdictions become mandatory and several proposed that states be required to adopt specific procedures fo r serving victims of domestic violence including counseling for noncustodial fa thers education on domestic and sexual violence and mandatory caseworker training teen parents few persons commented on teen parent rules but of those who did most favored ending the requirement that they live under adult supervision and some favored dropping the requirement that they attend school some proposed that the federal time clock not commence until these parents reach age 20 and one law center said states should have full authority to develop programs for teen parents mothers of young children various individuals suggested exempting mothers from work requirements for time after their youngest child reached age one the current outer limit in federal law the several proposal s were to lift the threshold to age one age three age four or age eight and in each case to exclude the exempted mothers from the calculation of work participation rates one person said all states should be required to adopt uniform age of youngest child at which the parent would be required to work nonparental caregivers among the persons commenting on rules and benefits for nonparental caregivers of tanf children all but one favored federal rule exempting the caregiv er from the time limit most also favored exempting the caregiver

r two bonuses one for reducing out ofwedlock births with reduced abor tion rates and high performance bonus there was little comment on the efficacy of providing bonuses as means of encouraging states to design programs to meet federal goals rather comments generally focused on support or opposition to particular bonuses or criteria for awarding bonuses as discussed in the section on progra m goals and philosophy one of the most common comments was to establish reduction in poverty as tanf goal many of those who made that recommendation also suggested that poverty reduction bonus be added to tanf few state groups ma this recommendation with the exception of new york which commented that an use of child poverty as measure of meeting program goals should be in positive framework such as performance bonus however recommendations for poverty reduction bonus came from the broad spectrum of those who sought to incorporate poverty reduction as goal of tanf national and state and local dvocacy organizations faithbased groups community service organizations nd members of the general public there were number of suggestions to abolish the current bonus for reducing outofwedlock births some suggested that these bonus funds be put to other uses for example the center on budget and policy priorities recommended replacing this bonus with fund to conduct research on po licies that could

related to specific criteria used to measure performance and award bonuses minnesotas department of human services suggested eliminating th measures that award part of the bonus based on coverage of the food stamp and medical assi stance programs number of commenters suggested adding additiona l measures to be rewarded such as employment in jobs that pay certain wage job advancement effectiveness of services for different groups eg racial ethnic groupspeople with disabilitieslow income communities and reductions in homelessness information and data reporting sharp divisions appeared in the comments between state groups and others w ho addressed the subject of information available about state programs and da ta reporting advocacy groups typically requested more information and more da ta states generally opposed adding to existing data reporting requirements and some suggested reducing existing requirements among the state human services agencies that commented additional reporting requirements were unanim ously and adamantly opposed there were calls to streamline and simplify existing reporting re quirements concerns about the impact of any additional reporting re quirements on state computer systems eg changes to large computer systems necessary to comply with requirements and desire that reporting also be sepa rately financed was voiced in the comments other commenters partic ularly advocacy organizations requested more information about state programs for example some commenters proposed that state tanf plans be required to include new provisions suggested as mandated plan provisions were procedures for civ il rights complaints description of how the state and the county in county plans will function as partner in the workforce investment act wia onestop

vocational rehabilitation agencies to be sure that tanf parents are assessed for hidden disabilities before being required to work and description of how states will assess the needs of kinship families the center on budget and policy prio rities suggested that the hhs annual report to congress include more detail on state program rules better reporting of how federal and state funds are spent was also requested by number of groups large number of commenters urged that stat make data publicly available with information provided by race and ethnicity to ensure that services are provided on an equitable basis administration number of additional comments related to state administration were received for example some persons said that states should be required to accept tanf

national state and local advocacy groups ddressed the need to ensure fair and equitable treatment of tanf recipients and applicants these comments concerned fair access to tanf benefits and services as well as equitable treatment for tanf recipients in general commenters sought to ensure that civil rights and labor law protections applied to tanf recipients and together they listed wide variety of conditions characteristics or statuses that they asserted should not be factor in access to or receipt of tanf benefits or services these include applicant or recipient status mental or physical disability marital stat us race gender ethnicity sexual orientation criminal record immigration status and primary language within the context of ensuring equitable access to all some commenters specifically mentioned the need for lang uageappropriate serv ices education and welfaretowork services that meet the needs of all tanf recipients many of these commenters also asked for greater attention to compliance with labor and civil rights laws as well as with the americans with disabilities act including specific data reporting on benefits and services provide d by race gender and other categories summary of comments on related programs child care many commenters focused on child care issues affecting lowincome families and provided recommendations w ith respect to the reauthorization of the child care and development fund ccdf as well as tanf4 both of these federal block grants support child care for lowincome families but only the ccdf is dedicated solely for that purpose5 as result recommendations for changes in funding and program requirements usually applied to the ccdf but not always in some cases commenters called specific attention to tanf s role in supporting child care services and suggested changes to the federal t anf law ie requiring that tanffunded child care meet the same health and safe ty standards of ccdffunded child care at the broadest level the comments reflected desire to improve the availability affordability and quality of child care the suggested means for achieving thosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31371crs18 funding for child care has fallen short of the true need waiting lists for child care programs are common and place our most vulnerable children in substandard care fund more slots and set higher income guidelines community service organizationimprovements generally involved making changes with respect to ccdf funding program requirements and data collection funding the most frequently submitted comment with respect to child care called for increasing ccdf funding ma ny commenters specifically recommended increasing the mandatory portion ccdf is funded through combination of mandatory and discretionary grants total ccdf funding ppropriated for fy2005 amounts to 4817 billion with the mandatory portion comprising 2717 billion these amounts have been roughly unchang ed since fy2002 commenters of all types expressed the sentiment that funding for child care has fallen short of the need and that increasing ccdf funding would he lp move toward serving all eligible children and help improve overall child care quality in addition to increasing the overall funding available for child care many commenters favored raising the percentage of ccdf funds that states are required to set aside specifically for promoting quality activities under current law 4 of ccdf funds must be dedicated for this purpose and many co mmenters expressed support for raising that percentage to 12 likewise severa l commenters advocated increasing the funding reserved for infant s and toddlers comments that deviated from promoting these setasides came from at least two organizations which while supporting an increase in overall funding oppose additional setasides in favor of greater state flexibility in their us of ccdf funds one researchadvocacy organization emphasized that while they do support providing additional resources for the quality setaside it should not redu ce the current level of funding available for actual child care slots aside from funding levels and setas ides number of commenters expressed support for simplifying ccdf rules for stat obligation and expenditure of funds by making the time periods for doing so identical regardless of ccdf funding stream program requirements most of the comments that called for changes in ccdf program requirements reflected those commenters lack of satisfaction with the availability of quality child care both during standard work hours and weekend and evening care numerous comments expressed the sentiment that one way to improve child care quality is to improve compensation for providers and to help them get additional education howe ver only few of those commenters mentioned dedicating specific funds for th is purpose ie setaside several individuals and organizations called for requiring that all providers receiving ccdf funds have training in childhood developm ent before caring for children moreover some commenters recommended using pr ovider payment rates as means of improving quality of care each of these commenters suggested the federal government require states to pay th full market rate as opposed to the 75th percentile suggested in ccdf regulations for child care and higher rates for care that is of higher quality limited supply for children with special needs and childrenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31371crs19 6 for comparison of child support provisions passed by the house and senate

communities with resp ect to the providers who receive public funds many commenters said that they shoul d be subject to at least two mandatory unannounced visits year several commenters recommended requi rement that every community have access to child care resource and referral agencies many comments also expressed support for simplifying the application and recertification process for parents the most common recommendation in this area was to require certification for ccdf subsidies more than once year so that the recertification process would be less likely to present barrier to receiving subsidies data collection those submitting child care comments overwhelmingly recommended additional funding citing need to improve child care availability affordability and quality ho wever many acknowledged lack of comprehensive national data to illustrate the needs they describe several comments included identical language calling for national data collection initiative to gather information on child care supply and dema nd as well as quality available to low income families tanffunded child care several commenters w ho addressed child care issues suggested two tanfrelated modifi cations the first alluded to earlier would require that the health and safety standards applicable to ccdf child care providers also apply to providers receiving funds directly from tanf under current law tanf funds transferred to the ccdf are required to be spent according to the ccdf rules but tanf funds spent for child care directly within the tanf program are not the second modification relating to tanf child care concerns the definition of assistance under tanf under current law tanf program requirements ie work requirements time limits are triggered when tanf money is spent on assistance as defined by hhs in regulati on whether child care is classified as assistance depends on the individual situ ation for example child care for working person is not assistance and woul d not trigger tanf requirements whereas child care for nonworking person such as cash welfare recipient in training program would be categorized as assist ance and thus trigger tanf requirements several commenters suggested that child care should not be c ounted as assistance under any circumstances child support enforcement6 most of the individuals or groups th at made comments on the child support enforcement cse program were intere sted in getting more child support to children they wanted child support collecti ons to be paid to former tanf families first before the state or federal governme nt could claim for their own expenses any child support arrearage payments as requi red under current law up to the amount of tanf benefits that had been paid to the familyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31371crs20 child support payments should benefit the child not the state or federal government one of the reasons that lowincome fathers do not pay child support or do not pay it on the record is because when their child receives tanf assistance their child support will be used to reimburse the state rather than to support the child national advocacy organization convene panel of noncustodial parentorganizations to seek their advice on how tanf cse child care and related programs can best serve them and their children mens advocacy organizationin addition they wanted some of the child support collected on behalf of current tanf families to be passed through to the families and disregarded in determining the familys tanf benefit amount some of these commenters stated that the current law requirements regarding the federal share should be eliminate d in other words they maintained that states should be able to pass through and disregard portion of child support collected on behalf of tanf family without having to re imburse the federal government most commenters did not put dollar amount or percentage on how much child support should be passed through and disregarded and only minor ity said all of the child support collected for tanf family should be passed through nd disregarded few commenters said that states should be rewarded with monetary incentives for providing more child support to tanf fa milies several comme nters suggested that the child support passed through and disreg arded should be counted as state moe funds or that tanf funds be used to help support the child support passthrough another frequent recommendation was to re peal the existing federal requirement that tanf applicants and recipients coopera in establishing paternity or obtaining support payments these commenters generally argued that if the custodial parent did not want to pursue child support it us ually was because of legitimate reason moreover several commenters wanted to eliminate the current law provision that requires tanf recipients to assign thei r rights to child support to the state several commenters mentione d financing of the cse system some wanted to maintain the current general federal matching rate of 66 of state expenditures on cse activities and the 90 federal matching rate for the laboratory costs of paternity establishment couple of commenters wanted the enhanced automated systems matching rate which was 80 of capped amount reinstated til october 2005 other commenters wanted 90 federal matching rate for costs associated with medical support few commenters wanted to eliminate or adjust the current law cap on incentive payments to the states which requires states to compete among each other for fixed amount of funds other comments which were raised by only few people called for additional funding for visitation programs in which noncustodial parents would have more access to their children the development of fatherhood programs requirement that unemployed noncustodial parents participate in welfarerelated work programs the tr ansfer of the administration of the cse program from the states

interaction between tanf and child welfare services generally children who receive tanf benefit and are cared for by nonparent relative eg grandparent or aunt would in the absence of this kin care be

nowrepealedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31371crs23 afdc program and federal foster care nd adoption assistance they recommended basing eligibility on childs need alone or letting states set their own income eligibility levels eg up to 200 of the federal poverty level some commenters also took the opportunity to call for greater funding or increased flexibility in the use of other child welfare funds recommenda tions included increased funding for the promoting safe and stable families program directing some federal spending from foster care and adoption assistance to more preventive child welfare services and modifying restrictions on certain funds to improve coordi nation between child welfare services and tanf other programs numerous commenters understood tanf as one component of

charitable choice section 104 of title i of the 1996 welfar law addresses serv ices provided under tanf by charitable religious or privat organizations commonly known as the charitable choice provision the stated purpose of this section is to allow states to use religious organizations as service pr oviders on the same basis as any other nongovernmental provider without impairi ng the religious character of such organizations and without diminishing th religious freedom of beneficiaries of assistance funded under such program10 although there were number of commenter s affiliated with c hurches or faith based service providers these groups did not often comment on the charitable choice provisions under tanf comments on char itable choice came fro m wide variety of individuals and groups most of whom had similar concerns about the provision in general commenters supported the protec tions currently afforded recipients under the charitable choice provision such as th prohibition against requiring religious observance to obtain servi ces but wanted system of oversight and increased protections to make sure that thes protections were being enforced in addition many of these commenters were concerned that under charitable choice federal tanf funds c ould be paid to employers who discriminate in hiring the current charitable choice provision llows religious organizations who are exempt from section 702 of the civil rights act of 1964 which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of religion to maintain their exempt status as service providers
