monitoring for claimants in level i asbesto srelated nonmalignant di sease and five years occupational exposure to asbestos to 11 million for claimants in level ix mesothelioma17 the bill would also allow claimants suffering from asbestosrelated injuries that cannot fit into one of the ne levels to seek compensation for their exceptional medical claims18 one of the more controversial aspects of the effort to reach legislative solution to the asbestos problem has been the question of smoking levels vii and viii of the tiered compensation scheme both deal with lung can cer and some have ex pressed concern that smoking may have contributed to ma ny of these claimants conditions19 as result the awards in levels vii and viii are pegged to each claimants smoking history in that non smokers would get higher awards than exs mokers who would get higher awards than smokers20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22081crs4 20 continued than 100 cigarettes or the equivalent of other t obacco products in

compensati on however would include only compensation paid by defendants insurers of defendants nd compensation trusts pursuant to judgments and settlements it apparently would not include payments from disability insurance health insurance medicaremedicaid etc26 another sticking point in the debate over previous asbestos bills has been the effect any legislative resolution woul d have on socalled mixed dus t ie silica and asbestos claims some have expressed concern that if these claims are not included in the legislation and therefore removed from the c ourts asbestos cla imants could avoid the administrative process by refiling their claims in court as mixed dust claims s 852 would remove silica claims from the courts to the bills administrative process unless those bringing such claims establish by preponderance of the evidence that exposure to silica caused their impairments and that asbestos did not significantly contribute to their impairments and submit specific
