secessionism in the northern soghd formerly leninabad region and in the western gorno badakhshan region and tensions between ethnic tajiks and uzbeks within tajikistan political and economic developments since the signing of the peace accords in 1997 rahmon has steadily increased his authoritarian rule and marginalized the opposition his ambit remains limited however by myriad local warlords the main tajik opposition groups boycotted the 1994 presidential election and referendum on new constitution because they had say in drawing up the constitution which establishes strong presidential rule and would not be allowed to field their own candidates the tajik legislature in mid1999 rubberstamped constitutional changes proposed by rahmon calling for seven year presidential term twohouse supreme assembly legislature and the legalization of religious parties crs5 popular referendum approved the changes and presidential election was set for november 1999 tajik opposition candidates alleged that government harassment prevented them from registering so that rahmon emerged as the only approved candidate the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce refused to monitor the election seeking to avert renewed war nuri agreed to respect the outcome of the election in return for pledges by rahmon to allow fair legislative elections scheduled for february 2000 osce monitors later reported that this election presented voters with range of candidates from competing parties but they raised questions about freedom of the media the independence of electoral commissions turnout figures and the transparency of vote tabulation legislative electoral law was approved with input from the uto in late 1999 calling for lower chamber the assembly of representatives to consist of 63 members 22 elected by party list and 41 in single member districts and an upper legislative chamber the national assembly to consist of 34 members representing regional interests 25 selected by indirect voting by local council assemblies eight appointed by rahmon and one reserved for the former president another referendum on changes to the constitution was held in june 2003 opposition critics correctly predicted that one of the changes limiting president to two sevenyear terms would permit rahmon to claim two more terms in office under the new amendment the four main opposition parties are the irp democratic party dp social democratic party sdp and communist party cp the cp sometimes has allied itself with the ruling peoples democratic party pdp about 160 candidates mostly pdp members ran for the district seats in the february 27 2005 election to the assembly of representatives the osce reported largescale irregularities including the presence of government officials on many electoral commissions close government control of campaigning ballot box stuffing and doubtful ballot counting after runoff races in march the pdp had won 51 seats the cp 5 the islamic revival party 2 and independents 5 selection of deputies to the national assembly in late march 2005 resulted in 29 seats for the pdp 2 for the cp and 3 for independent candidates five candidates ran in the presidential election in tajikistan held on november 6 2006 including incumbent president rahmon all four challengers praised rahmon and campaigned little the opposition dp and sd parties boycotted the race claiming it was undemocratic and the irp chose not to field candidate rahmon officially received 793 of 288 million votes with nearly 91 turnout according to osce observers the race was slightly improved over the 1999 presidential election but still lacked genuine choice and meaningful pluralism including because of the dearth of meaningful debate by the candidates improbable turnout figures in some precincts use of administrative resources and nontransparent votecounting5 according to the state departments country reports on human rights practices for 2007 released in march 2008 the governments human rights record remained poor arbitrary arrest and detention remained serious problems and police and security officers beat and otherwise abused detainees to extort confessions authorities often falsified 5 osce office for democratic institutions and human rights final report on the 6 november 2006 presidential election in

did not suffer reprisals the government continued to refuse to register some opposition political parties religious freedom deteriorated during the year authorities at times restricted muslim religious activities trafficking of persons was serious problem reportedly government officials in customs border control immigration police and tourism took bribes from traffickers or even acted as patrons of traffickers the government did not enforce child labor laws and continued to force students to pick cotton in late 1997 tajikistans economic decline reversed as the peace accord took hold
