finance division summary several types of savings ar eligible for beneficial treatment under the individual income tax and individual retirement accounts iras ve received considerable attention pension savings are actually more important in rms of revenue loss there are other investments that ar treated favorably as well the president has proposed in succession of budgets to significantly expand iras effects of these provisions on savings are uncertain and spite dollar limits on contributi ons and income phase outs iras tend to benefit high er income individuals description of tax treatment several types of i nvestments are preferentially tr eated under the individual income tax including individual retir ement accounts iras pensi ons capital gains dividends owner occupied housing and life insurance policy earnings there are two types of iras that have the effect of exempting investment earnings from tax the traditional deductible ira and the roth ira for the deductible ira also called frontloaded ira contributions are deducted when made and withdrawals are taxed this treatment is similar to the treatment of pensions eligibility for the deductible ira is phased out as income increases for individuals who are active participants in employer pension plans individuals above the income phaseout can make nondeductible c ontributions with earnings taxe d when withdrawn which allows deferral but not elimination of taxes there are penalties for early withdrawal and mandatory distribution requirements as described above iras were treated the same way as pension plans with contributions deductible and withdrawals taxable the roth ira also called back loaded ira was added as an option in 1997 when eligibility for both types of iras was expanded the tax treatment of this account is s imilar to that of tax exempt bond earnings are simply not taxed the earnings phaseouts are higher and treatment is inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22019crs2 1 see joint committee on taxation estimates of federal tax expenditures for 20072011 jcs 307 washington dc us government printing office september 24 2007general more generous than in the case of the deductible ira the annual deduction limit for ira contributions when expanded in 1997 was th lesser of 2000 or 100 of compensation that limit was increased unde r the temporary provisions of the 2001 tax cut and eventually made permanent at 5000 the 2001 act also introduced tax credit for contributions by low income individuals favorable tax treatment of pensions namely allowi ng the firm to deduct contributions which are not included in em ployees income and exempting the earnings of pension trusts as in the case of deductible iras has been in place almost since the inception of the tax law pensions fall into two types defined benefit plans where payments depend on earnings and years of serv ice at retirement nd defined contribution plans where payments depend on the amount accumulated in an account pensions are subject to many rules and regulations designed to ensure that tax benefits do not accrue to owners and highly compensa ted managers and that pension trusts are adequately funded in the case of defined benefit pl ans of course to the extent that pension assets or ira assets are invested in corporate stock tax is collected at the corporate level tax benefits for pension plans are much more important in dollar terms than are tax benefits for iras for fy2009 according the latest joint committee on taxation jct estimates employer pensions resulted in revenue loss of 1204 billion with plans for selfemployed individuals ca lled keogh plans costing 95 billion iras resulted in loss of 185 billion1 in the case of dividends about lf of the income is not subject to tax because of tax preferred status there are other savings and investments th at receive favorable treatment under the individual income tax capital gains has hist orically been favorably treated both through lower tax rates deferral taxed only when r ealized and forgivene ss of tax if passed on at death dividends are also now eligible for lower tax rates of course earnings on corporate stock are taxed under the corporat tax owner occupied housing is also favorably treated because imputed rent is not included in income and earnings on investments in life insurance policies are deferred and when passed on via death benefits exempt from tax these tax benefits are significant as well lower rates for capital gains and dividends are estimated by the jct to lose 1310 billion in fy2009 the failure to tax gains at death 575 billion and the deferral of gain for gifts 59 billion while there is not separate estimate for excluding imputed rent the value of deducting costs even though gross rent is not included in inco through itemized deductions is 852 billion for mortgage interest and 142 billion for propert taxes the exemption of most capital gains on homes is estimated to cost 301 billi on the value of deferral and forgiveness of earnings on life insurance policies is 275 billion httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22019crs3 2 for itemizers such contributions would be ductible so the provision would not matter for them it would matter for nonitemizers and also because there are some limits on itemizwed deducitons for very large contributions relative to income it could also affect the taxation of social security benefits which are determined by adjusted gross income 3 see crs report rl32228 proposed savings accounts ec onomic and budgetary effects by jane g gravelle and maxim shvedov for an economic analysis of this proposal recent legislative activity iras were expanded by the 2001 tax bill hr 1836 which was signed into law on june 7 2001 ira limits increased to 3000 in 2002 4000 in 2005 and 5000 in 2008 with indexation afterwards individual 50 nd over had an extra 500 increase in 2002 and will have 1000 increase in 2008 this bill also increased contribution limits for pension plans including 401k plans because of budget rules the tax cuts in this bill were sunsetted in 2010 but the increased limit was made permanent by the pension protection act of 2006 the pension protec tion act also allowed rollover of ira amounts to charity for those aged 70 and ½ without incurring tax effects2 this provision expired after 2007 but may be reinst ated along with other extenders president bush proposed in his fy2004 through fy2009 budget plans to eliminate the deductible ira form his proposal woul d rename the roth iras as retirement savings accounts rsas and also low lifetime savings accounts lsas3 the contribution limits would be greatly increas ed to 5000 for each type of account under the most recent proposal and the income limits would be eliminate d individuals could roll over existing accounts into these new account s by paying tax on the rollovers which would increase revenue in the short run the test proposal is expected to initially gain and then lose revenue with loss in the nth year of 5 billion in the long run the provision would cost much more his proposal would also combine variety of employer savings accounts into single account and simplify the rules designed to prevent discrimination in favor of highly compensa ted employees this proposal might form part of an the presidents proposal for fundamental tax reform the enron scandal and the slow recovery of the economy led to legislative proposals regarding pensions in the 107th congress that did not see completion and were not addressed in the 108th congress however the pensi on protection act of 2006 eventually provided variety of revisions and lib eralizations of pension policy issues the original rationale for iras first intr oduced in 1962 was to provide parity with individuals covered by employer pensions ir as were made univers ally available in 1981 with the primary rationale to encourage savings income limits that disallowed deductible ira coverage for most individuals were adopted as part of the base broadening in the 1986 tax reform act the 1997 legislation in creased these limits and introduced roth iras all but the very high income indi viduals and couples now have access to iras httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22019crs4 4 see crs report rl30255 individual retirement acc ounts iras issues and proposed expansion by thomas l hunger for jane g gravelle for further discussion of savings and distributional effects of irasthere has been considerable debate among economists about the effect of iras on savings some statistical studies have f ound powerful savings eff ects of iras and have argued that advertising of the tax benefit s caused people to save others have disputed the evidence from those studies and argued that there is historical evidence of an ira savings effect and that econo mic theory does not support such an effect still others have argued that iras are less important in increasing overall savings than the more generous thrift savings accounts eg 401k pl ans provided through employers although the dollar contribution ceilings and income limits on iras keep the provision from providing benefits to very high income individuals iras do generally benefit welloff individuals w ho are more likely to save4 the evidence that lower taxes on the return to investments increase savings in general is mixed income and substitution effects which in the one case lower and the other case raise savings may net out to little or effect and most simple evidence suggests that savings rates do not change very much as tax rules change although there has been trend downward in private savings rates
