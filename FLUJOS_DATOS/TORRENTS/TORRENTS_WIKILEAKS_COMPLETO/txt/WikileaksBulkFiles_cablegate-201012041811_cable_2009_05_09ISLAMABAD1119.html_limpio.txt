hour conversation with ambassador may 23 chief of army staff general kayani told ambassador he was desperate for helicopter support as he had only five mi17s operational kayani insisted that pakistani technicians were capable of doing required helicopter maintenance there are two ways for the pakistani military to acquire additional helicopters relatively quickly 1 lease and we understand waiver to enable the usg to lease mi17s now needs only congressional notification and 2 procurement through pakistans fmf account which also requires waiver we expect pakistan to prefer the first option post acknowledges the frustration of dealing with the pakistani military but it is critical to our interests that they receive help as soon as possible to clear swat and move on the waziristans the heart of crossborder operations against us forces in afghanistan post recommends that we request expedited congressional notification of the mi17 waiver in the meantime we continue to seek cobra helicopter spare parts end summary and action request 2 c in two hour conversation may 23 septel chief of army staff general kayani told ambassador he was desperate for helicopter support he said he could not move against north and south waziristan until he had more lift at that moment he said he had five mi17s operational this is lower number than others have told us as has been previously reported kayani wanted us support to lease mi17 helicopters and he needed spare parts for the cobra helicopters ambassador said she wanted to clear the air about some of the offers of us assistance that had gone unanswered such as the helicopter maintenance contract and the isr platform 3 c kayani said he did not need us help on maintenance the cobras were twentyfive years old and had been maintained by pakistani technicians but he needed the us government to stop the constant stream of leaks from washington these always made it appear as if he were taking steps in response to us demands he said he had been successfully moving troops from the eastern border but this was undermined by the drumbeat in the us press that he was taking this action in response to us demands the us he said is always trying to press on him sophisticated us systems which the pakistani military had neither the ability nor the funds to manage domestic political support for current combat operations would be eroded by bigger us military presence he said 4 c embassy understands that the iran north korea and syria nonproliferation act inksna waiver that enables the usg potentially to procure or lease mi17s has just been approved by the department and the only remaining hurdle is the congressional notification the notification process needs to be expedited the mission is considering options to assist pakistan army in procuring or leasing mi17s if the supplemental is passed our preferred option is to use the pakistan counterinsurgency capabilities fund pccf to lease nine mi17s us controlled lease of this kind allows us to include necessary maintenance which any contractor is likely to stipulate and provides leverage over use of the helicopters in order to ensure the helicopters are applied in counterinsurgency activities the nine mi17s the pakistanis have requested would be leased for the duration of ongoing overhauls of nine pakistan army mi17s and would in effect be 1for1 backfill of those helicopters in overhaul 5 c alternately if the supplemental is not passed in time the mission can advise the gop to use its fmf to buy or lease mi17 helicopters if the gop chooses to use its fmf for this purpose the mission will need to obtain an offshore procurement osp waiver from dod with state department and department of treasury concurrence and an agreement with the gop specifying the conditions on how they intend to use these new mi17 helicopters the terms of the agreement will specify use of the helicopters in support of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency coin operations in the federally administered tribal areas the northwest frontier province and portions of balochistan further if purchase the agreement will require comprehensive islamabad 00001119 002 of 002 maintenance and logistics package in conjunction with the helicopters 6 c finally we will require access to the helicopters above and beyond normal end use monitoring standards in order to certify the helicopters use in coin operations the missions assessment is that because the pakistan military has not forecast the use of fmf for helicopter procurement the opportunity cost of using fmf to procure helicopters makes it unlikely that the gop would choose to do so quickly in any case we are fully prepared to assist the pakistan army to address the maintenance issues of the mi17 helicopters if it so desires if as general kayani indicates only five mi17s are operational we can produce the equivalent of new helicopters by assisting the pakistan army to repair the helicopters that are nonoperational 7 c other helicopters in pakistans aviation fleet face equally troubling operational readiness and availability issues we are searching for and acquiring specific critical spare items for cobra helicopters as quickly as possible and have provided an agreement to resume work on eight pakistani cobras now in the us despite the urgency of the existing situation in the nwfp and fata we are waiting for the gop to sign letters of agreement on cobra spare parts 8 c comment embassy is aware that us engagement with the pakistani military has been frustrating transparency is often nonexistent offers of assistance go unanswered or are overruled at headquarters even as pakistans maintenance and training are inadequate still the success of our own troop surge in afghanistan and the stability of pakistans government depend on rolling back the terrorist threat in swat and eliminating the terrorist safehavens in the waziristans the inability of the gop to control north and south waziristan has enabled terrorists to operate throughout the country kayani confided to an american visitor recently that he would not be able to move to waziristan until late summer while that movement will not be determined solely by the availability of helicopter support it is certainly the case that the availability of helicopters will be key factor in making the decision to go patterson
