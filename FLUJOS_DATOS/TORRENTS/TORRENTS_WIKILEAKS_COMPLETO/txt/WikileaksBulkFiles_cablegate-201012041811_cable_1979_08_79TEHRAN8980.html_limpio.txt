negotiations in which the embassy has been involved here ranging from compound security to visa operations to gte to the sherry case highlight several special features of conducting business in the persian environment in some instances the difficulties we have encountered are partial reflection on the effects of the iranian revolution but we believe the underlying cultural and psychological qualities that account for the nature of these difficulties are and will remain relatively constant therefore we suggest that the following analysis be used to brief both usg personnel and private sector representatives who are required to do business with and in this country end introduction 3 perhaps the single dominant aspect of the persian psyche is an overriding egoism its antecedents lie in the long iranian history of instability and insecurity which put premium on selfpreservation the practical effect of it is an almost total persian preoccupation with self and leaves little room for understanding points of view other than ones own thus for example it is incomprehensible to an iranian that us immigration law may prohibit issuing him tourist visa when he has determined that he wants to live in california similarly the iranian central bank sees inconsistency in claiming force majeure to avoid penalties for late payment of interest due on outstanding loans while the government of which it is part is denying the vailidity of the very grounds upon which the claim is made when confronted by similar claims from foreign firms forced to cease operations during the iranian revolution 4 the reverse of this particular psychological coin and having the same historical roots as persian egoism is pervasive unease about the nature of the world in which one lives the persian experience has been that nothing is permanent and it is commonly perceived that hostile forces abound in such an environment each individual must be constantly alert for opportunities to protect himself against the malevolent forces that would otherwise be his undoing he is obviously justified in using almost any means available to exploit such opportunities this approach underlies the socalled bazaar mentality so common among persians mindset that often ignores longer term interests in favor of immediately obtainable advantages and countenances practices that are regarded as unethical by other norms an example is the seemingly shortsighted and harassing tactics employed by the pgoi in its negotiations with gte 5 coupled with these psychological limitations is general incomprehension of casuality islam with its emphasis on the omnipotence of god appears to account at least in major part for this phenomenon somewhat surprisingly even those iranians educated in the western style and perhaps with long experience outside iran itself frequently have difficulty grasping the interrelationship of events witness yazdi resisting the idea that iranian behavior has consequences on the perception of iran in the us or that this perception is somehow related to american policies regarding iran this same quality also helps explain persian aversion to accepting responsibility for ones own actions the deus ex machina is always at work 6 the persian proclivity for assuming that to say something is to do it further complicates matters again yazdi can express surprise when informed that the irregular security forces assigned to the embassy remain in place but the central committee told they would go by monday he says an mfa official reports that the sherry case is 90 percent solved but when consular officer investigates he discovers that nothing has changed there is recognition that instructions must be followed up that commitments must be accompanied by action and results 6 finally there are the persian concepts of influence and obligation everyone pays obeisance to the former and the latter is usually honored in the breach persians are consumed with developing parti bazithe influence that will help get things donewhile favors are only grudgingly bestowed and then just to the extent that tangible quid pro quo is immediately preceptible forget about assistance proferred last year or even last week what can be offered today 7 there are several lessons for those who would negotiate with persians in all this first one should never assume that his side of the issue will be recognized let alone that it will be conceded to have merits persian preoccupation with self precludes this negotiator must force recognition of his position upon his persian opposite number second one should not expect an iranian readily to perceive the advantages of longterm relationship based on trust he will assume that his opposite number is essentially an adversary in dealing with him he will attempt to maximize the benefits to himself that are immediately obtainable he will be prepared to go to great lengths to achieve this goal including running the risk of so alienating whoever he is dealing with that future business would be unthinkable at least to the latter third interlocking relationships of all aspects of an issue must be painstakingly forecefully and repeatedly developed linkages will be neither readily comprehended nor accepted by persian negotiators fourth one should insist on performance as the sine qua non at esh stage of negotiations statements of intention count for almost nothing fifth cultivation of goodwill for goodwills sake is waste of effort the overriding objective at all times should be impressing upon the persian across the table the mutuality of the proposed undertakings he must be made to know that quid pro quo is involved on both sides finally one should be prepared for the threat of breakdown in negotiations at any given moment and not be cowed by the possiblity given the persian negotiators cultural and psychological limitations he is going to resist the very concept of rational from the western point of view negotiating process laingen confidential
