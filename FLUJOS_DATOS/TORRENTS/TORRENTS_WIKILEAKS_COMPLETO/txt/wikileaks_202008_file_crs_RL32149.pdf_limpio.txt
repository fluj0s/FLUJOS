limit debate recently concern by some senators over an inability to halt consideration and obtain confirmation vote on several pendi ng judicial nominations has led to renewed interest in amending the senate cloture rule one option called the nuclear option by some and the constitutional option by others would seek to use ruling by the presiding officer or majority vote of the chamber to end debate outside of the terms of rule xxii it is possible that this option may be attempted in the 109th congress several measures were introduced in the 108th congress to amend the cloture rule sres 138 which

cloture rule brief history of the cloture rule proposals to limit senate debate are as old as the senate itself over the 216 year history of the body numerous proce dures have been proposed to allow the senate to end di scussion and act1 the most important debatelimiting procedure enacted was the adoption in 1917 of the clot ure rule codified in paragraph 2 of senate rule xxii under the current version of this rule process for ending debate on given measure or matter may be set in motion following supermajority vote of the senate since the senates adoption of the cl oture rule in 1917 proposals have been advanced to repeal or amend it in almost every session of congress2 at times senators of both political parties as well as the parties themselves have debated the merits of the senates tradition of free and unlimited debate and argued for and against making cloture easier to invoke these debates occurred at different times and under different sets of circumstances for example as senators attempted to prevent filibusters of civil rights measur pass consumer prot ection legislation or secure the confirmation of judicial or executive branch nominations debates on the cloture rule have frequently focused on whether or not the senate must consider amendments to it under the bodys existing rules including rule xxii itself this argument rests on the princi ple that the senate is continuing body which regards its rules as staying in for ce from one congress to the next contrary argument contends that this principle has the effect of entrenching the existing rules against change situation which amounts to an unconstitutional limit on the power of the body to set the terms of its own opera tion to ove rcome these difficulties senators attempting to change rule xxii have employed various procedural tactics including seeking to invoke cloture by majority vote seeking opinions by the vice president acting as presiding officer that the cloture rule itself is unconstitutional and arguing that the rules do not apply on the first day of congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32149crs2 3 us congress senate committee on rules and administration senate cloture rule

cloture rule was amended to apply to all matters as well as measures change which expanded its reach to nominations most motions to proceed to consider measures and other motions decade later in 1959 its reach was further expanded to include debate on motions to proceed to consider changes in the senate rules themselves the thre shold for invoking cloture was lowered in 1975 from twothirds present

congress several resolutions were introduced on the subject proposals currently under discussion include the nuclear or constitutional option6 media reports have focused on the possi ble use of what has been called nuclear parliamentary option to nd debate and vote on certain stalled nominations7 under such scenario the chair perhaps occupied by the vice president serving as presiding officer or by the president pro tempore of the senate would set aside the existing provisions of rule xxii and rule that cloture could be invoked by simple majority vot supporters of such an approach argue that

continuedmajority vote of senators supporters argue that this proceeding would be permissible because under the constitution the senate has the expr ess right to make or change the rules of its proceedings at any time they further point out that such constitutional questions are traditionally submitted to vote of the full chamber for decision8 under this latter scenario however the chair would likely have to also ignore the precedent that constitutional questi ons are debatable perhaps by stating that the body has right to get to the question at hand those concerned about the filibuster of judicial nominations have also argued that the inability of the senate to reach final vote on nomination represents an abdication of the senates duty to perform constitutional duty that of advising and consenting to nominations majority leader bill frist told his nate colleagues on january 4 2005 that he was willing to take steps to use one of the nuclear or constitutional options in the 109th congress if he felt it was necessary so let say this if my democratic colleagues exercise selfrestraint and do not filibuster judicial nominees senate traditions will be restored it will then be unnecessary to change senate procedures selfrestraint on the use of filibuster for nominationsthe very same selfrestraint that senate minorities exercised for more than two centurieswill alleviat the need for any action but if my democratic colleagues continue to filibuster judicial nominees the senate will face this choice fail to do its constitutional duty or reform itself and restore its traditions and do what the framers inte nded right now we cannot be certain that judicial filibusters will cease so i reserve the right to propose changes to senate rule xxii and do not acquiesce to carrying over all the rules from the last congress9 opponents have used the term nuclear to describe these scenarios because of their belief that its use would destroy the comity and senatorial courtesy necessary in body that operates largely by unanimous consent they further argue that such an approach might destroy the unique charact er of the senate itself making it more like the house of representatives where majority has the ability to halt debate any time it wishes10 observers point out that such parlia mentary proceeding is not unprecedented on several occasions vice

example senator robert c byrd the architect of the 1975 cloture amendment observed that the reversal vote erased the precedent of majority cloture established two week s before and reaffirmed the continuous nature of senate rules13 others argued that such precedent was established and was not overturned senator walter f mondale observed the rule xxii experience was significant becau for the first time in history vice president and clear majority of the senate established that the senate may at the beginning of new congress and unencumbered by the rule s of previous sena tes adopt its own rules by majority vote as constitutional right the last minute votes attempting to undo that precedent in way undermine that right14 frist proposal in the 108th congress senator frist introduced another proposal to amend the cloture rule his resolution sres 138 w ould have added new section to the end of rule xxii and created cloture pro cess applicable only to the confirmation of nominees any nomination requiring senate confirmation would have been subject to this new procedure including nominees to the us supreme court the us court of appeals district courts members of the presidents cabinet and lowerlevel agency executives15 as under the current rule the new clot ure procedure envisioned by senator frists sres 138 would have begun with the filing of written cloture petition that contains the signatures of 16 senators wh ich would lie over befo re being considered on the following calendar day plus one under sres 138 however the number of votes needed to invoke cloture on nomin ation would have d iminished steadily over time under the procedure proposed by senator fris t as with current practice the first cloture petition filed on nomination would need the votes of 60 senators for cloture to be invoked if 60 senators did not vot for cloture second petition could then be submitted when the senate voted on that petition just 57 senators would

calendars not just nominees as in the frist proposal would decline on ccessive cloture votes from 60 to 57 to 54 and finally to 5116 additionally the frist resolution would have prohibited the filing of further cloture petition on nomination until the senate had disposed of other pending cloture motions on that nomination currently cloture petitions can be filed on successive days or even on the

the filibuster of nominations takes power away from the president obstructionist delay in the consideration of either executive or judicial nominations harms th separation of power s said douglas w kmiec dean of the catholic university of america school of law there is constitutional duty to provide timely advice and consent on judicial nominees21 while there are other avenues for senator trying to get bill that is being filibustered through the pro cess such as by amending some other measure or with the aid of house colleague senator fris t noted there is other way to have nomination confirmed except by vote of the full senate there is safety valve filibustering nominations is filibustering in its most potent and virulent form and even if majority of senators stand ready to confirm such filibusters can be fatal he said22 those who oppose the frist resolution argued that it would tilt the balance of power too heavily toward the president in the nomination and confirmation process they also maintained that there is not enough evidence of problem to merit changing one of the basic features of the senate the potential for unlimited debate finally they asserted that such change could challenge the senates ability to exercise its constitutional and institutional right to independently assess the qualifications of nominees if we cede power to the president i dont think well ever get it back said christopher j dodd ranking democrat on the senate rules committee at the june 5 hearing the frist resolution would fundamentally undermine the senates role in our

the proposal would inevitably lead to pressure to make the same change for ending debate on legislation26 william and mary law professor michael j gerhardt testified that filibuster of nominee does not completely block the president from filling the vacancy at issue pointing out that the president can f ill the seat by making recess appointment which would not require senate confirma tion

legislative procedures by christopher m davismechanism by which debate can be stopped in the united states senate29 before the cloture rule was enacted in 1917 it was not possible to stop debate without achieving unanimous consent statutes and standing orders another option that has been suggested is to establish procedures to limit debate by means other than changi ng senate standing rules30 one example of this might be to amend the standing orde rs of the senate instead of its standing rules another possible example of such an approach w ould be to pass an expedited procedure statute expedited procedure statutes often called fast track statutes are laws that establish special procedures for the cons ideration of measures in one or both chambers of congress these laws frequently mandate timely floor scheduling limit time for committee consideration floor bate and amendment and establish mandatory hookup procedures to ensure that both chambers act on the same measure31 numerous expedited procedure statutes are currently in effect and act as the equivalent of standing rules of the house and sena including such wellknown examples as the congressional budget act the war powers act the nuclear waste policy act the trade act of 1974 and the congressional review act by which the senate can vote on resolutions to di sapprove proposed agency regulations32 potential advantage of an expedited procedure statute is that it presumably would only require 60 rather than 67 senators normally required to invoke cloture on such proposal this would presumab ly also apply to amendments to the senates standing orders this is because the special provision for cloture on rules proposals is understood to apply only to amendments to the standing rules by relying on statute provisions of this type might be passed as freestanding measure or attached to another piece of legislation if supporters thought it aided them an expedited procedure statute limiting debate might even originate in the house of representatives where they could be attached by special rule to one or more pieces of must pass legisl ation creating momentum for their consideration in the senate why would it be appropriate for procedur governing nominations to be placed in statute supporters might argue that it is precisely because they deal with power in which both the legislative and executiv branches of government are involved such an approach might also offer pr oponents political argume nts over attempts to change standing senate rules for exampl supporters might argue if it is the law that the senate must vote on disapproving government regulations on arcane subjectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32149crs10 33 us congress senate committee on rules and administration senate cloture rule

argue that while expedited procedures are fine for few individual pieces of legislation or functions such as disapproving agency re gulations they are not appropriate for an important constitutional function like the confirmation of presidential nominees additional proposals to limit senate debate in its 214year history numerous propos als have been put forth to limit senate debate33 these

representatives to end debate adopting rule that debate and amendment must be germane to thesubject under consideration either to all business at all times or only to specific business or only at limited times for example to appropriations and revenue bills or in the closing days of congressional session limiting the duration of debate by special rule as in the house enforcing the existing

to make it more difficult on those who want to stage filibuster arguments in support of extended debate34 minority rights it is key safeguard of the american sy stem of government that the senate so strongly protects the rights of block of senators who do not command majority 51 supporters of this argument believe that legi slative minorities have rights which majority should be able to easily override further they argue obstruction is justified to prevent majority from trampling upon the rights of minority until broad political consensus has developed on an issue the structure of the senate was intended to protect the rights of smaller states and it is asserted that such change would undermine this intent harm defenders of extended debate also contend that in the long run matters that are truly in the nations best interest have not been permanently blocked by extended debate nearly every important bill blocked by filibuster they maintain eventually has been enacted and those bills which ultimately failed becau of an extended debate would have b een bad for the country like wise the senates tradition of debate has protected both political parties at different times in history the cloture rule has been in effect for nearing 100 years with little ill ffect they contend unique role supporters of extended deba believe that the ability of any senator to speak at length about virtually any topic at any time is unique charact eristic of the senate which allows the chamber to play vital role in the legislative process cooling passions and forcing delibera tion furthermore supporters argue this feature was one that was intended by the framers differentiating the senate from the house removed of this delib erative function the senate w ould become shadow of the larger house of representatives they say in addition because the senate alone has the right to act on executive business nominations and treaties the function of extended debate can act as check on the executive branch arguments in favor of strengthening limitations on debatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32149crs12 majority rule the ability of senate minority to bloc k actions supported by clear majority thwarts one of the basic premises of american government majority rule supporters of changing the system argu that it is undemocratic to allow determined minority to prevent an institu tional majority from working its will the current process they say gives too much power to the minority at the expense of the majority further they believe it undermines public acc ountability of the majority which is in charge of running the chamber if they cannot get their agenda considered and passed by the senate because of procedural problems efficient action the senate is legislative body and shoul d be able to act on matters before it in timely and efficient manner extended debate by one senator or small group of senators is to waste time and money supporters of ch anging debate rules argue and brings public disrepute because the senate cannot act in timely fashion on important issues much legislation nd several qualified minations have been delayed or defeated by ex tended debate they contend speech protected changing the rules would not inhibit freedom of speech in the senate current proposals to change the rules would provide those who oppose bill or matter significant time to discuss the proposal but would not allow them to block action on it if majority of the senate supported it all limitation on debate demands supporters say is the ability to have fair up or down vote it does not mandate particular outcome additional points other points raised during discussion of the cloture issue include the following some argue that number of sena tors might view proposed
