an ag ricultural transportation and environmental context summary the upper mississippi riverillinois wa terway umriww navigation system provides vital export outlet for the ag ricultural bounty of the upper midwestern states of minnesota iowa wisconsin illinoi s and missouri the waterway is also vital means for shipping other bulk commodities important to the regional economy commercial navigability on the umriww is dependent on system of locks and dams built maintained and operated by the us army corps of engineers commercial users of the umriww navigation system primarily shippers and agricultural producers claim that since the 1980s the umriww has been beset by increasing traffic congestion and delays related to its aging infrastructure and limited lock capacity these groups advocat that the federal government should invest in major modernization and lock expansion on the umriwws navigation system they argue that the economies of the umriww basin states as well as us export competitiveness depend on navigation system improvements in contrast budget watchdogs envir onmentalists and ot her interest groups argue that improving navigation must not needlessly damage river ecology less expensive alternatives should first be fu lly exploited and major spending on umr iww improvements is not fully justif ied on economic grounds advocates of alternate transportation modes particularly rail questi on further federal support for barge transportation to the detriment of rail nd truck transportation furthermore considerable uncertainty surrounds proj ections of future barge demand and contributes to concern about the ec onomic viability of large investments in 1993 the corps began multiyear feasibility study called the navigation study to assess navigation efficiency imp rovements for the umriww system over 50year planning horizon following re view of the corps draft feasibility study by the national research council spa rked by controversy over the economic justification for lock expansion the ec onomic analysis was reformulated and the navigation study was restructured to include ecosystem restoration in april 2004 the corps announced its preliminary recommendation for integrated investments in navigation and ecosystem restoration the corps recommended navigation impr ovements are estimated at 24 billion they would be funded 50 from federal ge neral revenues and 50 from the inland waterways trust fund the plan includes building seven new 1200 ft locks and possibly five lock extensions as well as implementing helper boats and moorings while new locks are designed and constructed the co rps also recommended 53 billion 50year ecosystem restoration plan approx imately 425 billion fe deral and 105 billion nonfederal for

transportation and environmental decision purpose of this report this report is intended as an aid to c ongressional staff new to discussions about the upper mississippi river illinois wate rway umriww navigation system and proposals for its improvement in six s ections this report describes the major infrastructure and environmental issues associated with the umriww reviews proposals by the us army corps of engin eers to address these issues evaluates the uncertainty surrounding the benefit of improving the rivers navigation infrastructure and points out the views of various stakeholders the first section of this report briefly describes why the umriww is significant navigation system it also di scusses how disagreement over the extent and nature of waterway conges tion underlies much of the bate over whether the corps should undertake infrastructure investment to expand the capacity of some locks the second section briefly describes the decisionmaking process for the umr iww along with the corps proposal for joint navigation and ecosystem restoration project it also pres ents views of various stakeholders the third section describes the nature of freight movements on the umriww and how freight volume has va ried over time and by river reach closely related to the third section the fourth section expl ains why future agricultural demand for transportation on the umriww is important to investment decisions but also an important uncertainty it discusses how changes in domestic and international agricultural demand could cause the region s agricultural goods to be shipped via other transportation routes because these shifts in demand are difficult to forecast the net benefit to agriculture of improving the navigation infrastructure is unclear the fifth section of this report places the umriwws barge transport in multimodal system context it discusses how federal lockexpansion projects could affect rail and truck mode s and how in the absence of navigation improvements alternative modes might cope with additional traffic it also compares the different environmental and social ffects of transportation by barge rail and truck the sixth section discusses how river management decisions on the umriww affect the environment it describes bot h the environmental impacts of expanding the systems navigation capacity and the cu mulative effects of ongoing navigation operations and the corps propos for ecosystem resotrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32470crs2 1 us army corps of engin eers rock island district draft integrated feasibility report and

built by the corps in the 1930s with an initial projected life span of about 50 years commercial shippe rs and corps officials estimate that delays due to the continuous degradation of th umriww systems aging lockanddam infrastructure have increased over the past 25 years as result they argue that the corps has had to continually decrease allo wable traffic passing through the locks environmental and other gr oups contend that the corps has spent over 900 million on umriww rehabilitation projects ce 1975 extending the productive life of existing locks and dams for at least 30 years3 for example in 2001 the corps completed major 259 million rehab ilitation of the lock and dam 254 lock length limits capacity most of the locks in the umriww navigation system were originally desi gned to accommodate 600footlong barge tows twentysix of the umrs 29 lock locations have chambers that are 600 feet ft in length see appendix tables a1 and a2 for lock details the upper and lower st anthony falls locks are 400 ft and 500 ft respectively three locks lock 19 lock 26 renamed as the melvin price lock and dam and lock 27 are 1200 ft in length with 1200 ft lock chamber 1100 ft barge tow can pass through in about 45 minutes in st it generally take s between 90 and 120 minutes for an 1100 ft barge tow to pass through 600 ft lock due to the need to doublelock the barge tow doublelocking is procedure whereby barge tow is broken into two sections each is passed th rough the lock chamber separately then the two sections are rejoined before continuing commercial users argue that not only do ba rge tow backups tend to occur at the 600 ft locks where extensive doublelock ing causes delays but doublelocking increases the potential for workrelated hazards associated with manipulating the binding and guide ropes etc wh ile in the narrow lock chamber5 as result barge companies and corn and soybean producer groups have lobbied actively for the expansion of several of the lower locks in contrast budget watchdogs such as the national taxpayers union and taxpayers for common sense and environmental groups have argued that inexpensive sma llscale measures like traffic scheduling congestion tolls helper boats and moorings could reduce lockage times by 20 minutes or more and that unlike new or expanded locks that will take decades to build smallscale measures can be implemented right away at fraction of the cost6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32470crs6 7 corps draft feasibility report and peis pp 52 8 discussion with richard kreider of the nneapolisbased barge shipper cargo carriers apr 16 2004 according to mr kreider his firm estimates that barge traveling either up or down river between minneapolis and st l ouis moves at an average speed of about 75 miles per day

while using the current infrastructure univ of missourist louis center for transportation studies feb 3 2003estimated traffic delays the corps reports that the umriww system has over half 19 of 36 of the most delayed lock sites in the countrys system of inland waterways7 existing delays vary based on th location in the system but are generally greatest at the locks furthest downstream see table 1 these delays result from traffic backups due to congesti on as well as closures for operation and maintenance from 1990 to 2001 the co rps estimated cumulative average delays per tow of 485 hours more than two da ys on the umr and 106 hours on the iww for perspective barge trip between minneapolis and st louis is estimated to take about 114 days on average including delays8 in effect the estimated average delays add about two days to what would otherwise be nineday trip completion of the corps recommended navigation impr ovements are not expected to completely eliminate all delays since portion of delays are attributable to variability in demand9 more than one boat arriving at the same time results in delay and the seasonalityof crop harvesting assures strong autumn demand corps data suggest that locks 26 and 27 experience some of the largest dela ys despite having unde rgone fairly recent renovation and having 1200ft lock capac ity the corps has not published an estimate of the

views of various stakeholders corps recommended proposal to inform the congressional decision on whether to authorize investments in navigation improvements and ecosystem restoration activities on the umriww the corps has been studying the longrun navigation needs of the umriww system since 199312 several supporting reports and analyses have been released as part of the corps navigation study concerning pr oposed infrastructure alternatives the corps navigation study itself has been the subject of controversy in 2001 in response to criticism the corps reformul ated its economic analysis and added ecosystem restoration to the study13 in april 2004 the corps released draft preferred investment alternative after having analyzed multiple options for na vigation and ecosystem restoration the corps recommended 50year plan integr ates investments in both navigation efficiency and ecosystem restoration the naviga tion improvements component would cost an estimated 24 billion while th ecosystem restoration plan would cost an estimated 53 billion the corps recomme nds that congress authorize first increment of the navigation plan at 19 b illion and first increment of the ecosystem restoration plan at 15 billion authorization if it occurs may be part of water resources development act wrda14 which is the typical legislative vehicle for authorizing corps projects to proceed with

appropriations act corps preferred navigation plan the 24 billion 50year navigation improvement plan would be paid 50 fro m federal general re venues and 50 from the inland waterways trust fund15 the corps recommends initial authorization of subset of the 50year plan at 19 billion this first increment of measures would include authorization and immediate implementation of smallscale and nonstructural measures 218 million mooring facilities at seven locks and phased in switc hboats at five locks16 authorization and immediate imple mentation of seven new 1200 ft locks 166 billion and authorization of continued study nd monitoring of the market and traffic conditions of umriww system and lock appointment scheduling system according to the corps analysis has been sufficient to support this initial investment decision if implemented us ing an adaptive approach the corps preferred plan would give it the authority to proceed with the planning design and construction of the seven ne w locks but the administration and congress would be provided with opportunities to continue stop or delay work at three checkpoints17 the only activities of the 50year plan not authorized by the fi rst increment proposed by the corps are the lock extensions and use of switchboats on the five locks upriver from the seven new locks httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32470crs10 18 ibid p 447 and 500

end of this reportthe draft feasibility report also presents the analysis the corps performed to support its recommendation some conclusions from the analysis were first the preferred navigation lternative depends greatly on two variables 1 traffic forecasts rived from future trade scenarios and 2 the price sensitivity of shippers18 second single navigation altern ative was clear best choice across range of economic conditions19 third the risks are high if acti on is taken and high traffic occurs risks are also high if large investment is made and increases in traffic do not materialize20 the corps found that every alternative in cluding action contains risk in the face of an uncertain future ultimately any authorization will likely be based on expectations for the future of the system pa rticularly as regards agricultural trade and transportation demand as well as on pers pectives of the value and likelihood of success of ecosystem restoration the weighting of tradeoffs among multiple uses and the selected approaches to risk and uncertainty competing views on larges cale navigation investments numerous interest groups have expre ssed strong opinions about largescale umriww infrastructure investments commercial users of the umriww navigation system primarily shippers and agricultural producers advocate largescale investments major propone nts include the national corn growers association statelevel corn growers ssociations iowa illinois minnesota missouri and wisconsin the american soybean association and the shipping industry21 opponents are collection of interest groups including environmentalists budget hawks railroads and truck companies and economic research institutes who question the rationale for largescale federal investment in the umriww system and have questioned the validity of study estimates of the potential benefits and costs of such projects environmentalists ar gue that at minimum improving navigation should be undertaken and funded in concert w ith ecosystem restoration in contrast navigation and agricultural groups conte nd that ecosystem restoration should be funded on its own mer its separate from na vigation improvements the

the initial lock and dam construc tion undertaken by the corps and financed entirely from federal general revenues nd corps operation and maintena nce of the lock and dam system financed 50 from general revenues stakeholders views on how to proceed with investments vary based on perspectives on the urgency of largescale investments its analysis of range of measures for navigation demand and cong estion management and the sufficiency and credibility of the corps analysis of the economic conditions used to compare alternatives urgency of largescale investments proponents of largescale measures argue that investments need to be made now because the current locks are antiquated and dilapidated to provide time for the new locks to come online and for the united states to compete in world markets they argue that making investment decisions now allows for the most efficient and costeffective way to modernize the system by taking advantage of ongoing rehabilitation investments for

alternatives small scale measures to manage waterway congestion for example congestion tolls tradable arrival slots and industry selfh elp have been discussed for use on the umriww smallscale measur can be either structur or nonstructural and are smaller in scope and cost than new locks or lock extensions some smallscale measures have been consider ed independent of largescal measures either to better manage demand or to better operate existing infrastruct ure other measures were analyzed for use in combination with largescale improvements the draft navigation plan recommended by the corps includes the immediate implementation of two smallscale measures moorings and switchboats and the study of lock appointment scheduling system as well as largescale measures some stakeholders primarily environmental intere sts have questioned whether largescale investments coul d be delayed or avoided by implementing congestion management and other smallscale measures these stakeholders criticize the corps analysis of smallscale meas ures as incomplete supporters of new locks argue that smallscale measures are impracticable and that they would provide only incremental benefits over existing operations they ar gue that existing operations have serious shortcomings and question the logic of i nvesting resources in smallscale measures when they argue largescale measures are needed analysis of benefits and costs as part of navigation feasibility study the corps generally forecasts demand for navigation movements over 50 years on waterway and then uses this information to calculate benefits and costs for multiple investment alternatives creating longterm forecasts to support longterm decisions is an analytic challenge longterm forecasts inherently contain large uncertainties consequently traffic demand forecasting has been contentious element in the development of the umriww feasibility study rather than forecast demand over 50 years the corps draft report used scenariobased approach specifically the corps examined movements on the umr iww for five future traffic scenarios th at are based on differing world trade crop area crop yield and consumption patterns then it combined the five scenarios withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32470crs13 28 twicecooked pork and national research council transportation research board inland navigation system pl anning the upper

five scenarios and the three conditions have been criticized by stakeholders opposed to proceeding with largescale measures as well as by national res earch council review committee they argue that four of the five scenarios are unrealis tically optimistic which is inconsistent with export levels over the last 20 years regarding the economic modeling conditions they argue that the conditions are based on either discredited or incomplete models they also criticize the corps for not assigning probabilities to the various scenarios these same critics argue that the corps has history of overestimating barge traffic when justifying investments in inland waterways28 the corps has defended its approach as an attempt to address the certainties and weakness of available tools the corps

minor albeit growing share of freight transport on the mississippi river instead nonagricultura l commodities such as coal petroleum various ores lumber and primary manufact ured products accounted for the largest share of freight however by the 1970s agricultural bulk commodities caught up to and surpassed nonagricultural products as the dominant source for barge freight see figure 4 as result

decades in the postwwii era but has leveled off since the early 1980s see figure 5 there is disagreement over the cause for this lack of growth in barge demand is the falloff in barge traffic supply problem resulting from shortage of lock infrastructure or is it demand problem due to stagnation in fo reign demand for us feedstuffs shipping and agricultural interests argue that stagnant umriww barge traffic is due to delays associated with aging infrastructure and limited lock capacity that the costly delays are increasingly forcing grain shippers to switch to alternate transportation modes

interest groups contend that growth in domestic demand as well as international market conditions have changed substantially since the period of rapid growth in barge demand experienced during the 1960s and 1970s33 global events as reported in numerous usda publications appear to support this conclusion34 several of the more salient historical ma rket phenomena include since most corn and soybeans traded in global markets are ultimately used for animal feed international demand is highly dependent on general economic conditions global economic conditions were positive in the 1970s but stagnated during the 1980s see figures 6 and 7 us corn and soybean exports echoed this pattern as the weak economic growth translated into weak international demand for animal feeds widespread growth in foreign grain production during the 1980s and1990s contributed to the general decline in us corn exports the early 1990s witnessed the loss of major demand source forus feedstuffs particularly co rn with the breakup of the former soviet union fsu and the wide scale liquidation of soviet animal herds china entered world corn markets as major exporter in 1984 justas the fsu was preparing to leav

as it represents raw material for construction and industrial processing is expected to ebb and flow with the regional economy as result this chapter focuses on key issues and certainties behind evolving trade patterns and projections for future agricultura l freight traffic on the umriww preliminary conclusion is that there appears to be substantial potential for future agriculturerelated barge dema nd to fall short of the ex pectations of proponents of largescale investment in the umriww corps longrun outlook questioned as previously noted one of the corps objectives under the umriww navigation study has been to evaluate the potential barge demand over 50year time horizon specifically 2000 to 2050 however the primary studies undertaken either by or for the corps to examine projected umriww traffic flows and barge demand have met with skepticism from investment critics as well as from the nrc39 in particular major shortcomings cited by the nrc include the various models used by the corps to estimate the benefits of umriww infrastructure investments have been characterized by flawed assumptions and data and have relied on inadequate methodologies corps analyses have tended to ignore or minimize the potential foralternate routes to evolve based on international market conditions corps studies supporting new lock investments have relied on very optimistic growth projections for both international demand for bulk commodities and us exportable surpluses of bulk commodities other critics have also questioned the strong barge demand growth projections given that us corn exports have shown growth during the past two decades while soybean exports have grown slightly but with substantial variability at the same time projections for global population and income growth would suggest that demand for agricultural products will increase however this alone is insufficient to justify projections for strong growth in bulk commodity flows on the umriww system any comprehensive analysis must consider the evolution of specific market forces and the potential shifts in trade flows and patterns that they are likely to engender the following discussion considers these points two questions underlie the outlook for barge demand given the umriww basins likelihood of remaining major corn and soybean producer for the next several decades projections of significant growth in barge demand on the umriww system hinge on th outlook for two aspects of us corn and soybean production and trade httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32470crs22 40 for more information see crs report

words what are the prospects for exportable supplies 2 mode and route choices for exportable surplus what is the likelihood that such exportable surpluses if realize d will demand barge transportation on the umriww navigation system rather than alternate transportation modes and routes this hinges on the projected evolution of intern ational demand and supply conditions prospects for exportable surplus strong growth in domestic demand from the livestock sector the food and indus trial processing sect or and the biofuels industry particularly cornbased ethanol production has steadily reduced the share of production that is available for export to international markets see figures 6 and 7 while the longterm outlook for corn production may be optimistic the trend of the past five years suggests that domestic consumpti on driven by growth in meat and dairy products as well as increasing ethanol production will continue to capture growing share of to tal use the introduction of renewable fuels standard rfs as proposed in pendi ng energy legislation could accelerate this process40 strong growth in domestic use as share of total production tends to limit growth in exportable supplies for two reasons domestic users generally offer higher returns over international markets as result exports ar generally supplied as residual outlet after domestic users have been satisfied strong domestic demand s traditionally kept us prices at slight premium with respect to other international exporters hindering us competitiveness pa rticularly as compared to foreign producers with heavier export orientations like argentina and brazil mode and route choices for exportable surplus in addition to the volume of exportable surplus agriculture related demand for ba rge transportation on the umriww is highly dependent on inte rnational market conditions and on the availability and cost of alternate transportation modes and routes considerable uncertainty surrounds longrun internationa l market projections many of the projected longrun commodity trade outco mes hinge on policy decisions made by foreign countries such as china rather than the economic forces driven by supply and demand conditions this is particularly true for the two major agricultural commodities historically shipped on the umriww corn and soybeans httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32470crs23 41 usda

shifts in the sources and nature of international demand resulting from population and in come dynamics increasing competition from south american exporters evolving bilateral and multilateral trade agreements and trade disputes related to us production and use of biotech crops have induced exporters to seek nontrad itional routes to new and expanding export markets and have drawn exportable supp lies of corn and soybeans away from the umriww system see figure 8 several factors ve contributed to shifts toward other trade routes and suggest that this trend is expected to continue41 first the

truck and rail routes to the nafta partners mexico and canada have expanded rapidly during the past 10 years particularly for pe rishables but also for grains and oilseeds in addition both mexico nd canada have ma major changes in their domestic agricultural policies that have contributed to growing imports of us agricultural products together the two nafta partners import sizable share of us

agricultural service production supply and distri bution psd online database available at httpwwwfasusdagovpsd on april 8 2004exports of soybeans and soymeal to canada and mexico have shown similar growth increasing from 17 share to 26 share during the same time periods second as mentioned earlier comp etition from argentina and brazil in international agricultural markets has increased sharply since the mid1990s between 1995 and 2003 the two south am erican countries expanded their production by about 250 and their comb ined exports of soybeans and products expanded by 25642 the us share of the international market for soybean and products has declined from 72 in 1986 to less than 25 in 2003 this trend is expected to continue us exports that move via the umriww system to gulf ports and the atlantic dir ectly confront growing south american competition in contrast overland routes to major ports on the west coast offer direct access to the pacific ocean and asian mark ets and are beginning to compete with the traditional umriwwtogulfportstopana macanal route to asia third phenomenal growth in soybean import demand from china in recent years has spurred the growth of rail shipments out of the northern plains and the umr iww basin to the pacific northwest pnw dramatic income growth since the mid 1980s has been accompanied by sharp increases in chinas demand for meat products one of several polic responses by chinas gove rnment has been to permit increased soybean imports starting in th late 1990s by 2002 more than onethird of all soybeans traded in international markets was destined for china usda projects that china will account for 73 of global soybean import growth over the next decade as result us soybean shippers are looking for the most cost effective routes to china higher costs associated with the umriww system plus rising fees to pass through the panama ca nal have made the pnw route increasingly attractive particularly for soybeans from the dakotas finally two other factors ve contributed to the velopment of an overland pnw route for soybeans from the western corn belt first recent genetic advancements have produced hardier soyb ean varieties that have pushed their production into the plains states at the expense of traditional small grains crops soybean production in the dakotas is located far enough from the umriww system to make pnw route more cost effective once the midwesttopnw route becomes established and economies of scale ensue more soybeans from the western corn belt could potentially be diverted from the umriww second factor has been the increased use of 110car shuttle trai ns to the pnw these longer trains are designed to capture the economies of scale i nherent in shipping larger volumes of commodity long

chapter examines the infrastructure needs of grain carriers and shippers from systemwide perspective that considers the interplay of barge rail and truck transport markets first it describes the role of transportation costs in us and international markets in particular it explains how changes in barge rates might affect grain producers then it briefly describes how grain is delivered to market including major changes taking place acr oss transport modes and the underlying reasons for those changes next it discu sses emerging rail issu and relates them back to barge transportation finally it compares some of the environmental and social effects of transport by barge rail and truck why transportation costs matter to agriculture45 in competitive grain and oilseed markets transfer costs handling and transportation charges are major factor in determining market price differentials agricultural producers are concerned about transportation costs because the price that they receive for their agri cultural commodities is derive d from the price established in major markets whether processing plant feedlot or export terminal less transportation and handling costs the more it costs to transport commodity to buyer the less the producer will receive and vi ce versa as result any process that reduces the cost of moving commodity to buyer likely benefits producers by raising the amount that they receive whic h subsequently benefits the local economy by generating greater farm income and associated economic activity46 in contrast raising domestic transpor tation costs widens the farmtomarket price differential widening differentia l generally compels exporters to offer the products in international ma rkets at higher prices that is less competitively higher us export prices relative to international competitors will lower the demand for us exports of corn and soybeans lower export demand reduces total demand and consequently lowers the prices and in come received by farmers for given level of production barge transport generates cost savings barge transportation represents lowcost method of moving bulk commodities long distances most economists and market

costs relative to export competitors such as argentina and brazil have helped us products compete in inte rnational corn and soybean markets47 because barge rates are generally significantly lower than either rail or truck the umriww navigation system provides consid erable transportation cost savings to the regional and national economy an ev aluation of transportation costs for the umriww system commissioned by the co rps indicated that rate savings to waterway users averaged about 808 per t on 1994 prices over the best possible all land routing alternative48 the rate savings varied by commodity and included for example 018bushel for corn 8 of th 1994 season average farm price safp of 226bushel and 035bushel for soybeans 6 of the 1994 safp of 548bushel49 based on these cost savings

traffic levels50 these benefits compare w ith average annual operation and maintenance costs of about 115 million51 barge delays increase costs shippers of bulk commodities rely on volume to make profit for barge plyi ng the inland waterways key determinant of the amount of freight that can be carried in season52 is the time it takes to make each haul the shorter the haul time the mo re total hauls that can be made and the more freight that can be moved as result delays associated with aging locks and dams represent lost time lost potential freight and lost profits waiting delays also represent lost fuel towboats on the um riww burn about 80 gallons of diesel fuel per hour53 the engines are kept running wh ile each towboat waits for its turn through the lock an economic study found

bushel of soybeans or about 1071 per metric ton delay induced 6 rise in the barge freight rate would push perbus hel costs for corn and soybeans up by approximately 16 and 17 cents respectively or less than 1 of the average farm value55 even so this represents an upward bound of potential costs given the unlikely simultaneous delay at all 27 locks as barge rates for corn and soybean fre ight rise the demand for barge services declines however the decline is ge nerally by lessth anproportional amount economists have estimated 05 decline in grain barge demand on the umr and 02 decline on the iww in response to 1 increase in barge freight rates56 in other words 6 rise in the barge freight rate would likely result in 3 decline in the volume of corn and soybean freight or about 12 mmt out of 40 mmt on the umr the barge price rise would shift these commodities to alternate uses feed food industrial or storage to alternate transport modes rail or truck or to alternate trade routes eg canada mexi co or the pacific northwest possible effect of sustained rise in barge transport rates is rise in rail freight costs due both to rising demand for rail as freight shifts away from barge and towards rail transport and to decreased efficiency resulting from longer rail delays as more traffic moves over the same mileage of freight track and through the same number of terminals the degree if any to which rail rates w ould rise in response to greater demand would depend on the level of slack capacity available to immediately absorb the agricultural freight that is being diverted from barge transportation the level of rail slack capacity is seasonal but tends to be near zero ie near full capacity of rail use at harvest time when barge demand is highest in study sanctioned by the national corn gr owers association the bargerail cross price effect was found to be very small it was estimated that railroad freight rates for farm products increase 025 for every 1 increase in

policy decisions affecting one m ode affect all other modes any major capital project even if modespecific is likely to affect the interrelationship among all the modes as well as their grain cu stomers optimizing particular component of the grain delivery system without c onsidering the whole system could merely reroute traffic rather than improving the systems overall performance in

based on distance grain elevators are used to accumulate critical mass of product that llows for economies of scale in shipping bulk grain see figure 9 trucks trains and barg compete and complement one another in moving grain to successively rger elevators shi pping distance often determines each modes particular role trucks traditionally have an advantage in moving grain for shorter distances less than 250 to 500 miles and therefor function primarily as the short haul gatherers of grain product railroads have cost advantage in moving grain long distances but barges have an even greater cost advantage where waterway is available however barges cannot compete with trucks nd trains in transit time and waterways are not always available due to ice floods or drought to reach seaports

being bypassed in the grain suppl chain one survey of industry experts predicted that of the more than 10000 grain elevators in todays network one in four of these elevators will longer be in existence decade from now63 class i railroads are exploiting operating efficiencies by consolidating their trackage and rolling stock around larger subte rminal grain elevat ors these larger elevators have enough grain to load not only longer trains but also trains using higher capacity hopper cars the rail consolida tion process emphasizes unit and shuttle trains deemphasizing carload service in fa vor of shipment sizes that can fill entire trains and operating from single origins and destinations rather than multiple origins and destinations these tactics are desi gned to reduce switching costs and improve car cycle times64 the railroads offer rate incen tives for unitgraintrains which encourages centralization of the grainel evator network and contributes to the diminishing role of country evators and short line railroads65 while class i rail rate incentives reduce the cost of rail haul s consolidation of grain elevators may require longer and therefore more costly truck hauls trucks because of their geographic flexibility are more easily able to adapt to class i rail consolidation than are short line railroads the increasing role of truck transport to the disadvantage of short line rail transport has raised debate over infrastructure constraints in these sectors as well key policy questions include whether rura l roads and bridges leading to grain elevators are

of environmental impacts of transpor tation modes are complicated by data availability and differences in the types of impacts and significance of ecosystems affected by landbased transport and water transport the inability to compare directly some impacts does not diminish their significance and importance for decisionmaking because reduced damage to one environmental aspect eg terrestrial ecosystem fragmentation often comes as tradeoff with environmental harm increasing for another aspect eg riverine ecosystems environmental assessments of alternate modes typically ar evaluated within the context of modes other advantages and disadvantages eg costs price punctuality and speed when modal comparison are made they are typically limited to travel ie vehicle operations to transport

provide only partial picture of the environmental impacts of each transportation mode the analysis below indicates that current data do not c onclusively find barges superior to rail in terms of

conclusion that can be drawn from available data is that any advantages in total emissions that barge transport may have had in the past is likely to have decreased as result of converging fuel

impact partially depends on its proximity to urban areas and areas of significance such as national parks and the potential for human exposure particularly in nonattainment areas those areas failing to meet the national ambient air quality standards highways and rail lines generally pass through more urban areas than comparable waterways and thus their pollution may have greater significance than air pollution from barges76 safety safety of transportation modes can be compared based on accidents injuries and fatalities the environmenta l significance of accidents depends on many factors including human health exposure the environment of the accident and the ability to contain spill andor other dama ge barge traffic generally involves less urban exposure than either tr uck or rail and

restoration and navigation obj ectives under dualpurpose authorization and whether longterm ecosystem restoration is compatible with highly managed navigation system main area of disagreement among stakeholders over umriww ecosystem restoration opinions is the question of how closely investments in navigation expansion should be tied to investme nts in ecosystem restorati on some environmental groups see ecosystem restoration as necessary to mitigate damage caused by the ongoing operations and ma intenance of the umriww and believe that appropriations should not be made for additional navigation measures without investing in ecosystem restoration they propose that appropriations for ecosystem restoration and navigation f unding should be linked navigation and agricultural groups believe that ecosystem restora tion should be funded on its own merits separate from navigation impr ovements in other words the basic question on which stakeholders disagree is why is ecosystem restoration part of the corps preferred plan is it mitigationrehabilitation for the ongoing navigation project or is it separable from the navigati on improvement project

see crs report rs20866 the civil works program of the ar my corps of engineers primer by nicole t carter and betsy codyappendix b early history of corps involvement in umriww for much of the united states early history only the lower portion of the mississippi river between st louis and the gulf of mexico was navigable in its natural state the mississippi rive r above st louis was significantly less navigable due to unpredictabl water flows and fluctuati ons in the channel location and depth since the mid1800s federal interven tion on the umr primarily under the auspices of the corps has sought to address the problem of navigability101 see table a3 in 1878 congress authorized 4¬Ωfoot channel between minneapolis and st louis in 1907 6foot channel during the next two decades locks and dams 1 and 2 and what is now ck and dam 19 were authorized102 federal intervention was accelerated in 1930 when in an attempt to promote barge traffic and stimulate the economy of the midwest during the great depression congress authorized the corps to maintain 9f oot channel on the umr based on system of locks and dams this authorization resu lted in construction project consisting of 26 locks and dams on the umr that was fi nished in 1940 similarly construction of the presentday system of locks nd dams on the iww was completed during 19331939 under congressional authorization surge in wartime river traffic during the 1940s aided by the development of ne w fleet of diesel towboats saw the upper mississippi river finally emerge as an important route for freight traffic103 the corps activities on the umriww slowly grew bey ond navigation to establishing broader riverbasin developm ent plan series of flood control acts in 1936 1944 and 1950 subsequently au gmented the corps role in flood control activities and large multipurpose projects under these various authorities the corps plans and undertakes flood contro l and navigation activ ities as part of its civil works program104 many navigation and flood control pr ojects are multipurpose they provide water supply recreation and hydro power in addition to navigation and flood control during the 1970s additional legislation and several executive orders further required the corps to consider the environmental impacts of its projects andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32470crs50 105 ibidactivities it is often the competing objectives of these different uses commercial recreational hydro power and environmental that make proposed changes to existing projects controversial today the corps at the direction of
