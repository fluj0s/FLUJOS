bridge publications inc newsletter date good communication what has passed in our society for good communication however is on level with oxcart travel over trackless deserts and mountain wastes the primitive communications systems which we use cannot carry the load either in adequate volume or with sufficient speed while transport of material has jumped from the sailing ship to the jet plane communications have advanced only to the equivalent of fultons steamboat telephone telegraph radio duplicators airmail and television may deceive us into thinking that communications is developed appropriately for our age but these are only mechanical aids they are not communications far more important than communicating devices are communicating people and communicating practices l ron hubbard this excerpt was taken from the book how to live though an executive by l ron hubbard fulton robert fulton 17651815 american engineer and inventor builder of the first profitable steamboat organizations and communication an article by l ron hubbard the survival of an organization depends upon its ability to perceive to compute and to remember all these take place within the tissues that form the communications system group like an individual must know what it has done what it is doing and what it intends to do group like an individual must have this data available immediately at will the more closely communications system including perception memory estimation of future efforts and relay of orders approximates the operation of the human mind the better the organization will function when the memory of the organization is resident only in the minds of few individuals that organization is not functioning as group and has real group memory but is only borrowing the memories of these individuals in lieu of1 having memory of its own this is highly unsatisfactory as with an individual so with group there is direct relationship between sanity and ability to communicate with records of the past as well as with perceptions of the present communication lines also have weaknesses communication line can be cut or interrupted or invalidated in five ways the first way is simply to cut the line to prevent any information from traveling on the line to pass despatches2 the second way is to pervert the line to alter the communications which are going on the line the third way is to select all constructive messages out of the line and leave all destructive messages on the line this is cutting the line by censorship the fourth way is to introduce destructive material into the line to load the line with entheta3 the fifth way is to glut4 the line to permit any and all material to go over it with selectivity those who are on the receiving end will get so much material to deal with that they will become careless and irresponsible in their handling of the material of course the most successful way to prevent communications from occurring is not to establish communication line in the first place this is what usually happens but if one is established it can be destroyed by cutting it by perverting it by censoring the theta by introducing entheta or by glutting the line there are at least three ways to glut the line one is to fail to evaluate despatches as to importance and velocity in system where traffic is heavy the receiver then has to read everything to find out which item to handle first another way is to permit messages to be verbose5 with much talk and little data another way is to save up great amount of material and then send it all at onceto send nothing for five days and then send 100000 words and then nothing for five days the receiver has so much to do all at once that he will tend to devaluate the communication in general if communicator carelessly lets two months worth of material on certain subject pile up on his desk and then releases it all at once people will be so stunned by the great volume that they will pay attention to it and the material may be lost communicator because he is communicator will want lines not to be cut in any of these ways he will have to know how to prevent their being cut and the first ability that he will need in order to prevent their being cut will be the ability to evaluate the material that goes over the line some items will be very important some not so important they must be evaluated some items whether important or not will have to be done right away if they are to be done at allthey will have in other words high velocity they must be so evaluated by the communicator the importance and velocity of every message must be written on it by the communicator so that the receiver if he has pile of hundred messages will know which to handle first and which to follow up the most frequently in order to be able to evaluate messages in this way the communicator must know as much about the operation of the organization as the man who is sending the order he must make his own evaluation of the message the man who is sending the order may say to the communicator this order for orchids for my wife is top priority top velocity message mark it that way and send it out immediately it is all right for the executive to say this but it is not all right for the communicator to comply with his requestunless the order really is top priority and big rush it is up to the communicator to decide how this message will be communicated he will probably rate it high velocity if the orchids are to arrive that nightbut he will undoubtedly rate it low importance this will mean to the communication system that if other work is not too pressing orchids should be purchased for mrs executive that afternoonor not at all since there may well be time limit marked on the message before 500 pm or something of the sort if an executive tries to force his evaluation of an order on the communicator or if he will not the communicator know how the order relates to the rest of the operation or if he generally hides information from the communicator the communications system but just that much will cease to operate properly and communications will begin to fail whenever an executive acts as though the communicator were not good enough or trustworthy enough to know about something the executive will be cutting communication line because he will be depriving the communicator of the data he needs to be able to evaluate the material which the executive deigns6 to give him an order which was the most important thing that this executive could think of might not be the most important thing that could happen in the organization it would be up to the communicator of that executive to know the importance of the order in relation to everything that was being handled by the communications system if he didnt know it would be up to him to ask the central communications office to evaluate it for him the communicator is interested in the executives opinion of the importance of this message he may even concur with it but he may not and the communicators opinion is the one that counts in lowtoned organization executives from the head janitor on up will try to keep everything secret this will make it difficult for the communications system to evaluate their communications the number of items which have to be classified for security in an organization which has constructive and creative goals and plans should be very small sometimes in such an organization we find an individual from whose desk there is niagara7 of secret and confidential communications everything this individual sends out must be delivered in person must be delivered only to the addressee is sealed with wax and must only be sent by special trusted messenger open one of these messages and you find joe will you come over to my office for closed conference bill it so secret he cannot even say it in secret communication this individual is accomplishing only one thing with all this secrecy he is causing whatever meager communication lines there are in the organization to fail everything which is kept secret becomes an unknown in the equation which is set up to evaluate and expedite communications only few of these unknowns are necessary to make correct evaluation impossible every order or job which is kept secret will raise the chances of duplication8 or
