while this report to congress specifically identified the requested documents as rela ting to the four categ ories listed above it should be noted that gaos scaling back of its request related only to

as outlined below is based on such prelitigation statem ents by the administration statutory issues the comptroller general s suit marks the first time gao has exercised its authority to sue an executive branch entity in an effort to obtain information pursuant to 31 usc 716 accordingly novel questions have been raised regarding the scope of gaos authority to inves tigate and sue executive branch entities gaos investigat ive authority gaos primary audit authority is derived from section 312a of the budget and accounting act of 192111 currently codified at 31 usc 712 this provision in pertinent part directs the comptroller general to investigate all matters related to the receipt disbursement and use of public money12 additionally 31 usc 717b empowers the comptrolle r general to evaluate th results of program or activity the government carries out under existing law based on this authority gao has requested access to the aforementi oned information regarding the nepdg on the grounds that both 712 and 717b author ize such an inquiry in response the vice president has argued that neither provision imbues the gao with authority sufficient to support its position the vice presidents refusal to acknowledge gaos asserted authority under these provisions has led to gaos lawsuit necessitating an analysis of the provisions of 712 and 717 regarding 712 the vice president has sserted that it merely provides gao with the authority to conduct an audit of the costs incurred by the nepdg and does not provide any basis for its requests for such information as the names of nepdg meeting attendees while this interpretation is plausible under the plain terms of the statute it should be noted that the expr ess language of 712 vi ewed in relation to relevant legislative history indicates that congress inte ntion that gao serve broad role specifically 7121 states that the co mptroller general is to investigate all matters related to the receipt disbursement and use of pub lic money this language as enacted in 1921 was designed according to one member to ensure that the comptroller general shall concern himself not simply with taking in and paying out money from an accountants point of view but that he shall also concern himself with the question as to whether it is economically and efficiently applied13 this conception was reiterated in 1980 the budget and accounting act of 1921 provides sufficiently broad and comprehensive authority to inves tigate all matters relating to the receipt disbursement and applicati on of public funds this

program opera tion by the executive branch14 belying these statement to some degr ee gao did not utilize its full statutory authority initially serving congress th roughout the 1920s and 1930s primarily by auditing vouchers to ensure the accuracy of payments15 however congress has explained that governmental expansion s necessarily increased its reliance on gao to provide it with esse ntial information about federal programs particularly in light of its statutory authority to participat directly in the oversight process as an independent congressional entity16 turning to 717b the vice president has argued against its application on the basis that it only authorizes the comptroller general to evaluate the results of program or activity the government carries out under existing law17 specifically in light of the fact that the nepdg was created by presidential order as opposed to statute the vice president maintains that its activities do not constitute program or activity carried out under existing law for the purposes of 71718 in response gao has stated that the term existing w absent any qualif ier or limitation refers to all sources of law while both positions are tenable prio r gao practice could be interpreted as supporting the notion that its statutory authority extends to entities such as the nepdg in particular gao has previously investigated similarly situated entities such as the white house china trade relations group and the presidents task force on health care reform reportedl receiving sufficient responses to its inquiries19 furthermore in 1980 when enactin g the enforcement mechanisms of 31 usc 716 congress specifically contempl ated gaos authority to investigate pertinent activities of the president nd his advisers without questioning its underlying authority to engage in such activity indicating an assumption on the parthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31397crs5 20see n33 and accompanying text infra 21it might be argued th at gaos interpretation of its authority is entitled to deference under chevron v natural resources defense council 467 us837 1984 this point is especially pertinent in light of congress termination that the

with information regarding the du ties powers activitie s organization and financial transactions of the agency22 to effectuate this di rective and buttress gaos investigative power 716 also imbues the comptroller general with the ability to demand the release of relevant record s and to sue for their production by noncomplying agency specifically under 716 b1 the comptroller general may make written request to the head of an agency that has failed to make records available the comptroller generals letter must state the authority for inspecting the records and the reason for inspection upon recei pt of such letter the head of the agency is afforded 20 days to respond scribing the records withheld and the reasons therefore in the event that the requested records are not released for inspection within the 20 day response peri od the comptroller general may file report with the president the director of om b the attorney general the head of the relevant agency and congress twenty days after the filing of the report the comptroller general is authorized to file it in the district court of the united states for the district of columbia to require the head of the agency to produce the requested records23 this authority is tempered however by 716d which enables the executive branch to preclude suit by the gao on certain grounds in particular 716d1 prevents the comptroller general from bringing suit if the requested records pertain to matters designated as foreign intellig ence or counterintelligence activities by the president or in instances where the record s are statutorily exempted from disclosure additionally the president or director of the omb may preclude suit under 716d1c by certifying to the comptro ller general and congress that record may be withheld under 5 usc 552b5 or 5 usc 552b7 of the freedom of information act and that disclosure reasonably could be expected to impairhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31397crs6 2431 usc 716d1c such

vice president has also stated that gao may not request nepdg records based on the fact that while 717b3 states that an evaluation may be requested by committee of congress with jurisdiction over the program or activity the current investigation was initiated at the behest of two individual congressmen while literal reading of 717b3 would seem to support this position the supreme court rejected an identical argument in bowsher v merck co 460 us 824 844 1983 stating that if the records sought by gao are within the scope of the accesstorecords provisions the fact that the comptroller generals request had its origin in the requests of congressmen or that the gao reported the data to congress does not vitiate its author ity it should also be noted that 717b1 empowers the comptroller general to conduct an investigation on his own initiative 2631 usc 7011 31 usc 717a 27franklin v massachusetts 505 us 788 1992 28id at 801substantially the operati ons of the government24 in the present case the president did not avail himself of the certification provision within the allotted period of time thereby enabling the comptroller general to bring suit under 716b2 it should be noted however that the administration may nonetheless choose to assert that the requested information is privile ged independent of 716d1c based upon the investigatory and enfo rcement authority outlined above gao maintains that it has authority to bring suit to compel disclosure of the requested nepdg records conversely the administra tion asserts that the comptroller general may not bring suit under 716 arguing 1 that gaos lack of investigatory authority under 712 and 717 prevents an enforcement action and 2 that neither the vice president nor the nepdg qualify as an agency that may be subjected to such an action25 the first prong of the vice presidents argument hinges upon the proper interpretation of the investigative authority vested in the comptroller general as discussed above regarding the second prong of the vice presidents argument review of the relevant statutory provi sions and case law reveals countervailing principles that could influence the determination of the issue chapter 7 of title 31 appears to define agency quite broadly to include department agency or instrumentality of the united states government or the district of columbia expressly excluding the legislative branch and the supreme court26 in franklin v massachusetts the supreme court determined that the term agency as employed in the administrative procedure act apa could not be construed to include the president27 specifically at issue was whether provisions of the apa authorizing review of final agency action applied to the presidential action taken pursuant to statute28 the court noted that while

to objections by the executive branch that the enforcement authority contained in 716 could endanger the confidentiality of highly sensitive continuedno express provision removes the president from its ambit despite the negative implication that presidential actions ar covered under the apa arising from the express preemption of the other bodies th court held the statute inapplicable explaining this decision the court stated that out of respect for the separation of powers and the unique constitutional position of the president it would require an express statement by congress before assuming it intended the presidents performance of his statutory duties to be reviewed under the apa29 given the status of the vice president as cons titutional officer and the proximity of the nepdg to the president it is possible that reviewing court would likewise require an explicit statement from congress prior to acknowledging gaos authority in the present scenario it is important to note however that the legislative history surrounding the enactment of 716 indicates that congress intended for the president and his principal advisers to be subject to suit potentially mitigating the effect of the courts decision in franklin30 discussing the ability of the president or the director of omb to prevent suit by the comptroller general the senate report accompanying the general accounting office act of 198031 states with regard to enforcement actions at the presidential level certifications provided for under sec tion102d3 currently 31 usc 716 d1c of the bill are intended to authorize the president and the director of the office of management and budget to preclude suit by the comptroller general against the president and his principal advisers and assistants and against those units within the executive office of the president whose sole function is to advise and assist the president for information which would not be availa ble under the freedom of information act32 from this statement it appears that congress intended to imbue the comptroller general with the authority to file suit against the president and his principal advisers specifically it seems th at there would be reason for congress to provide the certification provision unle ss the president and his advisers were covered given this apparent intention it would appear that congress conceived of the term agency as used in chapter 7 of title 31 as necessarily including the president and his principal advisers furthermore the structure of the certification provision itself contemplates high level access by gao given that it enables the president to prevent access to deliberative information that could impair substantially the operati ons of the government33 thus while the president and

find the st ructure and legislative history of 716 sufficiently explicit to allow suit against the vice president or the nepdg in the current case constitutional issues while the aforementioned statutory argume nts have been cite d by both parties as being dispositive of the current controversy the vice president has also made general statements indicating that the administration views its position as necessary to protect the constitutional prerogatives of the executive branch while there has been formal articulation of the basis for constitutional challenge the vice president and other officials in the bu sh administration ve made general statements implicating congressional authority to delegate investigative and access enforcement authority to gao as well as the doctrine of executive privilege congressional delegation of investigative authority to properly elucidate an analysis of the ability of congress to delegate investigatory and subpoena enforcement au thority to the gao it is first necessary to consider the scope of c ongress oversight authority while there is definitive constitutional or statutory provision imbuing congress with investigative authority long line of supreme court precedent establishes congress power to engage in oversight and investig ation of any matter related to its legislative function34 unless there is c ountervailing constitutional privilege or selfimposed statutor restriction upon its authority congress possesses the essentially unfettered power to compel necessary information from executive agencies private persons and or ganizations even though the constitution does not contain any express provisi on authorizing congress to conduct investigations and ta ke testimony in support of its gislative functions the supreme court has held conclusi vely that congressional investigatory power is so essential that it is implicit in the general vesting of legislative power in the congress35 in eastland v united states servicemans fund for instance the court stated that the scope of its power of inquiry is as penetrating and farreaching as thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31397crs9 36421 us at 504 n 15 quoting barenblatt

1976 eastland v united states servicemens fund 421 us at 504505potential power to enact and ppropriate under the constitution36 also in watkins v united states the court emphasized that the power of the congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legi slative process that power is broad it encompasses inquiries concerning the ad ministration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes37 the court further stressed that congress power to investigate is at its peak when focusing on alleged waste fraud abuse or maladministration within government department specifically the court explained that the investigative power comprehends probes into departme nts of the federal government to expose corruption inefficiency or waste38 the court went on to note that the first congresses held inquiries dealing with suspected corruption or mismanagement of government officials39 given these factors the court recognized the power of the congress to i nquire into and publicize corruption maladministration or inefficiencies in the agencies of government40 as corollary to this accepted oversight authority the supreme court has likewise determined that the issuance of subpoenashas long been held to be legitimate use by congress of its power to investigate41 in particular the court has repeatedly cited the principle that legislative body cannot legislate wi sely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change and where the legi slative body does not itself possess the requisite information whic h not infrequently is true recourse must be had to others who do possess it experience s taught that mere requests for such information often are unavailing and also that information which is volunteered is not always accurate or complete so some means of compulsion are essential to obtain what is needed all this was true before and when the constitution was framed nd adopted in that period the power of inquiry with enforcing process was regarded and employed as necessary and appropriate attribute of the power to legislateindeed was treated as inhering in it42 given that these cases establish congress expansive authority to investigate and compel information from the executive branch the question turns to whether this power may be delegated to an agent of the legislative branch it is well established that congress possesses the fundamental ab ility to delegate i nvestigative authority to an entity such as gao in buckley v valeo for instance the supreme court while invalidating certain functi ons of the federal electi on commission on appointmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31397crs10 43424 us 1 137 1976 44see buckley v valeo 424 us at 140141 springer v

conclusion adheres irrespective of the supreme courts decision in bowsher v synar 478 us 714 1986 in bowsher the court addressed the constitutiona lity of the grammrudman deficit reduction act under the act the continuedclause grounds stated that insofar as the powers confided in the commission are essentially of an investigative nature falling in the same general category as those powers which congress might delegate to one of its own committees there can be question that the commission as presently constituted may exercise them43 it is also possible that the vice president will assert that the initiation of lawsuit by gao to enforce its statutory ri ght of access pursuant to 716 violates the separation of powers doctrine this contention would hinge on the argument that the gao lawsuit constitutes the execution of the laws of the united states power which is committed solely to the executive branch44 review of the applicable law indicates that the statutory enforcement scheme of 716 appears to comport with constitutiona l requirements in pa rticular reviewing courts have determined that enforcement of subpoena through judicial process is not execution of the laws of the united states as contemplated for separation of powers purposes such determination was made in mcdonnell douglas corp v united states where the court of appeals for the eighth circuit addressed challenge to the cons titutionality of gaos access enfo rcement authority45 rejecting the argument that an enforcement suit by gao constituted execution of the law in violation of the separation of powers doctrine the cour t stated that gaos suit was far from being case in which the c omptroller general brought suit against mcdonnell douglas corporation for breachin g the law the comptroller general in this case was merely seeking information for legitimate investigative purpose46 further stressing the legitimate investigative nature of gaos suit the court went on to explain that the issuan ce of judicially enforceable subpoena was necessary to accomplish its investigative mission and that determination to the contrary would render meaningless the comptroller genera ls role as an investigating arm of congress47 similar conclusion was reached by the court of appeals for the federal circuit in re lated case the power of the executive under the constitution to execute the laws is not involve d here the 1980 act does not erode the executives authority48 based on these two appeals court rulings it is possible that reviewing court would uphold gaos access enforcement authority in the current case as it pertains to information sought in aid of gaos investigatory duties as distinguished from activities constituting execution of the laws of the united states49httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31397crs11 49continued comptroller general was empowered to review deficit estimates from the office of management and budget and the congressiona l budget office and to mandate spending reductions to meet specified deficit level the court found that the act imbued the comptroller general an official appointed by the president but removable by congress with the power to interpret provisions of the act and to dictate the means by which the executive branch implemented budget reduction measures id at 728 the court determined that the comptroller general legislative br anch officer was performing the functions of an executive officer in executing law passed by congress duty constitutionally committed to an officer of the executive branch id at 733 this dynamic rendered the act unconstitutional according to the court since permitting the execution of the laws to be vested in an officer answerable only to c ongress would in practical terms reserve in congress control over the execution of laws in violation of the separation of powers doctrine id at 726 as the factors cited by the cour t indicate the scope of the holding in bowsher is clearly limited to instances where congressional agents are imbued with the authority to execute the laws as such it seem s evident that the ability of gao to bring suit pursuant to legitimate

statutory nd constitutional issues discussed above it is possible that the administration may assert that the requested information is covered by the doctrine of executive privilege just as the constitution contains provisions authorizing the investigatory and oversight functions of congress ther is likewise express grant of executive privilege however beginning with president washington the executive branch has claimed that the separation of powers doctrine implies that the president possesses the power to withhold confidential informati on in the face of legislative and judicial demands50 politically speaking it is rare for interbranch disputes over contested information to reach the courts for judicial determination on the merits consequently the existence of presidential confidentiality privilege was not judicially established until the watergate era when the courts recognized the presidential confidentiality privilege as an inherent aspect of presidential power51 in united states v nixon the supreme court addressed claim of executive privilege in response to subpoena issued during cr iminal trial to the president at the request of the watergate special prosecutor th supreme court found constitutional basis for the doctrine of executive privilege noting that whatever the nature of the privilege of confidentiality of presidential communications in the exercise of article ii powers the privilege can be said to derive from the supremacy of each branchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31397crs12 52united states v nixon 418 us at 705 53id at 707 54id at 706 55id at 685

communications to be presumptively privileged there was support for the cont ention that the privilege was absolute precluding judicial review whenever assert ed as such conclusion would upset the constitutional balance of workable government53 in particular the court explained that when the privilege depe nds solely on the br oad undifferentiated claim of public interest in the confidentiality of such c onversations confrontation with other values arises absent national security secrets we find it difficult to accept the argument that even the very important interest in confidentiality of presidential communications is significantly diminished by production of materials needed to enforce criminal statutes54 upon determining that cla im of privilege is not ab solute the court weighed the presidents interest in confidentiality against the judiciarys need for the materials in criminal proceeding stating that it wa s necessary to resolve those competing interests in manner that preserves the essential functions of each branch concluding this calculus the court held that the judicial need for the tapes as established by demonstrated specific need for evidence in pending criminal trial was of greater significance than the presidents generalized interest in confidentiality55 it should be noted that the court specifically limited the scope of its decision stating that it was not c oncerned with the balance between the presidents generalized interest in c onfidentialityand cong ressional demands for information56 coupled with related nd subsequent decisions the courts decision in nixon established the contours of the presidential communications privilege57 pursuant to the standards developed in these cas the president may invoke the privilege when asked to produce documents or othe r materials that reflect presidential decisionmaking and deliberations and th at the president believes should remain confidential58 as noted above such an invocati on renders the requested materials presumptively privileged requiring an ade quate showing of need to overcome the claim this standard was further clarified in in re sealed case hereinafter referred to

viewed any of the documents underlying the report he withheld 84 documents on the basis of executivedeliberative privilege the oi c moved to compel production of the withheld documents subsequent to in camera review the district court upheld the claims of privilege forwarded by the presid ent in its decision the court of appeals agreed generally with the district courts determination that the documents in question were subject to the presidential communications privilege60 however the court vacated and remanded in order to provide the oic an opportunity to provide sufficient justification for its need for certain items of evidence61 at the outset of its opinion the court distinguished between the presidential communications privilege and the deliberative process privilege noting that while the former has constitutional basis in the separation of powers doctrine the latter is common law privilege applicable to the decisionmaking of executive officials generally62 the court went on to explain that while both privileges are qualified the deliberative process privilege disappears altogether when there is any reason to believe government misconduct occurred whereas the presidential communications privilege is more diffi cult to surmount requiring focused demonstration of need even when there ar allegations of misc onduct by high level officials63 turning to the question of whether the subpoenaed documents could be claimed to be privileged even though the presiden t had never viewed them the court stated that the public interest is best served by holding that communications made by presidential advisers in the course of preparing advice for the president come under the presidential communications privilege even when these communications are not made directly to the president64 the court based this conclusion on what it characterized as the presidents dependence on presidential advisers and the inability of the deliberative process privilege to provide advisers with adequatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31397crs14 65id at 751752 66id at 752 regarding the standard of need necessary to overcome claim of privilege the court determined that party

sources65 further illuminating the scope of the privilege the court stated that it must apply both to communications which these advisers solicited and received from others as well as those they authored themselves the privilege must also extend to communications authored or received in response to solicitation by member s of presidential advisers staff since in many instances advisers must rely on their staff to investigate an issue and formulate the advice to be given to the president66 recognizing that decision extending the presidential communications privilege to presidential advisers could pose signif icant risk of expanding to large swath of the executive branch privilege that is bottomed on recognition of the unique role of the president the court limited th privilege to white house advisers and staff that are in operational proximity to presidential decisionmaking specifically the court stated that the privilege should not extend to staff outside the white house in executive branch agen cies instead the privilege should apply only to communications authored or solicited and received by those members of an immediate white house advisers staff who have broad and sign ificant responsibility for investigating and formulating the advice to be given to the president on the particular matter to which the communications relate only communications at that level are close enough to the president to be revelatory of his delib erations or to pose risk to the candor of his advisers67 the court went on to stress that the privilege was not applicable to information that does not call ultimately for direct decisionmaking by the president68 while the principles established above ar applicable to the current scenario it is unclear whether reviewing court would accept claim of privilege in the present case in particular it seems evident that the vice president and the staff of the nepdg would qualify as immediate white house advisers as conceived of in espy69 to the extent that the vice president and his staff were engaged in the investigation and formulation of advice to be given to the president regarding national energy policy substantial argument could be made that such information would fall within the ambit of the presidential communications privilege70 however it should be noted that in the present instance any assertion of privilege would probably be based on broad claim of public interest in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31397crs15 71see n5 and accompanying text supra 72walker v cheney complaint for declaratory and

president joseph curl cheney refuses demand by gao washington times at a1 a16 july 27 2001 confidentiality of the reque sted material specifically gaos current information request as outlined in the complaint is significantly less intrusive than the demands contained in the initial demand letter71 whereas gaos original request sought information that could be regarded as reflective of the deliberative product and processes of the nepdg the complaint as filed seeks documents that describe 1 who was present at each of the meetings conducted by the nepdg including th names of the attendees their titles and the office represented 2 with w hom the vice president as chair of the and each of the nepdg support staff met to gather information for the proposed national energy po licy including the name title and office or clients represented nd the date purpose agenda and location of the meetings 3 how the vice president the members of the nepdg or others determined who would be invited to the meetings and 4 the direct and indirect costs that were incurred in developing the proposed national energy policy72 accordingly while it is conceivable that the information requested in the complaint pertaining to the purpose and agenda of nepdg meetings with outside interests and the process by which the ne pdg determined who would be invited to such meetings could be construed as pr ivileged there is indication that the material is in any way related to the type s of information such as national security secrets that the supreme court deemed worthy of the highest levels of protection in nixon73 furthermore it seems unlikely that the material sought by gao would be deemed revelatory of presidential deliberations in light of the fact that it does not appear to relate to information that would call ultimately for direct decisionmaking by the president74 rather the material sought by gao appears to encompass information pertaining to the scope and co mposition of meetings that were to provide the basis for the subsequent formula tion of recommendations and advice to be presented to the president regarding the development of national energy policy75 thus to the extent that gaos request does not seek information regarding the direct deliberations of individuals in operational proximity to the president in formulating policy advice it would not appear that the concerns voiced by the court in espy would be implicated as such it is possible that reviewing court would not accept claim of privilege in the case at hand in this case much would depend on the courts interpretation of the scope of gaos request for informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31397crs16 conclusion in light of these factors it is evident that there are host of significant statutory and constitutional issues that may affect the ultimate outcome of walker v cheney as noted above while gaos investigator and access enforcement authority have strong historical and statutory basis there are competing principles of statutory interpretation that could influence the courts view of this authority as applied to the vice president likewise the aforementioned constitutional issues regarding the delegation of access enforcement authority to the gao and the applicability of the presidential communications privilege to the activities of the nepdg could prove to be of substantial signif icance finally it should also be remembered that the vice president has yet to file response to th gaos suit making it difficult to ascertain the scope of the issues that will ultimately confront the court indeed it would appear that the only certainty at this juncture is that the disposition of the current controversy will have significant impact on the future of legislative oversight in the congressionalexecutive context
