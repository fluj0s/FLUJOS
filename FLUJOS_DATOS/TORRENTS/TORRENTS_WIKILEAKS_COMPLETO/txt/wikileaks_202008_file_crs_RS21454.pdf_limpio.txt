resulting from the military confrontation the movement of refugees and the possible outbr eak of disease the level and breadth of humanitarian assistance would especially hinge on such circumstances longterm reconstruction require ments would be strongly aff ected by the length of the war the extent of destruction caused to oil production infrastructure possible efforts of groups such as the kurds to achieve au tonomy or independence and the level of cooperation provided by iraqi c itizens and government bureaucrat s availability of oil resources for reconstruction purposes and level of participation by other donors would help determine any potential assistance needs facing the united states the shape of reconstruction aid would in large measure spring from stillforming us policy decisions the administration has indicated that at least at the beginning it would rely on military rule this would give the united states broad control over the iraqi government and economy until progressi ve transition to iraqi administration is initiated1 while responsibility for administering postwar iraq woul d fall to general tom franks commander of u s central command the office of reconstruction and humanitarian assistance would be expected to produce plans for his use in filling that role at the same time the office would implement us assistance efforts in iraq initially as

post february 26 2003 who will pay for assistance to the united states the cost of postwar aid would be considerably higher if few other donors contribute given resistance of major aid donors france and germany thus far to support military action and their perhaps related failure thus far to contribute to emergency fund for potential iraqi war humanitarian relief it is possible that the ited states would be re quired to provide the bulk of reconstruction assistance that mig ht be the case especially if us military occupation did not leave many opportunities fo r other donors to influence events within iraq should the united stat be joined by few other donors the impact on the us fiscal deficit or the rest of the us fo reign aid budget could become issues funds diverted to iraq might negatively aff ect priority concerns elsewhere some have proposed that iraqi oil be used to pay for development andor an occupation regime holdings under th oilforfood program some suggest might also be drawn upon to pay for reconstruction needs12 the administration has stated that priority would be restoring and increasin g the amount of iraqi oil production in order to support the iraqi peoples needs indicatin g that oil would be used primarily for reconstruction and not for the adminis tration of the us occupation13 one analyst has pointed out that large additional claims on iraq i oil reserves debt arrears infrastructure repair and domestic fuel use for example would leave little money for many occupation and recons truction requirements14 others have stated that due to the decrepit condition of the industry it may take some years to substantia lly increase the flow of oil some believe however that the expectation of future iraqi oil wealth may be enough by itself to encourage significant official nd private sector lending for reconstruction other donors may contribute to total aid cost s however in similar crises the aid pledges of key donors have been slow to materialize c ongressional concerns regarding the failure of key european donors to promp tly provide assistance in kosovo led to legislative prohibition restricting us c ontributions to 15 of total

program longevity official prediction has been made regarding the length of us aid commitment the administration has indicated that the united states is committed to stay in iraq as long as necessary but not one day more15 the length of any aid program factor in determining co sts would depend on the nature of overall us intentions based on previous experien ces some have questioned the american

and role of military there would likely be many obstacles in the path of successful aid prog ram in iraq perhaps the most important of these is lack of security although some ai d groups work in countries in conflict neither grassroots organizations like the p eace corps nor many of the nongovernmental organizations ngos that implement aid pr ograms are prepared to enter an unsafe country experience in afghanistan has already demonstrated that longterm reconstruction may be severely limited in geographic scope and impact if programs are not able to function in secure environment part of the administrations rationale for bringing humanitarian and reconstruction aid coordination under the wing of the pentagon is to link the aid officials to s ecurity providers and information the current administration plan for iraq is that military commanders assisted by civilian disaster assistan ce response teams dart will be responsible for food distribution in the early stages afghanistan raises another cautionary note there driven by the need to show positive results from the ousting of the taliban the us military has been employed in reconstruction activities outside of the secured capital of kabul but this has raised the concern that local citizens will not be able to distinguish between military personnel and civilian velopment advisors putting th latter at greater risk implementation and c oordination concerns officials in the pentagons office of reconstruction and humanitarian assistance civilians apparently in charge of any necessary humanitarian relief recons truction and civil administration could face flood of critical decisions in coming mont hs regarding the shape and implementation of development projects the relative priority to be given the aid objectives noted earlier coordination with and ngo humanitarian and development efforts and the security concerns noted above are among the many issu they may confront aid officials may also play role in dealing with such cerns as the drafting of new constitution the role of exile iraqis and the vetting of pers onnel in the government and in aid projects to insure that saddam allies were removed however these are issues that would also deeply interest the military g overnment and the lines of re sponsibility between it and the aid coordination operation are not clear more than dozen us agencies are likely to participate in reconstruction efforts making coordination of assistance particularly desirable goal choosing an aid coordinator may be helpful but experience in the former soviet union suggests that it alone is insufficient and in the iraq situa tion the unusual lead aid role of the pentagon more commonly played by the department of state in other situations might further complicate the coordinators task any coordinator could need strong executive and congressional support allowing his office suffici ent authority to make final decisions with regard to interagency disputes strong coor dination may be critical at all levels of the implementation process within sectors d emocracy economic growth etc and within and among agencies
