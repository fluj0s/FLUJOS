officials with additional technologically upgraded equipment congress has also ta ken action to track the entry and exit of foreign visitors by mandating an automated entryexit system however its anticipated implementation at the northern border may not have an adve rse impact on travel as most canadian nationals will be exempt from the requirements of the system moreover there have been several binational initiatives aimed at making the border more secure while facilitating travel these initiatives are outlined in 30point plan which was signed by officials from both count ries in

the border patrols efforts to improv northern border security oig report i2002004legislative background1 congress has taken action to improve border security at and along the northern border congress has also take n action to track the entry and exit of foreign visitors by mandating an automated entryexit system following is sample of legislation that has been enacted into law in recent years personnel infrastructure and technology the northern border extends some 4000 miles and is the largest of the two borders compared to its southern counterpart the northern border historically has been understaffed and lacked the necessary infrastructure to adequately screen individuals seeking entry into the united states although the southern border has seen more illegal activities over the years there has been growing concern over the insuffici ent number of personnel assigned to the northern border the increasing amount of ille gal activity that occurs at the northern border and the potential for terrorists to sneak into the united states through the northern border there has also been concern with respect to the antiquated facilities at the northern border and the inadequate physical infrastructure to accommodate the increasing volume of traffic at the border 2 congress took action to address the afor ementioned problems by passing the usa patriot act pl 10756 the act authoriz ed the attorney general to triple the number of border patrol pe rsonnel and immigration inspector s along the northern border and authorized 50 million for the agency to make tec hnological improvements and to acquire additional equipment fo r the northern border the enhanced border security and visa entry reform act of 2002 pl 107 173 authorized add itional personnel and provided for technological and infrast ructure improvements at the borders more recently congress passed the intellig ence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 wh ich requires the secretar of homeland security secretary to increase the number of border patrol agents along the northern border by at least 20 each year fy2006 through fy2010 with respect to technology the act permits the secretary to establish pilot pr ogram that tests advan ced technologies ie sensors videos and unmanned aerial vehicles for border surveillance between ports of entry the act requires the program to opera in remote areas along the northern border and that the operation be coordi nated with other federal st ate local and canadian law enforcement and border security agencies th act also requires the secretary to design the program in such way that it has the capability to be expanded congress also passed several appropriations bills that authorized appropriations for immigration inspectors and border patrol agents for example the department of commerce justice and state the judiciary and related agencies appropriations act for fy2002 pl 10777 included 254 million for 348 additional immigration inspectors and 6635 million for 570 additional bor der patrol agents the department of defense appropriations act for fy 2002 pl 107117 authorized 558 million

gene ral to develop an automated system to record the entry and exit of every alien arrivi ng in and departing from the united states this provision became source of concern for border communitie s whose members feared that if section 110 were implemented it would cause gridlock at border crossings consequently congress amended section 110 in the 105th congress by extending the deadline for its implementation and by prohibiting significant disruption of trade tourism or other legitimate crossborder traffic once the system is in place congress further amended section 110 in the 106th congress by delaying the systems immediate implementation at all ports of entry and by requiring the system to use available data to record alien arrivals and departures without establishing additiona l documentary requirements following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks however congress requested that resources be directed to the immediate development and implementation of an automated entry and exit control system at all ports of entry the canadian government has expressed strong oppositi on to implementation of an automated entry and exit data system at nor thern ports of entry notwithstanding canadian citizens are exempt from some of the usvisit program requirements for example canadian nationals and some canadian landed immigrants are not required to present passport and are ofte n not required to obtain visa4 moreover canadian nationals are generally not re quired to obtain an i94 form arrivaldeparture record if they are entering the us temporarily for business or pleasure5 canadians who enter the us for purposes other than business or pl easure eg employment trade and diplomatic activities etc are issued an i94 form but may be able to omit their passport number and visa information from the form if they have not visited outside the western hemisphere6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21258crs4 7 see crs report rl32234 us visitor and immigrant status indicator technology usvisit program by lisa m seghetti and stephen r vina 8 in general canadians arriving at designated port of entry must in general comply with the biometric requirements however those canadian citizens who travel on temporary visits to the us and who do not apply for admission pursuan t to nonimmigrant visas do not have to supply the biometric information currently required by law see 69 federal register 468 472 the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 however requires all individuals traveling into the us to have passport or other document or combination of documents that the secretary of homeland secur ity deems sufficient to denote ones identity and citizenship by january 1 2008 the law does not require the documents to contain biometric identifier nor does it require all travelers seeking entry into the us to be vetted through the entry and exit database biometrics and travel documents7 congress first mandated biometrics in travel documents in iirira by requiring bo rder crossing cards bccs now referred to as laser visas for mexican nationals to have biometric identifier that is machine readable in addition to iirira the usa patriot act and the border security act both required biometrics in travel documents in order for foreign nationals to enter the us until recently however most canadian nationals were exempt from the documentary requirements for entry into the us8 previous binational cooperation both the united states and ca have taken measures to better secure the shared border while preventing disruption to the flow of people such efforts date back to 1995 and include the following 30point plan commonly referred to as the smart border accord signed on december 12 2001 to secure the bor der and facilitate the flow of lowrisk travelers throug h 1 coordinated law enforcement operations 2 intelligence sharing 3 infrastructure improvements 4 the improvement of compatible immigration databases 5 visa policy coordination 6 common biometric id entifiers in certain documentation 7 prescreening of air passengers 8 joint passenger analysis units and 9 improved processing of refugee and asylum claims joint statement of cooperation on border security and migration was signed on december 3 2001 by representatives from the united states and canada the joint statement of cooperation focused on detection and prosecution of security threats the disruption of illegal migration and the efficient management of legitimate travel mechanism for the two governments border communities andstakeholders to discuss issues of border management was established in 1999 commonly referred to as the canadaus partnership forum cusp the guiding principles that evolved from the discussions include 1 streamlining harmonizing and collaborating on border policies and management 2 ex panding cooperation to increase efficiencies in customs immigration law enforcement and environmental protections at and be yond the border and 3 collaborating on common threats from outside th united states and canadahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21258crs5 9 although individuals enrolled in nexus are precleared for inspection purposes they are subject to random cursory searches 10 the core agencies involved in ibets are the coast guard and immigration customs and law enforcement agencies from both countries 11 the concept of shared facilities is often used interchangeably with reverse inspections under reverse inspections inspections that are curren tly conducted at us port of entry are done in foreign country ie on the canadian side of th border crossing whereas in shared facility inspection officials from both countries are colocated in the same facility 12 see 96397 canadaus relations by carl ek the section entitled border security trade and commercial concerns by ian f fergusson p 21 13 preinspections are immigration inspections conducted at foreign ports of embarkation by united states authorities for passengers seeking entry into the us 14 calgary edmonton toronto va ncouver victoria winnipeg and montreal see 8cfr 1031current binational cooperation the us and canada have several binational initiatives aimed at improving border security and facilitating the gitimate flow of goods and pe ople following is sample of few of these initiatives nexus the nexus program permits preenrolled lowrisk travelers who are either citizen or legal permanent resident of the united states or canada expedited crossing at the border by preclear ing them for inspection purposes9 under the smart border accord nexus will expand to every major land border crossing at the northern border the united states nd canada have already expande d the program to twelve land border crossings two canadian international airports nexusair and there are plans to expand the program to the windsor detroit marina area nexusmarine integrated border enforcement teams ibet ibets are binational united states and canada multiagency law enforcement teams that target crossborder criminal activity10 ibets were originally set up as result of the 1995 join accord on our shared borders to target crossbor der crimes that usua lly involved illicit drug violations the smart border accord how ever expanded ibets to designated areas across the northern border and its focus s broadened to include counterterrorism measures shared facilities prior to the events of september 11 2001 the united states and canadian governments had taken measures to facilitate the prescreening of people and goods prior to their arrival at ports of entry for example in some instances the countries would permit immigrati on and customs officials to cooperate in each others country11 such an effort has been viewed by many not only as mechanism to facilitate travel but also as an intervention tool that allows for preclearance activities to occur away from the border such crossborder efforts however have not been without controversy12 preinspections13 currently preinspections of trav elers route to us air port of entry are allowed at seven canadian airports14 although preinspections at selected canadian international air ports have been in place for some time under may 2 2003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21258crs6 15 several subsequent laws extended the implemen tation of an entryexit control system deadline set forth in 110 of iirira and the enhanced border security and visa entry reform act of 2002 pl 107173 further requires implementa tion of an entryexit control systemagreement canada has agreed to allow travelers route to the united states to be inspected directly by us officials thus bypassing canadian inspection this agreement replaces 1974 agreement and clearly identif ies the authorities of us inspectors current issues several issues have been raised when ex amining the need for tighter border security while continuing to allow for the unimpeded flow of travel across the northern border in almost every case the need for binational cooperation is evident following is discussion of two such issues usvisit program the law requires an automated entryexit system at all ports of entry that records arrivals and departures of every alie n entering and exiting the country section 110 of the illegal immigration re form and immigrant responsibility act iirira division c of pl 10420815 the canadians currently do not want to implement similar system however there have been reports that the canadian government may introduce plan that would ve canadian customs officials collect exit information on noncitizens and pass it on to us officials ch plan could further aid the united states in identifying noncitizens who may enter the country the absence of such plan however could complicate u scanadian border ma nagement moreover as the us begins to implement an automated entry and exit control system the demand for improved infrastructure will be critical for the development of such system it is unclear if canada will facilitate such system by extending its infrastructure at the relevant border crossings north american perimeter security as the united states moves forward with implementing much of the security requirements in the patriot act and the border security act many fear that the tighter security requirements will impede the flow of people across the border some critics are dvocating for more open border the ideal of north american perimeter security cept has been around for several years and the basic premise of north american perime ter security would move inspections and enforcement activities away from the border such concept would essentially eliminate barriers to the movement of people and g oods across the shared border the border security act called for study to examine the feasibility of establishing north american perimeter security program th at would provide for increased cooperation with foreign governments on questions rela ted to border security the north american perimeter security however would require the harmonization of us and canadian immigration and refugee policies among other things although such harmonization of policies may be problematic following the events of 911 both countries have begun to harmonize other policies at incremental levels that coul d be viewed as pushing the border out ie preinspections and reverse inspections
