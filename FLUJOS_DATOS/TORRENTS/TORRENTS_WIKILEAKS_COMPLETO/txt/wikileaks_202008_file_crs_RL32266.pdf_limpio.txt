one of the proposals broadbased transaction tax or fee on february 3 2004 representative fattah introduced hr 3759 transform america transaction f ee of 2004 that required study of replacing current federal taxes with br oadbased transaction fee this report provides relevant background information on tr ansaction taxes or fees in general and discusses some of their mo re notable economic aspects broadbased transaction fee or tax is triggered by any transaction and is imposed either as percentage of transac tions full value or as flat fee most items are resold several times during the production process and every such transaction would be taxed this pyramid ing effect makes the tax different from other consumptionbased taxes such as sales and use taxes or valueadded taxes historically transaction taxes have been applied to limited number of transactions such as trades in various financial instruments while they were used in the united states and abroad they were never major revenue source transaction tax or fee may generate additional revenues for the federal government or substitute for existing ones in doing so it may reduce or eliminate existing distortions in the economic system but introduce distortions of its own for example transaction tax burden would fa ll more heavily on industries that involve large numbers of transactions its in troduction might induce firms to vertically integrate production which ma not be beneficial from social standpoint imposing the transaction tax in the financial market could possibly cause significant loss of trading volume to competing overseas markets on the other hand the transaction tax or fee might eliminate great deal of complexity from the taxation system it could be easier to administer and result in lower compliance and other related social costs it may also prevent excessive speculative trading in financia l instruments in addition it would be means to tax underground economic activities several tentative revenue estimates included in this report illustrate the revenue generating potential of broad based tax for example 05 tax on stock transfers would yield more than 656 billion year and 000006 tax on foreign exchange transactions would bring in just 43 billion in order to replace all federal receipts with the transaction tax revenues the rate would have to be set at about 43 per transaction possibly more this timate does not account for new federal programs envisioned by hr 3759 this report provides general background information but it does not evaluate any specific

report provides background information on trans action taxes and fees it uses these terms interchangeably since their economic impacts are identical mechanics of the transaction tax the transaction tax is triggered by transaction that uses any kind of payment instrument check cash credit card or anything else the tax may be collected on retail and wholesale sales pur chases of intermediate g oods and financial or other intangibles transactions taxpayers would become liable for the tax at the moment they are able to exercise control over piece of property or service regardless of the payment method the transaction tax may appear similar to the sales and use tax one of the major revenue sources for state and local governments but there is major distinction sales tax is charged only on sales to the final consumer of the product while the transaction tax would apply to intermediate users as well it also differs from value added tax vat commonly us ed by european countries since the vat is imposed only on portion of tran sactions value roughly the difference between an items selling price and its cost thus avoiding multiple layers of taxation1 transaction taxes may be asse ssed as percentage of the value of the transaction ad valorem or as flat fee per trans action for example when person buys 100 worth of groceries under the fixed rate tran saction tax the tax due would amount to 5 using 5 rate for illustration by the same token m oney management firm buying 1 million worth of bonds would incur 50000 liability an example of fixed fee would be 1 fee for any

exchange commission s ec in 2000 this tax raised revenues of 22 billion2 although after recent enactment of rate reductions the revenues are expected to drop3 in the late 1980s and early 1990s several

taxes are levied on pertransaction or perunit basis irrespective of an items value such as alcohol or tobacco taxes5 unlike the transaction tax the existing excise taxes apply only once for each product avoiding pyramiding effect in addition to federal taxes many stat and local governments impose levies on such transactions as sales of real property and vehicles or provision of telecommunication services the rates and ex act definitions of taxable events differ by jurisdiction worldwide many governments impose so kinds of transaction taxes for example on securities transfers specifics vary by country6 in many cases revenues raised are insignificant but in some inst ances they become noticeable for example the stt generated 42 of the governme nt general account revenue in

revenues equal to about 07 of the countrys gross domestic product gdp8 the ongoing discussions in the economic literature on transaction taxes are focused in narrow areas such as currency ex change or the stt for example james tobin put forward an idea of taxing curre ncy transactions which came to be known as the tobin tax in order to stabilize exchange rates not to raise revenues9 however other proponents of the tax would like to tap its revenue potential mosthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32266crs4 10 belgium set to approve tobin tax despite protests from eu officials daily tax report 228 nov 29 2004 p g4recently belgian parliament approved nati onal tobin tax but it is unclear whether it would ever become effective10 impact of transaction tax on economic behavior generally speaking any tax changes behavior of economic agents since it alters costs and benefits associated with deci sions they make consequently imposing taxes in competitive market typically lead s to economic inefficiency however the taxation mechanism does affect how economic agents respond to it and tax burden per is just one part of the equation different tax stru ctures can raise exactly the same revenues and yet create very different sets of incentives if the transaction tax revenues replace some other federal receipts the aggregate tax burden on the us economy as whole w ould remain constant at the same time separate taxpayers burdens may end up higher or lower by eliminating or reducing some existing federal taxes the transaction tax may cut efficiency losses and distortions associated with them for example if revenues from the new tax allow reduction in marginal income tax rates firms might be willing to undertake projects that were not economically profitable in the past and workers would be more willing to supply bor than before on the other hand the transaction tax would introduce its own dist ortions into the economic system its burden would still fall on both labor and investment inco although burden shares may shift transaction tax may be imposed several times on an item as manufacturers and distributors buy and sell it before it finds its way to the final consumer this pyramiding effect occurs because the tax pplies to the full transaction value without any credit for the previously paid taxes at every stage of the production chain the tax becomes cost ultimately incorporated in the output prices therefore even though the nominal tax rate can be set at relatively low level th effective rate may end up being multiple of that rate these multiple layers of taxation would affect different s ectors of the economy in different ways for exam ple offering legal services may require minimal supply chain with correspondingly low total trans action tax bill in contrast an aircraft manufacturer would have to include in the fi nal price transaction taxes paid by all of its suppliers from mining companies to elect ronics vendors thus the effective tax rate would differ across goods and generally such variation is likely to create more distortions than tax imposed at uniform effective rate transaction tax creates incentives to minimize the number of transactions necessary to manufacture pr oduct and bring it to the fina l consumer one of the fundamental tenets of economics suggests that specializ ation and trade are two of the key driving forces of economic devel opment because through specializationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32266crs5 11 bank for international settlements statistical annex in triennial central bank survey 2001 march 2002 visited on feb 20

specialized skills in the absence of transaction taxes each firm can choose between inhouse production or outsourci ng taking into account actual costs associated with every option after impositi on of transaction tax this choice would become artificially skewed towards internalizing production even though there is advantage to the society as w hole in this mode of operation transaction tax liability is present regardless of whether company makes or loses money many sectors of the economy are cyclical in nature the necessity to pay the tax may become significant burden for companies especially in cyclical industries and startups knowing that they have to pay the tax even if the venture is unprofitable may discourage companies fro m taking entrepreneurial risks in addition companies would have to keep rger cash reserves to service their tax liability in bad year which implies lower return on capital and economic inefficiency many of the problems discussed above are present regardless of changes in individual taxpayers absolute tax liabilities their total transaction taxes may be lower than the taxes they currently face yet this lower absolute burden would not eliminate the above distortions imposition of the tax may put at disa dvantage domestic financial markets that compete internationally in essence the largest financial centers in new york tokyo and london operate globally around theclock and geographic location of buyers and sellers is of little importance the industry turnovers are huge for example average daily foreign exchange gross turnover in the us was 287 billion in april of 200111 in the same year total market value of equity and options sales on the us exchanges exceeded 13 trillion12 tiny fluctuations in securities prices generate huge cross border capital flows as result of transaction tax trading activity might flee the us in favor of other sites for example umlauf13 cites the historical example of sweden which increased its

provides an estimate of over 3 billion hours and as much as 100 billion annually18 replacing federal individual and corpor ate taxes with transaction tax may eliminate substantial portions of this burden to society for example most individual taxpayers may longer need to file an annual federal ta x return the magnitude of this cost reduction would depend on exact imp lementation of the reform and on other factors such as whether states follow suit and repeal their income taxes or whether any tax preferences remain under the new system transaction tax would discourage short term speculative trading in financial markets in favor of longterm investments in any time period shortterm traders execute far more trades than longter m investors and therefore would pay proportionately more in tran saction taxes this was th rationale behind the tobin tax tobin first proposed it to prevent shortterm trading that led to excessive exchange rate volatility and by many acc ounts exacerbated currency crises to the extent these assertions are valid trans action tax could improve overall welfare at the same time many researchers believe that frictionless financial markets are essential to an efficient allocation of resources transaction tax may capture some of the revenues from an underground economic activity that currently evades taxation since illicit income remains undeclared the

under the plan on the other hand the transaction tax may induce broader use of undocumented cash payments to reduce tax liability the transaction taxs revenueraising potential how much revenue can be raised by appl ying the tax to specific sectors of the economy that either were subject to such taxes historically or were considered as candidates for this tax what would be the transaction tax rate necessary to substitute all current federal revenue s ources as envisioned by hr 3759 the analysis in this section attempts to provide some ballpark estimates to answer these questions in static world estimating the revenue potential would be as simple as multiplying the tax rate by the total domes tic transactions turnover in reality however the tax would alter economic agents behavior with corresponding change in the total volume of transactions the response to the levy would not be uniform across economic sectors and would depend on specifics of the law thus the rate estimates in this section try to capture just the most potent dynamic effects and are highly tentative one of the industries historically subject to transaction taxes is the financial sector imposition of the tax may cause dramatic reduction in its transaction volumes the most sensitive markets are likely to be foreign exchange number of estimates of the maximum rate that does not shut down trading in the market were developed in the past for example garb er points out that for tax on transactions in foreign exchange markets imposed unilaterally 61000 of basis point or 000006 is realistic maximum magnitude19 assuming that the rate of 000006 causes reduction of trading volume the tax on foreign currency exchange transactions would yield just 43 billion year despite an annua l turnover in dozens of trillion dollars other financial markets are somewhat less prone to cross border migration and therefore the tax rate ceilings are higher as mentioned above the united states currently imposes the tax on securities tran sactions at 00033 rate in the uk similar tax known as stamp duty has 05 rate20 and in some countries it is even higher than that it is unclear thoug h if these rates are sustainable in the long run given increasing ec onomic openness worldwide assuming 05 rate on over 13 trillion in stock and options transactions the static revenue estima is 656 billion but most likel actual revenues would fall far short of this figure the revenues depe nd on transaction volume and it would fall because of the negative relation of tur nover to transaction costs

value of an elasticity of 15 means that say 5 increase in trans action costs would result in 75 reduction in transaction volume hubbard lists so of the elasticity estimates ranging from 026 to 17 with the 026 estimate bein g obtained in 1976 before industry deregulation21 since the elasticity value typically is not constant across cost ranges the estimates would work well only for relatively small change in transaction costs by contrast 05 tax can easily exceed th bidask spread the difference between stocks selling and buying prices implying percentage change in transaction costs of more than 100 therefore one might expect significant turnover reduction and lower federal revenues trading in other financia l assets such as nongove rnmental bonds and swaps would generate additional re venue however it may be difficult to establish rate pattern that would treat all financial instrument s equally without such an equality trading is likely to concentrate in the mostfavored market since it is often possible to substitute one type of security for another for example an investor can buy derivatives portfolio that would repli cate regular stock share this tax minimization behavior would further drain revenues the rates of 000006 and 05 were selected as illustra tions of realistic rates for the unilaterally imposed tax setting higher rates might virtually shut down financial markets in the united states and move the activity abroad however in the case of coordinated interna tional tax policy it could be possible to set them higher from the technical standpoint the ta x on financial instruments would be relatively easy to implement it can piggyback on the existing tax on share issuance and transfers levied by the federal government or on similar taxes levied by individual states in fact the ease of transaction taxs technical implementation and enforcement attracted some of the count ries with weak collection enforcement systems levying the tax on transactions going through the federal reserve bank system fed would be one of the most technica lly feasible implementation options for broadbased transacti on tax described in hr 3759 the fed timates the daily volume of payments at more than 3 tr illion which puts the annual total at over 750 trillion22 however this is the composite of all payments including fedwire and clearing house

showdoccfmindex1821sequence0table1the total of these transfers is so large in part because many members engage in overnight transactions which probably would not become part of the taxable base such transactions are performed every business day and since every one of them would carry tax or fee the effective levy rate may get prohibitively high even though the nominal rate is set low for example at the nominal rate of 001 the effective annual rate ends up at 5 rendering many transactions useless24 one of the less elastic parts of the da ily turnover is retail noncash payments retail in this context means paymen ts made by individuals businesses and government entities but not largevalue f unds transfers discu ssed above gerdes reported that in 2000 the value of retail noncash payments was 466 trillion25 this figure does not include on us checks checks deposited at the same institution on which they were drawn estimated at 29 of the total check transactions or about 114 trillion there are two more missing parts so portion of payments in the united states are processed by private networks and may never pass through the fed it is difficult to put specific number on the valu of these transactions due to the lack of consistent data nd potential doublecounting another missing piece is cash payments according to some estimates retail cash transactions equaled less than 1 trillion in 199926 in addition they are predominantly small payments that are most likely to be underreported for this reason and due to the lack of data on total cash transactions value the estimate does not account for them in 2000 federal government payments that presumably would not be subject to the transaction tax cons tituted about 15 of all retail noncash payments27 subtracting them from the sum of repor ted retail noncash payments and on us checks gives the taxable base of 573 trillion more than five and half times the annual gdp the congressional budget ffice cbo reported federal revenues of 19912 billion in 200128 transaction tax at the flat rate of 43 would theoretically raise sufficient revenues to replace existing taxes based on the debatable assumption that there would be little reduction in retail transaction volume in response to the tax introduction this estimate does not acc ount for new federal programs envisioned by hr 3759httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32266crs10 29 geoffrey r gerdes and jack k walton p 367a flat fee approach probably would not yield much revenue the bulk of all transactions are relatively low in value for example almost half of all checks in 2000 were written for 100 or less about 87 did not exceed 1000 and over 98 were below 1000029 therefore even relatively low fee may become prohibitive tax burden on lowvalue transactions for example person buying bottle of soda for 150 would face 67 tax if the fee wa s set at just 100 per transaction these considerations put cap on the re venue potential under this approach introducing progressive fee schedule w ould also not solve the problem most taxpayers would be able to avoid higher fees by splitting up their transactions into small payments subject to lower fees on the other hand technical implementation of such mechanism becomes considerably more difficult the general nature of this report does not allow an evaluation of each option in greater detail for the same reason it is difficult to address some of the important issues such as tax preferences or distributional effects implementation of the transaction tax would represent major ch ange of the taxation system and it would require careful study to make re its implications are well understood
