6307c16 shspec255 tips on running r3r auditing engrams and gpms is new world to many auditors especially to those who learned different kind of engram handling this doesnt invalidate yesterdays techniques they have their place especially in the field of healing we can heal things although we have neglected this area of responsibility for which reason we are being attacked in the area so we will collect and publish what we can do r212 for instance can have fantastic results when done as limited process just dont do more than four oppositions on one item get one ri do two or three oppositions and be happy with it the pc has been beaten down by his experiences on the whole track he thinks nothing good can happen in the universe when one goodness occurs it is almost too much for him to have that is different zone of expectancy from making clears and ots people wouldnt be able to conceive what you meant if you said that you were making clears and ots although in fact they would believe you and feel very uneasy about it you would have restimulated bypassed charge and they will always get cross with you in all auditing dont stir up more charge than you can handle if you apply that to any process you run or to any program you formulate you will have happy pcs the worse off case is the less you stir up this goes directly in the teeth of the q and that is yesteryears mental sciences the effect scale has to be observed at low levels the person cannot receive much of an effect so you have to featherweight the effect to let the pc receive it the more desperate the case the more featherweight the cure the technology of the preliminary assessment step for r3r lowers the level on which it will be effective that bypasses the ordinary defenses of the mind so when you do such an assessment the rule of not stirring up more charge than you can handle applies in neon lights if you are auditing case at level 7 6 or 5 see pp 414415 above for description of these levels this person doesnt easily run engrams the assessment has located the only tiny channel on the time track where the pc can confront engrams and on which you will not find dubin that is the basis on which the process has been developed case at level 3 see p 414 above this is the case with partially visible time track can be run on any engram you can find and wont be particularly upset or damaged by wrong date or other error but case at level 6 dubin of dubin case has barge canal sixteenth of an inch wider than your barge and full of roots old stoves and curves on that channel there is dubin of dubin and with correct assessment the case will have perceptics this gives you the responsibility of handling the case very carefully by the rule of not stirring up more charge than you can handle because at this level there is process that will put the case back together again if it falls apart the lower the case level the fewer incidents you will find per preliminary step the chain may be only one incident long test your level after you have run an incident if it doesnt read and the pc has had some sort of cognition about it dont choose this time to go backtrack if you have an incident that the pc can run it doesnt matter how long ago the incident was if he gets ta on it runs ok and that is all there is to the incident and if there are problems finding the date and duration and if there is read on asking for an earlier incident fine do another assessment things are more likely to run longer with an upperlevel case the clue to whether the chain is flat is ta action not how far back basic is to find out if you have run the ta out of the chain be sure that the ta didnt cease because of wrong date wrong duration or gpm in the incident if none of those apply leave it those are the criteria of flattened chain the helatrobus implant goes as far back as 43 trillion years ago the situation of having the ta cease is not the same as the situation of not having gotten any ta the only reason that you have trouble with running case with ta and arc breaks comes down to these factors 1 wrong assessment 2 wrong date 3 wrong duration 4 gpm in the incident that you are trying to run that you have collided with but have not found out about so you have been trying to scan the pc through the items of the gpm the worse off the case is the weirder the assessments will look to you the pc may run something well that is from the backtrack and still be lowlevel case so dont take the recentness of the incident as adjudicative of case level dating anything beyond an easily available incident becomes very difficult you are very likely to misdate and pass by incidents and the pc will know it too gpms are hard to date anyway being timeless and pc will have trouble staying in place on the time track this can also happen with upperlevel cases but they can take it lowerlevel case will plow in thoroughly the preliminary steps on level 4 see p 414 above this is dubin case or level 3 lead inevitably to gpm it is about the fastest way to find goal you ever heard of if the case is running well you can probably run the whole goals series right there any trouble you have with running case all goes back to the four factors given above wrong assessment includes running something that has not been assessed on lowerlevel case you can spend more time assessing than running the engrams test the level after you have something flat dont run over the pcs head when you have flattened the chain leave it the worse off the case is the more it moves from nonsense to murder so dont muddy the little channel you have to work in listen to what the pc tells you about what he wants to run but assess before you run it the way you make work for yourself as an auditor is by doing things that you shouldnt be doing for instance dont mix r3n and r3r dont switch from one to the other by mistake there is point on the track where you can get back of and find the basic of all gpms ive hit that point i havent got it so i can hold it steady i got there by the way by keying out had an awful time recently working out the most vicious series of gpms on the track there are five pictures but the first one is invisible goal with them just opposing items in dichotomy four firing five times in row for each picture i ran into myself on the track trying to figure this out i gave up took two sessions to get it unwound and the first picture is invisible so youd always try to put picture there so basic is always missing it makes vacuum and pictures pour in thats why later gpms accumulate pictures you get in the habit this is the vacuum that holds the whole bank together when he contacted this lrh could hear gpms coming apart all the way down to pt obviously you dont try something like this on lowerlevel pc desperate conditions are hard to maintain in the face of featherweight touches but heavier measures like bypassing too many goals in r3n wont help the case it is always ok to push pc little heavier than they can go but the rougher the case the less they can take the arc break is good test if the pc arc breaks regularly dont always blame yourself except for overestimating the state of case and running the process too steep there is real excuse for running pc poorly but if you put the pc in an available channel he will run like doll buggy if you run him right do careful assessment after every flattened chain checking carefully for wrong date or duration or gpm in it pcs that dont assess easily on the standard scale can be gotten to extend it auditing is as easy to do as it is real to the pc
