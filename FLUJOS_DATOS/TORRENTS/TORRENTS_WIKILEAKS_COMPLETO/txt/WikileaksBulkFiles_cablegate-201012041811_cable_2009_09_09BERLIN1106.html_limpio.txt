angela teflon merkel takes limelight as fdp waits in the wings classified by minister counselor for political affairs george glass fo r reasons 14 b and d summary 1 c less than two weeks after her party suffered losses in two state elections cdu chancellor angela merkel found her fighting spirit before 8000 party faithful at september 6 election rally in duesseldorf launching the hot phase of the cducsu electoral campaign the cdu has been shifting party tactics after its losses in the august 30 elections in saarland and thuringia where the social democratic party spd may now be in position to form coalitions with the left party merkel to great applause focused in on the specter of socalled redred government composed of the spd and the left party she described the spd as suffering from an identity crisis and needing vacation from political decisionmaking and time in opposition along with the entire cdu leadership and incumbent cducsu ministerspresident merkel made her case for cducsu coalition with the probusiness but socially liberal fdp she repeated the cducsus election mantra we have the strength throughout her speech aiming to convince the german electorate that strong cducsu is required for germany to emerge from its worst economic recession in postwar history cdu views on whether the issue of germanys role in afghanistan would become more prominent campaign theme were mixed 2 c with three weeks to go before the parliamentary elections all signs point to chancellor merkel returning to office although she and her party recognize that they face difficult campaign it remains uncertain whether the cdu and the fdp will gain enough support to form majority coalition if not another grand coalition cducsuspd is very likely other options require threeparty constellation that would force the illsuited greens and fdp to work together but there seems to be an almost one hundred percent certainty given the spds chronic slump in the polls and limited coalition options that spd foreign minister and chancellorcandidate frank walter steinmeier will not become chancellor end summary merkel casts aside spd embraces fdp 3 c chancellor merkel to rapturous cries of angie angie and standing ovation took to the floor at her partys september 6 rally before some 8000 supporters affirming that the cducsu have the best chance to win the parliamentary elections but also cautioning that the elections outcome has not yet been decided on the one hand she praised her grand coalition governments record noting its success in countering germanys economic and financial crisis on the other hand she called for new cducsu coalition with the fdp after the upcoming elections casting aside the spd she asserted that such coalition would anchor germany in the middle of the political spectrum and take the country out of its current economic crisis faster merkel said our country needs government that will support growth security and work for everyone in swipe at the spd comment merkel never mentioned steinmeier by name end comment she said the party is currently plagued by an identity crisis adding that the spd is devoid of any reality and is distraught she asked how can party that achieved 10 18 and 24 percent at the recent state elections in saxony thuringia and saarland be taken seriously dismissing spd warnings against socalled blackyellow cducsufdp coalition merkel said that the country should be more worried about the spds plans to form coalitions with the left party on the state and federal levels note the spd has warned that blackyellow coalition would represent wealthy germany and business interest at the expense of the middle and lower classes 4 u cdu leaders also tried to cast the cdu at the state level in positive light after its poor showing in the saarland and thuringia state elections on august causing the minister president of the latter state to resign lower saxonys cdu minister president christian wulff asserted that the most prosperous and successful laender states in germany are those ruled by the cducsu and fdp he cited berlin governed by spd mayor klaus wowereits berlin note in berlin the spd rules with the left party end note as being the worst case hesses minister president roland koch to great applause noted that he could not understand how the spd could possibly cooperate on state or national level with left party that is antiamerican and antieuropean note in saarland and thuringia the option berlin 00001106 002 of 003 exists for the spd to form governing coalition with the left party end note csu truce with fdp 5 c csu bavarian ministerpresident horst seehofer threw his partys support behind cducsu coalition with the fdp despite his wellpublicized doubts about the fdps real coalition intentions after the parliamentary elections even as seehofer pronounced his support for the fdp in duesseldorf however media reports from munich confirmed that the csu had decided to continue attacking the fdp the csu has been buffing its economic bona fides by attacking the fdp on its own themes while basking in the reflected glory from popular economics minister zu guttenberg the new csu champion seehofer has publicly suspected that fdp chairman guido westerwelle in an attempt to enter government at all costs might support traffic light coalition with the spd and the greens although this political constellation appears unlikely at present in addition bavarian politics trump national politics especially during time when the csu longs for the days when their party alone wielded political power in munich rather than as it does today in coalition with the fdp seehofer is also aware that the csu needs to be strong and the fdp proportionally more weak for the csu to win more and better ministerial posts in cducsufdp coalition he did not use his appearance in duesseldorf to chide the fdp to the great delight of those pleading that recent cducsufdp bickering had been harmful and counterproductive during the campaign afghanistan domestic campaign issue 6 c the september 4 air strike against two fuel tankers near kunduz afghanistan hit the press right before the cducsu rally in light of the german medias frenzy poloff asked the cdus head of international relations klemens moemkes whether germanys isaf commitment might emerge as potential domestic campaign issue moemkes noted that the spd could make afghanistan an issue but this would be very odd given foreign minister steinmeiers support for germanys military role in isaf however the prospect of afghanistan becoming major theme clearly had the cdus xxxxx spooked he told poloff that it would be very difficult for the chancellor not to address germanys role in afghanistan in the coming weeks given the german publics overwhelming support for withdrawal of german troops from afghanistan this was not an issue the chancellor wanted to address in the runup to the parliamentary elections comment 7 c while it is all but certain that chancellor merkel will return to office as chancellor after the next parliamentary elections on september 27 it is too close to call whether she will achieve coalition with the fdp bavarian mp seehofers attacks on the fdp in bavaria could weaken that party there and further undermine the chances of coalition the fdp wants the same but political bickering over future ministerial positions and csu attacks on the fdp in bavaria and on fdp chairman guido westerwelle suggest that possible cducsufdp coalition will not be marriage made in heaven some fdp contacts admit that they harbor doubts about the chancellors promise to form coalition with the fdp they insinuate that in reality she may prefer another grand coalition with the spd although chancellor merkel has used every public opportunity to advertise for cducsufdp coalition backing down on this pledge would call into question her reputation 8 c paradoxically however it is the cducsus relative weakness in the polls 3536 percent that threatens possible cducsufdp coalition the fdp is clearly riding on high with doubledigit successes in the state elections of saarland saxony and thuringia but this may not be enough the cdu refuses to engage in any selfintrospection after its defeats in saarland and thuringia and the party can really only take comfort from the spds perennial weakness the fear in the cdu is acute that the chancellors high popularity ratings may not be enough to ensure comfortable win for the cducsu at the parliamentary elections 9 c merkel once again vehemently denies any intention to form grand coalition with the spd but the electoral math on september 27 may force her despite intense cducsu reservations not to mention those of the german public to look at the spd as partner as for the spd steinmeier is berlin 00001106 003 of 003 looking desperate the spd has failed to reach over 25 percent in the last six elections and steinmeiers unlikely path to the chancellorship is only possible if he reneges on campaign promise not to form coalition with the left party this will not happen in 2009 but the cducsu will not tire of raising the fear of redred coalition in 2009 or in 2013 the chancellor appears to be in winwin situation but three weeks on the campaign trail can be an eternity end comment murphy
