divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32441environmental protection agency appropriations for fy2005 summary the president signed the consolidated appropriations act for fy2005 pl 108447 hr 4818 on december 8 2004 th law provides funding for numerous federal agencies including 809 billion fo r epa subject to an acrosstheboard rescission of 08 the fina l appropriation is more than the administrations request of 779 billion but is less than the fy2004 appropriation of 837 billion the adequacy of funding for scientific res earch the cleanup of hazardous waste sites under the superfund program nd water infrastructure were prominent issues in the fy2005 appropriations bate funding for numerous other activities also received attention such as grants for environm ental education clean school buses and redevelopment of brownfields as we ll as funding for epa enforcement of environmental laws amounts indicated below for specific activities are lineitems in the act and the accompanying conference report on hr 4818 hrept 108792 and do not reflect the acr osstheboard rescission the act provides 750 million prior to transfers from the superfund account for epas scientific research activities more than the administrations request of 689 million but less than the fy2004 appropriation of 782 million some scientists had opposed decrease in fundin g for scientific research arguing that critical areas of knowledge needed for public policy decisions on controlling pollution would be compromised the administration had countered that its requested decrease was due to cost saving s from consolidating and realigning certain research areas and that it would maintain research in key areas needed for the development of polluti on control regulations the act provides 126 billion for the clea nup of hazardous wa ste sites under the superfund program prior to transfers to the science and technology and office of inspector general accounts the appropriation is the same as in fy2004 but is less than the administrations request of 138 billion the level of funding needed to ensure an adequate pace of cleanup and the source of such funding were key issues the taxing authority for the superfund trus t fund expired at the end of 1995 and the balance has essentially been expended since then the act authorizes the use of general treasury revenues to entirely support the fy2005 funding level if sufficient funds are not available in the trust fund the act provides 110 billion for the clean water state revolving fund srf more than the administrations request of 850 million but less than the fy2004 appropriation of 134 billion the law so provides 850 million for the drinking water srf the same as the administrations request and nearly the same as the fy2004 appropriation of 845 million these sr fs provide seed monies for state loans to communities for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects the amounts for the srfs have been contenti ous as there is disagreement over the adequacy of funding to meet these needs the law also provides 310 million in earmarked funding for grants to specific communities for drinking water wastewater and storm water infrastructure projects as this report disc usses final action on fy2005 appropriations for ep it will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32441contents

on science provides federal agency perspective on the science policies and accomplishments of the administration and illustrates how todays science sets the stage for benefits to the economy and national quality of life9 the administrations requested decrease for epas scientific research activities sparked debate in light of the ucss cla ims about the quality nd use of scientific data although the administration pr oposed an overall 101 million decrease in funding including transfers it asserted that key research areas would continue to be supported and that its proposed decrease therefore would not diminish the quality of science upon which policy decisions are based in some cases reductions were characterized as efficiencies gained as result of combining individual research projects into broader funding categories epas fy2005 budget justification asserted that the requested funding for agen cy activities would continue to pl ace high priority on researching the eff ects of pollution on human health numerous scientific organizations such as the american association for the advancement of science opposed the adminis trations request to reduce funding for scientific research at epa and other federal agencies arguing that critical areas of knowledge needed for public policy decisions would be compromised such critics argued that reducing funding for epas sc ientific research ac tivities could result in poorer understanding of the effects of pot entially hazardous substances and other sources of pollution on human health and ma ke it more difficult to assess the level of protection provided by ex isting regulatory standards or intended for future ones in response to concerns about the adequ acy of the administrations request both the house and senate ppropriations committees reco mmended more funding for the st account in reporting hr 5041 and s 2825 respectively the conferees on hr 4818 provided final funding leve l in between the amounts recommended in the two reports however with certain exceptions the increase above the fy2005 request for the st account is allocated in the form of earmarks for 78 special projects rather than for ongoing programs or activities that epa administers the conference report earmarks more than 60 million of the appropriation for the st account for grants to specific universities and organizations to

close as possible to the fy2004 funding level which was 97 million the administration had requested 62 million funding for star fellowships also had been point of contention in the fy2003 debate the administration did not request any funding that year but congress restored it to 97 million the sa as appropriated again for fy2004 although the conference report did not specify funding for star research projects the house appropriations committee specified 162 million increase above the fy2005 request for the research and fellowships components of the star program in its report on hr 5041 the report indicated that the increase would fully restore these activities to fy2004 leve ls in propos ing an increase for the star program the house appropriations committee did not specify the breakdown of funding for each activity therefore it is unclear how the increase above the request would be allocated among individual activities within the program the senate appropriations committee did not specifically discuss the star program the fy2005 budget request had included 35 m illion in reductions and transfers within the st account for star resear ch projects the proposed reductions included the elimination of funding for gran ts in four research areas ecosystems research grants approximately 50 gran ts research on endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs grants for researching the

appropriati on of funding pl 108447 includes an administrative provision that affects eligibility for brownfields redevelopment grants it provides authority in fy2005 for epa to award grants for the redevelopment of brownfields sites purchased prior to the enactment of the small business liability relief and brownfields revita lization act pl 107118 on january 11 2002 congress also approved such authority for fy2004 the house appropriations committeehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32441crs25 24 congress provided the fy2004 appropriation fo r this activity within the environmental programs and management account rather th an in the stag account epa had requested 15 million for fy2004 the conference report on the consolidated appropriations act for fy2004 hr 2673 hrept 108401 did not specify reduction in the 15 million request for diesel engine retrofitting activities proposed in the fy2004 budget request therefore it is presumed that the 50 milli on added by congress for school bus retrofitting is supplemental to the requested amount 25 epa initiated this program in anticipation of new diesel engine emission standards the program promotes innovative technology to comply with the standards implements continuedincluded similar administrative provision in hr 5041 the nate appropriations committee did as well but included language that would have made the authority for this purpose permanent rather than for fy2005 alone under pl 107118 epa is authorized to award grants for the redevelopment of brownfields only if these properties we re purchased after the enactment of this statute communities have advocated am ending the law to allow grants to be awarded for the redevelopment of brownfie lds regardless of when the property was purchased epa has indicated its support for such an amendment the senate appropriations committee also included bill language in the administrative provisions of s 2825 that w ould have allowed the use of brownfields grants for reasonable administrative costs as determined by the administrator of epa this language was not include d in pl 108447 under current law brownfields grants cannot be used to pay recipients administrative costs smaller communities with fewer resources have advocated the use of grant funds for administrative costs that they otherwise woul d not be able to pay however others assert that the use of brownfields grants should focus on actual cleanup and redevelopment of b lighted properties clean school bus initiative pl 108447 provides 75 million to fund costshare grants for clean school bus congress appr opriated 5 million for fy200424 the administration had reque sted 65 million for fy2005 based on interest of grant applicants in previous years seeking total of 60 million in funds these grants are mainly used to retrofit older dieselpowered school buses to reduce emissions of particulate matter and to raise awareness of the health risks posed to schoolchildren from exposure to diesel missions epa reports that 24 million children travel by bus to school each day exposing those who ride on older buses to potentially harmful emissions the program has been popular at the local level and the administration had requested substantially larger amount for fy2005 to award grants in greater number of school districts although pl 108447 increases funding for this program relative to fy2004 some have noted concern that local interest in these grants would greatly exceed th fy2005 appropriation of 75 million epa began the clean school bus initiativ in april 2003 as pilot program it was an extension of the voluntary diesel retrofit program25 to upgraderetrofithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32441crs26 25 continued demonstration projects to encourage more fl eet retrofits and evaluates emission control technologies for more information see the epa website at h ttp wwwepagovotaq retrofitindexhtm 26 for more information s ee http wwwepagovotaqschool busdemo_projectshtmdiesel engines which began in 2000 the go als of this program are to reduce diesel emissions by developing strategies to eliminate unnecessary idling and by replacing older pre1991 school buses with buses that have more effective emissions controls and retrofitting newer pos t1991 buses with similar updated controls by 2010 epas initial grant solicitation in fy 2003 sought demonstration projects to assist school districts in reducing pol lution from dieselpowered buses epa received more than 120 grant proposals from school districts state and local agencies and nonprofit organizations seek ing total of 60 million in funds with the 5 million appropriated for fy2003 epa aw arded grants for 16 demonstration projects in 14 states epa awarded grants for 20 demonstration projects in 18 states with the additional 5 million provided for fy2004 as well as 100000 grant for school bus retrofit project funded through another epa pr ogram that awards grants for retrofitting many diffe rent types of buses used for public transit26 conclusion the fy2005 appropriation of 809 billion for epa is reduction relative to the 837 billion that congress appropriated for fy2004 this reduction is greater when the 08 acrosstheboard rescission is pplied however th fy2005 appropriation is more than the administrations reque st of 779 billi on funding for specific activities administered by epa received va rying levels of attention in the fy2005 appropriations debate the main points of contention focused on the adequacy of funding for scientific res earch upon which pollution contro l standards are based the cleanup of hazardous waste s ites under the superf und program and federal assistance to states for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure in the final bill the largest reductions relative to fy2004 were for wastewater infrastructure projects and sc ientific research convers ely the largest increases relative to the fy2005 request we re devoted to these same activities funding for the superfund program remains steady at the fy 2004 funding level prior to the across theboard rescission but is below what the administration proposed although there is disagreement among various st akeholders as to whether the fy2005 appropriation is sufficient to support thes and other activities the final amounts reflect the priorities of congress in llocating limited funding to numerous federal agencies within the consolidated appropriations act for fy2005
