senate versions specific differences are highlighted in table 1 below of note the senate provisions to ban enrichment reprocessing and heavy water production cooperation with india now section 104 d 4 and create an enduse monitoring program now section 104d 5 prevailed in the conference bill as did title ii which includes the implementing legislation of the us additional protocol the so called harkin amendment which added determination that india was fully and actively supporting us and international efforts to contain dissuade and sanction iran for its nuclear weapons program did not remain as determination but became two reporting requirements first as onetime report when the section 123 agreement is submitted to congress now section 104c2h and as an annual reporting requirement now section 104g2e pl 109401 signing statement on december 18 2006 president bush signed the henry j hyde united statesindia peaceful atomic energy cooperation act of 2006 into law pl 109 401 president bush noted that the act will strengthen the strategic relationship between the united states and india20 in particular president bush stated that the executive branch would construe two sections of the bill as advisory only policy statements in section 103 and the restriction contained in section 104 d 2 on transferring items to india that would not meet nsg guidelines on the first the president cited the constitutions commitment to the presidency of the authority to conduct the nations foreign affairs on the second the president raised the question of whether the provision unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to an international body in other words the president was questioning whether congress were ceding authority to approve us exports to the nuclear suppliers group however us officials including secretary of state rice have formally told congress multiple times that the united states government would abide by nsg guidelines the presidents signing statement also noted that the executive branch would construe provisions of the act that mandate regulate or prohibit submission of information to the congress an international organization or the public such as sections 104 109 261 271 272 273 274 and 275 in manner consistent with the presidents constitutional authority to protect and control information that could impair foreign relations national security the deliberative processes of the executive or the performance of the executives constitutional duties this could suggest that the executive branch might limit the scope of reporting required by congress in those sections 19 congressional record november 16 2006 s11014 daily edition 20 see httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases2006122006121812html crs10 table 1 comparison of current
