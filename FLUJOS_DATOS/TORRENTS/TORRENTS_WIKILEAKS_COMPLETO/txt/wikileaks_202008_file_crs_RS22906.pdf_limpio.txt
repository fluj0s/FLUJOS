at the same time it published an special rule limiting the application of prohibitions to activities affecting the bear2 the listing and special rule sparked debate not only because of the polar bears charismatic qualities it was widely known that the center for biological diversity had petitioned the fws to list the polar bear in 2005 in the hope that listing would provide legal basis for forcing reduction of greenhouse gas ghg emissions throughout the count ry to combat climate change thus the consequences of the listin g many thought could be vasthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22906crs2 3 9a1b 16

presumably run like this ghg emissions contribute to climate ch ange climate change has produced disproportionate warming in th arctic that warming has already reduced the extent of arctic sea ice and will continue to do so in the future polar bears depend on sea ice for breeding foraging and travel thus by diminishing the polar bears essential habitat and jeopardizing the species ghg emitters anywhere in the united states now implicate the demands of the particularly sections 9 and 7 as follows section 9 th take pr ohibition section 9 makes it unlawful for an person to take an animal listed as endangered under the esa3 take is defined broadly by the to include harm to an endangered animal or plant4 and harm critically for the climate change argument above has been administrativ ely defined to include indi rect harm to listed species members through certain significant habitat modifications 5 thus at first glance an argument appears to exist that because significant ghg emitter c ontributes to climate change which melts the polar bears seaice the emitter violates the section 9 take prohibition if blessed by the courts this argument would require significant ghg emitter to obtain an incidental take permit allowing incidental takes of polar bears after the emitter sub mits conservation plan and the fw s finds that the applicant will minimize the impacts of such taking6 this argument has some flaws first section 9 as noted pr ohibits takes only as to endangered species while the polar bear was listed as threatened here matters become more complex by general rule the fws long ago extended the section 9 take prohibition to threatened species as well7 threatened species with atypical management needs however are subject instead to special rules8 the fws has great flexibility in writing special rules because the requires only that regu lations protecting threatened species be necessary and advisable to provi for the conservation of such species9 not that they be the same as the acts prot ections for endangered species when the fws listed the polar bear as threatened it simultane ously issued special rule for the species also known as 4d rule afte r the relevant subsection the polar bear 4d rule has been contr oversial the rule narrows the section 9 take prohibition that normally would apply through the general rule above by two exceptions only one is substantially relevant to climate change it exempts from the section 9 prohibitions any taking of polar bear s that is incidental to but not the purpose of an otherwise lawful activity within any area subject to the jurisdiction of the united states except alaska the effect of this exemption would appear to be that coalfiredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22906crs3 10 see eg cold mountain

strychnine for use in bait was held to constitute prohibited take of endangered species registration allowed distribution of the bait which led to its use against target species endangered nontarget animals then ate the bait directly or indirectly by consuming target animals that had ingested the bait and died the court noted that epas decision to register the pesticide was critical to the resulting poisonings of endangered species and that the relationship between registration and deaths of endangered animals was clear id at 1301 13 127 s ct 1438 2007power plant anyplace in the united states except alaska could not be deemed to take polar bears through its ghg emissions unle ss the section 4d rule is judicially invalidated then any effort to use the polar bear listing to reduce ghg emissions through take argument will almost certainly be unsuccessful second flaw in the ghgemissionstakepol arbears argument is that of causal proximity ghg sources anywhere in the us do not affect polar bears directly but through the intermediary steps of atmospheric mixing arctic warming and seaice melting is this close enough nexus betw een activity and take to trigger section 9 section 9 case law indicates that for violation to occur there has to be causal connection between the activity and the take10 and imminent harm must be reasonably certain to occur11 case law further indicates that indirect effects can constitute takes but does not explicate further12 given these vague standards one can say only that the argument that source of substantial ghg emissions takes polar bears is plausible greater certainty as to the arguments chances of success is impossible given that the decided cases i nvolve facts very different from climate change judicial attitudes toward the causal proximity required by the may be influenced by supreme court decision in 2007 massachusetts v epa holding that epa has authority under the clean air act caa to regulate ghgs from new motor vehicles13 relevant here is the c ourts discussion of massachus ettss standing to bring the suit there it found that the reduction in automobile ghg emissions sought by the state was likely to yield nonnegligible be nefit to the state slowing down its loss of shorelands to sea level rise thus satisfying the redressability requirement of standing doctrine the analogy between massachusettss loss of shoreland and the polar bears loss of sea ice is evident though standing law and the are admittedly very different contexts finally there is the question of whether the effect of particular ghg emissions source on polar bear habitat is minimis section 7 consultation with fws while section 9 applies to persons section 7 applies onl to federal agencies it demands that each federal agency insure th at any action authorized funded or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adversehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22906crs4 14 see eg riverside irrigation dist v andrews 758 f2d 508 10th cir 1985 in considering permit application for discharge into creek to bu ild earthen dam

whooping cranes 150 miles downstream 15 50 cfr 40202 16 id emphasis added 17 the listing preambles only explication of the caused by prong is to say that the fws confines its section 7 evaluation to effects th at would not occur but for the action under consultation 73 fed reg at 28299 18 id 19 73 fed reg 47868 august 15 2008 the proposed amendments to the current agency definition of indirect effects s ee text above would define indir ect effects as those effects for continuedmodification of designated critical habitat to minimize the chance of jeopardy or adverse modification section 7 creates consultation process if any listed species is present in the area of the proposed acti on the agency proposing to act prepares biological assessment identifying any such species likely to be affected and setting out relevant details of the acti on and available information on its potential effects the agency must then consult with the fws wh ich prepares biological opinion as to how the proposed action will affect the species or signated critical habita t if the biological opinion finds jeopardy or dverse modification the fws must propose reasonable and prudent alternatives that the action agency or permit applicant can take to eliminate jeopardy or adverse modification based on the argument above for takes the argument may be made that the proposal of federal action authorizing funding or carrying out substantial emissions of ghgs triggers secti on 7 consultation and just as section 9 has habitat modification component so does section 7 though only where critical habitat has been formally designated moreover case law suppor ts the triggering of section 7 consultation even when the effect of an agency acti on is remote from the area of agency action14 if sanctioned by the courts this argument for section 7 c onsultation would effectively require an agency to adopt any reasonable and prudent alte rnatives proposed by the fws which presumably could incl ude reduction of ghg emissions as with the section 9 take argument th section 7 consulta tion argument has its vulnerabilities the major one is causati on fws regulations say that section 7 consultation evaluates the direct and i ndirect effects of the proposed action15 indirect effects are those that are caused by the proposed action and ar later in time but still are reasonably certain to occur16 the listing preamble strongly insists that the caused by requirement is not satisfied in the case of ghg emissions and the plight of the polar bear17 states the preamble the best scientif ic information availabl to us today has not established causal connection between specific sources and locations of emissions to specific impacts posed to polar bears or their habitat18 moreover recently proposed amendments to the consultation regulations would make it even less likely that fws would regard climate changerelated impacts on the polar bear as an indirect effect of federal action trigge ring consultation19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22906crs5 19 continued which the proposed action is an essential cause and that are later in time but still are reasonably certain to occur emphasis added further th amendments would specify that conclusion that an effect is reasonably certain to occur must be based on clear and substantial information emphasis added this means states the pr eamble that the indirect effect cannot be speculative and must be more than just likely to occur id at 47872 these proposed changes and others reinforce in the fwss view the ag encys current view that there is requirement to consult on ghg emissions contribution to global warming and its associated impacts on listed species eg polar bears 20 regulations make express that federal ag encys promulgation of regulations may trigger section 7 50 cfr 40202 definition of action 21 center for biological diversity v ke mpthorne c081339cw nd cal second amended complaint filed july 16 2008the preamble reference to the best scientific information available to us today acknowledges that new scientific inform ation may provide the requisite causal connection second point is that while th causal nexus between specific s ources and adverse effects on polar bear bitat may be elusive some federal actions such as caa regulations may increase ghg emissions fro m enough sources that the linkage may be more clear20 third in contrast with the s ection 9 prohibitions the fws cannot by special rule narrow the range of circumstan ces that trigger section 7 consultation though its views on the causal nexus between ghg emissions and polar bears or lack thereof will likely be accorded deference by court final point is that as with the causation issue under section 9 massachusetts v epa may be influential here as well as with section 7 minimis argument exists for consultation another problem with use of section 7 fo r polar bears is that the may 15 2008 listing was not accompanied by designation of critical habitat for the bear the center for biological diversity sued challenging this failure to designate21 in the meantime any effort to force section 7 consultation ba sed on proposed activitys ghg emissions will have to argue that the emitting source satisfies the jeopardy trigger for consultation other listing petitions related to climate change though the polar bear petition was the most publicized several other listing petitions have been filed for animals alleged to be ndangered or threatened due in whole or in part to climate change the center for biological diversity is the sole petitioner in almost all of these reflecting its campaign to use the to address climate change besides the polar bear only one of th petitions has reached final listing determination that for the elkhorn and stag horn coral in 2006 seven other petitions are currently pending and are listed below to understand their status the procedural stages in the listing process must be reviewed first the 90day finding upon receipt of petition the appropriate secretar of the interior or of commerce must determine if it presents subs tantial information indica ting that the petitioned action may be warranted and must do so within 90 days if practicable second the 12month finding if the 90day finding is positive the secretary must determine whether listing is warranted not warranted or warranted

protection statut the and marine ma mmal protection act energy statutes energy policy and conservation act and outer continental shelf lands act information statutes including the national environmental policy act nuisance law and state laws governing electric utilities22 the number of case filings has proliferated in recent years under either the or other statutes however it is likely that complainants fully understand the inability of these laws to produce broad schemes for dealing with climate change rather these suits have almost certainly been filed in part to pressure congress or in ternational negotiators to adopt comprehensive solutions tailored to the specifics of climate change
