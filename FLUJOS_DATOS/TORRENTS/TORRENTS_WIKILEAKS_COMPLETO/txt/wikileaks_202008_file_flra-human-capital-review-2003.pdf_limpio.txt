for official use only 6 united states of america federal labor relations authority office of the inspector general washin gton dc 20424 0001 may 2 2003 subject inspector general flra human capital progress assessment followup on fy 2000 internal review of flra human capital background the actual foundation for human ca pital was developed in 1993 by the national performance review national part nership for reinventing government the concept reflecting that human capital resour ces were an asset vice cost occurred when congress passed the government performance and results act congress continued passing legislation that integrated human ca pital investment strategies and performance management ie federal acquisition streamli ning act clingercohen act government information security act government perf ormance results act etc because human resources are the most essential reso urce for accomplishing federal agency s mission congress has always recognized that human reso urces are the most important asset of the federal government as the federa l government strives to change it s structures and emphasize its focus on customer service performance based budgeting delayering management positions to be re placed with working level positions learning that agency s can do more with less if they attract hire and retain skilled employees with broad based knowledge and appropriate behavioral qualities the management of human capital investments becomes even more important human capital may be the most difficult gove rnment wide standard for management to address because of the actual challenges the federal government faces in the personnel area the current skills imbalances significant pending retirement of experienced and knowledgeable federal employees current outd ated personnel and payroll policies and lack of flexibility to acquire and develop talent and leadership are issues that the current administration is addressing overall pr ogress in federal agencies to improve human capital standards has been slow because most managers have addressed other standards that they feel are more important such as financial management competitive sourcing and procurement weaknesses however the botto m line is that in reality none of these other standards can be improved or achi eved without dedicated motivated and for official use only appreciated employees the current administration is committed to strengthening the relationships of pay for performance particularly for employees with significant program and or human capital management responsibilities the management of employees is not the responsibility of the human resources division but is the respon sibility of every manager and supervisor current leaders managers and supervisor s must address significant challenge by engaging in creative and effective approaches for managing today s diverse highly skilled well educated employees who prefer to be challenged and want to broaden their knowledge be assured of continuous growth and remain challenged with continuous growth knowledge and job opportunities public leaders need to treat employees in way that brings out their potential as individuals leadership should ensure that employees are always treated with dignity and respect every day by every one employees should have work environment and tools to promote contributions which are meaningful both to the agency and employee and appropriately recognized working level employees have new challenges wh ich result from changes in their previous working concepts such as taking responsibility for their actions engaging in continuing training and focusing on adoing it right the first time leaders and managers must devote more time to mentoring and communi cating with their employees creating trustful and respectful work environment promoting innovation and thoughtful risk taking and being accountable for their work leaders managers and working level employees who have committed to public service must accept the fact that the government is changing and there are new standards of performance stronger but more simplified technical and administrative sy stems requiring more accountability and the need for corporate continuity and planning also everyone should be aware of very basic work ethic principle that to excel it is not necessary to be in supervisory or management capacity leaders need to f ocus on developing and interacting with employees in way that brings out their potential instead of stifling it such focus benefits everyone mentoring provides on the job training and development of employees treating employees as an asse t benefits agency productivity employee motivation and dedication and supports temporary management skills frequent communication benefits managers as well as employees by providing clear sense of the culture and benchmark for success and insight into what works and what doesn t work the ideal employee will readily adapt to change be willing to work and do whatever is necessary welcome increased responsibility have strong interpersonal skills and be motivated to learn new skills this is the essence of human capital 7 the current administration has focused on huma n capital even more by defining it as one of the five governmentwide standards of the president s management agenda although for official use only the office of personnel management is current ly in the process of drafting some changes in this area at the time of this assessment the governmentwide standards for human capital standards included 1 the alignment of human capital strategy with agency mission goals and organizational objectives including integration into budget and strategic planning b compliance with standards for internal accountability systems which ensure meritbased human resource management and c consistent with opm s human capital scorecard issued in december1 2001 2 the agency has citizencentered organizational structure that is delayered and oriented toward perfor ming the mission assigned to it 3 the agency sustains high performance workforce that is continually improving productivity strategically us existing personnel flexibilities tools and technology and implements effective succession planning 4 there are skill gapsdeficiencies in mission critical operations 5 the agency differentiates between high and low performers through appropriate incentives and rewards 6 changes in agency workforce skill mix and organizational structure reflect an increased emphasis on egovernment and competitive sourcing during fy 2000 the flra inspector general conducted an internal review of flra human capital investments for small quas ijudicial agency whose appropriations are primarily allocated for paying its employ ees salaries and benefits human capital investments were an important management fact or this review also affirmed that the 8 flra workstaff was highly educated but the flra generally hired its attorneys and labor relations specialists at an entry level gs 9 gs7 respectively which was lower than other federal adjudicatory agencies the mana gement drivers for entry level hiring by the flra was due to combination of labormarket conditions flra s significant budget restrictions management s desire for internal molding of its legal staff and obtaining for official use only more for the dollars spent generally from flra s management s perspective and employees standpoint the lack of promotion opportunities was concern during fy 2000 the flra s turnover rate was higher than the norm the reasons could not be determined at that time because of the lack of exit interviews and related statistics although the flra had established an upw ard mobility program and leadership program both programs had limited success and needed strengthening the basic problem was that positions defined for upward mobility were very limited and rarely vacant at the time of the fy 2000 revi ew the human resource division hrd was strengthening its program working fairly close with component managers and orienting itself to focus on recruiting and retaining multiskilled diverse workforce which would achieve the agency s mission the hrd also worked with management and the partnership council to develop core compe tencies performance management and development programs focus was also placed on workplace security and safety due to several incidents occurring at the headquarters facility and threats made at three flra regional offices an objective evaluation of flra s headquarter s security was performed by the federal protective service wh ich also provided security briefing to flra headquarters employees flra s employee assistance program was handled through the u s public health service while it s health program was performed by the health care service of the department of treasury both of these programs were managed appropriately but employees were t aware of the extensive health services available to them the fy 2000 review revealed several vulnerabilities in technology and the lack of tools for some employees although software upgrad were made to all computers converting them from word perfect 6 to word perfect 8 an d were in compliance with y2k internal integration and security vulnerabilities existed this review also revealed that although philosophically flra management stated they maintained collegial progressive innovative and participative environment the focus of significant amount of managers and employees was rather narrow in scope and focused on their assigned organizational entity rather than from an agencywide perspe ctive at this time distinct management philosophies existed among the three organizati onal entities the authority the office of general counsel and the federal service impasses panel compared to other small federal agencies in fy 2000 the flra was progressive in its approach and acceptance that human capital resources were an asset the flra had dedicated over 75 of its appropriations to pa for its educated workforce career ladder and upward mobility positions had been established the flra s strategic planning was 9 for official use only good its human resources program improved significantly and several programs specifically oriented to benefit employees such as flexiplace transit subsidy alternative work schedule program and tier i and ii leadership programs were implemented the review also revealed that the flra conside red the training of employees important and actually spent much more than the training fun ds allocated for each employee this was commendable because previous studies have sh own that three times more productivity is gained by investing in human capital training than if the same money was spent on new equipment or technology another commendable program at the time of the review was the flra employee recognition and awards program which recognized exceptional employee performance throughout the year in spite of very restrictive budget the flra recognized the contributory performance of employees with performance awards the flra also conducted annual 2 2 day employee orientation programs for new employees employees have found this progra m very helpful the only weakness in this program was that employees who come on board after the orientation have to wait almost year for the new orientation although their immediate supervisors and human resource director provide them with individu orientations the review revealed that flra management as whole was sensitive to its employees professional personal and private life obligations and that many mana gers and employees spontaneously helped one another during difficult times medical privat life situations etc the review also verified that flra managers and working vel employees were very generous to the combined federal campaign as well as private sector charities the fy 2000 review also revealed that flra had focused on workplace and information security health and safety since the ptember 11 2002 issue however the implementation of security policy is still pendin g the transition of the flra to the new administration s federal management requirements s been slow and resisted by some senior executives and line managers who correlate these requirements to micro management the statutory structure of the flra has not been conducive for corporate agency mentality because it created three distinct and independent legal components actually four counting the foreign panel and created the chairmanship ceo in the authority the fy 2000 review validated that employees were bonded to their own organizational entities current leadership has successfully changed this approach 10 the fy 2000 review also revealed some hu man capital vulnerabilities such as limited promotion availability higher rate of employee turnover compared to other small for official use only agencies the lack of an agencywide mana gement perspective and different component focuses on employee development the review so affirmed that the grade levels of most of the professional staff were at least one grade lower than their counterparts in other small quasi judicial agencies the review so revealed that management invested more in its professional staff than its administrati ve staff even though most of the latter have been with the agency for significant amount of time the review revealed that the flra did not conduct and use position mana gement reviews or statistical workload justifications as management tool for the cl assification and assignment of position the fy 2000 review revealed that the flra s upward mobility program which was active in the early 90s had dwindled down to almost apaper exercise the program was restructured in l999 but there was still little fl exibility in dedicating specific positions for support staff functions professional atto rneylabor relations specialist upward mobility positions were considere d different and referred to as built in career ladders the fy 2000 review also included close look at the flra s tier i and ii development program which was aligned with flra s strategic planning this program was supposed to ultimately have specific tier for profe ssional and senior executive service leadership development guaranteed promotions are not part of this program and this inappropriately discouraged some employees from participating during1999 and 2000 the flra human re sources division conducted several administrative support traini ng sessions as well as bag lunch seminars at the flra headquarters in spite of ample advertisem ent and employee notification these training sessions were not well attended other area s needing management attention surfaced through the fy 2000 review included not all employees had individual development plans b some employees were reluctant to use equal employment opportunity counseling and grievance procedures because they felt their confidentiality was compromised at the onset c the morale of administrative program minority employees was affected by the lack of advancement opportunities d the majority of human capital investments and achievements pertained to the professional legal staffs of the agency and the lack of succession planning could negatively affect the agency 11 for official use only objective an flra inspector general internal review of the fy 2000 corrective actions caused some concern although most of the fy 2000 corrective actions were reported implemented during fy 2000 or fy 2001 the assessment of progress by the flra inspector general indicated that many of the initial problems still exist or have resurfaced therefore followup assessment evaluating flra s human capital progress was conducted beginning on october 15 2002 and was completed on april 15 2003 methodology this current assessment includes followup of implemented corrective actions from the flra inspector general fy 2000 internal review of human capital which was proactively done to assess flra s position when this topic was first introduced by the office of personnel management it also involved survey of flra management s knowledge of and involvement in this important management area which has become one of the main governmentwide standards of the president s management agenda interviews were held with the executive director and director human resources division as well as randomly selected managers and employees to include their perspectives of flra progress in the human ca pital area interviews were also conducted with flra employees throughout the agency to assess their perspectives of progress and needs in the human capital area statistical data which was initiated as result of fy 2000 flra inspector general recommendation was reviewed and analyzed as part of this assessment introduction both the federal government s workforce and workplaces are changing these changes are primarily driven by the current president s management agenda and previous administration s vision that the 21st century workforc must be highly skilled adequately compensated and appropriately assigned and that the work environment must be safe and productive to reach this goal federal management must focus on and recognize its employees as an asset and key step for this transformation the current administration has strengthen ed the focus on federal human capital investments by making it one of the five essential government wide standards of the president s management agenda the general servic administrative office has issued framework for human capital assessments whic h has been used as baseline for the flra s inspector general followup assessment the framework for this assessment involves the overarching reality that in order to be effective all levels of management must provide sustained interest and commitm ent to human capital management with the 12 for official use only understanding that it requires continuin g reassessments and the elimination of perspective stereotyping also management must realize that their successful approaches today may need to be changed to ensure continuing effectiveness and the capacity to provide shared vision betw een the employer and employees successful flra human capital should routinely address 1 the level of incorporation of human capital in the agency s mission accomplishment strategic planning and core values 2 appropriate organizational alignment and the integration of human capital strategies with the agency s core business processes 3 committed leadership team which provides reasonable continuity through succession planning 4 recruiting hiring developing and retaining employees with the appropriate skills including interpersonal for mission accomplishment 5 work performance culture that empowers and motivates employees while ensuring accountability and fairness in the workplace human capital standards on november 22 2002 the office of pers onnel management opm issued new human capital standards which will replace the pr evious human capital standards in the president s management agenda these new standards were formulated by opm and the government accounting office and office of management and budget they are based on creating more effective government by ttracting developing and retaining quality employees from diversified backgrounds and continually ensuring that government employees perform at high levels these new standards are i strategic alignment agency human capital strategy is aligne d with mission goals and organizational objectives and integrated into its strategic plans performance plans and budgets ii workforce planning and deployment agency is citizen centered delayered and mission focused and leverages egovernment and competitive sourcing 13 iii leadership and knowledge management for official use only agency leaders and managers effectively mana ge people ensure continuity of leadership and sustain learning environment that drives continuous improvement in performance iv results oriented results oriented performance culture the agency has diverse resultsoriented high performance workforce and has performance management system that effect ively differentiates between high and low performance and links individualteam and unit performance to organizational goals and desired results v talent the agency has closed most mission critical skills knowledge and contemporary gaps and deficiencies and has made meaningful progress toward closing all vi accountability the agency s human capital decisions are guided by data driven results oriented planning and accountability system based on this followup review the following comments pertain to the inspector general s assessment of the current flra status related to the new standards i strategic alignment the current flra strategic plan has two go als which specifically relate to the flra s adjudicatory mission the flra has gene ral human resource strategic goal in its strategic plan which is integrated with com ponent action plans and individual employee work plans the human resource strategic goal does align for the most part with the flra mission and organizational goals component action plans integrate with the strategic plans and employee work plans if they exist and similarly integrate into component action plans however not all flra employees have work plans new employees are supposed to receive their positi on descriptions and workplans within 30 days of their employment there were severa l employees in the authority however who had never received workplan from their managers and few employees who have not received relevant position descriptions basic human capital strategies are now bein g aligned and integrated with performance planning and budget submissionallocations by the majority of flra managers the office of the general counsel previously had been the innovator of the flra s human capital focus however now all three flra components are addressing this standard the current federal and flra focus on human capital has provided foundation for management to support human capital initiatives ii workforce planning and deployment 14 for official use only because of the nature of its adjudicatory mission the flra has always considered customer service important and has focused on its mission to process labor management disputes in an appropriate and timely way during fy 2001 and fy 2002 the number of cases filed with the flra has increased but time ly processing has decreased some of the reasons for the effect on timeliness include pe rsonnel turnover inability to fill vacancies in timely manner because of budget restri ctions the absence of general counsel and the previous lack of permanent director of the case control office recently filled while the last decade downsizing did delaye r the flra there still exist an excessive amount of ses and gs15 who are in management positions and perhaps not enough working level employees recent inspec tor general management work analysis identified managerial positions which could be consolidated or eliminated once they were vacated management has considered deployme nt of personnel several times in the past to accommodate workload but has not adopte d this procedure the flra currently has an inactive deployment program for its pers onnel current leadership is focused on workforce planning succession planning wo rk plans needs to be part of this iii leadership and knowledge management agency leaders and managers effectively mana ge people ensure continuity of leadership and sustain learning environment that drives continuous improvement in performance the majority of the flra s quarter million budget is spent on the pay development and benefits for its employees the flra fficially allocates 50000 per employee for training while management supports learni ng environment in the flra the reality that most training courses exceed 50000 puts restriction on learning and development of flra employees the fact that flra has not yet instituted succession planning system along with the reality that significant amount of senior ma nagers are close to their retirement and that there has been significant turnover of gal as well as administrative employees may have significant effect on flra s productivity during the next few years although the flra has implemented tier i and tierii leadership program there has been activity in these programs over the last year th ere are also deficiencies in contemporary management knowledge ie respect for leadership and accountability professional behavior interactive communication etc an d federal program knowledge ie security procurement use of government credit cards et c related training should be priority for both tenured and new managers taking into consideration it s small size the flra has diversified workforce however it needs to focus on increasing the hiring of qualified veterans and minorities in its higher graded positions iv results oriented results oriented performance culture although the flra s strategic plan is results oriented there are senior management concerns over the untimeliness of some ca processing some untimeliness of both internal and external responses for administ rative information untimeliness of hiring employees and some untimeliness of technology and security development the current passfail performance system of the flra does not provide management or employees 15 for official use only with sufficiently detailed performance eval uation appraisal system which should focus on results and drive performance improvement the flra has diverse resultsoriented an d basically hard working workforce and has performance management system that differe ntiates between high and low performance but does not define intermediate levels th performance management system does link individualteam and unit performance to organizational goals and defined results v talent the flra has employed legal and labor manage ment personnel with sufficient skills to meet its technical mission some of these em ployees are also in managementsupervisory positions and do not have sufficient manage mentsupervisory skills andor training there has also been lack of sufficient focus on contemporary federal program skills of some employees working in the administra tive subcomponents human resources security computer technology this deficien cy needs to be addressed either by training and mentoring or future hiring as well as agen cywide briefing of current administrative program requirements asecurity health and safety federal management and employee responsibilities and rights use of government credit cards etc managers need to become aware of behavioral science and develop interpersonal skills and ensure that their work is assigned in manner that takes advantage of an employee s key capabilities and skills rather than just focusing on their vuln erabilities agency talent can be maximized by increasing interactive communication between management and employees which does exist in most of the component and subcomponent levels and by providing incentives to retain good employees and hiring skilled new employeesmanagers who have had experience working in small agency and are committed to serve their customers and senior leaders the flra needs to focus on the future as well as the present and identify the skills and experience for future hires vi accountability current flra leadership has placed an emphasis on management accountability and results oriented planning however so flra managers have had difficulty transitioning to the new flra environment th is resistance to transitioning in and of itself is human capital issue and is also affecting flra employees because they either observe are told about or are victims of the tension the smallness and unique mission of the flra has served both as coverup and defense mechanism for previous non compliance with several federal program and operational requirements including the fair act government information security act and the government performance results act rather than functioning operatio nally as single entity up until fy 2000 flra functioned administratively as three separa agencies rather than as one this has now changed and current leadership is promoting organizational unity management accountability and program and operational compliance with federal requirements not all of flra s management senior executives as well as line managers have been able to successfully transition to the new and accountable environment for many years the flra s authority members offices case control office office of 16 for official use only administrative law judges and office of th solicitor office of general counsel and federal services impasse panel have been ccumulating case processing data to address its strategic planning process and quantitative strategic goals the fact that the human resource division and information resource management had insufficient andor data supporting their work and strategic goals which were quantitative was brought up in several fy19982002 inspector general over sight activities data is now being kept past two years by flra s administrative program office s and technology division and should be actively used to analyze and prov ide human capital and administrative insight as well as the performance of flra s strategic goals major human capital statistics as part of this review the inspector genera l requested specific statistics relating to human capital which were provided by the hu man resource division andor the budget and finance division the following statemen ts are based on this statistical analysis the statistics are provided as an attachment flra human resources in fy 01 the flra had total of 208 employ ees includes senior executives law judges presidential employees and general schedule employees student and temporary hires totaled 5 4 of whom were students in fy 01 and 4 3 of whom were students in fy 2002 during both of these fiscal years the flra had two contractor staff members in the information resource management division one is help desk senior technician and the other is an oracle software developer the current human resource division statis tics do not provide sufficient information regarding current employee skills and potential skills needed for the future office of the general counsel does retain individual velopment plans for its employees who have not reached their performance level and has fined the necessary skills for its employees but this has not been done by the other flra components human resource expenditures 34 of flra s annual appropriation is spent on human resources in fy 01 the authority spent 93 of its fiscal year obligations on sa laries and benefits the office of the general counsel spent 88and the federal services im passe panel spent 89 of its fiscal year obligation on salaries and benefits 2 of the central services fund was also spent on human resources the same holds true for fy 2002 where the authority spent 93 the office of the general counsel spent 90 th federal services impasse panel spent 90 and 2 of the central services fund all ocations were spent on human resources promotions during fy 2001 there were 20 employee prom otions in the authority costing 159697 34 promotions in the office of the general counsel costing 213932 and 1 promotion in the federal services impasse panel costing 8 238 during fy 2002 the authority had 13 promotions totaling 84313 22 promotions in the office of the general counsel totaling 145854 and promotions in the federal services impasse panel these 17 for official use only statistics include ses level increases an d movement from gsgm to ses which are considered conversions to new appointments within grade increases during fy 2001 there were 26 authority em ployees who received within grade increases totaling 51 017 35 office of the genera l counsel employees who received within grade increases totaling 64943 and 3 within grad increases in the federal services impasse panel totaling 5496 during fy 2002 26 authority employees received within grade increases totaling 53430 33 office of the general counsel within grade increases totaling 71 057 and 1 federal services impasse panel within grade increase costing 2207 these statistics do not include ses level increases because ses increases were included in the promotion section above awards in fy 2001 181 flra general schedule em ployees received performance awards as well as 14 senior executives 30 special act awards were also processed the authority dedicated 75364 to the general schedule employee awards the office of the general counsel used 194109 for general schedule employee awards and 28 000 for senior executive awards both the authority and the federal services impasse panel used 67600 from the central services fund for senior executive awards during fy 2001 in fy 2002 233 performance awards includin g 30 special act awards were issued to general schedule employees all flra compone nts used total of 87657 from the central services fund for senior executive awards the authority used 98424 of its funding to provide general schedule employees performance awards the office of the general counsel used 142875 of its all ocations for general schedule employee awards and the federal services impasse panel used 7950 training the total cost of flra employee training in fy 2001 was 226070 the authority spent 102393 the office of the general counsel spent 71 552 the federal services impasse panel spent 4 210 226070 was spent from the central services fund during fy 2002 the total amount spent on training was 190 582 the authority spent 88921 on employee training the office of the general counsel spent 62111 and the federal services panel spent 2 805 36 745 was spent on training from the central services fund the inspector general review of documented fy 20012002 training revealed that all training was related to federal and labor mana gement issues the review revealed that one flra employee was receiving funding for college education courses which could be related to flra s mission the fact that the flra does not have policy relating to paying or reimbursing college expenditures and that other flra employee was aware of and 18 for official use only provided this opportunity makes this action unfair the majority of training for flra employees during fy 2001 and fy 2002 exceeded 50000 per per person in fact during fy 2002 2258000 was spent for training for one employee this information is an attachment to this report leadership training program the flra has created three leadership training programs the tier i program was designed for entry level through gs 1213 to help employees develop professional organizational and technical competencies there is documentation indicating that this program was ever implemented the tier ii program was designed to provide high potential gs 13 and 14 employees with leadership skills that would make them candid ates for positions of leadership within the agency team leader supervisory or managerial positions participants are required to complete this program in three years this program was implemented and was active in fy 2001 and fy2002 five flra employees from the fy 19 992001 program completed the program so far only 1 employee from the fy2000 20002 program has completed the requirements there are currently 3 em ployees participating in the fy 20012003 program the tier iii program was designed for supervis ors at the gs14 through senior executive level flra s executive resources board developed the training needs to enhance the skills and provide succession planning for on board senior executives during fy 2001 and 2002 all newly selected supervis ors received leadership training the office of general counsel has also create d leadership program designed to provide ogc gs14 employees appropriate technical mana gerial and leadership qualities during fy 2001 all ogc gs14s and 5 authorityfsip employees participated in 2 day training session related to this program this prog ram was not provided to employees because of budget constraints and the pending appointment of general counsel during fy 2003 three ogc employees attended the harvard law school harvard negotiation workshop in fy 2001 and two ogc employees attended the same course in fy 2002 also in fy 2002 three ogc employees attended the federal executive board leadership institute and one attended the federal executive insti tute ogc employees also attended various other training such as adr training the art of effective facilitation conflict management eeo training employment law an d representation case issues mediation and unlawful discrimination training tier iii program consisting of two phased five year programs with an emphasis on self motivation and managerial skills has also b een planned and intended for supervisors gs 14 through the senior executive levels to ei ther develop or enhance supervisory andor executive leadership skills for current or po tential senior executives this program has not been implemented 19 attrition rate for official use only the flra attrition rate for fy 2001 was 38 employees includes 6 retirements and 20 employees including 6 retirement for fy o2 excluding those employees who retired the flra s attrition rate over the last two years has been approximately 10 which is considered normal for federal government agency however because the flra is such small agency this attrition rate definitely impacts the productivity of the agency it is noteworthy to note that eight of the cu rrent senior executives and administrative law judges are eligible to retire the current amount of employees eligible for retirement in fy 2003 and fy 2004 are three and four respectively as result of an flra inspector general recommendation the human resource division began distributing an exit interview questio nnaire in april 2000 to departing employees for the primary purpose of capturing the reasons employees leave the agency and assessing their general satisf action with their flra work experience the first annual report covered the period of april 1 2000 through may 19 2001 although 43 employees separated during that period 25 authority 16 ogc and 2 fsip only 9 people returned the exit questionnaire conclusions could be rendered by the human resource division based on this small amount of exit questionnaires in august 2001 director of human reso urces issued memorandum to all flra managers and supervisors requesting that they provide the human resource division assistance in the exit interview questionnaire process specifically flra human resource division and office of the genera l counsel office managers were asked to ensure that the exit questionnaire be provid ed to each separating employee along with stamp flra addressed envelope for re turn to the human resource division supervisors office of the general counse l office managers and the human resource division staff should encourage employees to complete and submit the exit interview questionnaire at the same time they submit th required clearance checklist and that the human resource division send followup questionnaire to all employees one month after their separation requesting the questio nnaire if they have not submitted it within that time frame second exit survey summary covering employees leaving from may 20 2001 through may 19 2002 was prepared in june 2002 this summary was not released to management because only eight out of 34 em ployees leaving the agency responded to the questionnaire the data from those employees who submitted the exit interview questionnaires reflected various reasons for leaving including more pa more growth opportunity more personal time and different career interest fy 2001 and fy 2002 employees who left the flra did not provide specific negative comment s about their work experience training resources and management hiring personnel during fy 2001 the flra posted 54 announcements and hired 15 employees in fy 2002 23 vacancies were advertised and 8 of these were filled during fy 2oo2 more 20 for official use only focus was placed on upward mobility positi ons the office of the inspector general created and filled an upward mobility positi on and the cco created 2 upward mobility positions supervisory ratios in both fy 2001 and fy02 the flra had 36 supervisory positions includes vacant as well as encumbered positions specifically the supervisoryemployee ratios for the flra subcomponents are not standard and fall anyw here between one supervisory position for one employee office of he inspector genera l to one supervisory position for ten employees information resource division th office of the general counsel has three supervisory positions for eleven employees generally the regional offices have two supervisory positions for fourteen or fifteen employees the authority members offices range from two supervisory positions for eight or ten employees the office of the administrative law judges has one supervisory position for eight employees the office of case control has one supervisor for four empl oyees and the office of the solicitor has supervisory positions for seven employees performance awards during fy 2001 the flra spent 279393 on performance awards for general schedule employees and 95600 for senior executives for fy 2002 249 250 was spent for general schedule employee performance awar ds and 87657 was spent on senior executive performance awards grievances fy 2001 in july 2001 grievance was filed alleging failure to provide adequate notice on the nature and scope of work related to the installa tion of new lab tops in two regional offices which denied the uae the opportunity to negociate impact and implementation issues this grievance was denied because flra ma nagement and the uae had previously worked together on the same issues at another regional office fy 2002 in april 2002 step 1 grievance was filed concerning performance progress review in december 2002 the deciding official responde d that the grievance was not sustained even though the wording in the progress review wa s changed in consideration of the employees input another fy 2002 complaint pertained t0 an allegation of noncompliance with settlement agreement reached in fy 2001 as result of 2 complaints filed by one individual against the flra flra had pr eviously issued response denying the allegation the complainant subsequently appealed the issue to the eeoc findings of fact since human capital pertains to all empl oyees both managers and working level employees were interviewed the following are validated findings of fact 21 for official use only 1 in fy 2000 the flra inspector general assessment of flra s human capital focus revealed that the flra was well on its way in supporting human capital progress in this area has not continued sufficiently to support the same status currently in fy 2000 the flra was ahead of many federal agencies in its program implementations related to human capital the fact that this program became part of the president s management agenda generated the f ocus of all federal agencies toward human capital although the flra has im plemented many programs which pertain to human capital most of this implementation remains aon paper and is not completely institutionalized into the agency s operations managers acknowledged that over the last several years flra has done better job of providing services and implementing human capital programs such as flexiplace and ternative week schedules upward mobility program and tier i and ii programs which enhanced employee satisfaction and commitment there were several managers as well as employees who stated that these programs had to be expanded to provide mo re employees with these options others suggested that senior management should consider implementing programs which paid off percentage of college tuition assisted in financing graduate school courses and that part time employment and job sharing should be explored and implemented to provide other incentives for employee retention 2 most flra managerssupervisors understand the concept of human capital and it s focus on employees being considered an asset rather than cost with the exception of two all flra mana gers interviewed understood the general concept of human capital and its importance veral line managers stated that specific human capital training would be beneficial and help managers put the concept into practice only one manager stated that there was little evidence of human capital fundamentals being used to achieve the fl ra mission several managers commented that the flra s strategic plan and performance system is not oriented to human capital standards and that human capital teamwo rk and more management communication was needed for immediate improvement 3 most senior flra managerssuper visors understood the importance of human capital and its inclusion in the president s management agenda line managers were not as well informed on this subject most senior managers who were interviewe d understood the reasoning behind the president s management agenda as result of attending related conference in fy 2002 line managers were not as knowledg eable as their senior managers collegial cohesive and comprehensive workforce strategy needs to be developed and oriented toward human capital objectives to support the flra s mission majority of flra s workforce interviewed stated that they would like more information briefing andor policy on the president s management agenda human ca pital strategic planning diversity eeo and the retention of qualified personnel 22 for official use only 4 performance management needs to focus more on teamwork results and accountability significant number of managers felt that the current flra passfail system is not sufficient for properly evaluating employees performance virtually all flra managers considered their employees as vital asset to accomplishing the flra s mission in an effective and efficient way most commented that the current performance management system is focused on individual rather than team performance more operative in the legal subcomponents than the administrative subcomponents and that the current apassfail performance evaluation system should be revisited by management because it does not appropriately address performance 5 flra does not currently have workforce planning and succession strategy which would promote cont inuity and lessen performance gaps caused by personnel turnover component and regional managers were t aware of any flra workforce planning strategy and felt that such planning was necessary and would benefit the agency the majority of flra managers felt it was very important for the agency to plan for the future and improve its current communication processes 6 the flra does not have specific policy related to human capital while the flra is not required to have huma n capital officer this responsibility could be assigned to senior manager who is knowledgeable or trained in current human capital initiatives to help the agency f ocus appropriately on human capital issues irregardless of such an appointment agency level briefings instructions andor policies and procedures that addressed work vironment which encourages work excellence and human capital initiatives has not occurred an d would be beneficial for all levels of employees morale issues are pervasiv throughout the agency and are effecting performance and attitudes and need more senior management attention 7 the flra has not yet successfully integrated political and career leadership into cohesive leadership team although current leadership is focusing on consolidating the three major components and transitioning employees to consider the flra as one agency instead of three it is important to establish strong working relati onship among senior leadership irregardless of their political or competitive source of appo intment the fact that such relationship does not exist is noted by significant amount of employees and is negatively affecting the work environment morale most employees interviewed stated that their supervisors were working managers and very knowledgeable but the majority of them focused predominantly on their own projects and t on their employees several employees commented that there was too much politi cal dissension which has effected employee commitment and productivity most working level employees interviewed stated that their own subcomponent management encoura ged teamwork innovation and created 23 for official use only participative environment but they did not feel that this environment was pervasive throughout the agency 8 flra has dual challenge to tr to retain its tenured and skilled employees as well as prepare for the real ity that the current private sector as well as federal work environment will encourage more employee turnover the majority of flra managers are appropri ately focused on developing their employees competencies through on the job and external training more job flexibility upward mobility positions and detailing of empl oyees could improve employee retention managers of legal staffs felt that attorneys wi th experience should be hired at the gs11 level and the journeyman level should be gs1 4 which are the levels used in other federal adjudicatory agencies majority of interviewed employees stated th ey felt they were micromanaged and never asked for suggestions regarding operational or program procedures this is an opposite perspective from management who majoritively stated that they sought input from their employees succession planning for the futur at the flra is minimal in spite of the continuing turnover of personnel 9 flra managers and employees ar not sufficiently knowledgeable of applicable federal legislation and program requirements the majority of flra managers verified that they were not provided sufficient or enough timely management information andor auth ority to be able to respond to their employees questions several line managers stat ed that they need clear understanding of the president s management aagenda more information on available resources and the specific objectives of current leadership presidential appointeessenior executives 10 the flra s strategic plan has not been updated to focus on the president s management agenda gove rnment wide standards several managers commented on the obsoleteness of the flra s strategic plan these managers all felt that the original plan focuse d to heavily on timelines rather than quality of service one manager stated that the flra s mission and strategic plan should be revisited because it was formulated during democratic administration and it needed to be restructured to include the standards of the current republican administration there were several managers who were not sure what the agency s current strategic vision and plan were most managers felt that the flra needed to focus on the quality of work qualitative rather than on numeric goals qua ntitave even though numeric goals can be easily measured 11 the flra does not currently conduct regular agencywide management meetings 24 currently the flra does not hold regu larly scheduled agencywide management meetings most flra component and line managers communicate and interface with their employees on regular basis howe ver many cannot communicate agencywide information to their employees because th ey themselves are not informed all for official use only component managers stated they interact and communicate with their employees and encouraged and valued employee feedback employees did not affirm this some managers actually used their employees to br ainstorm technical administrative andor management issues some have weekly sc heduled staff meetings while others have meetings as required establishing communi cative and interactive agencywide meetings would provide mechanism for senior manageme nt to provide direction and managers to share their work progress such an initiative would enhance management knowledge and promote more of an agency wide focus it would also encourage more component interaction 12 regional managers management authority has increased under current leadership while current flra leadership has strength ened the management responsibilities of flra regional directors several of the re gional managers commented that there was too much administrative work for their current staffing level and that the capabilities of the regional directors to manage their regions effectively were underestimated 13 flra s compensation system for entry level and journeyman level legal employees is lower than other similar federal adjudicatory agencies flra s compensation system for working level attorneys is not aligned with those systems of most other federal agencies although money is not considered the major motivating incentive for most federal employees both flra managers and legal working level employees brought this issue up most other fe deral agencies hire entry level attorneys at the gs11 level while flra usually hires at the gs9 level the journeyman level for attorneys in other federal adjudicatory agenci is at the gs14 level while flra attorneys are at the gs13 level with the exception of entry level attorneys gs9 and journeyman level gs13 most managers felt the flra compensation system was parallel to most other federal agencies the current flra attorney hiring level was not however considered sufficient to obtain andor retain high quality performers since other federal and private sector positions payed more several managers stated they would like more flexibility to offer higher grades and promotions 14 the flra award system does not ve standards or controls to ensure that employees who perform at an exceptional level are appropriately recognized the flra s award system needs to be assessed by management and improved so that it provides standards which focus on the truly good and dedicated employees who contribute beyond their work plans and not just satisfy the work plans it is important to note that the flra s quarterly award system which focuses on employees is positive part of the current system however not all incentives and recognition need to cost money verbal acknowledgment written ac knowledgment special conference training time off and agencywide recognition are so alternatives which can be incorporated into the flra s system 25 for official use only some employees stated that their position cl assification and actual work structure were not accurate and they were not appropri ately appraised for the actual work they performed several employees commented that there was need for more employee incentives such as more training time ff awards promotions to increase employee motivation over the past few years flra management has issued performance awards to broad range of its employees whil management feels they are using the performance awards in fair and productive manner number of flra employees stated that the way the performance award system is administrated does not truly differentiate between exceptional and normal employees and is focused on rewarding management vice employees 15 the flra s focus on employee training and development is not sufficiently funded but generally focuses on contemporary needs although the official allocation of 50000 per employee is not realistic most external training runs from 60000 to 90000 plus travel costs depending on the level the flra does support the need to train and velop its employees virtually all managers stated that flra s focus on training and employee development was adequate several employees had the incorrect perception that tr aining should equate to promotions rather than knowledge and skills to better perfor m their current job several employees suggested that more effort be made to provide employees the opportunity to perform at higher level positions such as when managers were on leave or when vacancies occurred several working level administrative program personnel stated that they did not receive on the job training from their managers because of the manager s extensive workload and in some instances because the lack of in depth of federal program knowledge of their manager several employees and managers st ated that they needed more training in technology and security less than half of the employees interviewed stated that they have received sufficient information on admini strative programs such as security health care eeo thrift savings time and attendan ce personnel policy technology and work requirements several employees stated that training is insufficient for administrative personnel professional personnel are generally traine d within their area of responsibility administrative personnel did not feel they were adequately trained for all of their responsibilities while the tier ii leadership program appeared to be beneficial enhancements for employees positive results have not yet been seen several employees who participated in this program have left the flra for other federa l or private sector jobs the majority of lower graded employees interviewed felt th at the flra upward mobility program needs more positions more funding and more manage ment support several participants stated that they thought the program would provide the basis for promotions but it did not two individuals who have filed equal employment opportunity complaints stated that the administration of this program did not support confidentiality and because of this 26 for official use only other employees who have eeo issues we re very reluctant to file them 16 current communicationinteraction among and in some cases within the flra components does not support the flra s agencywide concept communication and interface are essential requirements for successful and timely actions over the last decade these two hu man capital actions have diminished in many organizations due to many causes including increased workload and diminished staffing computer technology confidential or sens itive issues management and employee behavioral styles and excessive manageme nt control over the last few years management meetings internal and external program and operational briefings offsite meetings employee orientation s and even internal discussions of current issues andor events have diminished previous human reso urces and office of the executive director attempts to conduct management meetings an dor program or operational briefings have not been successful because of poor attendance all flra managers interviewed acknowledged the importance of communication between all components and between management and the workforce in order to ensure that all agency employees are provided with the same information one senior manager stated he was almost completely isolated from other management officials managers acknowledged that over the last several year s flra has done better job of providing services and implementing human capital prog rams such as flexiplace and alternative week schedules which enhanced employee sa tisfaction and commitment there were several manager who stated that these programs had to be expanded to provide more employees with these options others suggest ed that senior management should consider implementing programs which paid off pe rcentage of college tuition assisted in financing graduate school courses and that part time employment and job sharing should be explored and implemented to provide other incentives for employee retention this followup revealed that there are sti ll some subcomponent managers who have not issued work plans or individual developm ent plans to their employees some line managers were not knowledgeable about human capital or the government wide standards of the president s management agenda some managers as well as employees did not have sufficient knowledge of curity procurement health and safety requirements for the use of government credit cards or contemporary communication biopsychological and behavioral elements several tenured authority senior managers stated that flra needed to do better job of training its managers and supervisors at all levels office of the general counsel managers felt they were adequately trained but that the agency should focus on leadership training for all gs14s to help qualify them for management positions the need for successi on planning was supported by virtually all managers especially for leadership roles some managers felt that until policy was created for human capital agency individuals who in tended to retire should document their positions prior to retiring some felt that specific employees should be trained to fulfill the position when it became vacated even if it were only in an aacting capacity also both managers and employees need to focus more on agency wide team work although several committees were formulated during the past year most of the management 27 for official use only members focused on their own needs vice the agency s needs 17 the flra human resources division needs to improve the agency s hiring process provide flra managers and employees with sufficient and timely information on issuesprogram s that effect them and focus on contemporary human capital program requirements while significant deterrent to the flra huma n resource division has been the lack of tenured director and significant amount of employee turnover over the last two years those few remaining employees have tried hard to keep the program running efficiently but can only do so much several managers have ataken over some of the human resource divisions responsibi lities such as position description writing informing employees of contemporary employee programs and issues in order to keep productive and address the agency s mission requirements once the human resources subcomponent is stabilized the flra needs to address hiring procedures improve the formulation of position descriptions requir work plans for all working level employees and speed up both processes 28 for official use only inspector general comments the days of bureaucratic government environment are over the government is currently on the verge of significant tran sformation which will affect what federal agencies provide and the way they do it most federal agencies have become alearning organizations which focus on customer satisfaction require versatile skills networking innovation and creativity and shared vision of the agency s mission successful organizations have managers and employees who understand they must often change their culture in order to transform themselves this change for the flra has started with top leadership but is being resisted by significant number of tenured employees senior executives need to align their performance goals with the agency s mission in results oriented perspective and understand that they are accountable all managers must integrate their contributions with the top level vision and develop new thinking which will hopefully eventually shape new behavi or managers need to understand that current leadership is building foundation for change and improvement in operations and that the structure systems staffing and strategies of previous years are longer applicable to the current environment senior executives need to ensure that their goals and individual performance cascade within flra s various organization levels and support current government priorities the botto m line is that even though change must start with top leadership line management and employees must support it for it to work the flra s current line management and employee resistance to current leadership changes and its emphasis on accountability fl exibility and unity as one organization has definitely affected the flra s work and cultural environment and has lessened employee self motivation and commitments to the agency there is currently too much resistence by line management to do things differently an d to be accountable for their actions this management resistance to change has been recognized by majority of flra working level employees some employees have also acquired this same attitude because their supervisors have verbalized their negative opinions concerning the current environment which has become more results oriented less hierarchical and more integrated 1 significant amount of flra employees currently lack contemporary visionary 1 the federal services impasse panel contributes to the flra s performance but their employees still have minimal exposure to or integration into the current flra culture the same is true for the office of the ge neral counsel regional office employees 29 for official use only perspective flra management has to adjust to the reality that newer professional hires do not enter government with the expectation of long term commitment as did previous hires this will require flra management to focus on getting its work done in an environment which will involve frequent staffing changes and perhaps lower experience levels flra has to adjust to the new adynamics in the marketplace which will require the development of strategies for recruiting and retaining the best employees another reality is that flra will have significant turno ver as will other agencies but the effect will be greater because of the smallness of the ag ency the flra will have to do better job of identifying workforce requirements capita lize on the strengths of different employee generations and develop new approaches to ensure an organizational culture that supports positive changes communication is another area that needs to be addressed and improved senior and line headquarters managers need to have more routine interaction among themselves as well as with their staffs timely feedback fr om employees and line managers should be considered important to senior levels of ma nagement feedback to employees on their efforts suggestions proposals and even advi ce would have positive effect on the working environment and enhance employee moti vation and productivity technology is wonderful but it should not be allowed to eliminate face to face communication and interaction the majority of managers focused on thei r own issues and did not appear to be sufficiently agency oriented there is notice able tension among substantial amount of flra managers and employees who do not derstand why administrative changes are being made and are resisting transition to the new administration and flra leadership s vision management needs to aget on board and become proactive and not reactive leadership needs to communicate the current vision of the flra to senior and line managers who then need to revise their management methods and engage in strategic planning to meet the standards of the chairman flra and the president s management agenda flra leadership needs to assure fl ra managers and employees that they are valued and respected and that their functions are essential to the agency the current flra environment needs more trust more cooperation and more unity mentoring is cogent and important method for training current employees and growing future leaders it also helps forming positive relationships between supervisorsmanagers and employees and can be evaluated as part of succession planning it also creates trust loyalty and commitment to the organization cross functional rotations also help employees understand other aspects of the environment and provides more internal broad based awareness learning new approa ches and applications broadens employees perspectives and future leadership capabilities in the past flra management has been somewhat reluctant to incorporate cross fun ctional rotations and mobility into their operations but such actions ultimately will benefit the agency and employees most employees were aware that the flra d developed strategic plan but were not aware of any updates or revisions and some had never been provided copy of the initial plan several employees commented that ther are very few minorities are in high 30 for official use only positions and lower graded employees have w expectations several support personnel stated that flra management focuses on it s professional vice administrative support personnel and does not credit or recognize administrative personnel for their ideas and suggestions one employee brought up the fact that most awards are based on percentage of the employee s salary and that this caused working level employees to receive much less than more senior employees this individual stated that performance awards should be balanced and based on performance rather than salaries while computer technology is definitely wo rk asset it has diminished interactive communication staff meetings briefings etc at all levels this may be part of the reasons for flra s tense environment flra managers and employees needs to have more face to face interactions and feel comfortable stating their perspectives understanding that final decisions will be made by senior leadership management should restore monthly management meetings specific offsite activities and encourage teamwork and organizational support and areinstate teamwork at all levels most managers agreed that workforce pla nning strategy both short and long term would be helpful for the flra to identify it s current and future human capital needs all levels of management should be involved in this planning because they are all responsible for ensuring that the flra s mission is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner results oriented goals program integrity customer orientation information security communication and feedback behavior as we ll as core competencies are all linked to human capital employees who had supervis ors who conducted weekly staff meetings appeared to be more motivated and dedicated to their jobs than those employees who had supervisors that did not routinely provide them with component agency or subcomponent information most legallabor management professional employees interviewed felt they had good training and on the job instruction and success fully journeyed through their positions but were unhappy that their entry level and journe yman level positions were lower than other similar federal adjudicatory agencies severa l legal employees focused heavily on what the agency aowed them rather than what responsibi lities they as employees owed the agency several paraprofessionals felt th eir work was too clerical and that their development was hindered by this situation some employees felt their efforts and contributions to the agency were not ackn owledged properly and that sometimes aa thank you is worth more than million dollars two years ago the human capital review reve aled that flra was ahead of most of the other agencies in the human capital area as it should be because of the nature of its mission some progress has been made in some of the noted areas of vulnerability but not enough management must adjust and successfully transition to the current environment which is becoming prevalent in most federal agencies focus more on issues and actions that affect the growth progress an d productivity of both the agency mission and employees this is indeed time of ch ange and perhaps an unwanted challenge to some employees but they must understand th at the purpose of this change is to strengthen and perpetuate our existence as citizens as well as government employees all flra individuals have the same responsibility to go forward 31 for official use only there has been large turnover of employees during the last 6 months including several administrative and support program manage rs the lack of succession planning sufficient documented policies and procedu res and continuing turnover of personnel indicates that the flra needs to focus more productively on human capital issues and employees need to be forthcoming and tr uthful about their concerns and reasons for leaving the flra 32 for official use only status of findings from fy 2000 human capital review as part of this followup the flra inspec tor general met with the former executive director director of human resources and th assistant director of human resources to discuss the status of flra s actual actions relating to the findings and recommendations of the fy 2000 human capital review the following information provides the current status of fy 2000 human capital corrective actions 1 conduct exit interviews to provide annual data on the reasons employees leave flra exit interviews are being conducted by the human resources division related data is being kept and report has been issued however there is enough data to determine trends flra partnership council re search and develop employment retention incentives the flra partnership counsel is longer active so this recommendation has not been addressed management should address this issue and coordinate its incentives with the uae 2 review work requirements for entry level and journey level attorneys to validate grade levels as result of this recommendation more gs14 journeyman level positions have been created in the legal components but entry level attorneys are classified as gs 9 and entry level labor management spec ialists are usually classified as gs7 3 budget 3 of yearly appropri ation for employee training require idps and discussions of training with supervisors and peers to get maximum return on training investments rejected by former management current management should reconsider this recommendation the reality is that the flra does spend close to 3 on traini ng even though the stated allowance is 50000 per person and should get ahuman capital credit for doing so most headquarters employees do not have individual development plans ogc personnel do and upward mobility pers onnel should and training is often duplicated among employees instead of being shared 4 revitalize upward mobility program for development of administrative support parapro fessional and clerical personnel the flra has placed focus on revitalizi ng its upward mobility program the flra currently has 2 non legal upward mobi lity positions office of the inspector 33 for official use only general and human resources division and two being filled at this time in the authority case control office as vacancies occur designate 2 positions for the upward mobility program and open to all flra employees previous management would not commit to specific number of positions this recommendation has been addressed 5 educate supervisors on obli gations and responsibilities in personnel management and performance appraisals some training was provided for supervis ors in fy 2000 however subsequent oversight evaluations and investigations ve revealed that flra supervisors and managers still need more trai ning in human capital aspects ensure that all first line pervisors have human resource performance element and are rated on their supervisory performance and mentorship as well as technical elements flra managerssupervisors currently have performance element related to their supervision and human resource functions as well as their technical responsibilities b plan activities seminars or offsites fostering communication between employees and management during fy 2002 the flra held an off site for administrative personnel which included myers briggs testing as well as training in specific administrative programs participating employee feedback was very positive similar activities shou ld be planned for management and managementemployees in the future 6 develop internal technical or ientations for new employees at the organizational element level and provide to new employees prior to initial major workload assignments this is performed by individual managers and designated employees to help new employees transition to the flra mission and environment there is standardization of this process and each of the three major flra components orient this initial training to their specific statutory mission 34 for official use only 7 conduct position management reviews andor workload analysis on all flra employees consider flra s vacated positions prior to rehiring and conduct workload analysis of all organizations to ensure grade levels are proper classification and allocations support reoccurring mission essential work load former flra management did not concur prior flra management did not concur with this recommendation however several position management reviews c ase control office authority were conducted by the former director of human resources in fy 2000 the flra inspector general conducted work analysis of flra management positions in fy 2002 work analysis of working level employees should also be done 8 require all managerssupervisors to acquire training in human resource and contemporary manageme nt skills within 6 months of the acceptance of managementsupervisory position all current managerssupervisors should obtain this training within 6 months 0f the issuance of this report although this recommendation was reported to the inspector general as completed this followup revealed that agencywide action has been taken to implement this requirement sponsor periodic management meetings invite community speakers knowledgeable in contemporary human resource matters behavioral science and federal management practices to enhance flra managementsupervisors perspectives some management meetings were conducted during fy 2001 by the former assistant to the executive director th external briefings pertained to legal ethical and some federal program matters none have been conducted during this past year previous flra management meet ings were held periodically to inform managers of federal and senior leadership information and to encourage individual managers to talk about what they were currently involved in these meetings were formulated by the flra ex ecutive director only one such meeting regarding the geographical moving of the flra was held this past year 9 employees do not have sufficient security and health information and implement an agency wide preventive violence in the workplace program while essential and emergency security information has been provided since the september 11 2001 incident the flra has still not implemented contemporary and sufficient security program whil health and security information are distributed on cyclic basis many flra employees feel they are not sufficiently informed while violence in the workplace includes verbal as well as physical was 35 for official use only focused issue for the flra in fy 2000 other than briefing provided by the flra inspector general and the incorporation of this issue by the general counsel into the office of the general counsel investigation manual other formal actions were performed by the flra 10 uaeflra reviewrevise or cancel as appropriate memorandums of understanding executed prior to and including 1995 according to the flra executive director this recommendation has been implemented and executed 36
