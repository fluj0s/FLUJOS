disposition may be reflected in roll call vote on the motion or objection or may be in ferred from the subsequent conduct of the trial with regard to tha t evidence during the trial of judge james h peck the senate on january 7 1831 heard argument on the issue of whether the strict rules of evidence as applied in the courts were applicable in impeachment trails to assist it in determining the appropriateness of witness being asked to give an opinion on an is sue of fact before the senate the respondent in the case favored relaxat ion of the rules of evidence in the impeachment trial context so that the witness involved might be permitted to voice such an opinion the house managers opposed this position arguing that the strict rules of evidence should be applied and that the opini on testimony be excluded by vote of 7 yeas to 35 nays t he senate sustained the objection of the house of representatives to th proffered evidence of the respondent iii hinds 2218 at 537539 this

is limited in the judgments available to removal from office or removal and disqualification from future offices of public trust although th american impeachment process has its roots in the british impeachment process and the british practice can at times provide enlightenment one must bear thei r differences in mind when considering the precedential value of the britis h impeachment practice to the american impeachment process in the 1862 impeachment trial of judge west humphre ys strict adherence to the rules of evidence was required particularly since the respondent did not appea r himself or through counsel iii hinds 2395 at 817 the impeachment trial f presiden t andrew johnson in 18671868 also provides some insight regarding th appropriate evidentiary standards to be applied in t he impeachment context on april 16 1868 mr charles sumner of massachusetts proposed declaration of opinio n designed to relax th strictness of evidentiary rules to be applied in the impeachment trial the proposed declaration said considering the character of this proceed ing that it is trial of impeachment before the senate of the united states and not proceeding by indictment in an inferior court considering that senators are from beginning to end judges of law as well as fact and that they are judges from whom there is appeal considering that according to parliamentary usage which is the guide in all such cases there is on trials of impeachment certain latitude of inquiry and freedom from technicality and considering finally that already in the course of this trial there hav been differences of opinion as to the admissibility of evidence therefore in order to re move all such differences and to hasten the dispatch of busine ss it is deemed advisable that all evidence offered on either side t trivial or obviously irrelevant in nature shall be received without objection it being understood that the same when admi tted shall be open to question and comparison at the bar in order to determine its competency and value and shall be carefully sifted and weighted by senators in the final judgmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30042crs63 the motion was tabled by vote of 33 yeas to

claiborne s substantive evidence the house observed that the rules of procedure practice in the senate when sitting n impeachment trials contain specific standard for when evidence is admissible in an

cited mccormick on evidence sec 267 p 791 3d ed 1984 for the proposition that an incourt admission by an ttorney generally is held by courts to bind the client event though the attorney is not sw orn as witness this suggests that the house managers in their memorand um in support of this motion relied both upon the federal rules of evidence and upon treatis which addresses more general common law principles similarly their argument seems to indicate view that the senate is not bound by either the federal rules of evidence or common w principles alone in its consideration of ev identiary questions in an impeachment trial but rather can use both as sources of guidance to assist the arguments of the house of representatives in its memorandum in support of motion in limine to exclude

it would serve useful purpose to declare any particular system to be supreme impeachment handbook 1974 by professor charles black of yal university discusses the entire impeachment process professor black suggests that technical rules of evidence designed for juries have place in th impeachment process both the house and the sen ate ought to hear and consider all evidence which seems relevant without regard to technical rules senators are in any case continually exposed to hearsay evidence they cannot be sequestered and kept away from newspa pers like jury if they cannot be trusted to weigh evidence appropriately discounting for all th factors of unreliability that have led to our keeping some evidenc away from juries then they are not in any way up to the job and rules of evidence will not help simpson is federal impeachments supra discussed rules of evidence in impeachment proceedings simpson noted the senate has invariably received all the evidence which i t deemed relevant from any witness who had personal knowledge of the facts matter by whom it was to be proved and left its weight to be determined upon final consideration the senate must retain its fr eedom to review evidence issues as they present themsel ves the senate should not restrict itself unnecessarily by making it s decisions in vacuum before the trial has even begun thus the senate committee on rules and dministration rejected the notion that the senate need bind itse lf to particular evidentiary standard prior to the trial on judge hasting s impeachment articles it noted the prior practice of looking to earlie r impeachment practices and observed that in the previous impeachment trial that of judge claiborne the house managers cited to the federal rules of evidence t provide guidance while

may provide some guidance to the committee members of the senate sit both as judges of law and fact precise rules of evidence are t needed in an impeachment trial to protect jurors lay triers of fact from doubtful evidence in the end th task of memb ers of the senate will be to weigh the relevance and quality of th evidence conclusions the precedents reviewed above suggest th at in the past the senate has preferred to take guidance from the evidentiary standards current in the judicial branch at the time of the impeachment at hand or from prior impeachment practice rather tha n binding itself to specific set of rules r standards as an immutable form to which the evidence introduced in n impeachment must conform this approach has permitted the senate greater flexibility in the admission of evidence which it has deeme d relevant material and credible the humphreys case suggests that the senate may be particularly strict in its constructio n of evidentiary standards where the respondent in the impea chment trial has not appeared in person or by counsel the senate s refusal to relax its adherence to the then current rules of evidence in that cas suggests that the senate may be particularly attentive to these rules where th protectio ns of the respondents interests inherent in an adversarial proceeding ar absent ho wever the peck trial where the senate also rejected move to relax the applicable rules of evidence to permit the respondent to introduce witness testimony to which the house objected appears to reflect the fact that the senate may adhere to the strict rules of evidence current at the time of an impeachment trial even where the respondent is present wit h counsel on the other hand in the recent proceedings with respect to judge claiborne and judge hastings the senate has refused to bind itself to specific set of evidentiary rules the senate is the final arbiter with regard to evidentiary questions as well s other issues of fact and law in an impeachment trial should the senate so choose it can admit evidence which might not be admissible in court of law under applicable rules of evidence the absence of binding set of evidentiary rules in th impeach ment setting may create some uncertainty for house managers and thei r counsel and for respondent and his counsel in their preparation of their cases for the impeachment trial in addition it may make the task of the senate in ruling upo n evidentiary matters more difficult because of the absence of hard and fast standards to apply however while guidance may be gleaned from the evidentiary rules an d principles applicable in the courts at the time of the impeachment proceedings an d from prior precedents from earlier impeachment trials the flexibility inherent in the absence of binding set of rules permits the senate to temper its evidentiary rulings to its perception of the pro bative weight of the evidence offered balanced against its potential to prejudice or mislead rather than to strict adherence to more inflexible standard elizabeth b bazan legislative attorney
