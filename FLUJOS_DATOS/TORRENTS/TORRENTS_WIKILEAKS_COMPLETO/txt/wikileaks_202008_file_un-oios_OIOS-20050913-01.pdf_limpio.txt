taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subproject agreements except for one subproject under the 2 003 emergency programme of the ministry of planning and international cooperation for this subproject there was lack of documentation to support the expenditure incurred oios assessed that internal controls for the other partners were generally in place and oper ating effectively 10 unhcr had contracted an external audit fir m to perform the audits for 2003 sub projects with local partners audit certificates we re available and unqualified opinions were expressed for all subprojects the external audito rs management letters were fairly detailed and to an extent enabled oios to reduce the scope f the audit of partners care australia 11 care was responsible for two subprojects one included activities such as community development counselling inkind assista nce and training to urban refugees the other provided community services and motherchild health services in the two refugee camps in ruwaished and mans land 12 cares internal control mechanisms were ge nerally in place and working effectively expenditures were appropriately approved and suppor ted by adequate documentation care is prequalified by unhcr to conduct procurement on their behalf but only minor items like office supplies sanitary napkins and material for community centres were purchased procedures were assessed as generally satisfactory and operating effectively during the period under review b ministry of planning international cooperat ion 13 the government of jordan through mop und ertakes the necessary measures to maintain the unhcr camp infrastructure this includ ed the involvement of the ministry of water ministry of energy civil defense and the nistry of health 3 14 mop had manual accounting system whereby expenditures were recorded on ledger oios found evidence however that the ac counting records were reviewed or approved by anyone but the accountant who prepared them mop had separate bank account for unhcr funds but bank reconciliations were p repared oios recommended that internal controls be strengthened to ensure there i s proper segregation of duties and accounting records and reconciliations are independ ently reviewed and approved by supervisor the representation has requested the mop to strengt hen internal controls by ensuring accounting work is properly supervised and segregated and bank reconciliations are prepared and reviewed on regular basis 15 for the 2004 subproject assurance nonethe less could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted the expenditures charged m ainly related to the supply of water kerosene and health services the delivery of water and kerosene was closely monitored and checked by camp management jhco and oios found t hat there were adequate controls to ensure the appropriate level of health services wer provided as agreed under the subproject 16 while mop is the coordinator between minis tries there were written agreements with them to document the work required or the good s to be delivered everything was agreed in official letters which mop sent to oth er ministries referring to the subproject agreement between unhcr and the government of jorda n the letters simply provided the other ministries with financial ceiling for the r equired services or goods the representation has requested mop to prepare written agreements wit h other ministries for the delivery of goods and services listed in the subproject agreem ent 17 for the 2003 emergency project 03sbjore m130 with expenditure of us 907011 for camp infrastructure mop was respon sible for coordinating some of the construction work related to the establishment of t he two camps oios was unable to obtain any documents pertaining to mops management of the project and were only presented with invoices from the ministry of public works the inv oices simply listed details of the work done ie machines used and staff hours worked th is data could not be correlated to the charges made to unhcr in the spmr moreover there were supporting documents to verify that the results of the work done were in ac cordance with the expected outcomes as listed in the subproject agreement oios visit to the camps to observe the work done could also not confirm that unhcr funds were properly acc ounted for this should have been identified as part of unhcrs regular programme mon itoring moreover the spmr narrative for the subproject was neither available in unhcr nor mop oios suggested that if the scope of work with mop ever increases the r epresentation should ensure the results are properly monitored and controls by unhcr 18 oios noted that mop paid the highest possi ble rate for electricity jd 0080 per kwh mop explained that this was the normal rate between ministries oios noted however that the rates charged for charities given in the price lis t attached to the invoices was discounted by 25 per cent and further discounted rates could be given for other consumption categories oios was of the opinion that unhcr as humanitari an organization should get the most favourable rate available if 25 per cent discoun t was applied to the current rate it could result in savings of some us 6000 per year the representation has taken this issue up with mop and it is exploring it with the ministry of ene rgy response is expected soon 4 recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in jordan should continue negotiations with the ministry of planning and international coo peration and the ministry of energy to ensure that unhcr as humani tarian organization obtains electricity for the ruwaished camp at favourable rate considering the discounts already given to other organisations this could result in savings to unhcr of us 12000 over twoyear period rec 01 c jordan hashemite charity organization jhco 19 jhco is charity organization mainly invo lved with operations outside jordan for example they were operating in the west bank darf ur and the tsunami relief operation in asia it is officially an ngo but it has close rel ations to the government of jordan 20 the internal controls over the authorizing function were generally in place and operating effectively and expenditures were adequa tely supported jhco had separate bank account for unhcr funds and it was operated on join t signatory basis bank statements and regular bank reconciliations were available for our review but we noted that they were not reviewed or approved by an independent person the representation has requested jhco to strengthen internal controls by ensuring that bank reconciliations are reviewed on regular basis 21 jhcos procurement procedures were general ly satisfactory and the supporting documentation attached to the payment vouchers was adequate for its domestic purchases jhco was not exempt from sales tax nonetheless it mainly consisted of the procurement of food which had sales tax imposed on bread and nly between two to six per cent on vegetables depending on the country of origin oi agreed with the representation that direct procurement by jhco with its longterm local procurement experience was more cost effective than if goods were purchased taxfree dir ectly by unhcr b other programme issues 22 oios assessed that project financial and p erformance monitoring was competently performed it was conducted on quarterly basis on the submission of the spmrs the findings were documented and discussed with the par tners involved the representation organized and conducted training for partners as an d when required oios highlighted however that more vigorous project monitoring of mo ps management of activities might be required considering the lack of confidence in the level of camp construction work conducted under the 2003 emergency subproject 23 the budgeted amount allocated to sector p in some cases appeared excessive oios pointed out that it should normally not exceed 15 p er cent of the total budget of subproject the representation took note and stated that action would be taken in the new subproject agreements issued during 2005 and for all 2006 sub project agreements 5 c supply management 24 the level of procurement by the representa tion was limited for the purchasing undertaken however oios found that the representat ion generally adhered to unhcr procurement rules and procedures and they were oper ating effectively during the period under review the logistics unit of the representation ma inly served the iraq operation unit in amman ioua which oios reviewed and reported on u nder different assignment local committee on contracts lcc was established in 2003 and subsequently converted to regional committee on contracts rcc in 2004 oi review of the lccrcc assessed that it was working effectively 25 oios recommended as part of the 2002 audit that competitive bidding be conducted for various activities including security travel office supplies training and fuel oios was pleased to note that most of these goods and servic have now been procured competitively it was noted nonetheless that the supplier for mobi phone services costing us 66000 in 2004 had not been selected competitively even thou gh there were several operators currently in jordan oios recommended that the representation comply with unhcrs procurement rules and procedures and select the mobile phone rvice supplier after competitive bidding exercise has been undertaken the representation stated that in may 2005 during the common administrative services task cast force eting the above issue was raised with all agencies to obtain competitive offer from the three existing companies during the june cast meeting and further to comparison made between three companies it has been agreed to select the provider with the best corpora prices and that the agencies in jordan will use their services d administration 26 in the areas of administration and finance the unhcr representation in jordan generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under review financial management 27 segregation of duties was not always obser ved and proper certifying approving and authorizing procedures were not always in place oi reminded the representation that staff member should approve any payments to himher self or authorize their own travel the representation accepted the recommendation but stat ed that at times there were only few authorized signatories present thus necessitating ccasionally the beneficiary to sign for himherself the representation has taken note of t he recommendation to draw up note for the file in such instances oios would remind the representation that for staff members to approve their own payments is serious weakness in internal controls and note for the file will not suffice and cannot mitigate the risks asso ciated with such practice oios would reiterate that under circumstances should office rs be approving their own entitlementspayments the responsibility must be g iven to another officer with delegated authority to approve the payment 6 b official travel 28 in july 2003 the representation introduced the practice of using monthly travel authorizations to facilitate visiting camps staff mainly drivers used these and submitted their travel claims at the end of each month oios reviewed the monthly travel authorizations and noted that while they were usually issued at th beginning of the month in some cases they were issued late and backdated to the first of the month in one case the travel authorization was approved only on the 18th for the full month of october 2004 29 improvements were instigated for 2005 and from january 2005 monthly travel authorizations were accompanied by individual missi on requests oios found however that they were not always completed in timely manner nd travel authorizations were not always issued prior to travel the representation indicated that mission requests are being completed and signed prior to the issuance of pt8s c medical insurance plan mip 30 mip claims were generally processed in acc ordance with mip guidelines the majority of the claims were of low value oios ted however that criteria and standard price lists of treatment drugs and medicines had n ot been prepared as benchmark to ensure only reasonable amounts were reimbursed also the representation had not produced list of recommended hospitals doctors and pharmacies to ensure staff and their dependents receive the best medical care at favourable prices as result staff seem to be paying different rates for similar treatments the representation stated that they are referring s taff to the arab medical centre with which an agreement had been made but staff preferred to go to cheaper doctors the representation informed that t hey are working on list of cheaper doctors for the purposes of mip claims d human resources management 31 currently the secretary of the representat ive was performing the duties of human resources assistant for both the representation in amman and the iraq operations unit oios found that the jordan operation was heavily pendent on staff on temporary assistance ta there were 16 ta posts for local s taff and 3 fast track posts for international staff also eight staff were hired under specia l service agreements ssas mainly for cleaning services almost two thirds of the 2004 ab od expenditure of some us 868000 was charged against temporary assistance 03x oio s pointed out that ssas are not valid unhcr contractual agreements and recommended that t he representation seek alternative contractual arrangements such as hiring company the representation has received similar advice from dhrm as well as from the legal affairs section and has signed contract with cleaning company 32 according to iomfom262004 temporary as sistance lines in the context of the 2005 annual programme review ta lines under the s pecial budget in the general service national officer and field service categories shoul d be advertised within year subject to confirmation of continued funding of the function despite these guidelines the representation has received special budget to cha rge staff against ta since 2003 and from information received from the desk this will contin ue in 2006 as result at the time of the 7 audit there were eight staff members whose appoin tment has been exceptionally extended beyond the 728day limit the desk justified the continuation of ta posts wit h the fact that there are funds to cover the posts under annual budget ab so they should remain under the special budget sb until such time the iraq sb is mainstreamed to ab while oios appreciates the reasoning the practice is contrary to unhcrs policy moreover the practice of shortterm one to three month contracts for ta staff creates insecurity and exposes the organization to risk of losing competent and expe rienced staff if more permanent employment possibilities become available elsewhere recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau of caswaname in conjunction with the representation in jordan should conduct revie w of continuing temporary assistance posts under the spe cial budget related to the iraq programme and consider r egularizing their posts under the annual budget this is partic ularly pertinent if it is foreseen that these staff will b needed in 2006 rec 02 33 oios noted that the staff of the represent ation and that of ioua are subject to different home leave entitlement for newly appoint ed ioua staff in amman the appointment letter includes baghdad is duty stat ion with 12month home leave cycle whereas the others are on 24month cycle ioua s taff members do not have permission to enter iraq and are working in the same building as the representation staff it does not appear fair that staff members working under the same cond itions at the same duty station are eligible for different entitlements dhrm provided oios with memorandum from united nati ons security coordinator ai dated 25 march 2004 that stated united nations staff members performing iraqrelated functions will be assigned to jordan on nonfamilydutystation basis the desk commented that due to budgetary re asons the staff members are assigned to baghdad although the office resides in amman while oios appreciates that such an arrangement was appropriate at the time of evacuati on for staff originally assigned to iraq this discrepancy now needs to be reviewed the security situation does not currently allow international staff to enter iraq therefore for new ly assigned staff dhrm should seek clarification of this practice this is especially relevant as there are plans to integrate the amman office and ioua recommendation head2right the unhcr division of human resources management should seek for clarification from united nations s ecurity coordinator whether the policy of applying nonfami lyduty station basis to staff newly assigned to amman but performing iraqrelated functions should continue rec 03 field location ruwaished 34 oios visited the two refugee camps in ruwa ished and in mans land close to the iraq border oios noted however that the office was established without any official status the staff members working at this office are loca l staff on ta and international unvs 8 unhcr international staff are assigned directly or are on mission to ruwaished the status of ruwaished was unclear it is sometimes referred to as satellite office and sometimes just as place where unhcr has presence in oios opini on the status of the presence at ruwaished should be clarified 35 unhcr had guesthouse in ruwaished costin g about us 635 per month staff members on mission who have been provided staff hou sing and who are in receipt of dsa are subject to deduction from dsa at the prescribed r ates the room charges for the guesthouse were not in accordance with unhcr rules and procedu res ie as percentage of the applicable dsa it has been arbitrarily established at jd 10 us 1412 per night against the rate application for substandard accommodation of 2 5 per cent of the dsa ie us 3075 jd 21750 per night the unhcr representation in jordan took immediate ction to rectify the situation v acknowledgement 36 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to the auditor by the staff of unhcr and implementing part ners in jordan egbert c
