which is low by historic standards and suggests the presence of tight labor market conditions that are related to longrunning demographic trends the oldest members of the babyboom generation turned age 60 at the end of 2006 and every year thereafter more of this larg birthcohort will move into the ages when workers traditionally have retired consequently the business community in particular has asserted that the future supply of labor will fall short of employer demand and that us economic growth and competitiveness would be put in jeopardy based upon crs analysis of the current employment patterns of babyboomers across industries and occupations and of occupational employment projections within industries many industries throughout the economy eg insurance manufacturing mining public administration real estate transportation wholesale trade utilities appear to be highly dependent on babyboom workers and to face the prospect of tightening labor market conditions as more of them move into the traditional retirement ages babyboom dependent industries that seek both to replace all boomers who retire from occupations critical to their operations and to increase employment in those fields could face the most intense competition for workers in the near term eg educational services and health care services an actual shortage of workers is unlikely in the long run because companies can be expected to take various actions in response to the accelerating slowdown in labor force growthalthough it appears few have yet done so key assumption of the labor shortage scenario is that firms must have more workers in the future than at present for the economy to continue to grow proponents of this viewpoint thus are asserting that rates of output growth and labor force growth are closely and directly linked but the economy historically has been able to expand faster than the labor supply by more efficiently utilizing the available pool of workers another assumption underlying the shortage scenario is that babyboomers will sharply curtail their work activity once in their sixties the degree to which older persons participate in the workforce already has risen due in part to changes that congress made to the social security retirement system and age discrimination law some have urged congress to make further modifications to encourage more older individuals to continue working and more employers to hire and retain them similarly congress has been urged to further amend immigration law to permit more foreign labor to be brought into the country to fill jobs for which us workers are deemed to be in short supply additionally those who assert that the need to replace retiring babyboomers will result in shortage of workers usually consider only the labor supplied by the babybust generation this 45 million birthcohort which immediately followed the 76 million babyboomers into the labor force is not the only source of replacement workers the 72 million members of the echoboom began to enter the workforce during the 1990s access to foreign labor through offshore outsourcing in addition to guest worker programs also is often overlooked in the context of shortages httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33661g20g142g157g146g155g146g151g144g561g4g138g139g162g556g4g152g152g150g142g155g156g561g445g561g3g561g14 g138g139g152g155g561g21g145g152g155g157g138

they anticipate will occur in the nottoodistant future concern about this possibility waned when the historically low unemployment rates from 1998 to 2000 rose during and for some two years after the marchnovember 2001 recession in 2007 however the national unemployment rate averaged just 461 this suggests the presence of tight labor market conditions that are related to longrunning demographic trends th oldest members of the babyboom generation will reach 60 years of age by the end of 2006 and every year thereafter more of the 76 million persons born between 1946 and 1964 will move into their early 60s when most workers traditionally have retired2 as consequence observersparticularly members of the business communityhave expressed the belief that the supply of us labor will fall short of employer demand in coming decades3 while the public budgetary effects of the aging of the babyboom cohort have been much studied4 the implications for the private economy have been less thoroughly researched proponents of the labor shortage scenario assert that the nations rate of economic output growth will slow because workerstarved us firms would be unable to produce the quantity of goods and services demanded by us consumers they further argue that the competitive position of us industries will suffer because foreign companies would expand sales not only to the domestic market but also to other markets now supplied by us firms even if businesses were able to coax more individuals into the us labor force by bidding up wages it is claimed that similar endresult could occur employers would try to pass the increased cost of production onto buyers resulting in higher prices that among ot her things would diminish the purchasing power of us workers wages the market share of u s businesses could shrink as well if domestic and foreign purchasers react to these higher prices by switching to less costly goods and services from other countries this frequently voiced view omits actions that employers could take other than raising wages to ameliorate the labor market tightness they expect to occur when babyboomers stop working it also assumes that babyboomers will behave similarly to preceding generations of older workers in terms of the rate at which they participate in the labor force and the length of their working lives the scenario similarly does not consider that congress might take legislative action to mitigate the effect on the private economy of perceived shortfall of workerssomething it has done in the recent past eg loosening and raising the cap on h1b visas for foreign workers in professional occupations in addition shortage proponents often paint firms with broad brush raising the question of whether each firm is as likely as the next to be affected by the babyboomers retirement 1 labor force data are available in the us bureau of labor statistics bls employment and earnings or at the bls website httpstatsblsgov 2 according to

employment in 2007 the labor force more than doubled in size since 1967 see table 1 within the 40year period however the pace of growth fell by more than half during the most recent compared to the first 20 years the diminished rate of labor force growth in recent decades is related in part to the substantially reduced number of births in the united states the cohort of some 76 million individuals born between 1946 and 1964 was aptly dubbed the babyboom generation as the members of this very large group entered the workforce 16 or more years after birth5 the babyboomers greatly increased the aggregate supply of labor by 280 between 1967 and 1977 and by 211 between 1977 and 1987 see column 2 of table 1 the babyboom generation was followed into the labor force by the suitably named babybust cohort which totals some 45 million persons born between 1965 and 1976 6 the small size of the babybust group contributed to the decrease in young workers and the ebbing of overall

survey during the 1990s the babyboomers continued to buoy the overall supply of labor by 1989 the youngest babyboomers had reached 25 years of age and the oldest members of the group were 43 years of age the entire cohort thus was in the prime workage group 2554 years old which historically has had the highest rate of participation in the labor force the labor force participation rate shown by age over time in figure 1 below is the share of the civilian noninstitutional population that is employed or actively seeking employment in 2007 for example more than 4 of every 5 persons in the population aged 2554 were members of the labor force in contrast about 3 of every 5 individuals aged 1624 had job or were looking for one while still fewer persons 55 years and olderless than 2 in 5were attached to the workforce the advancement of the numerous babyboomers into the prime workages consequently offset in part the babybusts dampening impact on the supply of labor during the 1990s

end of the decades long rise in womens labor force participation8 which on the basis of the current trend reached its peak at 60 percent in 1999 and the trend will be at best flat in the future9 the recent movement of older babyboomers into the age range of low rates of supply to the labor force is shown in column 5 of table 1 the youngest members of the babyboom cohort will have turned 55 years old by 2019 which could cause the workforce to grow more slow ly between 2000 and 2019 than it did between 1980 and 2000 indeed the us bureau of labor statistics bls projects that the decelerating rate of increase in the labor supply could continue through 2020 although the labor force is projected to expand from 141 million people in 2000 to 165 million people in 2020 the gain will steadily dwindlefalling from 11 annually over the 20002010 period to 06 annually over the 20102015 period to 02 annually over the 20152020 period 10 further contributing to the slowdown is the prog ress of the small babybust group into the age range with strong attachment to the labor force the oldest members of the babybust generation turned 25 years of age in 1990 the youngest in 2000 they will be among those replacing the entire babyboom generation in 2020 when it will have aged out of the 25to 54yearold group despite the high rate of labor force participation for those in the prime workages shown in figure 1 the small number of babybust workers means that they will not be able to compensate for the large cohorts of baby boomers leaving the primeaged group and moving into group with much lower participation rates the result is decrease in the overall labor force participation rate and slower rate of growth of the labor force 11

the supply of labor that employers have begun to encounter has led them to worry about how much harder it will become to hire replacements for babyboomers as more of them reach the retirement phase of their lives during the coming decades the ebbing of labor force growth could present more of difficulty for some firms than others depending on the age composition of their current workforces for example mature industries eg steelmakers in contrast with emerging industries eg biotechnol ogy did much of their hiring many years ago hence babyboomers probably comprise larger share of the workforces of mature than emerging industries still other industries are known for having fairly young workforces eg leisure and hospitality and are less likely to have many jobs to fill as result of retirements instead these other industries probably are more concerned about the relatively small additions to the youth labor force shown in table 1 which is affected by more than demographic trends

associated with the retirement of the babyboom generation was to calculate babyboomers share of employment overall and by industry in 2005 utilizing current population survey cps data13 the industries estimated to have employed significantly aboveaverage percentage of babyboomers in 2005 more than 421 of 41to 59yearolds are considered the most prone to the effect of the groups withdrawal from the labor force14 within each of the babyboom dependent industries crs next estimated the babyboomers share of employment by occupation to determine the job categories most likely to develop vacancies due to retirements the size of the cps sample limits the degree of detail by occupation within industries that could be estimated accurately in addition to identifying babyboom dependent industries and the occupations within them the section immediately below discusses possible reason s for them having very high prevalence of 41to 59yearolds what the impending retirement of babyboomers might actually mean for the industries future occupational staffing requirements is analyzed thereafter

2006 13 the latest annual data at the time the study originally was undertaken were for 2005 substantially the same results are likely based on more recent cps data 14 the cps is monthly sample of about 50000 households drawn from the civilian noninstitutional population estimates of employment and other variables derived from the cps thus are subject to sampling error researchers utilizing the cps generally construct confidence intervals which provide information about the accuracy of the estimates confidence intervals were calculated for the differences in 2005 between the percentage of all workers who were babyboomers and the percentage of workers in each industry and occupation who were babyboomers the text of this report discusses only those industries and occupations in which the estimated share of employment accounted for by babyboomers is significantly greater than their estimated share of total employment ie the differences are not likely due to sampling error 15 among the 51 industries included in the study those that employed lesser shares of babyboomers in 2005 included agriculture construction four manufacturing industries wood products furniture and fixtures food and beverage and tobacco products retail trade publishing industries except internet motion picture and sound recording broadcasting except internet internet publishing and broadcasting

hospitals private and public health care services except hospitals membership associations and organizations and public administration excluding public schools and hospitals the utilities industry eg private and public establishments that provide electricity natural gas and water has the highest proportion of babyboo mers with almost 3 of every 5 workers between 41 and 59 years old in 2005 see column 2 of table 2 one possible reason for the marked incidence of babyboomers in the industry is its comparatively high unionization rate while just 125 of all persons employed in 2005 were union members according to cps data the figure among utilities workers was more than twice that at 288 older workers are likely to be more prevalent in highly unionized industries that thus favor seniority and generally have lower turnover rates due to higher wages and better benefits than nonunion jobs 16 in terms of retirement benefits in particular the type of pensions that unions historically have negotiated with managementdefinedbenefit plansencourages long job tenure because its benefit formula typically is based on combination of peakyears earnings and years of service unionization probably also explains in part why 504 of employees in the transportation and warehousing industry eg railroads and airlines and 493 of employees in the 12 manufacturing industries combined are members of the babyboom generation17 see column 2 of table 2 in addition the babyboom dependent manuf acturing industries did much of their hiring many years ago and have grown their workforces little if at all since then as an example consider transportation equipment manufacturing when the first members of the babyboom generation were born in 1946 the industry employed 12 million production and nonsupervisory 16 arlene dohm gauging the labor force effects of retiring babyboomers monthly labor review july 2000 p 20 hereafter referred to as dohm gauging the labor force effects of retiring

next two decades but since factory employment peaked at 21 million in 1968 many more workers have been permanently let go than have been hired18 the order in which unionized employees usually are laid offnamely in an inverse relationship to seniority lasthired firstfiredhas served to reinforce the marked presence of babyboomers on these manufacturers payrolls so too has manufacturings image reportedly dissuaded younger persons from considering the field when making career decisions 19 more than three out of every 10 persons employed by federal state and local governments were union members in 2005 despite variability across jurisdictions in whether and which employees eg education and public safety can be organized20 variability also exists in the scope of negotiable subjects with all levels of government often excluding leave and benefit policies from the collective bargaining process 21 in these instances legislators have passed laws that prescribe human resources policies or the precepts that underlie them with regard to retirement benefits elected officials usually have provided defined benefit pensions to public employees as noted above traditional pensions encourage lengthy job tenure and hence older workforces almost all fulltime state and local government workers including teachers at public elementary secondary and postsecondary institutions were covered by definedbenefit plans in 1994 which enable them to retire with unreduced benefits at age 55 or younger and typically after 30 years of tenure 22 all federal employees also are eligible for definedbenefit pension plan like their state and local counterparts many federal employees become eligible to retire at age 55 with 30 years of service and the average retirement age was 604 in 2004 according to opm data23 little over onehalf of public employees excluding school personnel and 487 of workers in the public and private educational services industry were babyboomers in 2005 as shown in column 2 of table 2 but in that year just 2025 of babyboom employees might have been retirementeligible based on their age ie at least 55 years old24 going forward then retirements could rise considerably in the public administration and educational services industries as many more of these employees reach the ages associated with pension eligibility yet the impact of babyboomers withdrawal from the labor force can be expected to differ across industries depending on their future employment trends those industries that reduce the size of their workforces will not need to fill every vacancy number of babyboom dependent industries in the goodsproducing sector are projected to employ fewer workers in 2016 than they did in 18 according to the bls current employment survey ces

staffed their management ranks with substantial shares of babyboomers as shown in column 2 of table 2 in fact 41to 59yearolds accounted for significant portion of managers economywide in 2005 at 528 on average27 if bls projections of the creation of almost 16 mill ion new management positions between 2006 and 2016 prove correct then the effect of the babybooms retirement from the occupational group could be widespread28 whether it would be difficult to replace retired managers is another matter one case study of large manufacturing firm estimated that increased retirements among senior management would result in an almost imperceptible decrease in job tenure and slightly faster promotions from the ranks one step down the corporate ladder if all replacements were internal this is true for most organizations and the reason is because in typical pyramidalshaped organizational chart the levels below have many more incumbents than those above29 there is anecdotal evidence as well of babyboomers who survived corporate restructuring which pared the number of executive positions not being in hurry to retire according to survey of seniorlevel managers 44 planned to continue working past age 6430 the phenomenon of older workers failing to make way for others to advance is referred to as the gray ceiling and it seemingly extends beyond management occupations to lawyers for example many of the babyboom dependent industries also rely heavily on 41to 59yearolds to fill office and administrative support jobs as shown in column 2 of table 2 the 12 manufacturing industries mining and utilities for example are projected to employ fewer office and administrative support personnel over the 20062016 period31 these industries consequently 27 crs estimates derived from cps

way of coping with reduced occupational demand other occupational groups with very high incidence of babyboomers appear to be more industryspecific for example the retirement of babyboomers from production jobs eg machinists could create difficulties for manufacturers not only did babyboomers comprise almost onehalf of production employment in ba byboom dependent manufacturing industries in 2005 but 41to 59yearold production workers also accounted for large share about onefifth of the industries workforce see columns 2 and 3 in table 2 although manufacturers demand for production workers generally is projected to decrease between 2006 and 2016 several of the babyboom dependent manufacturing industries could increase employment in specific occupations eg welding soldering and brazing workers32 much the same can be said about transportation and material moving occupations eg drivers and stock movers in the transportation and warehousing industry babyboomers made up nearly onehalf of transportation and material moving workers in the industry in 2005 and 41to 59 yearolds in the occupational group accounted for close to onefourth of the industries workforce see columns 2 and 3 of table 2 in this case the industry is projected to add 294000 workers in transportation and material moving occupations over the 20062016 period with much of the job growth accounted for by motor vehicle operators eg heavy and tractortrailer truck drivers33 similarly the retirement of babyboomers from health care practitioner and other related technical occupations eg physicians nurses therapists and health technologists could pose supply problems for the health care services industry about onehalf of the individuals employed in this occupational group by hospitals and other health care services establishments were aged 4159 in 2005 see column 2 of table 2 these babyboomers represented 243 of total employment at hospitals and 162 of total employment at other health care services enterprises eg nursing and residential care facilities as shown in column 3 of the table in addition the health care services industry employed the majority of persons working as health care practitioners and in related technical occupations in 2006 and the industry is projected to increase employment in these occupations by almost 11 million between 2006 and 201634 for the same reasons the retirement of babyboomers from educational training and library occupations could cause difficulties for the educational services industry public and private in particular babyboomers in 2005 comprised 476 of the industrys employment in the occupational group of which elementary and secondary school teachers are large part these babyboomers also are important to the functioning of the industry accounting for more than onefourth of its total employment see columns 2 and 3 of table 2 moreover state and local government educational agencies and private providers of educational services are projected to increase their employment of educational training and library workers by almost one million between 2006 and 2016 35 speaking more generally the retirement of babyboomers could have substantial effect on the educational services industry because of its large number of babyboom dependent occupations 32 ibid 33 ibid 34 ibid 35 ibid

occupations the wide variety of jobs and differing growth among the three branches of government with employment projected to decline in federal government and to grow in state and local government makes it difficult to gauge the impact of babyboomer retirements on the industry however36

dependent on babyboom workers and seemingly face the prospect of tightening labor market conditions as these individuals move toward the typical retirement ages employers with older workforces that seek not only to replace all babyboomers exiting occupations critical to their operations but also to increase employment in those fields could face especially intense competition for labor in the short run an actual shortage of labor is unlikely in the long run however because businesses can be expected to raise wages thereby prompting some pensioneligible babyboomers to continue working enticing those outside the labor force eg discouraged workers 37 to enter or those employed parttime to increase their work hours38 encouraging individuals qualified for jobs that are in particularly high demand but who are employed in other fields to change positions and motivating youngsters attending school and unemployed persons among others to prepare for these now more lucrative occupations admittedly these accommodations to the new labor market realities could take some time to occur the adjustment period could be prolonged if companies are slow to make nonwage changes as well such as relaxing hiring standards or providing training to persons who but for the tight labor market would not have been hired eg high school dropouts or retained eg employees with outdated skills in addition firms will vary in their ability to alter compensation and other human resources policies making them unequal competitors in their attempt to attract and retain an adequate number of workers 36 dohm gauging the labor force effects of retiring babyboomers p 24 37 there were almost 71 million persons in the labor force who lacked jobs in 2007 according to bls data only workers who have actively sought employment in the fourweek period before the monthly cps is conducted are considered to be unemployed unemployment data thus understate the degree of slackness in the labor market partly because they do not include discouraged workers who numbered 369000 in 2007 discouraged workers are individuals who want job and looked for one within years time but are not currently searching because they believe jobs are available or none for which they are qualified 38 there were 242 million persons at work in 2007 on parttime schedules ie less than 35 hours week according to bls data most 198 million or 818 chose to work s hort schedules because they were in school or had family obligations for example the remainder were involuntarily employed parttimethat is they would have preferred to work longer hours httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33661g20g142g157g146g155g146g151g144g561g4g138g139g162g556g4g152g152g150g142g155g156g561g445g561g3g561g14

in order for the us economy to continue growing companies must have more workers on their payrolls in the future than at present proponents of this viewpoint essentially are arguing that the rate of economic growth is closely and directly linked to the pace of labor force growth the us economy generally has been able to expand faster than the labor supply however by more efficiently utilizing the available pool of workers former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan noted that an expansion of laborforce participation by immigrants and the healthy elderly offers some offset to an aging population however it is heightened growth of output per worker that presents the greatest potential to boost the growth of gross domestic product39 confronted with bidding war for relatively scarce workers businesses could well try to increase productivity through substitution of less expensive capital for labor and initiation of organizational and technological innovations indee d good deal of empirical research indicates that past slowdowns in labor force growth have been accompanied by acceleration in productivity growth40 this historical relationship provides some optimism for future increases in the productivity growth rate partly offsetting the diminishing pace of labor force growth in coming decades there are factors in addition to the rate of increase in the size of the workforce that affect the growth rate of labor productivity key variable is the quality of laborthat is the amount of knowledge embodied in nations workers one analysis tentatively estimated that while business investment in traditional kinds of capital eg expenditures on plant and equipment might have accounted for little more than 27 of the growth in output per hour worked between 1995 and 2003 business investment in intangible forms of capital eg expenditures on employee training and changes in labor composition eg educational attainment might have accounted for 38 of the increase in labor productivity over the period 41 it has been suggested that the human capital characteristics of recent migrants to the united states and their descendants might attenuate the historically inverse relationship between labor force and productivity growth however the united states has been experiencing shift in the countries of origin of immigrants from european toward mexico and other latin american countries because latin american immigrants generally have completed fewer years of school than european immigrants the change in country mix has lowered the average educational attainment of recent immigrants the impact this will have on the human capital possessed by future members of the us labor force depends of such factors as trends in source countries educational attainment and the rate of convergence in years of schooling completed by immigrants descendants and the nativeborn population although there have been marked gains in high school completion among recent cohorts of mexican migrants to the united states the wide gap 39 testimony of federal reserve chairman alan greenspan before the special committee on aging us senate hearing on aging global

likely to persist for quite some time years of school completed by u sborn hispanics ie secondand subsequent generation hispanics also are expected to remain well below the us average these findings led little and triest to surmise that the average level of educational attainment among us workers could be dampened as result of the labor forces increasingly hispanic composition unless the educational status of hispanic youth changes dramatically42 in contrast census bureau staff who developed projections of educational attainment based upon alternative assumptionscontinued immigration and immigrationfound the net impact of immigrants on overall schooling levels in the future to be indeterminate the counterfactual case zero immigration showed an increase of few percentage points in the rate of high school completion while the impact on college completion was uncertain the continued immigration case showed little difference in future educational attainment because still other projections by ethnicity revealed that all groups could have rising levels of schooling day and bauman surmised that changes in ethnic composition of the us population toward hispanics for example do not suppress educational attainment to the extent some observers have feared 43 some analysts are not sanguine about the economys ability to achieve rates of productivity growth sufficient to fully compensate for the slowdown in labor force growth nyce and schieber projected labor supply based on continuation of current patterns of labor force participation by age and labor demand over the 20002010 period under four scenarios of productivity growth 15 annually which was the average rate of increase over the past three decades 175 and 20 annually which mark the range of increases in labor productivity in the past decade and 223 annually which is rate last surpassed in the 1950s and 1960s but not again attained for any long period thereafter they estimated that the united states could be faced with shortfall of labor unless output per hour worked grows by 223 for sustained period of time or patterns of labor force participation changefor example if more members of the population join the labor force and current workers retire later 44

going forward in 2016 when babyboomers will be between 52 and 70 years old the bls projects that the labor force participation rate of older workers could reach 42847 in light of the large size of the baby boom population such an increase in the percentage of persons continuing to work at older ages would greatly affect the supply of labor many variables have come together to spur the ongoing increase in labor force participation among older workers improvement in the populations health has increased the ability of individuals to work at older ages should they desire the decrease in physically demanding jobs operates in the same direction48 the life span of individuals has lengthened as well which could make the extension of ones years in the labor force financial necessityparticularly for those with limited savings and retirement benefits the tendency of employers to eliminate health benefits coverage for retirees also could be prompting older workers to remain in the labor force at least until they qualify for medicare 49 so too could the movement of employers away from traditional definedbenefit pensions to definedcontribution retirement plans the latter which employers began to offer in the 1980s after section 401k was inserted in the internal revenue code irc are ageneutral and do not pay out guaranteed level of benefits50 one empirical analysis found that most of the increase between 1992 and 2004 in the intention of babyboomers to continue working after age 62 was due to decreased rates of employerprovided retiree health benefits higher levels of educational attainment among workers and reduced rates of coverage under traditional pension plans 51 in addition to changes in the irc congress has enacted and amended other laws over the years that encourage older workers to remain engaged in the labor force and remove obstacles to their continued participation several such changes were made to the public pension system including gradually raising from 65 the age at which workers can receive full retirement benefits increasing the reduction in benefits for those who retire between 62 and the full retirement age and enhancing the delayed retirement credit for those who forgo benefits receipt until after they have attained full retirement age 52 most recently congress loosened the earnings test for employed beneficiaries between 62 and the full retirement age and eliminated it for those at or above the full retirement age 53 if policymakers become convinced that labor shortage is imminent they might consider additional modifications of the public pension system such as further relaxing or eliminating the earnings test for workers between 62 years old and the full retirement age the results of empirical research are mixed however on whether removal of the earnings test for employed beneficiaries at or above the full retirement age has increased the labor supply54 47 toossi labor force

the workplace and virtually eliminate mandatory retirement to be among the leading reasons for the increase in labor force participation among older members of the population55 when the age discrimination in employment act of 1967 adea was passed it ba rred employers from discriminating against people between 40 and 65 years old on the basis of age thus firms still were permitted to include involuntary retirement clauses in their pension plans as long as they were not applied to persons under age 65 in 1978 the adea was amended to protect individuals up to 70 years old from workplace discrimination the age restriction was removed by amendment of the adea in 1986 as result most private pension plans longer can include involuntary retirement provisions 56 nonetheless it appears that older workers who lose longheld jobs have limited reemployment opportunities due perhaps to agebased hiring discrimination and lawful considerations of employers57 individuals who willingly retire from their career jobs but who would like to continue working for another company on parttime basis for example could face similar employer reluctance to hire them legal statutes such as the employee retirement income security act erisa were cited as an obstacle by almost 12 of companies that consider their aging workforces an issue that needs to be dealt with58 provisions in erisa and the irc arguably dampen employer demand for older workers who would prefer to phase into retireme nt rather than fully withdraw from the labor force currently company can only retain older employees and distribute pension benefits to them if they have reached the plans normal retirement age which by law cannot be above age 65 an employer can make pension distributions to employees who have reached the plans early retirement age eg age 62 only after they leave the firm thus business cannot compensate employees between 62 and 65 years old who would like to continue at the firm but work fewer hours or weeks through combination of redu ced wages and partial pension distributions companies have asserted that amending the law to permit inservice pension payments would make them more willing to provide phasedretirement arrangements however the net impact of allowing inservice distributions at the early retirement age on labor force participation and hours worked among older employees is unknown 59 another reason suggested for employers being re ticent about hiring older workers is that the group is thought to be comparatively expensive to cover under health insurance plans60 companies that provide health benefits must offer all employees including those at least 65 years old who are eligible for medicare the same pla n if newly hired older workers accept employer sponsored health benefits congress requires that medicare be the secondary payer firms with 55 toossi labor force projections to 2014 56 william j wiatrowski changing retirement age ups and downs

medicareeligible job applicants were their own plans instead designated the secondary payer while this policy change might raise employer demand for older workers seeking new career jobs or bridgetoretirement jobs it also would increase the costs of the medicare program61 however the majority of us companies do not appear to have yet focused on the implications of an aging labor force human resources hr practitioners who are cognizant of the importance of recruiting and retaining babyboom employees have urged companies to reexamine and change their attitudes toward older workers as they did with lag when women began entering the labor force in large numbers during the 1970s 62 according to survey of hr staff some 40 reported that their organizations were just becoming aware of the possibility of worker shortage associated with retirement of babyboom employees and similar share indicated that they were just at the start of reviewing their policies and practices accordingly as of 2005 only 11 had made changes to prepare for potential labor shortage 63 the results of survey released in 2007 indicate that only 26 of employers had analyzed the age makeup of their workforces and only 34 had projected retirement rates of their employees accordingly 35 of employers had not developed strategies to encourage latecareer em ployees to work past the normal retirement age64 another survey released in 2007 finds that 29 of employers believe the aging of the workforce is of little or significance to th em the results differ by industry however with industries having comparatively older workforces eg health care providers regarding the issue as more significant than industries with young er employees eg high technology businesses these industry differences are not surprising whe n learning that the primary reason 53 percent respondents indicated that this is not an issue is that their workforces will not be eligible for retirement within the next five to ten years65 g22g145g142g561g7g140g145g152g556g4g152g152g150g561g9g142g151g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g138g156g561g25g152g155g148g142g155g156g561 proponents of the labor shortage viewpoint usually look just at the very different size of two groups namely the babyboom and babybust generations the much smaller cohort that immediately followed the babyboomers into the workforce is not the only source of replacements for retirees however the babyboom produced numerous offspring who have been labeled the echoboom generation variously defined as having been born starting during the midtolate 1970s and ending sometime during the midtolate 1990s the echoboomat about 72 millionapproaches the size of its parents generation66 the oldest members of the echoboom joined the labor force during the 1990s

started to turn 25 years old and enter the prime workage group 2554with its high rates of labor force participation during the early years of the current decade just when their parents began to leave the group rather than an actual shortage of labor some observers thus have suggested that the labor market may develop an experience problem67 employers might indeed demand that individuals have many years of work experience to fill certain positions eg managers but they may not feel the same way about other jobs companies might for example prefer to hire recent college graduates for occupations that have been changed substantially by technology eg skilled bluecollar jobs in manufacturing rather than upgrading the skills of experienced middleaged workers who have at most high school diploma

closed economy dependent only on domestic labor to produce goods and services in the global economy demographic and labor conditions in other countries affect the us labor market globalization gives us fi rms access to labor overseas through foreign direct investment offshoring or subcontr acting and access to foreignborn labor that immigrates to the us the claims of coming labor shortage must be assessed in global context 68 if globalization were to continue at its current pace one prominent labor economist expects us firms to be able to meet potential shortfalls in domestic labor supplies for tradable goods and services by hiring labor overseas and to seek immigrant labor to ameliorate potential labor shortages in the production of nontraded goods or services 69 the limited availability of us computer programmers to make the technological fixes necessary for smooth transition into the 21st century ie the y2k crisis and the ready supply of qualified foreign workers sparked firms to obtain h1b nonimmigrant professional specialty visas70 which allowed them to temporarily bring these individuals into the country71 the perceived scarcity of information technology workers eg computer systems analysts and engineers in the domestic labor force prompted the 105th and 106th congresses to raise the h1b visa cap from fy1999 to fy2003 and the 106th and 108th

petition for them to become legal permanent residents lprs of the united states72 employers continue to urge congress to reexamine the h1b visa program to enable them to bring into the country greater numbers of skilled guest workers73 businesses similarly have turned to temporary and immigrant labor to fill jobs in other occupations when us workers are deemed to be in short supply eg landscape laborers and nurses in view of the ongoing tightening of the us labor market firms will likely intensify their pressure on congress to allow them even greater access to this pool of less skilled labor some members have expressed support for proposals that would raise ceilings on current visa categories for guest workers and would expand existing or establish new exemptions from nonimmigrant visa caps 74 yet the labor market effects of immigration and the ability to link in timely manner migrant inflows with us labor market conditions remain unsettled issues75 another means of augmenting the domestic labor supply available to us businesses is offshoring or offshore outsourcing initially the principal us firms sending work to be performed in other countries were manufacturers which meant that most of the jobs first offshored involved bluecollar occupations such as the industrys babyboom dependent production jobs shown in table 2 more recently the widespread availability of technologies that permit lowcost goodquality highspeed transm ission of voice and data communications has enabled companies in the service sector to tap into the supply of whitecollar workers residing in other nations although good data on the extent and nature of offshoring are limited estimates suggest that some of the babyboom dependent occupations shown in table 2 have characteristics that make their duties amenable to export eg office and administrative support and business and financial operations76 the core activities of several babyboom dependent industries could make it difficult for them to utilize labor living outside us borders eg truck drivers in the transportation industry sales agents in the real estate industry elementary and secondary school teachers in educational services and nurses in hospitals public sentiment also has prompted policymakers to try to limit offshoring of activities traditionally performed by employees of babyboom dependent industries eg
