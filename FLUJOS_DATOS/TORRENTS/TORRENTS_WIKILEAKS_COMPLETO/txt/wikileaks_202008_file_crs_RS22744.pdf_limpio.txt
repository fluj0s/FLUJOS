federal programs so exist to assist in recovery efforts after the fires are out preventing recurrence of catastrophic wildfires is impossible but research has shown how to protect hom even while wildfires are burning raging wildfires burned homes and the evacuation of thousands of californians have been making headlines options fo r federal support and ssistance during the fires in the aftermath and aimed at preventing recurrence have been raised by many concerned about the ongoing disaster th is report addresses th federal options during the fire two federal options for action exist while wildfires are burning one option relates to efforts to control and extinguish the fires federal responsibility for wildfire suppression is limited to federal lands states are responsib for suppressing wildfires on nonfederal state and private lands1 the federal government provides support to the states in two ways one is through direct financial assistance for state fire protection efforts funded through the forest rvices state fire assistance program2 the other and more critical in the current situation consists of fire suppression forces and assistance personnel funding and equipmen t including aircraft pr ovided at states request and coordinated through the national interagency fire center nifc in boise id as well as the federal emergency management agency fema in emergencies nifc coordinates federal state and private forces including the military when called upon to assist the state or region in need while maintaining local wildfire protection how paying for these forces gets allocated is usually addressed after the emergency is over fire management assistance is also provi ded by fema under the robert t staffordhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22744crs2 3 42 usc

by fema on october 21 and 22 20074 the second federal option is to support stat and local efforts to evacuate the areas threatened by wildfires presidential declar ation of an emergency as has occurred for part of california triggers federa l aid to protect property and public health and safety while preserving state autonomy and responsibility5 although the new national response framework required in the wake of hurricane katrina is still not complete fema and the national guard have been assisting state and local agencies in evacuating areas and establishing and maintaining evacuation shelters in the aftermath as with duringthefire efforts federal actions in the aftermath of wildfire disaster can take two principal forms in the first presidential declaration of an emergency initiates process for federal assistance to help state and local governments and families and individuals recover from the disaster the nature and ex tent of the assistance depends on number of factors such as the nature nd severity of the wildfire damages and the insurance coverage of the affected parties site rehabilitation following fire is the s econd principal form of support by federal agencies on federal lands site rehabilitation routinely occurs as an emergency wildfire program on state and private lands th responsibility lies with the landowner but federal assistance can be provide d through the state fire assistance and forest stewardship also state assistance programs6 however severely burned areas especially in southern california are at risk of landslides during the subsequent rainy season little can be done to prevent such events but monitoring can provide warning to homeowners to evacuate the area prior to landslide and other federal postdisaster assistance can then become available preventing recurrence numerous federal programs provide grants to states and local governments to prepare for wildfire emergencies the fo rest service provides financial and technical assistance and equipment to states and volunteer fire departments and through the states for community wildfire protection planning fema provides grants and training for firefighting and for community responses to terrorist attacks nd natural disasters7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22744crs3 8 see for example jack d cohen reducing the wildland fire threat to homes where and how much

bigger question is how to prev ent recurrence of the catastrophic fires the answer is you cant drought lightning and high winds make extreme wildfires inevitable they cannot be prevented in ecosy stems that have evolved with wildfire such as the chaparral of southern california ho wever it is possible to protect structures in such settings federal research and grants particularly for the firewise program have shown how homeowners can protect their st ructures even while wildfires burn around them8 the keys are the structure itself especially nonflammable roofing and the landscaping within 40 meters of the struct ure zoning could inform and enforce appropriate standards fo r wildfire protection
