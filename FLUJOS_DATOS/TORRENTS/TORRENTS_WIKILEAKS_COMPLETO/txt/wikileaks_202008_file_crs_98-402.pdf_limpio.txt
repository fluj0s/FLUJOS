increased economically necessary programsas viewed by reformers the eu other in ternational economic institutions and credit rating organizations whether or not these countries join nato in this balancedbudget competition for appropriations neither economic nor security programs will consistently win out success from transition programs generates growth assistance from many donors supporting transition and foreign investment that all generate revenue andfinancial flows that may ease the pressure of tight budgets current unexpectedlyhigh polish growth seven percent increas in gross

gdp limits the choices among new programshowever high growth prospects in pola nd is not an unmixed blessing for budgeters as the high growth puts pressure on the ex change rates and price levels and account for the lowering of the current deficit fi nancing cap to 16 percent of gdp with future prospect of zerodeficit budget policy high growth may thus lead to inflation and exchangerate problems requiring tighter deficit control the opportunity cost problems for defens costs are not just competition on the margin with popular and critical economic and politically desirable programs butfrom

united states benefits from the improvement in european security that enlargement of nat may be expected to produce security improvements would be expected to facilitate democratic market development undera rule of law more regional security in turn facilitates developments of profitable us commerce with the region some shar ing of the cost of nato enlargement has therefore been deemed justified in our na tional interests for improved security alone for the american people clearly the costs will be far less in lives and money toexpand the bounds of democracy and security than it would be if we had to involve our people in another conflict in europe 19 the european union criteria for their part include both economic and political reform criteria in their accessionrequirements but not security requirement s the interrelationship of economic and political reforms of importance to the eu may even be quantifiable according to world bank study correlating economic liber alization and political freedom the central european countries are adjudged to do especially well in transition because they combine economic liberalization and political freedom by matching countryrankings of the cumulative liberalization index to comparative index of politicalrights and civil liberties it has been found that economic liberalization has beentypically associated with similar degr ee of political change the direction of causality it is further argued is determined to be twoway since economicliberalization is an essential step in breaking the power of established structuresespecially line ministries that previously controlled industry and trade 20 while the benefits from accession to the european union and nato are complementary in enhancing security po litical stabilization and economic welfare in the three candidate states their costs are generally not for this reason someformer us officials here suggested th nato debate be recast to link nato and the eu expansion to assess both the cost s and the conflicts in serving multiple objectives 21 they argue that the policy of cost sharing adopted for supporting nato enlargement may adversely affect economic and political

the l ong term if its economy is unstable good economic policies must walk chalk line if they make the economy dynamicthen they will also set loose the for ces of social tension as well if they emphasize maintenance of the status quo then deficits and mismanagement will cause political unrest functioning economy and stable society are mutualprerequisites we will either be successful in achieving both or both will fail inthe long run increasing unemployment and social distress may seriouslyjeopardize consolidation of the new democratic structure 24 substantially higher costs with stringe nt budget constraints on the new member countries would tend to escalate opportunity costs and further elevate the concern over costly tradeoffs however these popular choices for growth over

our influence for proper consideration ofdefense requirements at the same time if we were to press for the inclusion of some military expenditures in the budget of the new member countries that might be seen as taking funds for recapitalizing work ers pension funds or restructuring loss making enterprises of these new member countries this decision may lead toretardation of economic transition and negative popular reaction within centraleuropean countries and european member s of nato the opportunity costs from supporting programs related to either eu or nato requirements might be considered especially onerous in those cas where the candidate countries paid the lions share of the costs the united states may be faced afte r accessions to both nato and eu with the broader consequences of

currency reduce the deficit and attractmore foreign investment new broad coalition supporting effective reform will be neededfrom the upcoming elections in order to return the czech republic to its former position in the front line of transition economies with popular support for nato less than that of the other new members the prospects of broad public support for czech burden sharing of nato enlargement costs are not as bright as for poland and hungary the czech government will haveto make some tough budgetary choices in supporting financial monetary and enterprise policieswhile

reduced causing slowdown in foreign investment weaken support of transition policy making the eu and nato accession processesmore difficult the projected budget deficit is 1 percent of gdp in 1998 tighter than the 3percent gdp cap set by the european union requi rements continuation of slow growth in 1998 would generate less revenues available to fund other critical programs thus puttingpressure on the deficit financing cap it is po ssible for the czech government to partially offset budget imbalances by selling assets or attracting more fdi funding of programs critical tosuccessful transition would be favored by the eu as they would tend to increase economic growth and gain wider support from the public the uncertain election outcome in spring 1998 will be key factor in projecting future econom ic performance only strong government with broad support base can move the czech economy back toward sustained growth and lowinvestment risk rating needed to attract forei gn capital the government is trying to bring the economy back into balance by trying to keep in flation at 8 per cent in 1998 with zero nominal increase in public sector wages indexation of pensions and social benefits and zero increase in nominal government expenditure except for defense their domestic state budget has been further constrained by low collection of tax revenues and continued subsidies the czechrepublic would thus have to pay high opportunity cost price to meet costs of natoenlargement by fitting costs into the new budget czechs need both austerity and growthnato enlargement costs will not help either moreover zero increase in government expenditures in 1990 would hamper transition toward sustained growth and early accessionto the eu stabilization full current

changes are needed further progress in regulation is also required in agriculture environmental protection and the energy sector the european unions critique highlighted the inefficiencies of the courts and the need to modernize and remove from politics the cumbersomeold regime bureaucracy the eu also faulted them on their slowness in building regional government system these shortcomings are related to the eu accession criteria and wouldrequire programs in the budget to support resolution integration the czech republic should be able to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the union in the medium term provided restructuring on the enterpriselevel is accelerated the czech republic has high economic transition grade from ebrd with low investment risk and relatively high forei gn direct investment fdi per capita the substantial foreign investment has had the eff ect of integrating czech enterprises into the european market for commerce and finance the czech republic was the first in the region tojoin the oecd they do not have an external debt servicing burden with the projected 25 percent of gdp growth for 1998 the czech societ would still have to face

investment and not enough on creating an environment for polishstyle explos ion of native entrepreneurial talent especially in smallscale private enterprises however the availability of comp etent hungarian managers and skilled labor is often cited by foreign investors as one of the attractions of investing in hungary hungarian deep enterprise and institu tional reforms contrast sharply with
