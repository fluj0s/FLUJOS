domestic social policy division summary in the social security disability program the level of earnings that constitute substantial gainful activity sga and therefore disqualifies person from receiving benefits is set by regulation at 940 month for 2008 however for the blind the law provides different sga level 1570 mont h for 2008 which is adjusted annually to reflect growth in average wages this report discusses the reasons for these differing amounts and proposals to change them1 it will be updated as events warrant under the social security law disabled individuals qualify for benefits only if they are determined to be unable to engage in substantial gainful activity sga under section 223 d of the social security act the commissioner of social security is given the authority to promulgate regulations prescribing the criteria for determining when earnings demonstrate an individuals ability to engage in sga since july 1999 the sga amount is adjusted annually to reflect the gr owth in average wages in 2008 this amount is 940 month however the same secti on of the law specifies that different definition of sga applies to individuals disa bled by blindness these individuals are considered to be engaging in sga if their earnings exceed 1570 month adjusted annually to reflect growth in average wages this different treatment for the blind be gan with enactment of pl 95216 in 1977 during consideration of hr 9346 the soci security amendments of 1977 the senate adopted by voice vote an amendment by sena tor bayh that provide d disability benefits for blind individuals regardless of their ability to work or of the amount of money they actually earned the amendment was identical to s 753 b ill introduced by senatorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20479crs2 2 123 cong rec s18786 daily ed nov 4 1977 statement of sen bayh 3 the earnings test reduces the benefits of recipi ents who have not attained the full retirement age fra currently age 65 and four months but scheduled to increase to age 67 by 2027 and who earn income from work in excess of an exempt amount in 2006 the law provides that recipients who receive benefits in year before the year they attain the fra may earn up to 12480 year in wages or selfemployment income without having their benefits affected there is different exempt amount 33240 in 2006 for months preceding the month of attainment of the fra in the year in which reci pient reaches the fra the test does not apply to recipients over the fra or to the disable d the exempt amounts rise each year at the same rate as average wages in the economy for more on the earnings test and proposals to liberalize or eliminate it see crs report 98789 social security proposed changes to the earnings test by debra whitmanhumphrey earlier in the year speaking in s upport of this amendmen t on the senate floor senator bayh stated social security disability insurance was signed to partially replace income loss due to disability congress has previously recognized blindness as distinct and unique condition certain economic consequences predictably follow the disability of blindness it is comparable with the social security insurance concept to protect the blind from these adverse affects if pers ons with high earning capacity can return to work at all after becoming blind they do so almost without exception at much lower salary and continue to suffer an adverse impact on their earning power moreover working in society adapted to vision entails extra costs for supportive services and special devices2 the housepassed version of hr 9346 contained similar provision in conference it was agreed that the house would recede with an amendment that struck the provisions of the senate amendment but pr ovided that the amount of earnings under the test of sga that would terminate blind indi viduals benefits would be increased to the monthly exempt amount for pe rsons at or above the full retirement age fra under the social security earnings test3 the conferees stated that they were aware that this established different test of sga for blind persons than is applied administratively for persons with other disabilities they went on to say that they did not intend that the new sga level established for the blind should be applied to other types of disabilities when the provision became effective in 1978 the sga for nonblind recipients was 260 month for the blind it became 334 month difference of about 28 in subsequent years the different sga amounts occasionally became subject to debate in 1988 the social security dvisory council found that the preferential treatment for the blind was inappropriate nd recommended that for new applicants the sga level be lowered to that for all ot her disabled recipients the council also recommended that the sga level for blind pers ons already on the rolls be frozen at the thencurrent level 700 month in 1992 the united states district court for the district of wyoming found that the higher sga amount for the blind was unconstitutional because it violated the guarantee of equal protection under the law the united states court of appeals for the 10th circuit overturned the district courts ruling saying that there was rational basis for congress to place preferences for blind persons in the law the supreme court refused to revi ew the appeals courts decisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20479crs3 4 cash benefits are suspended howeverin 1996 the general accounting office gao was asked to examine whether the legislative rationale for an earnings limit for the blind that was higher than for individuals who have other disabilities was warranted it concluded that the legislative rationale was based on the assumption that adverse employ ment experiences for the blind including high jobrelated costs and unemployment were greater than for persons who have other disabilities however the gao found that ch experiences do not appear to be unique to the blind compared to other disabled r ecipients the gao repeated this conclusion in hearing on the topic held by the social security subcommittee of the house committee on ways and means on march 23 2000 also in 1996 when congress enacted gislation pl 104121 to increase substantially the earnings test limit for those who have attained retirement age over period of five years reaching 30000 in 2002 it removed the linkage between the sga level of the blind and the exempt amount fo r individuals who have attained the full retirement age instead their sga level tinued as before ie adjusted annually to reflect growth in average wages sga fo r the blind is 1500 month in 2007 if the link had not been broken then the sga limit for the blind in 2007 would be 2870 month during deliberation of pl 104121 advocates of the blind sought to have the link maintained during the mark up of the bill in the ways and means subcommittee on social security an amendment was offered to do so the projected cost of 18 billion over seven years led to th proposal being rejected on april 7 2000 president clinton signed hr 5 the senior citizens freedom to work act which eliminates the social security earnings test for recipients who have reached the full retirement age effective in 2000 the new law pl 106182 continues the severance between the earnings test and the sga level of the blind enacted in pl 104121 the social security administration estimates that if the sga amount for the blind were totally eliminated as would happen if the linkage were restored the longrange cost to the program would be 003 of taxable payroll if the linkage of the blind sga to the earnings test applicable to those above the full retirement age were restored and the nonblind sga level were brought up to that of the blind the longrange cost to the program would be 045 of taxable payroll quivalent to an increase of about 23 in the longrange actuarial deficit proponents of liberalizing the sga limit for the blind maintain that the reasons given in 1977 to provide different limit for the blind are just as valid today blindness is still distinct and special condition and they belie ve that the blind still merit being singled out for compensatory help they point out that congress has recognized the special nature of blindness by writing in to law different disability cr iteria for the blind in regard to 1 insured status 2 continued eligibility for benefits beyond age 54 regardless of the level of work activity4 and 3 the use of functional capacity as part of the test of meeting the definition of disability they say that what congress established then was that the retirement test as the earnings test is sometimes called for ol der workers should be applied to the blind and therefore that they should be treated ju st like retired older workers whenever congress makes changes to the retirement test they say that if anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20479crs4 change is made to lessen or eliminate the di fference in sga amounts it should be to raise the sga limits of the nonblind opponents of liberalizing the sga limit for the blind maintain that the blind already receive enough preferential trea tment and that to expand it fu rther would be inequitable many of them think that even current law is too generous because they see logical reason that particular group of disabled individuals should receive advantages over another in their view there are many other impairments that could just as easily be viewed as needing special compensatory relie f quadriplegia cancer etc they dispute that the blind suffer higher rates of unemplo yment or workrelated expenses they point out that the very definition of disability is that person is unable to perform substantial work and that the purpose of the sga limit is to determine if regardless of persons medical condition he or she demonstrates by work that he or she is not in fact disabled from their perspective if the sga for the blind were further liberalized especially to the point where it would approach or exceed the av erage wage of all workers the concept of disability would become mean ingless and vitiate the basic concept of the disability program as whole
