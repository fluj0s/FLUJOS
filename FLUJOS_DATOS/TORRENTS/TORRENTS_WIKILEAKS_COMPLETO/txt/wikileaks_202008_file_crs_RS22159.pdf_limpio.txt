are those labor laws being adequately enforced and 3 does dr cafta comply with the principal negotiating objectives for trade agreements outlined in the trade act of 2002 this report will not be updated background congress has linked labor protections to tr ade promotion vehicles for at least two decades for two purposes the first is to help level the playing field by protecting us jobs and wages from what some consider unfair competition from lowwage foreign producers the second is to help improve working conditions in developing countries to this end in 1984 amendment to the ge neralized system of preferences gsp congress prohibited prefer ential tariff treatment to developing countries not taking steps to afford their workers internationally recognized worker rights this was extended to the caribbean basin initiative cbi whic h covers all drcafta countries in 1990 in the 1984 gsp amendment congress defi ned internationally recognized worker rights gsp sec 502a4to include the fo llowing basic protections 1 the right to associate to form unions and to bargain coll ectively 2 prohibition of forced or prison labor 3 protections against child labor and 4 minimum standards for wages hourshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22159crs2 and occupational safety and health meanwhile the inte rnational labor organization ilo set out to promote similar list of core labor standards which includes items 1 3 above but substitutes for item 4 freedom from employ ment discrimination the first worker rights prot ections were in us tariff preference laws however since 1993 the united states has also linked worker rights protections to free trade agreements ftas using three basic models the first model the north american free trade agreement nafta pl 103182 incl udes worker rights provisions in side agreement with sanctions limited to failure to enforce standards for occupational safety and health child labor or minimum wages the second model the usjordan fta placed labor provisions in the body of the ag reement and made them subject to sanctions via the ftas dispute resolution procedures the third model is reflected in drcafta and the other five ftas since jordan which include worker rights provisions in the body of the agreement but permit sanctions only if country fails to enforce its own labor laws commitments under drcafta are as follows each country pledges 1 to not fail to effectively enforce its own labor laws in manner affecting trade 2 to strive to ensure that both ilo core labor principles and internationally recognized worker rights are recognized and protected by domestic law 3 to strive to not waive or derogate from its own labor laws to encourage trade or investment 4 to respect the sovereignty of the other countries and 5 to estab lish mechanisms for cooperative activities and laborrelated trade capacity building with the other countries of these shared commitments only sustained failure to enforce ones own labor laws is subject to binding dispute settlement and ultimately to fines or sanctions the maximum fine in particular dispute is set at 15 million per year per vi olation sum of which may be directed towards remedying the labor violation see table 1 for more detail on labor provisions table 1 labor provisions included in drcafta each party chapter 16 labor 1 shall not fail to effectively enforce its own labor laws in manner affecting trade 2 shall strive to ensure that ilo labor principl and internationally recognized worker rights are recognized and protected by domestic law 3 shall strive to ensure it does not to waive or derogate from domestic labor law in order to encourage trade or investment 4 has the right to establish its own domestic labor standards and adopt or modify its labor laws 5

work 9 shall be guided by detailed mechanism for cooperative activities and trade capacity building 10 may request consultations with another party on any matter under the labor chapter sanctions and dispute settlement provisions for violations chapter 20 11 sanctions under drcafta labor provision s are authorized only for failure to effectively enforce ones own labor laws through sustaine d or recurring course of action or inaction in manner affect ing trade between the parties an annual monetary assessment could be imposed for failure of the di sputing parties to reach resolution or failure of the defending country to observe the terms of the agreement 12 the maximum penalty for such stained failure is 15 million annually which shall be paid into fund established by the drcaf ta free trade commission and expended at its direction for appropriate labor initiatives in the defending country including efforts to improve or enhance labor law enforcement if country fails to pay the assessment the complaining country can take other steps to secure enforcement including suspending drcafta tariff benefits httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22159crs3 3 for discussion of other issues rela ting

representative ustr website at httpwwwustrgov labor laws in central america and the dominican republic the ilo report critics arguments are taken from paragraph 1 april 4 2005 letter to acting us

organization reports confirm deficiencies in drcafta labor laws 10 p paragraph 2 aflcio global fairness 2004 ustr misleads congress on drcafta labor provisions dateconnected with drcafta are three main issues discussed below these stem from critics perceptions that the countries ve weak labor laws th at are not adequately enforced and their preference that all dr cafta labor provisions and ilo core labor standards be fully enforceable3 the four issues are 1 how strong are labor laws in dr cafta countries 2 are drc afta country laws being ad equately enforced and 3 does drcafta comply with the principal negotiating objectives for trade agreements outlined in the trade act of 2002 many ar guments on both sides are derived from three studies which are themselves controversial nd subject to interpretation they are the state departments country reports on human rights practices the ilos fundamental principles and rights at work labor law study and the labor dimension in central america and the dominican republic building on progress prepared by the vice ministers of trade and labor in drc afta countries with the interamerican development bank idb4 issue 1 how strong are labor laws in drcafta countries5 the first issue relates to the drcafta requirement that each country shall strive to ensure that ilo labor provisions and inte rnationally recognized worker rights are recognized and protected by domestic laws nd regulations much of the debate focuses on how strong these labor laws are in dr cafta countries because if they are inadequate critics argue drcafta would only reinforce weak laws the administration argues based on the above repor ts that drcafta country constitutions and laws generally reflect the eight core ilo conventions two for each of the four core labor standards that have been ratified by all drcafta countries except salvador which has ratified six the administration also argues that within the last decade all of the drcafta countries except honduras have carried out major revisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22159crs4 6 administration arguments are taken from ustr website cafta facts the case for cafta and cafta facts real results on labor rights and the facts about caftas labor provisions answering the allegations of cafta critics critics arguments are taken from paragraph 1 the washington post caftas profit motive by harold meyerson march 30 2005 p a15 paragraph 2 inside us trade cafta countries to unveil labor initiative to thwart congressional critics december 17 2004 and washington trade daily us cafta chances iffy april 27

appropriations administration requests for fy2001 167 mil fy2 002 72 mil fy2003 55 mil fy2004 12 mil fy2005 31 mil and fy2006 12 mil and paragraph 4 labor advisory committee for trade negotiations and trade policy the uscentral america free trade agreement march 19 2004 p9 and the dispatcher cafta the nafta nightmare returns march 2005 of labor codes that honduras is working on its revision and that drcafta will help raise standards further the administrati on acknowledges however that there are some coverage gaps in worker rights legi slation as identified in the ilo report critics from their analysis of the ilo and state department reports argue that they have identified at least 20 issue areas where drcafta labor laws fail to comply with ilo core labor standards especially the basi c right to organize and bargain collectively they claim that some laws contain onerous strike requirements inadequate protection against antiunion discrimination limitation on the number of unions restrictions on union leadership and procedural impediments to calling strike critics also argue that drcafta woul d not mandate needed labor law reforms and that most of the labor reforms carried out by drcafta countries in the past decade were the direct result of pressure from the us government tied to the threat of sanctions for failure to respect interna tionally recognized worker rights under the gsp in addition they argue drcafta does not actually pr ohibit backed up by sanctions any country from adopting weaker laws in order to attract trade and investment and then enforcing those issue 2 are drcafta country laws being adequately enforced6 the second issue relates to the only sanc tionable labor requirement in drcafta that each country shall not fail to effectively enfor ce its own labor laws in the production of goods for trade generally sp eaking both the administration and critics of drcafta agree that the thr ee studies referred to above find that drcafta countries have inadequate resources and perhaps weak political will to enforce their laws the administrations position however is that drcafta creat the strongest mechanism to make countries comply with fta requirements of any trade agreement negotiated so far because it creates threetrack labor strategy specifically designed to address enforcement issues track 1 if country fails to enfo rce its own labor laws it is subject to monetary fines of up to 15 million annually or potential loss of trade benefits if country fails to pay the fine the ad ministration points out that relative to the economic size and leve l of income of drcafta part ners fine of up to 15 million per year per violation is not small track 2 is voluntary labor law enforcement thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22159crs5 administration argues that countries in th region have already taken numerous concrete steps to improve labor law enforcement and are looking at additional specific recommendations from the idb report to improve such enforcement track 3 is us assistance for labor cooperation and trad capacity building supported by 20 million appropriation for the region for fy2005 to pr omote labor cooperation capacity building for worker rights and improvement in labor administration the administration states it will work with the interamerican development bank idb and others to target these funds toward areas of greatest need the administration also argues that the enforcement is enhanced by the dispute settlement mechanism under drcafta which is more targeted and thus likely to be more effective than that which exists under gsp or cbi where the remedy is suspension of benefits until the problem is resolved under drcafta they point out if the country is failing to effectively enforce its labor laws the governme nt would pay stiff fine which will recur until the situation is remedied and those fines could be directed toward solving the specific problem identified in the dispute on the other hand critics argue that drc afta is technically less stringent than gsp cbi and other trade preference laws which go beyond asking whether country is enforcing its own labor laws and look to whether partners are actually taking steps to afford their workers internationally recognized worker rights they also argue there is specific drcafta requirement that fines be directed to solving the enforcement problem critics maintain that if drcafta laws do not adequately meet ilo standards efforts to better enforce these laws would rely strengthen enforcement of bad laws they argue that drcafta could be re negotiated to address these concerns critics also assert that th administration has consiste ntly reduced budget requests for the department of labors bureau of in ternational labor affairs dolilab which has funded many of the technical labor assistance programs critics further argue that the administration is shifting funding for trade capacity building away from worker rights focus to programs only tangentially related to worker rights programs focusing on worker training productivity and corporate c odes of conduct which are not designed to improve labor standards finally critics argue that the potential ma ximum fine of 15 million per year per violation sum that the offending party essentially pays to itself is so low that the fines will have little if any deterrence effect and may simply be offset by shifting other funds away from labor programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22159crs6 7 administration arguments are taken from ustr the facts about caftas labor provisio ns op cit critics arguments are taken from aflcio global fairness 2004 ustr misleads congress on c afta labor provisions date p 1issue 3 does drcafta comply with the principal negotiating objectives of the trade act of 2002 7 the trade act of 2002 extended presidentia l fast tracktrade promotion authority to negotiate trade agreements which congress must then consider without amendment and under limited debate that gislation pl 107210 sec 2102 set out enforceable principal negotiating objectives to guide the administration as it forges trade agreements at issue is whether drcafta complies with those objectives the administrations position is that drcafta fully meets the labor objectives set out by congress in the trade act of 2002 wh ich include 1 to ensure that party to us trade agreement does not fail to ffectively enforce its labor laws 2 to recognize that parties to trade agreement retain the right to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to enforcement and 3 to strengthen the capacity of trading partners to promote respect for core labor standards critics argue that while drcafta may meet the labor negotiating objectives of the trade act of 2002 it does not meet negotiating objectives for dispute settlement and enforcement which instruct negotiators to seek provisions in trade agreements that treat us principal negotiating objectives equally with respect to the ability to resort to dispute settlement b the availability of equivalent dispute settlement procedures and c the availability of equivalent remedies critics point out that while virtually all provisions in nonlabor and non environment chapters of drcafta are eligible for dispute settlement procedures and possible sanctions only one provision in the labor chapter is so eligible the provision that each country shall not fail to enforce its own labor laws in manner affecting trade th erefore critics argue under drcafta us principal negotiating objectives for labor are not treated equally with principal negotiating objectives for such subjects as trade barrier s trade in services foreign investment intellectual property etc and as result violate the principal negotiating objectives of the trade act of 2002 congressional action on june 30 2005 the senate passed s 1307 the dominican republiccentral americaunited states free trade
