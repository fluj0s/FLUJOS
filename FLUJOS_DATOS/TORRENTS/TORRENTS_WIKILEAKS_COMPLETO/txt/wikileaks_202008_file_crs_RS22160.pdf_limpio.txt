some of th tax cuts that might be included in reconciliation legislation would extend existing tax cuts that otherwise would expire during the fiveyear period the tax cuts ca lled for in reconciliation would increase the fy2006 deficit estimate by 3002 and would increase the fi veyear cumulative deficit estimate by 5269 although the reconciliation in structions to cut mandato ry spending from baseline estimates is an attempt by congress to reduce the deficits from baseline levels expected over the next five years th reconciliation instructions to cut taxes move in the opposite direction and would lead to an increase in the deficit from baseline levels the net effect of the reconciliation legislation required by the budget resolution would be to increase from
