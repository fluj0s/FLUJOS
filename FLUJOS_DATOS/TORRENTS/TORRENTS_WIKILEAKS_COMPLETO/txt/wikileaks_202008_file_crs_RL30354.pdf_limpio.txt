the actions it undertakes to influence the availability and cost of money and credit to help promote stable price level and maximum sustainable economic growth since the expectations of market participants play an important role in determining prices and growth monetary policy can also be defined to include the directives policies statements and actions of the federal reserve that influence how the future is perceived in addition the federal reserve acts as lender of last resort to the nations financial system meaning that it ensures its sustainability solvency and integrity this role has become of great importance with the onset of the financial crisis in the summer of 2007 traditionally the federal reserve has had three means for achieving its congressionally mandated goals open market operations involving the purchase and sale of us treasury securities the discount rate charged to banks who borrow from it and reserve requirements that governed the proportion of deposits that must be held either as vault cash or as deposit at the federal reserve historically open market operations have been the primary means for executing monetary policy recently in response to the financial crisis the discount window has become important once again and the fed has created number of new ways for injecting reserves credit and liquidity into the financial systems as well making loans to nonfinancial firms the scope and magnitude of these changes are evolving the federal reserve conducts open market operations by setting an interest rate target that it believes will allow it to achieve price stability and maximum sustainable growth the interest rate targeted is the federal funds rate the price at which banks buy and sell reserves on an overnight basis this rate is linked to other short term rate s and these in turn are linked to longer term interest rates while monetary policy is charged with promoting maximum sustainable economic growth it does so only indirectly by maintaining stable price level since the direct effect of monetary policy is primarily on the rate of inflation low and stable rate of inflation through the business cycle promotes price transparency and thereby sounder economic decisions by households and businesses the fed has frequently changed the federal funds target to match changes in expected economic conditions between january 3 2001 and june 25 2003 the target rate was reduced to 1 from 6½ this policy was reversed on june 30 2004 in 17 equal increments ending on june 29 2006 the target rate was raised to 5¼ additional changes were made until september 18 2007 when in series of 10 moves the target was reduced to range of 0 to14 on december 16 2008 these reductions were designed to ease credit market conditions and stimulate spending this report will be updated periodically as new data become available httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30354g15g152g151g142g157g138g155g162g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 g138g151g141

defines monetary policy as the actions it undertakes to influence the availability and cost of money and credit to promote the goals mandated by congress stable price level and maximum sustainable economic growth since the expectations of households as consumers and businesses as the purchasers of capital goods exert an important influence on the major portion of spending in the united states and these expectations are influenced in important ways by the actions of the federal reserve broader definition of monetary policy would include the directives policies statements forecasts of the economy and other actions by the federal reserve especially those made by or associated with the chairman of its board of governors the nations central banker 1 in addition monetary policy has traditionally assigned to central bank the role of lender of last resort to the nations financial system this role means that the federal reserve is responsible for ensuring the sustainability solvency and integrity of the nations financial system as whole although this does not necessarily extend to each individual financial institution thus in times of financial stress or crisis the federal reserve is responsible for supplying the ultimate means of payment to financial institutions historically this has been limited to the banking system indeed the impetus for the founding of the federal reserve was an outgrowth of the financial panic of 19072 during its nearly 100 year history the federal reserve has rarely been called upon to perform this role it is now widely regarded as having failed to perform it during the collapse of the us banking system in the contraction of 19291933 however the ongoing financial crisis that began in the summer of 2007 with the bursting of the housing price bubble has placed this role front and center the federal reserve has responded in the conventional way by making massive additions of reserves available to depository institutions primarily commercial banks through the purchase of us treasury securities and allowing banks to discount large amounts of eligible paper in addition it has created number of additional ways to make credit available to broader range of financial institutions as well as making loans directly to nonfinancial firms these innovations are still evolving and several appear to have limited life 3 thus the federal reserve has two monetary policy functions its main function is one of demand management the availability and cost of credit are used to manage aggregate demand in such way as to promote stable price level and through it maximum sustainable growth its second function is as lender of last resort to the nations financial system4 1 for discussion of the important role played by

g18g152g149g146g140g162g501g561 the federal reserve has traditionally relied on three means to conduct monetary policy and they are used to alter the reserves available to depository institutions these institutions are required to maintain reserves in the form of vault cash currency or as deposit at the federal reserve against their deposit liabilities primarily checking saving and time cds the size of these reserves places ceiling on the amount of deposits that financial institutions can have outstanding and deposit liabilities are related to the amount of assets these institutions can acquire these assets are often called credit since they represent loans made to businesses and households among others if the federal reserve wishes to expand money and credit it has three ways to do so the primary method is called open market operations and it involves the fed buying and selling seasoned us treasury securities or those that have been already issued and sold to private investors should it buy securities it does so with the equivalent of newly issued currency federal reserve notes this expands the reserve base and the ability of depository institutions to make loans and expand money and credit the reverse is true if the fed decides to sell securities from its portfolio the fed can also change the reserve requirement meaning that given amount of reserves will now support more or less deposits and in the process this will affect the lending capability of financial institutions this is rarely used today finally the fed permits certain depository institutions to borrow from it directly on temporary basis that is these institutions can discount at the fed some of their own asse ts to provide temporary means for obtaining reserves discounts are usually on an overnight basis for this privilege they are charged an interest rate called appropriately the discount rate direct lending from the discount window and other recently created lending facilities was negligible until late 2007 but has been an important source of reserves since then 5 since the federal reserve defines monetary policy as the actions it undertakes to influence the availability and cost of money and credit this suggests two ways to measure the stance of monetary policy one is to look at the cost of money and credit as measured by the rate of interest relative to inflation or inflation projections while the other is to look at the growth of money and credit itself thus one can look at either interest rates or the growth in the supply of money and credit in coming to conclusion about the current stance of monetary policy that is whether it is expansionary contractionary or neutral since the great inflation of the 1970s most central banks have preferred to formulate monetary policy more in terms of the cost of money and credit rather than on their supply 6 the federal reserve thus conducts monetary policy by focusing on the cost of money and credit as proxied by an interest rate in particular it targets very short term interest rate known as the federal funds rate this rate is determined in the overnight market for reserves of depository institutions at the continued labonte

monetary aggregates see appendix c httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30354g15g152g151g142g157g138g155g162g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 g138g151g141 g561g157g145g142g561g8g142g141g142

how many dollars of reserves they want to hold against their reservable liabilities deposits7 some institutions may discover reserve shortage too few reservable assets relative to those it wants to hold while others may have had reservable assets in excess of their wants market exists in which these reserves can be bought and sold on an overnight basis the interest rate in this market is called the federal funds rate it is this rate that the federal reserve uses as target for conducting monetary policy if it wishes to expand money and credit it will lower the target which encourages more lending activity and thus demand in the economy to support this lower target the fed must stand ready to buy more us treasury securities conversely if it wishes to tighten money and credit it will raise the target and remove as many reserves from depository institutions as are necessary to accomplish its ends this will require the sale of treasuries from its portfolio of assets 8 the federal funds rate is linked to the interest rates that banks and other financial institutions charge for loans or the provision of credit thus while the fed may directly influence only very short term interest rate this rate is linked to other longer term rates however as shown on figure 1 this relationship is far from being on onetoone basis since the longer term market rates are influenced not only by what the fed is doing today but what it is expected to do in the future and what inflation is expected to be in the future this highlights the importance of expectations in explaining market interest rates for that reason there is growing body of literature that urges the federal reserve to be very transparent in explaining what its policy is and will be and making commitment to adhere to that policy in fact the fed has responded to this literature and is increasingly transparent in explaining its policies and what they are expected to accomplish 7 depository institutions are obligated by law to hold some fraction of their deposit liabilities as reserves in addition they are also likely to hold additional or excess reserves based on certain risk assessments they make about their portfolios and liabilities until very recently these reserves were nonincome earning assets the fed now pays interest on both types of reserves it is too early to assess how this shift in policy will affect bank reserve holdings 8 for technical discussion of how this is actually done see edwards cheryl l open market operations in the 1990s federal reserve bulletin november 1997 pp 859872

however the interest rate that is essential to decisions made by households and businesses to buy capital goods is what economists call the real interest rate it is often proxied by subtracting from the market interest rate the actual or expected rate of inflation the real rate is largely independent of the amount of money and credit since over the longer run it is determined by the interaction of saving and investment or the demand for capital goods the internationalization of capital markets means that for most developed countries the relevant saving and investment that determines the real interest rate is on global basis thus real rates in the united states depend not only on our national saving and investment but on the saving and investment of other countries as well for that reason national interest rates will be influenced by international credit conditions and business cycles

can be made in at least two different contexts in one monetary policy is compared with fiscal policy and given the current international financial system with flexible exchange rates and high degree of capital mobility between countries the ability of changes in monetary policy to affect aggregate demand is great compared with fiscal policy in the other context changes in monetary policy have the potential to bring about major changes in the growth of gdp and employment only in the short run most economists do not believe that this holds true over the longer run over the more extended horizon monetary policy has its primary effect on the rate of inflation brief discussion of the two contexts summarized above follows

importance of monetary policy in world whose financial arrangements involve the use of flexible exchange rates and where capital is highly mobile between countries to see this fiscal and monetary expansion will be contrasted allow the full employment budget deficit to rise or the fullemployment surplus to fall through either tax rate cut or rise in appropriated expenditures while the increase in this budget deficit or fall in surplus raises aggregate demand it also reduces national saving the fall in the supply of saving relative to domestic investment demand causes domestic interest rates both real and market to rise relative to those in other financial centers the rise in domestic interest rates makes us financial assets more attractive to foreigners they in turn increase the demand for dollars in foreign exchange markets to acquire the wherewithal to purchase us assets the increased demand for dollars causes the dollar to appreciate dollar appreciation then reduces the cost of foreign goods and services to americans and raises the price of american goods and services to foreigners as result us spending on imports tends to rise and foreign spending on us exports tends to fall thus any expansionary effects on domestic demand from the larger budget deficit tends to be offset in part or total by reduced foreign trade surplus or larger foreign trade deficit 9 monetary policy stimulus as shown by reduction in the target rate for federal funds initially serves to lower us interest rates both real and market relative to those in other financial centers foreign financial assets become more attractive to us investors the supply of dollars on the foreign exchange markets rises as us investors attempt to acquire foreign currencies to buy foreign assets and the dollar depreciates dollar depreciation then makes foreign goods and services more expensive to americans and american goods and services cheaper to foreigners as result the united states spends less on imports and foreigners spend more on us exports falling foreign trade deficit or rising trade surplus thus reinforces any stimulus to domestic demand that comes from lower us interest rates the implication from the standard open economy macroeconomic model is that monetary policy is more powerful than fiscal policy in influencing gdp growth and employment given current international financial arrangements 10 g21g145g152g155g157g561g20g158g151g561g159g156g495g561g14g152g151g144g142g155g561g20g158g151g561 the analysis above suggests that more expansive monetary policy can cause domestic demand to expand an examination of us economic hist ory will show that money and credit induced demand expansions can have positive effect on us gdp growth and total employment this same

with little if any lasting effect on real gdp and employment economists have two explanations for this paradoxical behavior first they note that in the short run many economies have an elaborate system of contracts both implicit and explicit that makes it difficult in short period for significant adjustments to take place in wages and prices in response to more rapid growth of money and credit second they note that expectations for one reason or another are slow to adjust to the longer run consequences of major changes in monetary policy this slow adjustment also adds rigidities to wages and prices because of these rigidities changes in the growth of money and credit that change aggregate demand can have large initial effect on output and employment over the long er run as contracts are renegotiated and expectations adjust wages and prices rise in response to the change in demand and much of the change in output and employment is undone thus monetary policy can matter in the short run but be fairly neutral for gdp growth and employment in the longer run 11 it is noteworthy that in societies where high rates of inflation are endemic the short run may be very short indeed during the final stages of very rapid inflations called hyperinflation the ability of more rapid rates of growth of money and credit to alter gdp growth and employment is virtually nonexistent if not negative

behavior of three major indicators of economic performance are set out in table 1 they show an expansion that got underway beginning in december 2001 initially the expansion in demand was insufficiently robust to bring about fall in the unemployment rate and it continued to rise into mid2003 as the expansion took hold the unemployment rate began to fall reaching 44 in october 2006 the inflation rate with the exception of 2004 remained under 2 throughout 2006 however it began to accelerate in 2007 initially the acceleration was attributed correctly to the increase in energy prices these increases did not show up in price indices including for example the core consumer price index that excluded energy nevertheless as energy price increases accelerated they became matter of

increases and the view that with the unemployment rate as low as 44 the us economy was probably close to operating at its long run potential led the fed to initiate gradual tightening of monetary policy the federal funds target was slowly ratcheted upward in 17 steps it was raised in uniform increments to 514 on june 30 2006 from 1 year earlier short term interest rates followed and by the end of 2006 the yield curve had become inverted with shorter term rates higher than longer term rates 12 the shift in financing housing from fixed to variable rate mortgages made this sector of the economy increasingly vulnerable to movements in short term interest rates in particular critics 12 yield curve inversions pose potentially difficult problems for depository institutions since they squeeze their profitability and possibly undermine their capital structure th reason for this is that pository institutions generally lend long and borrow short thus their borrowing their ability to attract and re tain deposits which are the source of their funds costs are very sensitive to movements in short term interest rates since they lend long only fraction of their assets their new loans are affected by movements in long er term rates thus when short term rates rise relative to long term rates depository institutions find their costs ri sing sharply as they struggle to retain and attract deposits while the gross earnings from their assets rise only slowly the classic case of profit squeeze in fact if losses ensue they undermine the capital base of these institutions setting in motion the possibility of failure in any case an inverted yield curve generally has negative effects on credit creation and is often leading indicator of an impending economic downturn see crs report

2004 caused an increased demand for housing leading to price bubble an unintended consequence of the tightening of monetary policy critics now claim was to burst this price bubble bubble that was also due in part to lax lending standards the net result was the onset of financial crisis affecting not only depository institutions but other segments of the financial sector involved with housing finance as the delinquency rates on home mortgages rose to record numbers and the subsequent losses of financial institutions made national headlines the contagious nature of this development was soon obvious as other types of loans and credit became adversely affected this in turn spilled over into the broader economy as the lack of credit soon had negative effect on both production and aggregate demand during the fourth quarter of 2007 gdp contracted at an annual rate of 02 initially the unemployment rate stayed fairly steady and did not show significant increases until midsummer 2008 this was due in part to the fact that gdp growth was again positive during the first two quarters of 2008 at annualized rates of 09 and 28 respectively however during the third quart er gdp contracted once again at an annual rate of 05 the unemployment rate continued to rise reaching 67 in november payroll employment in november was nearly 175 million below the expansion peak reached in december 2007 the economic forecasts for 2009 including that by the federal reserve shown below expect the economy to continue to contract into mid2009 the initial stages of recovery are expected to be insufficiently strong to prevent the unemployment rate from rising currently the unemployment rate during the fourth quarter of 2009 is expected to be near 8 13 as the magnitude of the financial crisis as well as its international scope became apparent the federal reserve responded to the expected economic slump by reducing the federal funds target and the discount rate beginning on september 18 2007 and ending on december 16 2008 the target was reduced to range of 0 to 14 from 514 this entailed an unprecedented increase in the reserves of depository institutions they increased from about 446 billion in august 2008 to nearly 644 billion during the first week of december of these only about 54 billion were required what began to concern the monetary authorities is that these large increase in reserves were not being lent out it would appear that the traditional transmission mechanism for monetary policy is not working if not broken down to circumvent this problem the fed began to employ little used provision of the federal reserve act that allows it to make loans to other financial institutions and to nonfinancial firms as well the magnitude of these loans has been large total borrowing from the federal reserve during november 2007 was 366 million during the first week of december 2008 it had grown to 676 billion down from high of 725 billion in midnovember this is clearly not business as usual monetary policy but something quite extraordinary once credit markets resume functioning smoothly the task facing the federal reserve will be to remove this huge amount of credit from the financial system quickly enough to prevent inflation from taking hold 13for more extensive discussion of current economic conditions see crs report rl30329 current economic

the constitution grants congress the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof however operational responsibility for making us monetary policy has been delegated by congress to the fed congress is still responsible for oversight setting the feds mandate and approving the presidents nominations for the feds board of governors but several institutional features grant it significant independence from the political process 15 the federal reserve system is quasipublic in structure it is owned by its member banks the governors are appointed to staggered 14year terms and can only be removed by congress for cause it is selffunded and does not receive appropriations while it must follow its congressional mandate it has been granted broad discretion to interpret and carry out that mandate as it sees fit on daytoday basis most economists argue that good monetary policy depends on independence because it reduces the temptation to raise inflation in the long run in order to lower unemployment in the short run researchers have made crosscountry comparisons to try to make the case that countries with independent central banks are more likely to have low inflation rates and better economic performance16 as practical matter the feds mandate can be seen as further source of political independence the federal reserve act of 1977 pl 95188 91 stat 1387 charged the fed with the goals of maximum employment stable prices and moderate longterm interest rates note that the fed controls none of these three indicators directly it controls only overnight interest rates because it has only one instrument at its disposal and three goals there will be times when the goals will be at odds with each other and the fed will have to choose to pursue one at the expense of the other two critics have argued that the ambiguity inherent in the current mandate makes for less than optimal transparency and accountability it may also strengthen political independence if it allows the fed to deflect congressional criticism by pointing at any given time to whatever goal justifies its current policy stance the most popular alternative to the current mandate is to replace it with single mandate of price stability under this proposal the fed would typica lly be given or under the version mooted by chairman bernanke give itself numerical inflation target and would then be required to set monetary policy with the goal of meeting the target on an ongoing basis 17 proponents of inflation targeting say that maximum employment and moderate interest rates are not meaningful policy goals because monetary policy has longterm influence over either one they argue mandate that focused on keeping inflation low would deliver better economic results and improve transparency and oversight opponents including former chairman greenspan say that the flexibility inherent in the current system has served the united states well in the past 25 years delivering both low inflation and economic stability and there is little reason to fix system that is not broken they argue that some focus on employment is appropriate given that monetary 15for more information see crs report rl31056

policy by setting target for the federal funds rate this method has allowed the federal reserve to adopt an activist stance in the conduct of monetary policy the board of governors controls another interest rate the discount rate financial institutions can borrow on temporary basis directly from the federal reserve at this rate that is they can use the discount window the board can either grant or deny the loan the initiation of the loan however is at the discretion of the borrowing financial institution in this sense the federal reserve is passive in the process although the discount rate has long been tool of central banking the discount window has not been used much in the united states over the past several decades until market turmoil in 2008 gave it more permanent role financial institutions prefer to borrow overnight in the fe deral funds market because they can obtain what they need without having to subject their borrowing needs to the purview of the federal reserve 19 in conducting monetary policy the board has in the past moved the discount rate in sympathy with the federal funds target for much of the past decade the discount rate was set slightly below the federal funds target to discourage financial institutions from borrowing at the discount window lending rules were altered in early 2003 since that time the discount rate has been set above the federal funds rate target and is now penalty rate however change in the discount rate independent from change in the federal funds target can send power ful message to financial markets for example on august 17 2007 the board of governors concerned about the adequacy of liquidity in national financial markets reduced the discount rate for primary credit to 4¾ from 5¼ later on september 18 october 31 december 11 2007 january 22 and 30 march 18 april 30 october 8 and 29 and december 16 2008 when the federal funds target was reduced the discount rate was also reduced replicating past behavior by the federal reserve in addition on march16 2008 the discount rate was lowered without any change in the federal funds target however in the current financial environment the fed has not discouraged banks in their use of the discount window 19a certain stigma was once attached to using the discount window to obtain reserves since banks borrow from their depositors to acquire assets it was thought to be sign of unsound banking to also borrow from the federal reserve httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30354g15g152g151g142g157g138g155g162g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 g138g151g141 g561g157g145g142g561g8g142g141g142

an important determinant of money spending it might appear to some as curious that the fed does not target the money supply in the conduct of monetary policy such target has not been popular with the federal reserve this is due in part to the fact that until the early 1970s the us was part of an international monetary regime based on fixed exchange rates under such regime money supply targeting isnt possible however after the us switched to using flexible exchange rate s in the early 1970s the fed did define several measures of money designating them ultimately as m1 m2 and m3 published data on them on monthly basis and set growth rate ranges for each on annual basis early on the fed encountered problems with its defined measures of money these monetary aggregates were not stably and predictably related to money spending in the technical language of the economist the demand for these measures of money was unstable hence their usefulness as target for monetary policy was questionable and inferior to using an interest rate target this the fed ultimately recognized 20 in its report to congress dated july 20 1993 the board of governors expressed considerable uncertainty about the usefulness of m2 and m3 as measures of money and decided to deemphasize both in its decisionmaking while the board continued to set growth rate ranges for each aggregate it concluded with considerable uncertainty persisting about the relationship of the monetary aggregates to spending the behavior of the aggregates relative to their annual ranges will likely be of limited use in guiding policy and the federal reserve will continue to u tilize broad range of financial and economic indicators in assessing its policy stance this position was reaffirmed by the board during subsequent monetary policy formerly called humphreyhawkins hearings however in the monetary policy report submitted to congress on july 20 2000 the board of governors stated at its june meeting the fomc did not establish ranges for the growth of money and debt in 2000 and 2001 the legal requirement to establish and to announce such ranges had expired and owing to uncertainties about the behavior of the velocities of debt and money these ranges for many years have not provided useful benchmarks for the conduct of monetary policy nevertheless the fomc believes that the behavior of money and credit will continue to have value for gauging economic and financial conditions even this view of the usefulness of the aggr egates changed the board of governors announced in november 2005 that beginning in march 23 2006 it would longer publish data on m3 in the words of the board publication of m3 was judged to be longer generating sufficient 20for discussion of their usefulness in the
