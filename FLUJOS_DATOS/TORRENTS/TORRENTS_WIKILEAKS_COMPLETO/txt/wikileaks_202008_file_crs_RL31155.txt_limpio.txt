8 2002 robert keith specialist in american national government government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress techniques for preventing budget sequester summary for the past 17 fiscal years beginning with fy1986 the budgetary decisions of congress and the president have been guided in part by specific goals in statute enforced by process known as sequestration the statutory goals initially took the form of deficit targets but later were changed to limits on discretionary spending first effective for fy1991 and payasyougo requirement for direct spending and revenue legislation first effective for fy1992 five sequesters were triggered during years in which congress and the president did not adhere to these statutory goals sequester has occurred however since fy1991 in many of the years since fy1991 congress and the president were able to avoid sequester by ensuring that it did not enact spending or revenue legislation in violation of the statutory goals at times congress and the president had to take advantage of flexibility in the procedures such as the ability to designate certain spending as emergency requirements in order to achieve this outcome in other instances however congress and the president prevented sequester that otherwise would have occurred by enacting into law provisions that intervened in the normal operation of the process during the 12year period that the discretionary spending limits have been in effect congress and the president have enacted statutory provisions intervening in the normal operation of the enforcement process three times congress and the president enacted provision in the middle of 2000 with the intent of preventing within session sequester under the discretionary spending limits for fy2000 the action was necessitated by the enactment of supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year additionally significant upward revisions of the discretionary spending limits for fy2001 and fy2002 were enacted to prevent sequester at the end of the 2000 and 2001 sessions these actions had been assumed in the budget resolutions adopted earlier in the year although in each case the revision increased the limits more than had been assumed on six occasions during this period congress and the president enacted statutory provisions intervening in the normal operation of the paygo process in three of these instances for fy1994 fy1997 and fy1998 the omb director was instructed to remove savings balances so that they could not be used to offset legislation considered in subsequent sessions this directive applied only to single fiscal year for fy1997 amounting to 6301 billion in savings but applied to multiple fiscal years for the fy19941998 period amounting to 505 billion in savings and the fy19982002 period amounting to 749 billion in savings in the remaining three cases the statutory intervention resulted in the removal from the paygo scorecard of costs that would have led to 105 billion sequester for fy2001 and 130279 billion sequester for fy2002 and that might lead to futureyear sequesters in all three instances the legislative vehicles were annual

goals at times congress and the president had to take advantage of flexibility in the procedures such as the ability to designate certain spending as emergency requirements in order to achieve this outcome in other instances however congress and the president prevented sequester that otherwise would have occurred by enacting into law provisions that intervened in the normal operation of the process the purpose of this report is to briefly describe the sequestration process including the ways in which sequester could be avoided under the regular process and then to discuss in more detail various techniques that have been used since fy1991 to prevent sequester by intervening in the regular process the sequestration process the sequestration process which involves automatic largely acrosstheboard spending reductions made toward the beginning of the fiscal year was established under the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as means of enforcing deficit targets1 the 1985 balanced budget act was amended in 1990 to supersede the deficit targets with two new enforcement mechanismslimits on discretionary spending ie spending controlled through the annual appropriations process and payasyou go paygo requirement applicable to legislation affecting direct spending ie spending controlled outside of the annual appropriations process and revenues the discretionary spending limits are divided into several different categories which have changed over time and any violation of the limits is remedied in the category in which it occurred 1 for more detailed history and description of the sequestration process see crs report rl31137 sequestration procedures under the 1985 balanced budget act by robert keith crs2 the two budget enforcement mechanisms have been revised and extended affecting legislation enacted through fy2002 in recent years by such measures as the budget enforcement act of 1997 the transportation equity act for the 21st century and several recent annual appropriations acts current sequestration procedures under the 1985 balanced budget act require the director of the office of management and budget omb to issue sequestration report at the time the presidents budget is submitted to congress the preview report midway through the congressional session the update report and within 15 days after the end of the session the final report in these reports the omb director adjusts the discretionary spending limits for various factors specified in the 1985 act the director of the congressional budget office cbo issues sequestration reports in advance of the omb reports but they are advisory only if the omb directors final sequestration report indicates that enacted appropriations measures have exceeded the discretionary spending limits or that enacted direct spending and revenue levels have incurred net cost for the fiscal year on the paygo scorecard then the president must immediately issue sequestration order to remedy the violation through automatic acrosstheboard spending reductions any required sequester under the discretionary spending limits the paygo requirement or both must occur within 15 calendar days after congress adjourns at the end of session sequester of discretionary spending would have to eliminate the amount of any breach of the limits caused by the enactment of annual appropriations measures for the fiscal year paygo sequester would have to eliminate any net positive balance on the paygo scorecard for that fiscal year and the prior fiscal year combined caused by the enactment of legislation during the session and in prior years during the following session withinsession sequester could occur under the discretionary spending limits if congress and the president enacted supplemental appropriations measure causing breach under lookback feature the enactment of such measure on or after july 1 ie during the final quarter of the fiscal year would not cause sequester but it would cause the applicable limits for the following fiscal year to be reduced by the amount of the breach avoidance of sequester under existing procedures the most direct way for congress and the president to avoid sequester is to not enact any legislation that violates the discretionary spending limits or the paygo requirement the prospect of automatic formulaic spending reductions under sequester is considered so undesirable as to give congress and the president strong motivation to adhere to its stated budgetary goals adherence to the goals is promoted in the congressional budget process which requires congress each year to adopt budget resolution the house and senate generally have adopted budget resolutions consistent with the discretionary spending limits and paygo requirement although in some instances budget resolutions have reflected congressional intent to crs3 revise the discretionary spending limits later in the session to accommodate increased spending or to suspend the paygo requirement to accommodate tax cuts2 during times of war or low economic growth key budget enforcement procedures including sequestration may be suspended for all legislation suspension procedures are set forth in section 258 of the 1985 balanced budget act3 the 1985 balanced budget act also includes several features that are intended to lend some flexibility to budget enforcement procedures on casebycase basis for example the designation of an appropriation as an emergency requirement by congress in statute and by the president leads to commensurate increase in the applicable discretionary spending limits effectively exempting such emergency spending from enforcement similarly the applicable discretionary spending limits are increased if congress and the president enact new spending for certain programs specified in the 1985 balanced act such as continuing disability reviews and adoption incentive payments the emergency designation feature also applies to direct spending and revenue legislation covered under the paygo process additional flexibility in these procedures is provided by scorekeeping rule 34 the rule provides that changes in direct spending made in an annual appropriations act be counted under the discretionary spending limits accordingly reduction in direct spending made in an annual appropriations act would be treated as an offset to an equivalent increase in discretionary spending such changes in direct spending are referred to as mandatory offsets finally the task of avoiding sequester also may be aided by the innovative use of certain types of customary budget devices such as advance appropriations rescissions and timing shifts and obligation delays during the past several years the use of the emergency designation procedure and other devices has been perceived by many as abusive the most prolific use of such devices to avoid sequester so far may have occurred for fy2000 according to omb these adjustments amounted to about 49 billion in budget authority and 30 billion in outlays for the fiscal year emergency spending 237 billion in budget authority 143 billion in outlays mandatory savings offsets 87 billion in budget authority 88 billion in outlays 2 the house and senate did not reach agreement in 1998 on budget resolution for fy1999 3 for more information on this topic see crs report rl31068 budget enforcement procedures suspended during low economic growth by robert keith and crs report rs20182 suspension of budget enforcement procedures during hostilities abroad by robert keith 4 the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on the bea of 1990 set forth several scorekeeping rules to be used in scoring legislation under these enforcement procedures the scorekeeping rules were revised under the bea of 1997 they are presented as an addendum at the end of omb circular a11 which deals with budget formulation and may be found on ombs web site at http wwwombgov crs4 advance appropriations 144 billion in budget authority 0 in outlays rescissions 25 billion in budget authority 0052 billion in outlays and timing shifts and obligation delays 0 in budget authority 65 billion in outlays5 in response to this concern several provisions were added to the fy2001 and fy2002 budget resolutions aimed at thwarting repeat of the fy2000 experience including points of order in the house and senate against the use of advance appropriations above certain threshold point of order in the house against directed scorekeeping provisions in general appropriations acts and point of order in the senate against legislation providing for delayed obligations techniques for preventing sequester several techniques have been used to prevent sequester for the upcoming fiscal year or to reduce the likelihood of sequester in future fiscal years the techniques are discussed below by enforcement mechanism it should be noted that legislative provisions containing such techniques could violate section 306 of the 1974 congressional budget act the section bars the consideration in the house or senate of any legislation containing subject matter within the jurisdiction of the respective budget committee unless it has been reported by or discharged from that committee violations of section 306 may be waived typically by special rule in the house or motion in the senate in the senate such waivers require threefifths majority 60 senators if seats are vacant further the prohibition in section 306 is not selfenforcing member must raise point of order to enforce the prohibition discretionary spending limits during the 12year period that the discretionary spending limits have been in effect congress and the president have enacted statutory provisions intervening in the normal operation of the enforcement process three times congress and the president enacted provision in 2000 with the intent of preventing withinsession sequester under the discretionary spending limits for fy2000 additionally significant upward revisions of the discretionary spending limits for fy2001 and fy2002 were enacted to prevent sequester at the end of the 2000 and 2001 sessions6 these actions had been assumed in the budget resolutions adopted earlier in the year although in each case the revision increased the limits more than had been assumed fy2000 in the middle of the 2000 session the house and senate attempted to bring action on the fy2000 budget to close by considering supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year in single bill in the house or as elements incorporated into several regular appropriations bills for fy2001 in the senate 5 us executive office of the president office of management and budget omb final sequestration report to the president and congress for fiscal year 2000 washington january 25 2000 pages 46 6 for more detailed discussion of congressional budget actions and the discretionary spending limits for fy20012002 see crs report rl30696 discretionary spending limits for fy2001 procedural assessment by robert keith and crs report rl31193 discretionary spending limits for fy2002 procedural assessment by robert keith crs5 eventually the supplemental appropriations for fy2000 were merged into single regular appropriations bill the military construction appropriations act for fy2001 the measure was enacted into law on july 13 2000 as pl 106246 according to omb estimates the nonemergency supplemental appropriations included in pl 106246 caused breach in the budget authority and outlay limits for the other discretionary category of 2359 billion and 6763 billion respectively levels in the remaining discretionary spending categories were not changed by pl 106246 in anticipation that the measure would become law in late june or early july congress had inserted into the bill provision barring sequester which would have been required if enactment occurred in june or reduction in the fy2001 limits which would have been required because of enactment on or after the july 1 triggering date section 5107 114 stat 582 in title v of division b of the act stated sec 5107 notwithstanding section 251a of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended there shall be sequestration under that section to eliminate fiscal year 2000 breach or reductions in discretionary spending limits for fiscal year 2001 that might be caused by the appropriations or other provisions in this act because the measure was enacted into law in july the lookback feature in section 251 of the 1985 balanced budget act would have required that the fy2001 limits for the other discretionary category be reduced by the amounts of the breach the ultimate effect of the section in pl 106246 therefore was to prevent the reduction in the fy2001 limits fy2001 under the fy2001 budget resolution adopted by the house and senate in april 2000 total discretionary spending for the fiscal year was envisioned at about 600 billion in budget authority and 625 billion in outlays well above the existing statutory limits on such spending and the assumption was made that the statutory limits would be raised to accommodate the new levels the statutory limits also are adjusted from time to time by the omb director as required by law during the following 6 months congress considered the regular appropriations acts for fy2001 without enacting the necessary revisions in the discretionary spending limits on october 18 2000 the republican leadership in congress proposed increasing the fy2001 limits in order to accommodate total discretionary spending of 637 billion in budget authority and 645 billion in outlays considerably more than had been envisioned by the budget resolution after brief period of negotiation between the parties the proposal was incorporated into the conference report on the foreign operations appropriations act for fy2001 hr 4811 the two chambers agreed to the conference report on october 25 and president clinton signed hr 4811 into law on november 6 pl 106429 the measure enacted into law by crossreference another appropriations bill for foreign operations hr 5526 which effectively superseded hr 4811 section 701 of hr 5526 increased the budget authority limit for fy2001 in the other discretionary category to 637000 billion and the outlay limit in that category to crs6 612695 billion the outlay limits for highway and mass transit programs amounting to about 316 billion for fy2001 remained unchanged in addition to increasing the discretionary spending limits for fy2001 section 701 prohibited the omb director from adjusting the limits in the final sequestration report for fy2001 for legislation providing emergency appropriations and for certain other factors but other adjustments under existing authority still were allowed further section 701 authorized rounding adjustments of 05 in the budget authority limit for the other discretionary category which increased the discretionary budget authority limit for fy2001 by about 32 billion following the changes in the discretionary spending limits sequester for fy2001 was required fy2002 budgetary actions taken so far for fy2002 mirrored those taken the year before for fy2001 the fy2002 budget resolution called for over 100 billion more discretionary spending for the fiscal year than the thenexisting limits would have allowed budget resolution policies assumed that legislation increasing the discretionary spending limits for fy2002 to 661 billion in budget authority would be enacted later in the 2001 session on october 2 2001 the bush administration reached agreement with congressional leaders to increase discretionary spending for fy2002 by another 25 billion to 686 billion in budget authority in late december 2001 congress enacted the defense appropriations act for fy2002 section 101a in division c of the act as passed by the house and senate on december 20 revised the limits for fy2002 in manner accommodating the 686 billion level agreed to on october 2 and preventing sequester7 in addition section 101d provided for further increase of 012 in the limits on discretionary budget authority if needed to cover technical estimates made by the omb director the act became law on january 10 2002 pl 107117 during the 2002 session congress is expected to consider supplemental appropriations for fy2002 supplemental appropriations in excess of the revised limits if enacted before july 1 could trigger withinsession sequester for fy2002 additional actions affecting enforcement of the limits two other types of action have occurred affecting the enforcement of the discretionary spending limits first scorekeeping rule 3 was set aside on two occasions so that changes in direct spending and revenues made in omnibus appropriations acts for fy2000 and fy2001 would not be counted under the discretionary spending limits the effect of these actions was to hold the appropriations committees harmless for the costs of legislation under the jurisdiction of other committees that had been merged into the omnibus appropriations act at the direction of the house and senate leadership this issue is discussed further in the next section 7 the provision originated in the substitute amendment recommended by the senate appropriations committee see srpt 107109 december 5 2001 page 232 crs7 the second type of action involves cancellation of sequester after it has taken place on november 9 1990 drafting error in an appropriations act resulted in the sequester of 395 million in budget authority for fy1991 in the international category the problem was rectified the following session on april 10 1991 the sequester was rescinded by section 401 of pl 10227 supplemental appropriations act8 paygo requirement during the 11year period that the paygo requirement has been effect9 the omb directors final sequestration report reflected combined negative balance ie savings rather than costs for the pertinent fiscal years in nine instances thereby obviating the need for paygo sequester these savings balances ranged from 11 million for fy1998 to 7532 billion for fy1997 for fy2001 however the final sequestration report indicated positive balance of 10542 billion for fy2002 the final sequestration report indicated positive balance of 130279 billion10 on six occasions during this period congress and the president enacted statutory provisions intervening in the normal operation of the paygo process see table 1 the text of these provisions is provided in appendix in three of these instances for fy1994 fy1997 and fy1998 the omb director was instructed to remove savings balances so that they could not be used to offset legislation considered in subsequent sessions this directive applied only to single fiscal year for fy1997 amounting to 6301 billion in savings but applied to multiple fiscal years for the fy19941998 period amounting to 505 billion in savings and the fy19982002 period amounting to 749 billion in savings the legislative vehicle for the fy1997 action was an annual appropriations act the omnibus consolidated appropriations act for fy1997 the legislative vehicles in the other 2 years were reconciliation bills the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 and the balanced budget act of 1997 8 similar actions occurred on two occasions when sequestration was used to enforce deficit targets deficit sequester of 20 billion for fy1988 was cancelled following budget summit agreement on november 20 1987 also deficit sequester of 161 billion for fy1990 was reduced to 575 billion by section 11002 of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 9 unlike the process associated with the discretionary spending limits which commenced with fy1991 the paygo process did not take effect until fy1992 10 for more detailed

the bba of 1997 or the taxpayer relief act of 1997 these actions implemented upon enactment of the bba of 1997 eliminated from the scorecard total preexisting savings for fy19971998 of 5881 billion and prevented the addition to the scorecard of net savings from the two acts of 749 billion for fy19982002 the savings were removed so that they could not be used to offset legislation considered in

added to the paygo scorecard however even if the 1552 billion for fy2000 had been added to the paygo scorecard it would not have triggered paygo sequester because savings balance of 1462 billion would have remained further the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 instructed the omb director to change any balances on the scorecard for fy20002004 to zero on january 3 2000 this action removed the combined fy1999 2000 savings of 3014 billion from the scorecard but also removed costs for fy20012004 amounting to 15763 billion from the consolidated appropriations act and other measures that

intervention resulted in the removal from the paygo scorecard of costs that would have led to 105 billion sequester for fy2001 and 130279 billion sequester for fy2002 and that might lead to futureyear sequesters in all three instances the legislative vehicles were annual appropriations acts considered toward the very end of the session the consolidated appropriations acts for fy2000 and fy2001 and

consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 pl 106113 november 29 1999 in addition to prohibiting the scoring of direct spending and revenue changes made in the act under the discretionary spending limits also prohibited the scoring of these changes under the paygo scorecard this prevented costs of 1552 billion for fy2000 and costs of 15193 billion for fy20002004 from being added to the paygo scorecard however even if the 1552 billion for fy2000 had been added to the paygo scorecard it would not have triggered paygo sequester for that year because savings balance of 1462 billion would have remained section 1001 of the act also instructed the omb director to change any balances on the scorecard for fy20002004 to zero on january 3 2000 this action removed the combined fy19992000 savings of 3014 billion from the scorecard but also removed costs for fy20012004 amounting to 15763 billion from the consolidated appropriations act and other measures that could have triggered paygo sequesters in those years if not offset or otherwise prevented fy2001 at the end of the 2000 session congress and the president wrapped up business by enacting the consolidated appropriations act for fy2001 pl 106 554 114 stat 27632764 december 21 2000 which enacted regular appropriations as well as significant direct spending and revenue legislation by crossreference section 2 of the act prohibited scoring the direct spending and revenue changes made in the act under the discretionary spending limits but did require them to be scored on the paygo scorecard this resulted in costs of 7170 billion for fy2001 and costs of 49463 billion for fy20012005 being added to the paygo scorecard further section 2 of the act instructed the omb director to change the balance on the scorecard for

one of the last of the regular appropriations acts for fy2002 to be considered during the 2001 session the defense appropriations act became the legislative vehicle for preventing paygo sequester the bill was signed into law on january 10 2002 as pl 107117 115 stat 22302355 section 102 in division c of the act 115 stat 2342 prevented paygo sequester for fy2002 by requiring the omb director to set the balances on the paygo scorecard for fy2001 and fy2002 to zero according to the omb final sequestration report the combined balance for fy20012002 on the scorecard before the required adjustment was 130279 billion in its earlier sequestration update report omb had noted maximum savings achievable from paygo sequester for fy2002 of 333 billion11 consequently had full paygo sequester including 4 cut in medicare been implemented there still would have been balance on the scorecard of nearly 100 billion the remaining paygo balances for fy20032006 ranging from 110 billion to 135 billion year were not affected by the required adjustment12 unsuccessful efforts to intervene in the paygo process in addition to the successful efforts to intervene in the paygo process discussed above there have been several unsuccessful ones involving instructions to the omb director to reset paygo balances or not to score direct spending and revenue changes in the 105th congress the house considered the taxpayer relief act of 1998 hr 4579 its principal vehicle for implementing large revenue reductions as passed by the house on september 26 1998 the measure instructed the omb director not to make any estimates of changes in receipts on the paygo scorecard due to the enactment of the bill see section 607 had the measure been enacted into law the tax cuts would have taken effect without triggering paygo sequester for fy1999 as mentioned previously one obstacle to this approach is that any legislation directly or indirectly changing the budget process is prohibited by section 306 of the 1974 congressional budget act unless it was reported by the house or senate budget committee as appropriate or unless the committee was discharged from further consideration in the case of hr 4579 therefore the house needed to waive the prohibition so that it could consider the bill the house did so by adopting special rule hres 552 that waived all points of order against its consideration during the first session of the 106th congress similar directed scorekeeping provision was included by the house in section 1801 of the taxpayer relief act of 1999 hr 2488 but was dropped in the senate due to difficulties in securing the 11 us executive office of the president office of management and budget budget of the united states government fiscal year 2002 midsession review appendix b washington august 2001 page 67 12 measures with significant impact on the paygo scorecard for fy2002 and later years may be considered during the remainder of the 2002 session the fy2002 effects of any paygo legislation enacted during this session before october 1 will be added to the paygo scorecard for fy2003 in determining whether paygo sequester for fy2003 is needed crs14 60 votes needed to obtain waiver of section 306 president clinton vetoed the measure on september 23 1999 in part because the absence of the directed scorekeeping provision would have led to sequester toward the end of the 106th congress the congressional leadership attempted to use housepassed bill amending the small business investment act hr 2614 as vehicle for wideranging issues including significant revenue reductions under the conference agreement on hr 2614 the bill would have enacted five other measures by crossreference including hr 5542 the taxpayer relief act of 2000 as introduced on october 25 2000 section 731a of hr 5542 would have prevented paygo sequester for fy2001 by instructing the omb director to reset the paygo balance for that year to zero when preparing the final sequestration
