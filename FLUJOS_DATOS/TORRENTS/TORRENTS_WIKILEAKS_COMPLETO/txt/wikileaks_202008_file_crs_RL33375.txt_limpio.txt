adequacy of firefighter staffing the staffing for adequate fire and emergency response act popularly called the safer act was enacted by the 108th congress as section 1057 of the fy2004 national defense authorization act pl 108136 the safer act authorizes grants to career volunteer and combination local fire departments for the purpose of increasing the number of firefighters to help communities meet industry minimum standards and attain 24hour staffing to provide adequate protection from fire and firerelated hazards also authorized are grants to volunteer fire departments for activities related to the recruitment and retention of volunteers the safer grant program is authorized through fy2010 although authorized for fy2004 the safer grant program received its initial

appropriations act of 2008 pl 110161 provided 190 million for safer grants the administrations budget proposal again requested funding for safer act grants in fy2009 the fy2009 budget justification stated that the federal government already spends billions of dollars in annual support to train exercise and equip state and local public safety personnel including firefighters so that they are adequately prepared to respond to terrorist attack or other major incident the budget justification argued that federally funded hiring program for firefighters risks replacing state and local funding for general purpose public safety staffing with federal resources and therefore does not forward the common goal of enhancing national preparedness capabilities for fy2009 the senate appropriations committee approved 190 million for safer grants while the house appropriations committee approved 230 million the consolidated security disaster assistance and continuing appropriations act 2009 pl

the safer program should be funded the administration has consistently requested funding for safer arguing that localities should be solely responsible for funding firefighting personnel fire service

background and genesis of safer firefighting and the provision of fire protection services to the public is traditionally local responsibility funded primarily by state county and municipal governments during the 1990s however shortfalls in state and local budgets coupled with increased responsibilities ie counterterrorism of local fire departments led many in the fire community to call for additional financial support from the federal government since enactment of the fire act1 in the 106th congress the assistance to firefighters grants program also known as fire grants and fire act grants has provided funding for equipment and training directly from the federal government to local fire departments2 since the fire grant program commenced in fy2001 funding has been used by fire departments to purchase firefighting equipment personal protective equipment and firefighting vehicles many in the fire service community argued that notwithstanding the fire grant program there remained pressing need for an additional federal grant program to assist fire departments in the hiring of firefighters and the recruitment and retention of volunteer firefighters they asserted that without federal assistance many local fire departments would continue to be unable to meet national consensus standards for minimum staffing levels which specify at least four firefighters per responding fire vehicle or five or six firefighters in hazardous or high risk areas3 fire service advocates also pointed to the community 1 title xvii of the fy2001 national defense authorization act

fire administration and the national fire protection association11 the boston globe12 and the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh13 which conclude that many fire departments fall below minimum standards for personnel levels according to these studies the result of this shortfall can lead to inadequate response to different types of emergency incidents substandard response times and an increased risk of firefighter fatalities those opposed to safer grants contend that funding for basic local government functions such as paying for firefighter salaries should not be assumed by the federal government particularly at time of high budget deficits also some safer opponents disagree that belowstandard levels in firefighting personnel is necessarily problematic and point to statistics indicating that the number of structural fires in the united states has continued to decline over the past twenty years14 another ongoing issue has been the administration and organizational positioning of safer and fire grants within the department of homeland security legislation considered in the 109th congress sought to restructure fema within dhs with the result that fire and safer grant programs would be transferred back to fema ultimately title vi of the conference agreement on the dhs appropriations bill pl 109295 hrept 109699 the post katrina emergency
