in energy policy resources science and industry division john blodgett specialist in environmental policy resources science and industry division air quality multipollutant legislation in the 110th congress summary with the prospect of new layers of complexity being added to air pollution controls and with electricity restructuring putting premium on economic efficiency interest is being expressed in finding mechanisms to achieve health and environmental goals in simpler more costeffective ways the electric utility industry is major source of air pollution particularly sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxides nox and mercury hg as well as unregulated greenhouse gases particularly carbon dioxide co2 at issue is whether new approach to environmental protection could achieve the nations air quality goals more cost effectively than the current system one approach being proposed is multipollutant strategy framework based on consistent set of emissions caps implemented through emissions trading just how the proposed approach would fit with the current and proposed diverse regulatory regimes remains to be worked out they might be replaced to the greatest extent feasible or they might be overlaid by the framework of emissions caps in february 2002 the bush administration announced two air quality initiatives the first clear skies would amend the clean air act to place emission caps on electric utility emissions of so2 nox and hg implemented through tradeable allowance program the emissions caps would generally be imposed in two phases 2008 and 2018 clear skies was reintroduced in the 109th congress as s 131 the second initiative begins voluntary greenhouse gas reduction program this plan rather than capping co2 emissions focuses on improving the carbon efficiency of the economy reducing 2002 emissions of 183 metric tons per million dollars of gdp to 151 metric tons per million dollars of gdp in 2012 in the 110th congress five bills have been introduced that would impose multi pollutant controls on utilities they are all fourpollutant proposals that include carbon dioxide s 1168 and s 1177 are revised versions of s 2724 introduced in the 109th congress s 1201 and s 1554 are expanded and revised versions of s 150 introduced in the 109th congress while hr 3989 is new proposal all of these bills involve some form of emission caps beginning in the 20092012 time frame with all but s 1554 including second phase in 20132015 co2 only for hr 3989 they would employ tradeable credit program to implement the so2 nox and co2 caps all but hr 3989 permit plantwide averaging in complying with the hg requirements the provisions concerning so2 nox and hg in the 110th congress bills are generally more stringent than the comparable provisions of s 131 of the 109th congress it is difficult to compare the co2 caps contained in these bills with the administrations proposal concerning co2 both because the administrations proposal is voluntary rather than mandatory and because it is broader covering all greenhouse gas emissions rather than just utility co2 emissions contents introduction 1 the bush administrations proposals 2 proposed legislation and legislative

facilities are major source of air pollution the combustion of fossil fuels petroleum natural gas and coal which accounts for about twothirds of us electricity generation results in the emission of stream of gases these gases include several pollutants that directly pose risks to human health and welfare including particulate matter pm1 sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxides nox and mercury hg particulate matter so2 and nox are currently regulated under the clean air act caa and the environmental protection agency epa has promulgated rules to regulate mercury beginning in 2010 other gases may pose indirect risks notably carbon dioxide co2 which contributes to global warming2 table 1 provides estimates of so2 nox and co2 emissions from electric generating facilities annual emissions of hg from utility facilities are more uncertain current estimates indicate about 48 tons utilities are subject to an array of environmental regulations which affect in different ways both the cost of operating existing generating facilities and the cost of constructing new ones table 1 emissions from us fossilfuel electric generating plants thousands of metric tons emissions 2000 2001 2002 2003

from combinedheatandpower plants the evolution of air pollution controls over time and as result of growing scientific understanding of health and environmental impacts has led to 1 particulate matter is regulated depending on the particle size current regulations address particles less than 10 microns in diameter pm10 the epa has promulgated regulations for particles less than 25 microns in diameter pm25 that are in the process of being implemented so2 and nox emissions would be affected by regulations of pm25 2 in addition steamelectric utilities produce minor amounts of volatile organic compounds vocs carbon monoxide co and lead on the order of 2 or less of all sources crs2 multilayered and interlocking patchwork of controls moreover additional controls are in the process of development particularly with respect to nox as precursor to ozone to both nox and so2 as contributors to pm25 and to hg as toxic air pollutant also under the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc the united states agreed to voluntary limits on co2 emissions the current bush administration has rejected the kyoto protocol which would impose mandatory limits in favor of voluntary reduction program in contrast to the administrations position in june 2005 the senate passed sense of the senate calling for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases that would be designed not to impose significant harm on the economy3 for many years the complexity of the air quality control regime has caused some observers to call for simplified approach now with the potential both for additional control programs on so2 and nox and for new controls directed at hg and co2 intersecting with the technological and policy changes affecting the electric utility industry such calls for simplification have become more numerous and insistent one focus of this effort is the multipollutant or fourpollutant approach this approach involves mix of regulatory and economic mechanisms that would apply to utility emissions of up to four pollutants in various proposals so2 nox hg and co2 the objective would be to balance the environmental goal of effective controls across the pollutants covered with the industry goal of stable regulatory regime for period of years the bush administrations proposals in february 2002 the bush administration announced two air quality proposals to address the control of emissions of so2 nox hg and co24 the first proposal called clear skies would amend the clean air act to place emission caps on electric utility emissions of so2 nox and hg implemented through tradeable allowance program the emissions caps would be imposed in two phases 2010 2008 in the case of nox and 2018 as part of complete rewrite of title iv of the clean air act the administrations proposal was introduced in the 108th congress as hr 999 and s 485 revised versions of clear skies legislation were introduced in the 109th congress as hr 227 and s 1315 the proposal has not been reintroduced in the 110th congress 3 samdt 866 to hr 6 the energy policy act of 2005 june 22 2005 4 papers outlining the administrations proposals are available from the white house website httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200202clearskieshtml for the three pollutant proposal and httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200202climatechange html for the climate change initiative 5 for further discussion of the administrations clear skies proposal see crs report rl32782 clear skies and the clean air act whats the difference by larry parker and james mccarthy and crs report rl33165 cost and benefits of clear skies epas analysis of multipollutant clean air bills by james mccarthy and larry b parker although hr 227 adopted the so2 and nox emission caps of the administrations clear skies proposal it did not include many other provisions including regulatory changes crs3 the second administration proposal initiates new voluntary greenhouse gas reduction program similar to ones introduced by the earlier george h w bush and clinton administrations6 developed in response to the us ratification of the 1992 unfccc these previous plans projected us compliance or near compliance with the unfccc goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at their 1990 levels by the year 2000 through voluntary measures the bush administration proposal does not make that claim projecting only 100 million metric ton reduction in emissions from what would occur otherwise in the year 2012 total emissions would continue to rise instead the plan focuses on improving the carbon efficiency of the economy reducing 2002 emissions of 183 metric tons per million dollars of gdp to 151 metric tons per million dollars of gdp in 2012 it proposes several voluntary initiatives along with increased spending and tax incentives to achieve this goal the administration notes that the new initiatives would achieve about onequarter of the objective while threequarters of the projected reduction is seen as occurring through existing efforts proposed legislation and legislative action in the 110th congress in the 110th congress five bills have been introduced that would impose multi pollutant controls on utilities they are all fourpollutant proposals that include carbon dioxide s 1168 introduced by senator alexander and s 1177 introduced by senator carper are revised versions of s 2724 introduced in the 109th congress s 1201 introduced by senator sanders and s 1554 introduced by senator collins are similar but revised versions of s 150 introduced in the 109th congress7 in contrast hr 3989 introduced by representative mchugh represents new proposal all of these bills involve some form of emission caps beginning in 2009 2012 time frame s 1168 s 1177 and s 1201 include second phase beginning in 20132015 hr 3989 includes multiphase program for co2 only they would employ tradeable credit program to implement the so2 nox and co2 caps while all but hr 3989 permit plantwide averaging in complying with the hg requirements the provisions concerning so2 nox and hg in the five bills are generally more stringent than the comparable provisions of s 131 of the 109th congress it is difficult to compare the co2 caps contained in these bills with the administrations proposal concerning co2 both because the administrations proposal is voluntary rather than mandatory and because it is broader covering all greenhouse gas emissions rather than just utility co2 emissions the five bills are summarized in the appendix each of these bills generally builds on the so2 allowance trading scheme contained in title iv of the 1990 clean 6 for discussion of those previous plans see crs report 94404 climate change action plans by larry parker and john blodgett out of print available from the authors 7 besides its multipollutant control provisions for electric utilities s 1544 contains separate titles on transportation fuel efficiency renewable fuels elimination of certain tax provisions for the oil industry and research on abrupt climate change crs4 air act amendments caaa8 under this program utilities are given specific allocation of permitted emissions allowances and may choose to use those allowances at their own facilities or if they do not use their full quota to bank them for future use or to sell them to other utilities needing additional allowances allowance allocations for so2 nox and co2 all five bills introduced in the 110th congress provide for tradeable allowance scheme to implement their emission caps on so2 nox and co2 however allowance allocation schemes in the bills differ with s 1201 and s 1554 containing detailed provisions for allocating so2 nox and co2 allowances to various economic sectors and interests in most cases these interests or their trustees in the case of households and dislocated workers and communities would auction off or otherwise sell their allowances to the affected utilities and use the collected funds for their own purposes in addition s 1201 requires the increasing use of auctions mandating 100 of the annual allowance allocation be auctioned within 15 years of enactment in contrast s 1168 bases its allowance formulas on fuel usage adjusted by factors specified in the bill along with requirement that 25 of the allowances be auctioned s 1177 specifies co2 and nox limitations based on electricity output and so2 limitations based on the current title iv program the bill sets schedule for increasing the percentage of the annual allowance allocation that is to be auctioned with 100 required in 2036 and thereafter finally hr 3989 auctions 100 of its co2 allowances while providing discretion to epa to allocate so2 and nox allowances hg controls on mercury all five bills focus on achieving 90 reduction by 2011 s 1554 and hr 3989 2013 s 1201 or 2015 s 1168 and s 1177 in contrast the emissions goal of s 131 of the 109th congress would have allowed about three times more emissions and three to five more years for compliance in addition all but hr 3989 restrict hg credit trading to plantwide averaging of emissions in contrast with the capandtrade program of s 131 hr 3989 is even more stringent imposing the emissions rate limitation on unitbyunit basis co2 reduction requirements the bills currently introduced in the 110th congress specify co2 reductions in contrast the administrations co2 proposal relies on various voluntary programs and incentives to encourage reductions in greenhouse gases from diverse sources including co2 emissions from electric generation these voluntary reductions should not be taken as given as neither the george h w bush administrations nor the 8 pl 101549 crs5 clinton administrations voluntary programs achieved their stated goals thus in one sense comparing mandatory reduction program such as that proposed by s 1168 s 1177 s 1201 and s 1554 with the administrations voluntary program is comparing apples to oranges the first is legally binding the second has been criticized as merely an exhortation the co2 reduction requirements of s 1168 s 1201 and s 1554 are similar except that s 1201 and s 1554 requires affected sources also offset co2 emissions from small electric generating units in contrast s 1177 imposes cap that starts out slightly higher than the other two bills and declines on slower schedule finally hr 3989 has the most detailed reduction scheme with substantial reductions from coalfired facilities scheduled through 2050 all but hr 3989 have provisions to create offsets and facilitate sequestration efforts among its titles s 1168 has extensive provisions providing for greenhouse gas offsets from landfill methane ch4 sulfur hexafluoride sf6 projects afforestation or reforestation energy efficiency agricultural practices manure management and biomass the provisions in s 1177 include allowance allocations for incremental nuclear capacity clean coal technology and renewable energy along with programs to encourage sequestration likewise s 1554 includes allowance allocations to encourage renewable energy energy efficiency and sequestration finally s 1201 requires the epa to develop standards for providing allowances for geologic and biological sequestration related regulatory provisions in addition to emissions caps s 131 of the 109th congress would have substantially modified or eliminated several provisions in the clean air act with respect to electric generating facilities the bill would have eliminated new source performance standards nsps section 111 and replaced them with statutory standards for so2 nox particulate matter and hg for new sources modified sources could have also opted to comply with these new statutory standards and be exempted from the applicable best available control technology bact determinations under prevention of significant deterioration psd provisions caa part c or lowest achievable emissions rate laer determinations

technology bart requirements maximum achievable control technology mact requirements for hg and non attainment laer and offset requirements the exemption would not have applied to psdbact requirements if facilities were within 50 km of psd class 1 area existing sources could have also received these exemptions if they agreed to meet particulate matter standard specified in the bill along with good combustion practices to minimize carbon monoxide emissions within three years of enactment in addition s 131 would have provided these exemptions for industrial sources that choose to opt into the clear skies program s 131 also would have included an exemption for steam electric generating facilities from hg regulation under section 112 of the caa including the residual risk provisions and relief from enforcement of any section 126 petition with respect to reducing interstate transportation of pollution before december 31 2014 crs6 the five bills in the 110th congress generally omit the regulatory changes of s 131 while introducing new provisions all five bills would revise the current new source review nsr program to require affected electric generating units 40 years or older 30 years old in the case of hr 3989 to meet more stringent so2 and nox performance standard by either 2015 s 1201 2016 s 1554 2020 s 1168 and s 1177 or five years after enactment hr 3989 all except s 1554 and hr 3989 contain provisions establishing new performance standard for co2 s 1168 and s 1177 would also eliminate the annual nox and so2 caps contained in the recently promulgated clean air interstate rule cair in addition to the above s 1201 and s 1554 would create several new regulatory programs and standards including an efficiency performance standard and renewable portfolio standard
