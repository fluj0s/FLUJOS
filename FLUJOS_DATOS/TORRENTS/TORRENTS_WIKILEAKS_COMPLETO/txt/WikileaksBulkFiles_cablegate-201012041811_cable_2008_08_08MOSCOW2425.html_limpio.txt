classified by acting deputy chief of mission alice g wells for reason 14d 1 summary xxxxx reported the results xxxxx in recent meeting with poloff while medvedev dominated russian programming on four of five surveyed stations his appearances were disproportionately ceremonial in contrast to putins hands on control of the russian government the virtual absence of airtime provided to most opposition parties continued to slow an already weak opposition and experience and intuition told xxxxx that his study would fall on deaf ears prediction already supported by the empty auditorium at his press conference hours before our meeting russian communist party kprf leader gennadiy zuganov publicly and privately praised xxxxx for his research as boost to kprf calls for greater press freedom medvedevs sagging standing in the polls despite lavish tv coverage is one indication of his difficulty in coming out from putins shadow end summary medvedev main headliner but putin top dog 2 c on august 4 xxxxx told poloff that while medvedev received twice as much press coverage as putin during the testing period most of his meetings were largely ceremonial while putins onair performances continued to give the impression that he held the reins of power xxxxx unabashedly called medvedev one in russian politics claiming he was nothing more than pen in ones pocket or glass on the table as he raised pen and glass from his desk medvedev continued to attract interest with his anticorruption campaign but putin still called the shots that mattered 3 c an august 7 poll from levada center indicated only 9 of russians believe medvedev controlled russias direction while 36 believed putin remained in sole power and almost 50 saw tandem presidency related levada center poll from july 1822 showed that 82 of russians believed to some degree that medvedev merely continued putins policies while only 11 saw medvedev gradually changing the countrys political course leading pollsters tended to agree with survey results xxxxx hinted to poloff on august 6 that russians would probably see medvedev as even less in control after putins recent mechel comments and subsequent stock market scare xxxxx told poloff on august 8 that the thenemerging conflict in south ossetia clearly painted putin as the countrys leader study results winners won losers lost 4 sbu xxxxx detailed the results of his recent research project on propaganda in the press done in conjunction with memo 98 media monitoring the project tracked primetime press coverage of major political figures and government departments from june 520 on three governmentrun television stations channel one tv rossiya and tv center and two privatelyowned channels ntv and ren tv xxxxx ascribed positive neutral or negative connotation to each news item then calculated the total amount of time devoted to each person or group 5 sbu the study revealed that all channels except for ren tv dedicated disproportionate amount of airtime to positive or neutral coverage of incumbent politicians and cabinet members rarely casting them in negative light ren tv however distributed airtime more evenly to greater number of political parties and levied negative commentary against the federal security service fsb and the vladimir zhirinovskiyled liberal democratic party of russia ldpr most of ren tvs remaining coverage was neutral and biased stations devoted remaining airtime to less important government figures including duma speaker and chairman of the high council of united russia party boris gryzlov first deputy prime minister igor shuvalov russian minister for emergency situations sergei shoigu vice premier and finance minister alexei kudrin regional development minister dmitriy kozak and economic development ministry chief elvira naibullina xxxxx produced the following results channel one 169 market share formerly ort statecontrolled network medvedev 489 putin 229 united russia 61 russian deputy premier sergei

6 c xxxxx showed poloff letter from zuganov that lavished praise on xxxxx his outstanding contribution to political reform in russia xxxxx then recalled to poloff that zuganov approached him at the embassy independence day celebration at spaso house joyously thanked him in front of numerous witnesses hugged him and named xxxxx friend of the communist party xxxxx retorted to zuganov saying i did not do this research for you i did it for my countrys future xxxxx shuddered as he relayed the story sheepishly noting that his grandfather and father would turn in their graves had they heard he had helped the communists note xxxxx grandfather was shot and killed by communists and his father spent time in the gulag 7 u on july 14 the communist party presented the results of the june 2008 center for research of russian political cultures complementary study on press freedom and propaganda as it pertained to the kprf zuganov noted that the study found 45 of all kprf references to be decidedly negative and only 14 decidedly favorable the russian channel tvt provided the most negative coverage while ntv projected the kprf most favorably considering xxxxx however ntv only dedicated about 1 of its programming to the kprf therefore its resonance with and impact on the public remained minimal despite its positive tone opposition hamstrung by press bias 8 c xxxxx said data supported the opposition claim that they received less governmentcontrolled airtime but didnt address the gor countercharge that the classic liberal opposition is doing little to generate news xxxxx agreed charging that russians feed from the same information trough xxxxx attributed much of the blame for the stagnation of russias political opposition to lack of leadership however he claimed the lack of unbiased press coverage reinforced the russian populations unwavering support of the current leadership press research lacks public influence 9 c xxxxx bemoaned the fact that one showed up to the august 4 press conference at the house of journalists organized to discuss the results of his research note poloff was the only attendee present while he admitted that both he and the organizers did poor job of informing the press and publicizing the event he felt that the publics general ennui about press freedom contributed to the lack of attendance when asked about the projected influence of his research xxxxx told poloff that he hoped organizations such as the and osce would utilize his analysis to advocate for greater political transparency in russia conversely he claimed the largest influence of his organization sprung from its relations with foreign journalists at the washington post monde and other western papers while his center operated quietly trying not to attract attention it cooperated with foreign journalists by supplying opinions and information for more scathing articles xxxxx told poloff with obvious delight when western press articles have infuriated kremlin officials in the past xxxxx comment 10 c xxxxx data strikingly demonstrates that despite medevedevs lavish courage in the media he has yet to come out from putins shadow and create political identity that resonates with russian viewers beyrle
