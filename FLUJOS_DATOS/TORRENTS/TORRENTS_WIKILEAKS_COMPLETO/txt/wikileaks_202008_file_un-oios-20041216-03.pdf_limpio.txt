endorsed the cheq ues and subsequently deposited the same in his bank account s vi evidence findings of facts 47 the issues to be addressed in this case are thr eefold firstly whether or not the staff member fraudulent ly created ten false cheques and subsequently presented them f or payments to the retired staff member and received cash 13 48 interviews with witnesses and documentary evide nce obtained in the course of the investigation disclosed that t he staff member on 23 august 2003 which was saturday pri nted ten duplicate cheques he used the user id allocated t him by it to print the cheques in question this was confirm ed by mr tsadik of it who had assigned the staff member the user id chqaa__1 that reflected that the computer user on that day was him and that the same code appeared in relation to the printing of the ten cheques in question according to mr t sadik the staff member also accessed imis that day thereby iminating the possibility that someone else used the staff member s user id code 49 further on being questioned by mr indieka hi s supervisor in the presence of his cash office coll eagues the staff member did not deny that he was in the office on the material day saturday 23 august 2003 he did not deny that he printed other cheques that day besides the ten in q uestion whose signature sheets were available signature sheets that were missing for that day were only for the ten forged c heques after printing the cheques evidence has been adduc ed that the staff member sold the cheques to the retired staff member at face value less 3 discount 50 upon realizing that the fraud had been discovered w hile on leave the staff member went to the us embassy in ddis ababa and applied for us visa request that was turn ed down due to his financial status interviews with his wife indicated that he later traveled to nairobi where he purporte dly obtained us visa the us mission in nairobi when contacte d stated that the subject was not issued with visa although h is current location could not be ascertained by oios eca staf f have indicated that there have been sightings of him in addis ababa ethiopia and that in fact he may not be in the us s he and his wife claim 51 the second issue is whether or not the retired staff member knew the ten cheques to be fraudulent and therefore committed fraud on the banks by presenting ten cheques to tw banks which he knew to be fraudulent and whether or not the ret ired staff member and the staff member were in conspiracy at any time during the fraud 52 during interviews with oios the retired staff m ember admitted purchasing the said cheques from the staff member the retired staff member then without the knowledge or authority of 14 the payees named on the forged cheques endorsed the cheques to facilitate them being honoured by the bank this ndorsement was suspect since the retired staff member admitted being familiar with the signatures of some of the payees as for example mr olokodana whom he said that he had wor ked with at eca for long time 53 when it was pointed out to him that he was fami liar with mr olokodanas signature and yet he accepted mr lokodanas cheque with different signature which was forg ery his response was that he had never seen stolen cheque and that he believed in eca people whom he had worked with for long time 54 during interviews with the investigators the r etired staff member said that he was aware that payees have to ndorse their signatures on the reverse side of each cheque but in this case he did endorse the cheques without the author ity of the payees all the cheques in question were deposited in the retired staff members bank accounts as confirmed b the bank officials at the time of depositing the cheques the retired staff member explained to the bank officials that ll cheques had been endorsed by the payeeswhich he knew was n ot true 55 the third issue is whether or not the evidence shows that criminal offences or ten of them were committed i n both ethiopia and the usa 56 forgery has been defined as the making of fal document with intent to deceive or defraud the evidence of this case reveals the fraudulent printing of ten cheques and converting the same for cash for personal use by the staff mem ber and the retired staff member the retired staff member fac ilitated the fraud he purchased the cheques from the staff mem ber at discount before banking the cheques in his bank ccounts the retired staff member endorsed the cheques without t he knowledge and authority of the payees some of whom he knew but advised the banks that the payees had endorsed the cheques 57 in 1997 before retiring from the organization the retired staff member was involved in similar fraud in c oncert with another retired staff member they forged four cheq ues and defrauded the organization of 3026378 58 further there is evidence that suggests that t he staff member planned his fraud with some degree of ease b ecause he could easily exercise his intention to defraud the organization by exploiting the systems weaknesses for example the 15 principle of separation of functions in cheque rea ctivation was lacking this allowed for the cheque reactivation facility to be abused by the subject because he had the sole authority to print cheques without involving either the certifyi ng or approving officer in addition bank reconciliatio n which is supposed to be conducted on monthly basis was not up to date and number of items were outstanding for over one year vii conclusions 59 the evidence adduced in this investigation indi cates that the allegations reported in this matter have been s ubstantiated as indicated above the subject the staff member fr audulently obtained total of 179365 from the organisation by printing duplicate cheques 60 the fraud was facilitated by the retired staff member who purchased the forged cheques endorsed them and eve ntually deposited the cheques into his local bank accounts that were used as conduit to cash the forged cheques viii recommendations recommendation 1 since the staff member and the retired staff member have separated from the organization it is recommended that consideration should be given to referring the case to the relevant law enforcement authorities for criminal p rosecution in making this recommendation oios strongly sugges ts that eca reverts to the investigations division of oios to t ake advice on how to proceed with criminal jurisdiction id rec iv0355301 recommendation 2 to safeguard against future frauds it is recommend ed that in addition to stamping disbursement vouchers and supp orting documents paid after payment is effected the sai d documents including the relevant cheque should be perforated paid id rec iv0355302 16 recommendation 3 currently paid cheques disbursement vouchers and supporting documents are kept in filing cabinets and on shelve s that are accessible to the filing clerk and all staff member s working in the finance section it is therefore recommended t hat paid cheques disbursement vouchers and supporting docum ents are kept in secure restricted area id rec iv03553 03 recommendation 4 it is recommended that the principle of separation of functions in cheque reactivation in finance be given full fo rce and effect by written procedures consistent with the fi nancial rules of the united nations cheques should only be rea ctivated with the authority of either the certifying or approving officer id rec iv0355304 recommendation 5 it is further recommended that bank reconciliations be conducted on regular basis as provided for in the financial rules of the united nations id rec iv0355305 recommendation 6 it is also recommended that eca reports all cases t the investigations division which they suspect may inv olve fraud andor forgery by staff members or retired staff mbers id rec iv0355306
