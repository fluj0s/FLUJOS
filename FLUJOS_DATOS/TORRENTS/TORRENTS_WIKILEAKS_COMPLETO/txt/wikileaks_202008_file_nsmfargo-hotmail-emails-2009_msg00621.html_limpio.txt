the official daily newspaper of the mike church show hour 1 once again healthcare was the big news of the day though not for the reason you might think as tension over obamacare continues to boil at town hall events across the country shrieker of the house nancy nazi pelosi and house majority leader steny boy hoyer are decrying any argument over the takeover as unamerican in an oped piece that appeared in todays online edition of usa today these two chuckleheads continue to be dismissive of the citizenry that demands to be heard after all when our elected officials continue to ignore the wants and needs of the people they represent what are we supposed to do do they really think that if they ignore us long enough well give up and go away apparently so but that was certainly the sentiment as mike opened the show you can read and listen to what he had to say on the subject here what president obama and congressional leaders seem to be missing is that the more people learn about their planned takeover of healthcare the more they dont want anything to do with it and matter what poll you look at its clearly not partisan problem public opinion on the issue is complex in ways that defy an easy republicandemocratic divide analysis of recent usa todaygallup poll finds views on what priority to emphasize how fast to act and whats important to protect vary and sometimes conflict depending on persons age and region of the country whether he or she has insurance and is healthy or ailing seniors are by far the most resistant to the idea of changing the current system an opening for opponents who have focused on proposed cuts in medicare spending and accusations about planning for endoflife care the idea of controlling insurance costs has broader support overall than expanding coverage for the uninsured which has prompted the white house to stop describing its goal as healthcare reform and begin calling it insurance reform still the usa todaygallup poll shows significant differences on what the key goal of health care overhaul should be twothirds of blacks and six in 10 hispanics say it should be expanding coverage to the uninsured but six in 10 whites say controlling costs is more important the bottom line the government had business running the healthcare system senate republican leader mitch mcconnell on fox news sunday this weekend accused democrats of trying to demonize citizens who are energetic about this think up next mike covered piece posted on powerlineblogcom which examines the state of things in cuba after years of the glorious socialism maobama is marching us towards how bad is it aside from what marxist twits like filmmaker michael moore might have you believe over the course of these last fifty years cubas economy has regressed to the point where its government is now encouraging farmers to plow with oxen but not just any old oxen governmentowned oxen why is that problem cuba gets 100000 barrels of oil day from venezuela for free but still cant afford to run its small supply of tractors which are also governmentowned one woman 52yearold zenaida leon admitted that she doesnt have such huge problem with the government controlling thingsexactly i am thankful for the revolution she said but we dont get boots tools irrigation that works socialism is the most destructive system of organization ever devised by mankind and as the author of the piece writes why would we even consider turning our health care system over to its discredited principles good question as for healthcare specific arguments many people have said that they wouldnt make their dog live with socialized medicine as it turns out if youre pooch things arent so bad in todays wall street journal theodore dalrymple british doctor compares human health care which is socialized with veterinary health care which is free market in great britain dalrymple offers in the last few years i have had the opportunity to compare the human and veterinary health services of great britain and on the whole it is better to be dog you can find the rest of the piece here in todays pile prep staying on the health tip mike also dissected the hotly debated section 1233 of the healthcare bill drafted in the democraticled house which would pay doctors to give medicare patients endoflife counseling every five years or sooner if the patient gets terminal diagnosis as charles lane of the washington post reports section 1233 is not as innocuous as its proponents might have you believe until now federal law has encouraged endoflife planning gently in 1990 congress required healthcare institutions not individual doctors to give new patients written notice of their rights to make living wills advance directives and the like but also required them to treat patients regardless of whether they have such document whats different section 1233 addresses compassionate goals in disconcerting proximity to fiscal ones supporters protest that theyre just trying to facilitate choice even if patients opt for expensive lifeprolonging care lane notes if its all about obviating suffering emotional or physical whats it doing in measure to bend the curve on healthcare costs though not mandatory as some on have claimed rep sander m levin dmi asserts the consultations envisioned in section 1233 arent quite purely voluntary to most of us purely voluntary means not unless the patient requests one section 1233 however lets doctors initiate the chat and gives them an incentive money to do so in my book thats an incentive to insist mike closed the hour with story which reveals when medicare will go broke oh wait when it did go broke whats that you say indeed as gary north has revealed medicare actually went broke last year and adds one noticed read the rest of the story here mikes tao of the hour what people are forgetting about medicare is that 83 trillion dollars is about to become due and payable where do think that money is going to come

our favorite economists thomas woods you can always find out more about him at wwwtomwoodscom but if theres ever anything big going on in the news youre likely to find him chatting with mike on the show for today the topics ranged from our countrys economic freefall to the governments continued attack on our healthcare system as an american you help people out with your talent said woods the money is not there for the government to pay for it woods went on to say that the government is great at destroying things and pointed out that maobamas actions are unprecedented and added there is way the people in office can think more debt is the solution to debt problem of course the guys touched on the protests that have been plastered across the headlines woods offered if you look back in history the past protests have been much more violent than what weve seen in the town halls want to check out our transcript of the interview of course you do so go read it here mikes tao of the hour you dont have freedom once the government intervenes with things like health insurance if this keeps up well become backwater burg if you dont understand what our future will be under obamacare go watch logans run youll get really good idea what theyre doing is just sinister mike wrapped the hour with lots of phone calls among them steven from maryland who called to talk about the governments promise that they can take care of everyone in much better fashion than people can take care of themselves mike explained the concept is pretty simple if youre outside restaurant that seats 100 people and you have food for them what if you let 200 people in everyone gets less we also got call from dude1265 from indiana who agrees with mike that the only way to fix our current problems is to starve the government and then there was mike from mississippi who had really great idea about why maobama is going for broke over healthcare he offered the government pushing this universal healthcare on

clinton was speaking out against the bush administration and the war policy relive the magic here and while you do ponder why it was okay for elected officials to argue with other elected officials
