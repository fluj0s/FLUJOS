gavin schmidt gschmidtgissnasagov steven sherwood stevensherwoodyaleedu frank wentz frankwentzremsscom thanks ben for this hi all and happy new year i had similar experiencebut not foia since we at climatic change are private institutionwith stephen mcintyre demanding that i have the mann et cohort publish all their computer codes for papers published in climatic change i put the question to the editorial board who debated it for weeks the vast majority opinion was that scientists should give enough information on their data sources and methods so others who are scientifically capable can do their own brand of replication work but that this does not extend to personal computer codes with all their undocumented sub routines etc it would be odious requirement to have scientists document every line of code so outsiders could then just apply them instantly not only is this an intellectual property issue but it would dramatically reduce our productivity since we are not in the business of producing software products for general consumption and have resources to do so the nsf which funded the studies i published concurredso that ended that issue with climatic change at the time few years ago this continuing pattern of harassment as ben rightly puts it in my opinion in the name of due diligence is in my view an attempt to create fishing expedition to find minor glitches or unexplained bits of codewhich exist in nearly all our kinds of complex workand then assert that the entire result is thus suspect our best way to deal with this issue of replication is to have multiple independent author teams with their own codes and data sets publishing independent work on the same topicslike has been done on the hockey stick that is how credible scientific replication should proceed let the lawyers figure this out but be sure that like ben is doing now you disclose the maximum reasonable amount of information so competent scientists can do replication work but short of publishing undocumented personalized codes etc the end of the email ben attached shows their intentto discredit papers so they have evidentiary value in public policywhat you resort to when you cant win the intellectual battle scientifically at ipcc or nas good luck with this and expect more of it as we get closer to international climate policy actions we are witnessing the contrarian battle of the bulge now and expect that all weapons will be used cheers steve ps please do not copy or forward this email stephen h schneider melvin and joan lane professor for interdisciplinary

request dear coauthors of the santer et international journal of climatology paper and other interested parties i am forwarding an email i received this morning from mr geoff smith the email concerns the climate model data used in our recentlypublished international journal of climatology ijoc paper mr smith has requested that i provide him with these climate model datasets this request has been made to dr anna palmisano at doe headquarters and to dr george miller the director of lawrence livermore national laboratory i have spent the last two months of my scientific career dealing with multiple requests for these model datasets under the us freedom of information act foia i have been able to do little or productive research during this time this is of deep concern to from the beginning my position on this matter has been clear and consistent the primary climate model data used in our ijoc paper are part of the socalled cmip3 coupled model intercomparison project archive at llnl and are freely available to any scientific researcher the primary observational satellite and radiosonde datasets used in our ijoc paper are also freely available the algorithms used for calculating synthetic microwave sounding unit msu temperatures from climate model data to facilitate comparison with actual satellite temperatures have been documented in several peerreviewed publications the bottom line is that any interested scientist has all the scientific information necessary to replicate the calculations performed in our ijoc paper and to check whether the conclusions reached in that paper were sound neither mr smith nor mr stephen mcintyre mr mcintyre is the initiator of the foia requests to the us doe and noaa and the operator of the climateauditcom blog is interested in full replication of our calculations starting from the primary climate model and observational data instead they are demanding the valueadded quantities we have derived from the primary datasets ie the synthetic msu temperatures i would like clear ruling from doe lawyers ideally from both the nnsa and doe office of science branches on the legality of such data requests they are troubling for number of reasons 1 in my considered opinion very dangerous precedent is set if any derived quantity that we have calculated from primary data is subject to foia requests at llnls program for climate model diagnosis and intercomparison pcmdi we have devoted years of effort to the calculation of derived quantities from climate model output these derived quantities include synthetic msu temperatures ocean heat content changes and socalled cloud simulator products suitable for comparison with actual satellitebased estimates of cloud type altitude and frequency the intellectual investment in such calculations is substantial 2 mr smith asserts that there is valid intellectual property justification for withholding this data i believe this argument is incorrect the synthetic msu temperatures used in our ijoc paper and the other examples of derived datasets mentioned above are integral components of both pcmdis ongoing research and of proposals we have submitted to funding agencies doe noaa and nasa can any competitor simply request such datasets via the us foia before we have completed full scientific analysis of these datasets 3 there is real danger that such foia requests could and are already being used as tool for harassing scientists rather than for valid scientific discovery mr mcintyres foia requests to doe and noaa are but the latest in series of such requests in the past mr mcintyre has targeted scientists at penn state university the uk climatic research unit and the national climatic data center in asheville now he is focusing his attention on the common denominator is that mr mcintyres attention is directed towards studies claiming to show evidence of largescale surface warming andor prominent human fingerprint in that warming these serial foia requests interfere with our ability to do our job mr smiths email mentions the royal meteorological societys data archiving policies the royal meteorological society are the publishers of the international journal of climatology recently prof glenn mcgregor the chief editor of the ijoc provided mr mcintyre with the following clarification in response to your question about data policy my position as chief editor is that the above paper has been subject to strict peer review supporting information has been provided by the authors in good faith which is accessible online attached fyi and the original data from which temperature trends were calculated are freely available it is not the policy of the international journal of climatology to require that data sets used in analyses be made available as condition of publication as many of you may know i have decided to publicly release the synthetic msu temperatures that were the subject of mr mcintyres foia request together with additional synthetic msu temperatures which were not requested by mr mcintyre these datasets have been through internal review and release procedures and will be published shortly on pcmdis website together with technical document which describes how synthetic msu temperatures were calculated i agreed to this publication process primarily because i want to spend the next few years of my career doing research i have desire to be taken out as scientist and to be involved in years of litigation the public release of the msu data used in our ijoc paper may or may not resolve these problems if mr mcintyres past performance is guide to the future further foia requests will follow i would like to know that i have the full support of llnl management and the us dept of energy in dealing with these unwarranted and intrusive requests i do not intend to reply to mr smiths email sincerely ben santer benjamin d santer program for climate model diagnosis and
