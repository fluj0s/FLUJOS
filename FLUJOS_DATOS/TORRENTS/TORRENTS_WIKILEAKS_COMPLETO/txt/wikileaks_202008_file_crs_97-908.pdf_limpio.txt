the countrys high defense requirements chronic trade deficits and political economy it can bedescribed as distinctive or unique since 1948 the economy has expe rienced three different stages of development the first 19481972 and third stages 19891995 were classic boom periods fueled primarily by rapid increases in the stock of labor the second stage 19731988 was characterized by considerable economic instability and turmoil the israeli economy currently may be entering fourth stage where concerns once again are being raised about stability and performance the increase and size of the current account deficit 48 of gdp in 1996 combined with an overvalued exchange rate are matters of particular c oncern because they can be precursors to financial crisis this is situation of special concern to israel because it alreadyimports large amount of capital to finance its deficit and there is certainty thatsources of funding at reasonable cost will continue indefinitely these economic problems have been fueled by an expansionary fiscal policy and relatively restrictive monetary policy in order to promote economic stabilitymost economists agree that israel needs to pursue less expansionary fiscal policy mainly by cutting nonproductive government expenditures this in turn wouldallow central bank authorities leeway to run less restrictiv monetary policy without jeopardizing other macroeconomic objectives reduction of the high degree of govern ment intervention in economic activity also could help israel promote economic growth and macroeconomic stabilitythrough more efficient use of the countrys resources given the likelihood of aslower growing labor force productivity increases brought about by structuralreforms may become even more critical in the future however progress has been gradual in reducing the governments role in owning and running enterprises as well as reforming capital and labor markets progr ess has been more rapid in liberalizing foreign trade and currency barriers and in increasing competition in certain sectors although there appears to be consensus within israel on the policy actions that should be taken to avoid serious economic problems implementation of coherent economic strategy continues to be politically difficult perennial problem is thatas israels political system produces coalition governments the majority party in thegovernment is often hampered in implementing its preferred economic policy bycompeting claims from small coalition partners larger unknown is thecommitment of the two major political par

on international trade for its economic growth in 1996 exports ofgoods and services accounted for approxima tely 30 of gdp and imports of goods and services accounted for about 40 of gdp the extent to which international trade plays key role in israels growth is highlighted not only by the contribution of exports to final demand but also by the composition of its imports in 1996 for example production inputs and investmentgoods accounted for 69 of israels imports thereby serving as major source forbolstering the productive capacity of the economy 4 the european union eu assisted by geographical proximity and 22year old free trade agreement is israels main trading partner in 1996 the eu purchased 31 of all israels exports and supplied israel with 49 of its imports the united

attributes by tradition circumstances and ideology the government of israel has played leading role in developing the economy and in influencing economic activitywhen israel was established in 1948 the economy was primarily agrarian with onlya small manufacturing sector the state possessed minimal natural or financialresources little economic infrastructure and few public services faced with thedaunting task of settling huge influx of immigrants from europe and the middle east who generally lacked savings or skills israels political leadership gainedcontrol over large part of the countrys investment resources and economic activity to provide food clothing housi ng and jobs for its new citizens government control of the economy was also prompted by the need to deal with these challenges in ahostile external environment 7 significant part of all business came to be controlled by three sectors private public and histadrut the general federation of laborers in the land of israelhistadrut whose membership initially enco mpassed nearly all the labor force came to own or control significant portion of israeli industry as result of its vast pension fund holdings while significant steps have been taken over the years to reduce the governments high level of intervention in the economy the israeli economy retains an interventionist character today security challenges social welfare considerations and the small size of the economy have served as justifications by israeli authorities for keeping sizeable portion of economic activity undergovernment regulation or control or for going slow on reducing the level ofintervention government expenditures which in the 1990s have averaged 46 to 48 of gdp symbolize the large role government still plays in the economy 8 continued ownership or control of approximately 116 companies with the largest ten companies accounting for over 20 billion in assets is second vivid illustration9 other notable manifestations include some 600000 public sector jobs which account for 30 of all jobs an estimated 93 of the land is also owned by the government condition that has contributed to rising land and housing prices and the government still controls or supervises number of retail prices such as meattransportation fares and medicines these goods constituted 18 of the consumerprice index cpi as of august 1996 10 the government has played dominant role in capital markets from the beginning due to its need to finance large budget deficits and its interest inchanneling the flow of capital within isr aels economy

health education and welfare bolstered by strong domestic consensus in favor of the welfare state and defense have driven the domesticbudget deficits historically by controlling bank and other credit lines and byestablishing tax incentives the government has exercised major influence on thescale and pattern of investment throughout the economy high concentration ofcapital among handful of large conglomerates continues to stifle competition 11 israels labor market is affected by structural rigidities and restrictive government regulations the labor market is dominated by histadrut which now represents about 60 of all israeli worker s including the vast majority of workers employed in the public sector or governmentowned enterprises12 cartels and monopolies many of which ar legal affect significant portion of the israeli economy the resulting lack of competition in certain sectors is oftenpreserved by considerable albeit declining level of import protection despite having negotiated free trade agr eements with the european union and the united states the israeli economy remains relatively protected from importsfrom generally lowerwage asian countries the protection mainly takes the form of variety of user taxes and high duties due to these myriad governmental interventions in the marketplace israel often is ranked relatively low on various surveys of international competitiveness oreconomic freedom most of these surveys attempt to develop one overall measure of governmental interference in economic activity based on analysis of the states tax trade budget regulatory and monetary policies distinctive attributes the israeli economy has several distin ctive features three of the more prominent ones are associated with high defense requirements chronic balance ofpayments problems and political system that make economic policymaking moredifficult or uncertain since its establishment israel has been subject to almost constant hostility from neighboring states as result defense has almost always come first in terms of the overall allocation of resources annual defense expenditures have been highcompared to other countries both in per capita terms and relative to the size of theeconomy in recent years defense expenditures have declined but still averagearound 10 of gdp 13 israels defense burden can be measur ed by the budgeted resources diverted to defense that could have been used for other civilian purposes the defense burden also includes the opportunity cost of labor working for the defense sector that isunavailable to work in the private sector thereby reducing the economys potentialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97908crs5 14 pelzman joseph israels economy in israel country study us library of congress 1988 pp 141176 15 hunt albert r the wonders of israelpolitics and all new york times august 28 1997 p a15output in addition defense spending has been an important factor behind the size of the state budget and persistent budget deficits14 israels precarious security environment has also insured that foreign policy or geopolitical considerations are given priority over purely economic policy issuesas result sound economic policy decisions eg to cut government expenditures in order to promote macroeconomic stability are often given short shrift when the security environment is tense chronic balance of payments deficits are second distinctive feature of the israeli economy driven by its need to import most all of its energy requirementsmost of its raw materials and considerable weaponry israel historically has runmerchandise trade deficits to finance the deficits israel has long had to rely onforeign capital transfers via loans grants foreign investment and borrowing aperennial concern is that rising trade defi cits and capital imports together can lead to precipitous decline in the value of the israeli currency this concern in the past however has also been the catalyst for economic policy changes that would avoida selloff of foreign currency reserves and financial crisis third distinctive feature relates to isr aels political system where seats in the 120member knesset are allocated according to proportional representation anypolitical party that receives 15 of the national vote is allocated seats in the knesset the effect of this system is to produce coalition governments where thepower of small mostly single issue parties is greatly enhanced currently nine such parties ranging from the ultrareligious to the leftwing peace parties hold almost halfthe seats in the knesset while the two main parties labor and likud combinedcontrol slim majority 15 the need for the prime minister to consult leaders representing nearly every faction of the governing coalition on most major decisions serves as formidableconstraint on pushing ahead with fundamental economic or structural reforminitiatives 1996 political reform that provi ded for the direct election of the prime minister arguably has served to reinforce this tendency by encouraging the formation of small parties and by forcing the prime minister to cater to the whims of the support groups that elected him within the israeli government the bank of israel remains the main force supporting macroeconomic stability particular ly low inflation and liberalization of the economy acting as

growth since the establishment of the state of israel in 1948 the economy has experienced three different stages of economic growth and related macroeconomicdevelopments the first 19481972 and th ird stages 19891995 were classic boom periods fueled primarily by rapid increases in immigration that boosted the stock oflabor the third stage 19731988 was period of considerable economic instabilityand turmoil the israeli economy currently may be entering fourth stage where combination of problems are raising concerns once again about the stability andfuture performance of the israeli economy first two stages 19481972 and 19731988 from 19481972 the first 24 years of the state of israel the economy grew at very rapid rate during this period real gnp increased at an annual rate of 104 percent one of the highest rates in the wo rld this high rate of growth allowed for steady rise in per capita incomes at the same time infla tion averaged less than 10 on an annual basis rapid increases in both the stock of bor and capital were largely responsible for the rapid growth of the economy between 1948 and 1973 the population ofisrael increased nearly fourfold risi ng from 870000 to 33 million the growth in the capital stock was even greater increasing eightfold from 1950 to 1967 17 between 1973 and 1986 by contrast the israeli economy performed very poorly and unevenly the economic growth rate slowed to an annual average ofabout 2 per year with increase in per capita incomes the rate of inflationskyrocketed reaching high of 445 in 1984 and the economy experienced balance of payments crises in 1975 1983 and 19841985 18 three factors major increase in defense expenditures following the 197374 yom kippur war world energy crisis and sharp increase in expenditures on social welfare help explain the deteri oration in economic performance during this period in the aftermath of the june 1967 war defense expenditures between 1970and 1982 escalated to over 25 of gdp up fr om 10 to 16 of gdp range prior to the war sharp increases in oil pr ices in 1973 and again in 1979 imposed huge cost on the israeli economy estimated at 12 billion or the equivalent of one

wage increases deep cuts in governme nt expenditures and monetary restraint the stabilization program was dramatically successful it not only reduced inflation from over 400 in 1985 to around 20 by the end of 1986 but it also laid the foundation for the consideration of add itional reforms affecting taxation foreign currency and privatization in the years ahead 20 stage three 19891995 beginning in 1989 israel experienced huge influx of immigrants mostly from the former soviet union from 19891995 approximately 760000 new immigrants increased israels population from 452 million to 554 million 13 increase these mostly young immigrants represented according to one analyst the greatest migration of highly skilled human capital in the twentieth century21 the israeli governments strategy for immigrant absorption placed primary responsibility on the promotion of private sector employment without direct labor market intervention government expenditures for absorption which averagedapproximately 6 annually of the domestic b udget were directed substantially to the construction of public housing in addition the government provided hebrewlanguage and vocational training as well as ans to new immigrants to start up their own businesses 22 the rising supply of labor spearheaded very rapid economic growth that averaged over 6 in real terms from 199095 real per capita

exports 30 the economy has continued to slow down in 1997 during the first six months it grew at only 18 rate well belo w the 44 growth in 1996 slower growth can be expected to have both positive and negative consequences for the economyon the one hand it is likely to help moderate inflationary pressures and to reduce the current account deficit through reduced demand for imports on the other hand itis likely to lead to reduced government revenues creating more pressure for significant cuts in government expenditures in order to meet budget deficit targets in addition slower growth combined w ith population rising at about 25 means there will be little or increase in per capita incomes such increases are an israeli government goal in order to attract new immigrants particularly from

due to continuing depreciation of shekel strong export performance is also key to keeping israels debt servicepayments at manageable levels current macroeconomic policy issues israels current economic problems are fu eled in large part by widening gap between fiscal and monetary policies while fiscal policy has been expansionary in recent years monetary policy has been re strictive this has imposed an economic cost on the country primarily in terms of high interest rates most experts agreethat major fiscal consolidation or tight ening is necessary before monetary policy can be eased the slowdown in economic growth however is placing addedpressures on monetary authorities to lower interest rates in order to avoid domesticrecession the problem is that too large drop in interest rates could lead to an large outflow of capital precipitating an abrupt depreciation of the shekel fiscal policy until 1995 the burden of absorbing large influx of immigrants was accomplished without an expansionary fiscal stance although the domestic budgetdeficit increased from 32 of gdp in 1989 to 53 in 1991 tight controls onexpenditures helped drop the domestic budget deficit steadily to 20 of gdp by1994 but with an election approaching in the fall of 1994 large increases in public sector wages and tax cuts as well as by receipt of less revenues than estimatedturned fiscal policy expansionary th result was that in 1995 the domestic budget deficit reached 33 of gdp well above the 275 target established by the 1992 budget deficit reduction act 43 fiscal policy became more lax in 1996 with the domestic

tax revenues and failure to cut the rate of spending45 as in the case in 1995 more than half of the deficit overrun was caused by revenue shortfalls rather than overspending46 the shortfall in revenues in turn was attributable to decline in income and other direct tax collections as well as to the growing role of foreign workers who are paid in cash47 n th expenditure side large increases in public sector spending occurred prior to the may 1996 election particularly noteworthy were rapid increases in both public sectorsalaries and public sector jobs 48 viewing recent shifts in the

payments to households and nonprofit institutions have increased from 135 in1992 to 156 of gdp in 1996 the share in the budget going to nondefense publicsector salaries also has risen from 51 of gdp

more slowly the 1997 economic slowdown increases th likelihood that revenues will run below projected levels as the base line 1997 budget assumed an economic growth rate of 4 actual growth at around 2 could translate into revenue gap of at least 425 million 51 the slowdown may also increase political opposition to budget cuts while economic theory suggests that significant budget cuts could facilitate lower interest rates and lower exchange rate that in turn could generate increases in domestic production cuts in government spending are traditionally unpopular amonginfluential interest groups monetary and exchange rate policies since 1985 the main objective of israels monetary and exchange rate policies has been to reduce inflation to levels prevailing in most advanced industrializedcountries the central banks principal t ools are control over the money supply and interest rates as israels fiscal policy turned expa nsionary in 1994 monetary policy turned restrictive throughout 1995 and 1996 tight monetary policy has persisted withthe bank of israel holding real interest ra tes at 4 to 5 percentage points above the underlying rate of inflation combined with an

inflow has led to moderate 5 since 1993 real appreciation of the shekel while stronger currency helps in the fight againstinflation it is controversial in the busine ss community because it increases the price of israeli exports third the tight monetary policy and accompanying high interest rates have encouraged israeli firms to increase subs tantially their use of foreign denominated credit the rising demand for foreign curre ncy borrowing has forced the central bank to engage in activities to soak up the supply of shekels it has pumped into theeconomy in order to prevent the monetary base from growing and undercutting itsinflationary targets this process know as sterilization has imposed quasifiscalcost on both the bank of israel and the public 53 in june 1997 the bank of israel acted to counter the negative pressures from capital inflows and the sterilization requireme nts exchange controls were further liberalized to allow provident and mutual funds more freedom to invest abroad andthe exchange rate band was widened to make speculation riskier the bank alsodropped its main lending rate from 139 to 127 after the cabinet agreed to cut the deficit by an additional 600 million shekels 54 monetary authorities hope that the interest rate reduction will reduce the demand for shekels in the foreign exchange market and allow some real devaluation of the shekel to take place gradually their concern is that diminution of interestrate spreads between israeli and foreign markets could prompt large outflow of foreign capital that in turn could lead to precipitous depreciation

reforms recent developments attainment of israels macroeconomic objectives particularly rapid economic growth can also be facilitated by range of structural reforms thatwould reduce the level of

small 18 in 1992 03 in 1993 and02 in 1995 64 structural changes in the wage bargaini ng process may have contributed to real wage restraint in the business sector as smaller share of the wage bill is

course of action first and foremost cut in government spending is advocated by many in order to increase domestic savings this would not only forestall any potential balance of payments problems by curbing any rise in is raels persistent high reliance of external resources but it would also help fund inve stmentled growth meeting the domestic deficit reduction target for 1997 and beyond would
