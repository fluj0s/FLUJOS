policy november 3 2005 raymond w copson specialist in international relations foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress the global fund and pepfar in us international aids policy summary the united states is responding to the international aids pandemic through the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar which includes bilateral programs and contributions to the multilateral global fund for aids tuberculosis and malaria pepfar overall appears on target to meet the administrations fiveyear 15 billion spending plan although competing budget priorities could affect its prospects by contrast the global fund which relies on multiple donors is reporting funding gap that may prevent it from awarding new grants to fight the pandemic the fund estimates that it needs 33 billion in 2006 and 2007 to cover the renewal of its existing grants in addition to 37 billion in order to fund two new rounds of grantmaking at september 2005 global fund pledging conference in london donors offered total of 37 billion for the two years and unless additional pledges are made the fund will be able to do little more than fund existing grants the united states at the london meeting pledged total 600 million for 2006 and 2007 although andrew tobias the us global aids coordinator suggested that congress might provide larger amount congress has consistently appropriated more than requested for the fund some believe that the administration increased its fy2006 request for the fund to 300 million from 200 million sought in fy2003fy2005 in recognition of the support the fund enjoys in congress representatives of the global fund and pepfar maintain that their programs are complementary and that they are partners rather than competitors the united states is the largest contributor to the global fund through pepfar some worry however that there are strains between us officials and the global fund pointing to the tendency of the administration to request less for the fund than congress has been willing to provide global fund representatives attended major pepfar planning session in may 2005 and this is seen by many as one indicator among others that any past strains between the two programs are easing advocates for the global fund seek major increase in the us contribution arguing that it would affirm us leadership in the struggle against aids and persuade other donors to increase their support they believe that the global fund has several unique advantages including its multilateral character its contribution to capacity building and its operations in countries other than the 15 pepfar focus countries supporters of us bilateral programs note that they too build capacity and operate beyond the focus countries while bringing the capacities of highly experienced us agencies to bear in fighting the pandemic through pepfar some argue the united states is already doing more than its fair share in fighting aids and any large increase for the global fund should come from other donor countries us officials and others are also encouraging contributions from private sector sources such contributions have been limited to date apart from 150 million contributed by the bill and melinda gates foundation this report will not be updated for further information see crs report rs21181

according to unaids the joint united nations program on hivaids an estimated 394 million people were living with hiv in 2004 including 49 million who were newly infected during the year1 aids deaths totaled 31 million or nearly 8500 per day approximately 64 of hivinfected adults and children live in subsaharan africa and the pandemic is casting pall over prospects for development and stability in that region south africa with 53 million infected people at the end of 2004 has the largest number of infections worldwide beyond africa the spread of the disease in india china and russia is giving rise to concerns over the potential impact of the pandemic in countries that are key regional and global actors india confronted an estimated 51 million infections at the end of 2004 and will likely soon have more infected people than any other country the united states is responding to the international aids pandemic through the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar which includes bilateral programs and contributions to the multilateral global fund for aids tuberculosis and malaria pepfar aims at spending total of 15 billion from fy2004 through fy2008 pepfar bilateral programs channel most funds through contracts with us and local nongovernmental organizations ngo fighting the pandemic as well as hostcountry health ministries or other government agencies the global fund which has committed 34 billion to date to fighting the three diseases is supported by donor countries including the united states in addition to foundations and other contributors it makes fiveyear grants in low and middle income countries in response to applications from national committees called country coordinating mechanisms ccm the recipients of global fund grants implement the actual diseasefighting programs and include health ministries local ngos and in several countries the united nations development program undp hivaids has been the main target of pepfar since its inception and the first annual report to congress on the program issued in march 2005 dealt exclusively with this disease2 however the legislation authorizing pepfar the united states leadership against aids tuberculosis and malaria act of 2003 pl 18025 authorized programs to fight malaria and tuberculosis as well thus the three 1 unaids aids epidemic update december 2004 2 office of the global aids

the administration reports that in both fy2004 and fy2005 93 of pepfar spending went to fighting aids4 the global fund estimates its 56 of its spending goes to fighting aids on june 30 2005 president bush proposed new fiveyear malaria initiative outside of pepfar to total 12 billion beginning with 30 million to be committed in fy2006 this proposed program is not included in the analysis in this report5 pepfar appears on target to meet the administrations fiveyear 15 billion spending plan although competing budget priorities could affect funding prospects appropriations are steadily rising reaching 23 billion in fy2004 and 29 billion in fy2005 while 32 billion has been requested for fy2006 appropriations bills currently before congress would provide more than this amount6 the global fund by contrast is reporting funding gap that may prevent it from awarding new rounds of grants for combating the aids pandemic the purpose of this report is to examine the relationship between the global fund and pepfar in us international aids policy review arguments in the debate over whether the united states should increase its contributions to the global fund and outline other options for increasing global fund resources background in may 2001 president bush made the founding pledge of 200 million to new yettobenamed global fund to fight aids at white house rose garden ceremony attended by secretary general kofi annan and nigerias president olusegun obasanjo7 us officials played prominent role in the subsequent negotiations on creating the global fund and the new organization began operations in january 2002 with its mission expanded to include tuberculosis and malaria the global fund is an innovative organization in many ways the funds board includes representatives of both donor and recipient governments ngos the private sector and communities affected by the three diseases unaids the world health organization who and the world bank also participate the funds secretariat in geneva is relatively small with about 135 employees this is possible because the global fund is not an implementing agency but rather financial instrument designed to mobilize new resources for fighting disease and to manage and disburse 3 some observers expect that spending on aids alone will total 15 billion or more for fy2004 through fy2008 but this remains to be seen 4 engendering bold leadership p 113 5 in announcing the initiative president bush said it would support the efforts of the global fund the world bank roll back malaria and other donors fact

identify one or more principal recipients such as the national health ministry or one or more ngos which are legally responsible for grant implementation applications are reviewed by technical review panel of independent experts and if grant is made the fund contracts local fund agent typically large accounting firm to oversee its implementation the global funds grantmaking takes place in rounds which are announced when the fund estimates that it has funds available to cover the first two years of large number of new grants the twoyear requirement known as the comprehensive funding policy is intended to assure that the projects being funded including treatment projects are not interrupted for lack of money president george w bush announced the launching of pepfar in his january 2003 state of the union address the united states had been implementing bilateral international aids projects through the us agency for international development usaid since the mid1980s the clinton administrations 1999 life leadership and investment in fighting an epidemic initiative brought other agencies particularly the centers for disease control and prevention of the department of health and human services into the effort as well pepfar which was authorized in may 2003 by pl 10825 see above brought these efforts into single program headed by global aids coordinator carrying the rank of ambassador and based at the department of state randall tobias former chairman president and ceo of eli lilly the pharmaceutical corporation was named to the post by president bush in july 2003 and confirmed in october the pepfar initiative promised substantial new resources for fighting aids including 9 billion over five years to be committed in 14 later expanded to 15 of the most afflicted countries of the world9 this new funding is being channeled through the global hivaids initiative ghai directed by the office of the global aids coordinator ogac pepfar also promised 5 billion over five years for ongoing bilateral aids programs in 105 other countries10 as well as 1 billion in contributions to the global fund officials said that overall pepfar represented 10 billion in new money that is 10 billion in additional funds beyond spending that would have occurred if existing programs had simply been continued at thencurrent spending levels 8 statements based on information

global fund have been meeting the difficult challenge of scaling up their efforts to combat the global aids pandemic11 however both are already claiming considerable success pepfar aims at supporting treatment for 2 million hiv infected people by 2008 preventing 7 million new hiv infections and supporting care for 10 million people infected and affected by hivaids including orphans and vulnerable children12 the office of the global aids coordinator reports that at the end of march 2005 the pepfar global hivaids initiative was supporting antiretroviral therapy for more than 235000 aids patients in the focus countries13 through september 2004 17 million were receiving care including 630000 orphans and vulnerable children14 ogac estimates that in fy2004 it reached 120 million people in the focus countries with prevention messages focusing on abstinence and being faithful in addition 96 million condoms were purchased and shipped to focus countries for programs directed toward people who engage in high risk behavior15 the global fund reports that the 316 grants it had approved in 127 countries through july 2005 had put 220000 patients on hiv therapy provided hiv testing and counseling for 25 million people and provided 397000 orphans with social medical and educational support16 some patients receiving treatment for aids are participating in programs supported by both pepfar and

existing grants through the end of 2007 in addition it is seeking 37 billion for total of 7 billion in order to respond to anticipated applications in rounds 6 through 8 during the twoyear period18 at pledging conference held in london in september 2005 donors pledged total of 37 billion unless additional pledges are made the global fund will have the resources to do little more than fund its existing grants it will not be able to bring new resources to bear in fighting the aids pandemic resource constraints were evident when the global funds board met in geneva at the end of september 2005 to discuss round 5 grants the board decided to approve 26 grants costing 382 million over the first two years another 37 grants costing 344 million were provisionally accepted pending additional pledges in the first half of 2006 if sufficient pledges are not received by the end of june 2006 the 37 grants will be denied final approval19 the board did not schedule sixth round us contributions the united states made initial contributions to the global fund totaling 275 million from appropriations for fy2001 and fy2002 table 1 for fy2003 through fy2005 the administration requested 200 million annually but congress provided more than requested in each year 200 million request is in keeping with the pepfar promise of 1 billion over five years but for fy2006 the administration raised its request to 300 billion some speculated that this reflected recognition on the administrations part that congress favored larger contributions house and senate versions of fy2006 appropriations

provisionallyapproved grants require further clarifications although it judged that these could be provided within the june 2006 framework the 26 approved grants required clarifications or minor clarifications that could be provided in four weeks crs6 global fund contributions have been funded principally through the foreign operations appropriations legislation and the appropriations for the departments of labor health and human services and education laborhhs the amounts reported in table 1 for appropriations in fy2003 through fy2005 reflect rescissions included in these appropriations bills in fy2004 as shown in line 3 878 million of the amount appropriated for the global fund was not provided due to legislative provisions limiting the us contribution for fy2004 through fy2008 to 33 of the amount contributed by all donors20 the fy2005 consolidated appropriations legislation directed that these withheld funds be provided to the global fund in fy2005 subject like the remainder of the us contribution to the 33 proviso the amount reported in the senatepassed foreign operations bill for fy2006 hr 3057 includes 100 million transferred from the economic support fund under sec 6118 added as floor amendment during debate the onethird rule governing contributions is not an issue in 2005 when the us contribution is estimated at about 29 of total contributions for the calendar year see below table 2 at the september 2005 pledging conference in london us global aids coordinator randall tobias said that the united states would pledge total of at least 600 million 300 million in each year in 2006 and 200721 tobias noted however that the final amount would be determined by congress remark that was interpreted as suggesting that he expected the ultimate us contribution to be larger the 600 million offered by tobias represents 16 of amounts pledged for the two years and was second to the french pledge of 631 million americas european partners together pledged 16 billion including the french pledge22 the 600 million for the global fund in fy2006 in the senatepassed version of the foreign operations appropriation without considering any additional amount for fy2007 would double the administration request for the year and put the us contribution at approximately 28 of the total global fund and pepfar in us policy representatives of the global fund and pepfar consistently maintain that the two are partners rather than competitors in the struggle against aids ambassador tobias told the london pledging conference that the us contribution to the global fund is strategic priority of pepfar the operational plan of the office of the global aids coordinator for fy2005 states that the global fund was conceived 20 these provisions are found in sec 202 of pl 10825 the united states leadership against hivaids tuberculosis and malaria act of 2003 as amended by pl 108199 the fy2004 consolidated appropriations table 2 below indicates that the us contribution in 2004 came to 30 of the total but this is calendar year figure the determination of the amount to be held back was made at the end of fy2004 21 recorded remarks at the global fund website httpwwwtheglobalfundorg 22 based on information appearing in the table on pledges at the global fund website and in the global fund observer september 7 2007 crs7 to be an integral part of the administrations global strategy against the epidemic23 an august 2005 global fund press release affirmed that the two programs are partners noting that together the global fund and pepfar are the major financial engines to achieve greatly increased treatment numbers over the coming years24 jack valenti president of friends of the global fight against aids tuberculosis and malaria which advocates for the global fund in the united states describes the fund as the multilateral arm of pepfar complementing the work of us bilateral programs around the world25 usglobal fund cooperation was underscored in january 2003 when then us secretary of health and human services tommy thompson was elected chairman of the funds board thompson served until april 2005 ambassador tobias currently serves as head of the global funds policy and strategy committee many argue that this history of cooperation represents significant us policy investment in the global fund and considered together with us financial contributions gives the united states significant stake in the funds success those who insist that the global fund and pepfar are partners also assert that the work of the two organizations is complementary they point out that the global fund is the principal vehicle for mobilizing new resources to fight aids outside the 15 global hivaids initiative focus countries thus furthering pepfars worldwide objectives at the same time the global fund is adding resources for treatment and other aids relief measures within the ghai countries by contributing to the global fund the united states is able to leverage its investment for fighting the pandemic because the fund provides means for other donors most of which lack the capacity for carrying out large bilateral aids program to participate in fighting the pandemic many feel that by working through ccms local government ministries and local ngos the global fund is complementing pepfar objectives by helping to build indigenous institutional capacities that will boost the abilities of host countries to deal with health challenges over the long term pepfar bilateral programs meanwhile complement the work of the global fund by bringing the capacities of usaid cdc and other us agencies to bear on an emergency basis in 15 of the most heavily affected countries where indigenous institutions are not able to cope with the pandemic in the short term us and global fund officials make point of noting that the two organizations work together closely underscoring their partnership and complementarity global fund staff participated in the may 2005 annual meeting of pepfar field staff held in addis ababa ethiopia and key emphasis of the meeting was the importance of cooperation between the two organizations at the local level us embassies in the focus countries report back to washington on this cooperation consultations also take place between the two organizations at the headquarters level in the field usaid provides technical assistance to ccms in setting priorities and formulating proposals to the global fund as noted above there has also been cooperation in 23 emergency plan for aids relief

international relations april 13 2005 crs8 providing antiretroviral treatment to aids patients officials foresee closer cooperation in the future for example w brad herbert chief of operations at the global fund expects us aids experts in the field to become more engaged in helping to monitor the performance of global fundsupported projects26 despite the emphasis on partnership complementarity and cooperation in public statements some suspect that us officials are not entirely happy with the global fund and may see it as rival that is drawing attention away from the accomplishments of us bilateral programs some trace the suspected estrangement to april 2002 when the global fund board chose dr richard feachem briton as executive director rather than an american candidate proposed by the united states27 others argue that the leadup to the 2003 war in iraq brought out sentiments in the administration that were unfriendly toward the united nations and multilateral organizations generally and that this affected attitudes toward the global fund28 the tendency of the administration to request less for the global fund than congress was willing to provide may be traced to these antimultilateral points of view some believe at september 2004 congressional staff briefing on the global fund officials were reportedly highly critical of fund operations causing observers to doubt administration statements of support29 however even many of those who have been skeptical of the degree of partnership between the global fund and pepfar now acknowledge that there seems to be new spirit of cooperation as symbolized in the administrations 300 million request for the fund in fy2006 this new spirit has come late in the day some argue but is welcome nonetheless debate over us funding for the global fund despite increasing cooperation between pepfar and the global fund the level of us contributions remains point of contention fund supporters believe that other donors are unlikely to increase their contributions unless the united states boosts its own level of support they maintain that the onethird rule governing us contributions serves as benchmark for the other donors who see it as their responsibility to provide twothirds of the funding while the united states provides the rest thus the united states would have to contribute 23 billion in fy2006 and fy2007 combined rather than the 600 million pledged by ambassador tobias if it is to persuade other donors to make contributions sufficient to meet the global funds stated need of 7 billion many see an increase for the global fund on this scale as unlikely since there are many competing budget priorities and guarantee that other donors would 26 john donnelly key groups in antiaids fight aim for

summers united to fight hivaids the washington quarterly autumn 2003 p 183 29 global fund observer november 8 2004 crs9 follow the us lead administration officials and others argue that the united states has already been generous toward the global fund and should not be expected to do more in july 2004 ambassador tobias pointed out to an interviewer in bangkok during the biennial international aids conference that the united states made the first contribution to the global fund and we remain the biggest contributor were contributing nearly twice as much as all other donors combined30 moreover the united states is on target to contribute considerably more than the 1 billion over five years initially promised when pepfar was announced there was much criticism of the level of us funding for the global fund at the bankok meeting where tobias said that the united states would not fulfill request from united nations secretary general kofi annan for 1 billion annual contribution31 table 2 contributions to the global fund by the g7 and european commission 20062007 country 20012002 2003 2004 2005 pledges united states 313 344 300 292 162 canada 26 27 33 78 57

contributions at the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria website global fund observer september 7 2007 press reports canadas 20062007 pledge was made after the london pledging conference us officials also note that the united states is contributing by far the largest share of funds going toward fighting the global pandemic including both its global fund contribution and its bilateral pepfar program report issued by the henry j kaiser family foundation in july 2005 found that the united states was contributing 454 of the funds committed by the g7 nations and the european 30 msnbc the bush administration stands alone july 14 2004 31 us will not meet secretary generals request to contribute 1b annually to global fund tobias says kaiser daily hivaids report july 15 2004 crs10 communities for international aids programs32 this is more than fair share some believe and if more funding is needed at the global fund it should come from other sources however the kaiser study also pointed out that when bilateral commitments and commitments to the global fund were adjusted for gross national income the united states ranked third in funding international aids programs behind britain and canada but well ahead of france germany and japan unaids estimates the total need for resources to fight aids in 2006 at 149 billion whereas 89 billion is likely to be provided33 suggesting to some that donors generally are falling short of their fair share contribution to the aids struggle for those who argue that other donors rather than the united states should be doing more to help the global fund the onethird rule governing us contributions should be seen as safeguard put in place by congress rather than as benchmark determining what others should contribute table 2 suggests that the onethird rule may not be governing pledges by other donors for 2006 and 2007 although it is also possible that their pledges reflect an expectation that congress will add to the us contribution nonetheless there is significant support often stated in heated terms for larger us contribution to the global fund number of editorials and opinion pieces have strongly urged an increase for the fund34 and advocacy organizations such as the global aids alliance have accused the administration of deliberate concerted action to undermine the fund35 some argue that an increase is merited precisely because the united states has assumed world leadership in the struggle against aids larger global fund contribution would affirm this leadership and have diplomatic and public relations benefits as well since it would underscore the us commitment to an important humanitarian cause supporters of boost in funding typically praise the global fund for its innovative features and its multilateral character they depict pepfars bilateral effort in the focus countries as top down program run from washington and contrast this with the global funds direct support for programs developed in the field by stakeholders participating in the ccms in this way they argue the global fund is making major contribution to institutionbuilding in developing countries with potential wider benefits for governance and growth many feel that the global fund should be the primary component of the us response to the pandemic they agree with stephen lewis special envoy for hivaids in africa in seeing the fund 32 jennifer kates financing the response to hivaids in low and middle income countries funding for hivaids from the g7 and european commission kaiser family foundation july 2005 33 unaids resource needs for an expanded response to aids in low and middle income countries june 2005 the funds likely to be provided in 2006 include 28 billion expected from the afflicted countries themselves 34 see for example des moines register september 21 2005 saloncom june 2 2005 indianapolis star march 19 2005 nation december 20 2004 35 msnbc the bush administration stands alone cited above the global aids alliance is nonprofit organization based in washington dc crs11 whatever its teething problems as the most formidable new international financial mechanism in the battle against communicable disease according to lewis the fund deserves every ounce of support it can muster36 many also favor the global fund over pepfars bilateral programs because they believe that pepfar has been fettered by various requirements and restrictions which in their view inappropriately restrict the program pepfar for example is required by law to spend onethird of funds allocated for hivaids prevention in fy2006 through fy2008 on abstinenceuntilmarriage programs37 and pepfar contractors must sign pledge stating that they oppose commercial sex work and sex trafficking38 some question the effectiveness of abstinenceuntilmarriage programs and worry that the prostitution pledge could inhibit the ability of ngos to work with group that is key vector for hiv such requirements do not affect the global fund in may 2005 ambassador tobias rescinded an effort to require ngos receiving us funds indirectly through the global fund to sign the prostitution pledge saying that the policy had not been fully cleared those who oppose an increase in the us contribution to the global fund tend to describe the pepfars bilateral effort as superior to the global fund program they emphasize that pepfar is funding expanded involvement in the struggle against aids by us agencies primarily usaid and cdc which have years of experience in fighting disease spending in the field is under the direction of personnel based at us embassies and this results in better coordination they argue it is mistake to see pepfar as top down program because embassy involvement means that local considerations are constantly being taken into account39 moreover pepfar is itself making major contribution to building local capacity through its training and infrastructure programs and by channeling much of its spending through local organizations as contractors or subcontractors with pepfar oversight and assistance supporters maintain local institutions are becoming more transparent potentially strengthening the overall quality of governance in the focus countries some also argue that only large bilateral program under us control could have gained the domestic american political support needed for commitment of 10 billion in additional resources to fighting aids they believe that the restrictions on the use of pepfar funds reflect widely held us values and further that the program might have failed to win majority support in congress if the restrictions were not in place 36 speech to the third international aids society conference july 25 2005 37 pl 10825 section 403 the legislation states this requirement in sense of congress language for fy2004fy2005 sec 402 sense of congress language states that 20 of pepfar spending should be devoted to prevention 38 pl 10825 section 301f prohibits funding for any group that does not have policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sextrafficking the usaid policy directive on the pledge is at httpwwwusaidgovbusinessbusiness_opportunitiescibpdfaapd05_04pdf see also kaiser daily hivaids report may 18 2005 39 however portion of ghai spending is centrallymanaged from washington in fy2004 1811 million was spent through centrallymanaged programs while 5702 million was managed at the country level engendering bold leadership p 115 crs12 some pepfar advocates maintain that several global fund programs have run into difficulties and see this as an argument for refraining from larger contributions in january 2004 for example the global fund suspended grants in ukraine that were found to be poorly managed and behind schedule while in august 2005 grants to uganda were suspended when the local fund agent reported mismanagement of one grant by the ministry of health global fund supporters however argue that such suspensions are sign that the global funds oversight mechanisms are effective and transparent and that they can be an incentive to recipient countries to strengthen their capabilities for grant management grants to ukraine have been resumed conditional on improvements in governance and adherence to sound business practices on the part of the ccm uganda is implementing changes to improve grant management and restore its own eligibility for global fund grants problems in global fund grants are most likely to be encountered in the early stages of grant implementation some argue but tend to ease as countrys capacity for grant administration begins to grow the ongoing debate between advocates for the global fund and for pepfar bilateral programs is unfortunate some observers maintain because both programs are making important contributions in the struggle against aids in their view way should be found to provide the global fund with the resources it needs from the united states and other donors without taking resources away from bilateral efforts the united states has already contributed substantial amounts to the global fund and some believe that failure by the fund to mobilize the resources it needs to fight the aids pandemic will to some degree be failure of us policy some also doubt that pepfar will be able to meet its own objectives for treatment prevention and care unless it bolsters the global fund policy options the difficulty in attempting to leverage larger contributions from other donors to the global fund by increasing the us contribution is that the resources available under the two appropriations bills used to support the fund foreign operations and laborhhs are finite once an annual budget resolution is passed and funds are allocated to the appropriations committees and then to subcommittees increases for one program can only be achieved through decreases for others40 in hearings and meetings according to observers representatives of executive branch agencies tend to argue most strongly in support of bilateral programs under their control even though they may also be supportive of multilateral programs some also suggest that similar process occurs in the executive branch before the annual budget is submitted to congress and that this has tended to limit the request for the global fund the global fund has strong supporters in congress and this has led to appropriations above the administrations request but these have not been on the scale that global fund advocates believe is needed 40 for discussion of the process see crs report rl32919 foreign operations housestate foreign operations and related programs senate fy2006 appropriations by larry nowels crs13 the solution for many global fund advocates is larger pie for foreign operations andor laborhhs backed up by larger budget request from the administration leaving room for substantially larger contribution to the global fund however expanding funding for these appropriations bills to benefit the global fund would likely prove problematic in period of concern over the federal deficit as well as high levels of spending for the war in iraq and hurricane relief some advocates of larger us contribution to the global fund believe that legislative provisions limiting the us contribution to 33 of all contributions should be repealed since it could lead to the withholding of us funds in the future others argue that the provision should be retained as an incentive to other donors another option would be concerted us effort to persuade other donor countries to increase their contributions to the global fund even in the absence of large us increase us officials might argue that the united states is using its substantial bilateral capabilities to carry out large scale effort against aids under pepfar and that those lacking these capabilities should participate in the struggle through larger contributions to global fund some suggest that making this case should not be left to ambassador tobias and his assistants but that secretary of state rice and president bush should also strongly advocate for the global fund in public forums and in their meetings with foreign leaders skeptics question however whether foreign leaders would be willing to make substantially larger contributions unless the united states does so as well third option would be an effort to persuade private sector donors foundations and the general public to contribute to the global fund at the september 2005 global fund pledging conference ambassador tobias urged nongovernment sources including the private sector to give generously to the global fund some suggest that popular music events along the lines of the 1985 live aid concert which raised funds to fight famine in ethiopia could generate new revenues for the global fund prior to the july 2005 g8 summit in scotland ten live 8 concerts in support of ending world poverty reportedly drew more than million people around the world41 although the concerts did not specifically raise funds for aids to date however nongovernment sources apart from the bill and melinda gates foundation have contributed only modest amounts to the global fund the gates foundation has given 150 million but corporations have given just 19 million while individuals groups and events have accounted for 33 million these relatively low numbers suggest to some that there is great untapped potential for larger contributions from alternative sources others see them as evidence that the potential is limited42 in any event many continue to believe way must be found to boost global fund resources if us objectives in combating the global aids pandemic are to be fulfilled 41 cnncom
