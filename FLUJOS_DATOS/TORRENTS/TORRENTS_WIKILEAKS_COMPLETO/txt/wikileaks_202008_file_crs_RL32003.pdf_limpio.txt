industry while facilitating the speedy introduction of lowercost generi c drugs however over the 18 years since its passage concerns have been expr essed as to whether or not implementation of certain portions of the law has led to unintended consequences contrary to the original intent some argue that brand name companies andor generic firms have exploited provisions of the act to prevent the timely marketing of less costly pharmaceuticals other experts maintain that while few isolated cases of misinterpretation of the law have arise n these can be addressed through existing procedures and that legislative changes are not necessary2 the two bills currently under consid eration would addr ess hatchwaxman related issues of drug patents listed in the orange b ook patent challenges by

regulations although the hatchwaxman act provides safe harbor from patent infringement it also requires wouldbe manufacturers of generic drugs to engage in specialized certification procedure the core feature of this process is that request for fda marketing approval is treated as an artificial act of patent infringement this feature was intended to allow judicial resolution of the validity
