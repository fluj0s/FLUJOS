eugene h buck jean rawson and eric fischer resources science and industry division november 25 2002 abstract whose responsibility is it to ensure the economic and ecological integrity of the nation in response to multibillion dollar threats posed by harmful nonnative species as the speed and level of trade and travel increase the chance of introducing unwelcome species such as zebra mussels melaleuca ﬁre ants or formosan termites increases but federal activities in this area remain unfocused the speciﬁc issue before congress is whether new legislative authorities are needed to address issues of nonnative species and their increasing economic and ecological impacts this report highlights the choice between single species approaches and pathway approaches for prevention and between prevention vs control it describes existing federal laws and federal agency roles and outlines eﬀects costs and issues surrounding 31 selected harmful nonnative

nonnative species background and issues for congress summary for the first few centuries after the rrival of europeans in north america plants and animals of many species were sent between the two land masses the transfer of nonnatives cons isted not only of intenti onal westbound species ranging from pigs to dandelions but also intenti onal eastbound grey squirrels and tomatoes and for those centuries the remaining nonnative species crossing the atlantic uninvited and often unwelcome we re ignored if they were noticed at all national focus on nonnative species arose in the 19th century primarily over losses in agriculture due to weeds or plant diseases the leading industry of the time few newlyarrived nonnatives and new timates of advers economic impacts exceeding 100 billion annually ve sharpened that focus very broadly the unanswered question regarding nonnative species is whose responsibility is it to ensure economic inte grity and ecological stability in response to the actual or potential impacts of nonnativ species as this report shows the current answer is not simple and may be one it ma depend on answers to many other questions is the introduction deliberate or accidental does it affect agriculture by what pathway does it arrive is the potential harm from the species already known is the species already established in one area of the country finally if the answers to any of these stions are unsatisfactory what changes should be made the specific issue before congress is whether new legislative authorities and funding are needed to address issues of nonnative species and their increasing economic and ecological impacts such legislation could affect domestic and international trade touris m industries dependent on br inging in nonnative species those dependent on keeping them out and finally the variety of natural resources which have little direct econo mic value and yet affect th lives of broad portion of the public in the century or so of congressional responses to harmful nonnative species the usual approach has been an ad hoc attack on the particular problem from impure seed stocks to brown tree snakes on guam few notable atte mpts have begun to address specific pathways eg ship ballast water but current law addresses the general concern over nonnative species and the variety of paths by which they enter this country 1998 executive order takes st ep in bringing together some of the current authorities and resources to address problem that has expanded with both increasing world trade and travel and decreasing transit time for humans and cargo bills have been introduced on this subject in the 105th 106th and 107th congresses this report compares an approach ba sed on speciesbyspecies assessment vs one based on pathways of entry it so assesses the choice of an emphasis on prevention vs post hoc control and intrastate quaran tine it describes existing federal laws and federal agency roles fe deral interagency coope ration and the federal interaction with state governments finally it outlines effects costs and issues surrounding 47 selected harmful nonnative specieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123contents v r

to continue with full list of the dama ging effects of harmful nonnative plants and animals risks sounding like hyperbole only in fairly recent years have many people realized that various areas of the country share problems that are similar in outline if not in detail impacts have been particularly severe on agriculture the globalization of trade the increased speed of travel the massive volume of cargo shipments and rising tourism all combine to increase the chance of more accidental introductions moreover trade in exotic plants and animals that would have been impractical when voyages took days or weeks now becomes practical when shipment times are only fraction of that some of the species in the horticulture and exotic pet trades may escape or be released in th wild by accident or when owners tire of them all 50 states and all of the territories have at least some nonnative plants and animals few eg hawaii florida louisiana great lakes states california have so many harmful nonnatives as to cause major ecological and economic damage to variety of locations and indus tries problems with terrestrial nonnative species tend to be more severe in the southern half of the country in terms of total numbers of nonnative species aquatic invasives have created more evenly distributed problems dollar impacts estimating the total ec onomic impact of harmful nonna tive

and categories domestic and feral cats and dogs were included and accounted for 49 and 01 of the total respectively some have criticized the report as inflated or as failing to count benefits of other introduced species 2 each of these species is covered in this order in gallery of invasive nonnative plants and animals at the end of this report see these entries for documentation of economic

control only brown tree snake 1 million annually on guam in power outages alone many impacts would be extremely difficult to measure in monetary terms the west nile virus has had vere impact on populations of some wild birds which are major focus of recreation for millions of americans the introduction of lake trout into yellowstone lake see gallery below for example is likely to have profound effects on populations of native cutth roat trout and as result on grizzly bears bald eagles and other speci the presence of honeybee mites see gallery is more problematic on the one hand crops pollinated by honeybees itself non native species will be more difficult to raise on the other species of native bees bumble bees carpenter bees solitary bees etc which are unaffected by the mites may benefit from the absence of comp etition and the presence of mites may be slowing the northward spread of african ized honeybees also nonnative species and zebra mussels one of the most costly invasives to date have benefitted water quality in the great lakes region see gallery httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs3 many names have been used to describe species that are able to survive and reproduce outside the habitats where they evolved or spread naturally among them are alien exotic injurious introduced invasive nonindigenous nonnative and noxious alien tends to be applied to species from other regions that are also harmful and likely to proliferate wildly in their new habitat injurious invasive and noxious are generally used synonymously and are not confined to species outside of their normal range these terms are applied to species that proliferate wildly whether native like whitetailed deer and barnacles or non native like leafy spurge and brown tree snakes in the legal arena these terms are found in various laws and defined in various ways this report generally uses the term nonnative to emphasize the geographic origin of these species but the term invasive is also used in deference to its increasing use among federal agencies this paper focuses on those nonnative species which have caused or seem likely to cause substantial economic harm the authors recognize that many species eg cattle olives wheat tulips etc were introduced with either little known adverse ecological impact or with sufficient net benefits to make it likely that most people would not consider them harmfulwhats in namemajor laws and executive order because the problem of nonnative species has continued to present itself as series of seemingly disconnected crises gislation has also become patchwork as each crisis was addressed the laws addressing threats to agriculture for centuries welldeveloped north american indus try whose risks from nonnative invasions are relatively clear tend to be more developed than laws protecting other industries or ecosystems in consequence agencies whose mission is to address those risks are also better developed yet even there responsibilities to protect agriculture from nonnatives which are establishe d in some regions but not others are diffuse shared or even lacking moreover the enor mous volume of trade makes the burden on understaffed federal inspection systems so severe as to permit only limited or cursory inspections and force strong reliance on selfreporting by importers of living and non living cargo laws protecting the natural ecosystems on which such industries as tourism the electric power industry or city water supplies depend are far less developed in some important instances such laws scarcely exist at all state agency which wishes to bring in sport fish from another continent to benefit its anglers may face few obstacles in doing so much less burden of proof to show that the action will not harm other economic interests natural resources or ecosystems comprehensive us law addresses imports of non native species see federal laws below for summary of current statutory provisions some areas of interest lack laws altogether obligation lies generally with those importing living organisms other than those already known to threaten agriculture to show that the imported species is safe some laws force the burden of proof in the other direction an import is deemed safe unless it is on list of or ganisms known to be harmful special laws to control imports of exotic aquarium fish or pets and the disposal of those pets once owners tire of them are lacking or may be focused on some other issues eghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs4 3 for more information on the legal status of

nation of federal agency efforts under national invasive species management plan developed by an interagency national invasive species council the order direct s all federal agencies to address invasive species concerns as well as refrain from actions likely to increase invasive species problems the national invasive speci council supporte d by an advisory committee was directed to develop reco mmendations for intern ational cooperation promote network to document and monitor invasive species impacts and encourage development of an informationsharin g system on invasive species see national invasive species council below for more information preliminary options for complex problem nonnative species introductions can be divided into those which were intentional or at least known by the pers on bringing in the living organisms and those whose arrival was probably not known to the persons involved while there may be disagreement over which species should be excluded among the many species whose entry is sought there appears to be constituency for unintentional imports rather opposition results from the effects of regulations on trade or travel generally that might arise from efforts to prevent introductions therefore research on which pathways pose the greatest risks and on the least intrusive mechanisms to reduce those risks could offer subs tantial benefits with reduced harm to trade and travel however with the possible exception of controls on balla st water and some agricultural pathways little s been done systematically to identify or control additional high risk pathways congress ma wish to consider requiring studies to identify other high risk pathways b identify or create suitable methods to prevent further introductions via these pathways and c investigate methods to reduce inconvenience of control measures to travelers and shippers using those pathways untreated wood used in pallets packing material crates and barrels airline cargo holds ship hulls holds and ballast tanks used tires etc are among possible targets for broader ri sk assessment or controls in contrast intentional introductions present di fferent set of problems because many deliberate releases of nonnative organisms have not been well planned and have not taken into account the potentially injurious nature of the exotichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs5 5

persons who are unaware that they are bringing in nonnative organismsspecies nor compared the potential risks with expected gains some organizations have developed guidelines nd codes of practice the american fisheries society5 the international council for the explor ation of the sea the world resources institute6 and the food and agriculture organization of the united nations7 have prepared such guidelines to assist regula tory bodies and other groups in determining whether an introduction is justified and then to advise them on what to do after an introduction is approved th guidelines complement the legislation described later in this report by providing conceptual framework for determining whether the risk of introduction is acceptable and then suggesting quarantine monitoring andor adaptive management if an introducti on is approved components of these guidelines have been incorporated in national legislation in the united states and elsewhere rapid response to news of recent intr oduction of an invasive species is also an area being considered for improvement in this respect lessons might be learned from the national interagency fire center nifc primarily under the management of the bureau of land management res ponse to wildfires faces many of the same problems of haste technical needs and interagency and intergovernmental coordination all fede ral land managing agencies participate in the nifc and great deal of the program focuses on work with tr ibal state and local governments to bring many resources to bear on major fires somewhat similar problems are also faced at the federal center for disease control and prevention in atlanta either program might provide models for congressional consideration predicting an invasi on black and white federal laws have tended to focu s on exclusion or black lists ie on species that have already been shown to be harm ful anything not on the list is allowed in contrast to white list anything not on the list is excluded the black list can be prepared in various ways but is usually made up of species already shown to cause serious damage to fisheries endangered species or especially agriculture8 an alternative approach would be to attempt to predict potential harm before species arrival the prediction would be base d on known characteristics of species such as how it reproduces the number of seeds or offspring etc central dilemma however is the difficu lty in making this prediction what characteristics of seed dispersal nesting food and host preferences etc are most likely to lead to exuberant proliferation and result in economic and ecological harm even more fundamentally of the many millions of species on the planet which ones should be tested for example it seems gical that all else being equal plantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs6 9 mark williamson biological invasions london chapman hall 1996 chapter 2 p 2854producing many seeds will be more invasive than those producing few seeds the problem is that all else rarely is equal variety of factors affect invasiveness the abundant seed producer may require speci pollinating insect the newly arrived plant with few seeds may leave behind its major herbivores etc host of other factors may complicate prediction ev idence to date has identified suite of features in plants or animals that seems to be truly reliable predictor of invasiveness and thus many expert s view all importations as suspect one observer argued that somewhat reliable predictor is what he called propagule pressure9 in very simple terms this means that those species that attempt invasions arrive in large numbers most frequently andor with the largest number of arriving individuals are most likely to have some success at invading scientists continue to model various fact ors which might contri bute to invasiveness nonetheless many scientists will likely prefer the strictest possible exclusionary policies including white lists because they lack confidence in these models in contrast number of industries pend in some respect on introductions of nonnative species these industries include florists as well as the horticulture pet and aquarium industries they argue that white list approach would exclude many species that were unlikely to cause harm or else would require inordinate economic burdens on their industries to prove that given imported species was safe further paperwork to prove that an imported speci was indeed one that was on the white list could be burdensome as well these gr oups strongly prefer black list approach whether list is white or black however still implies that the importers actually know they are importing living organisms an effort to prevent unintentional introductions would be co

can transm it diseases to other organisms but are not themselves pathogens are mentioned threat of harmful nonnative species variety of abundant nonnative species have had severe economic impacts on us industries and the natu ral environment the incr easing number of introductions and greater estimates of their cost are causing pressure on congress to develop new responses to the problem for example according to 1993 study by the office of technology assessment ota just 79 of over 4500 nonnative plants and animals in the united states caused over 97 billion in damage between 1906 and 199110 more recent study estimated cu rrent damage from all of the species examined at 123 billion annually11 damage varies by species nd can span an enormous range of effects including power outages loss of farmland property valu contamination of grain spread of disease increased operating costs loss of irrigation water collapse of buildings competition with native plants loss of sport game or endangered species ecosystem disturbance etc some nonnative plants have been not orious for years for causing both economic and ecological damage kudzu melaleuca cordgrass salt cedar purple loosestrife spotted knapweed and russian thistle are just few examples of unwanted plants now causing ecological nd economic harm in large areas of the united states their damage includes lowe ring water tables poisoning humans and livestock decreasing crop yields and incr easing pest control costs serious infestation can cause substan tial losses in property values12 nonnative invertebrate pests are also wellknown gypsy moths japanese beetles asian longhorned b eetles asian tiger mosquitoes fire ants africanized honeybees and zebra mussels are am ong the most wellknown introduced vertebrate pests eg walking catfish lake trout can toad brown tree snakes monk parakeet starlings feral goats bighorn sheep nutria rats etc can also have serious economic and ecological impacts these

difficult by being innocuous they escape study similarly kentucky blue grass poa pratensis which despite its common name may have been an early import from europe now serves as important forage for native herb ivores in much of the united states and its benefits are equally hard to measure 15 estimates of the benefits of desirable nonnative species were f ound short discussion of industries and interests benef itting directly from nonnatives is given on p 23in some of these cases eg kudzu melaleuca gypsy moths africanized bees zebra mussels and starlings the sour ce of the introduction is either known or strongly suspected introducers of some species such as kudzu melaleuca and starlings actually intended that their imports proliferate in the wild their purposes ranged from the practical kudzu for erosion control to the quixotic starlings for purported desire to bring all of the birds mentioned in shakespeares works to the united states whatever the motive society itself was the loser in the importers faustian bargains as the organisms prolif erated to the detriment of the economy native fauna and flora and ecosystems had they foreseen the damage these species would later cause governments at all levels would probabl have worked to prevent these introductions introductions of nonnative species may be intentional or unintentional some intentional introductions produced benefits or at least low vels of harm as in the case of the ringnecked pheasant game bird native to asia unintentionally introduced species may be present for years or decades before their presence is even recognized and the harm that they do if any is measured or observed14 however catastrophic results can come from both accidental introductions eg zebra mussels and inten tional introductions eg hogs to hawaii wide variety of intentional introduc tions have had effects which even if harmful to natural ecosystems or biodi versity have produced economic benefits sufficient to cause acceptance of collateral damage these include such food sources as cattle wheat honeybees kiwi fruit and so ybeans and such ornamentals as tulips chrysanthemums and dawn redwoods to name only few in each case the introduction of these species was very mu ch intentional and their propagation was more or less controlled th economic benefits conveyed by these species are vast and probably exceed the 123 billion figure cited above for the annual costs of non native species15 us agriculture would have far different appearance if it were limited to the several dozen food crops known to have been cultivated in north america before 1492 rather than the hundr eds of crops grown today these non native crops and their benefits are not th focus of this report but should not be forgotten in discussions of those impor ted species which cause serious harm however even in the case of nonnativ species conveying obvious benefits to humans the introductions of nonnatives are not without ancillary dangers sometimes to the interests of those importing the target species cattle can bring in seeds and new diseases tubers can bring in insect pests and soil from roots or hooves can harbor diseases for native pl ants there may be damage to local ecosystems as they are deliberately modified to accommodate new plants or animals in many cases eg tulip cultivation or chicken ranches society has acceptedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs9 16 pimentel reportconversion of land to support these species on the other nd controversies over grazing rights for such nonnatives as ca ttle and sheep show that acceptance is not automatic examples of these attendant ri sks and problems will be considered below this paper will focus on species prone to escaping human control or whose potential for escape is unclear or b rboring or transporting other undesirable species predicting either of these risks is one of the most difficult problems in addressing invasions by nonnative species numbers of nonnative sp ecies in the united states if new kind of tree grows in the forest one hears of it at least not for long time when new organisms are introduced to new site they must find conditions adequate to their needs depending on the biology of the species eg food rainfall temperature or mates and mu st avoid predators and diseas as result scientists agree the great majority of biological introductions whether caused by humans or occurring naturally tend to fail of those that succeed small fraction become serious pests new species can exist in an area for decades without being noticed

nomads crossing the bering strait brought their dogs with them over 10000 years ago polynesians landed in waii bearing pigs rats and crop seeds over 1500 years ago nearly thousand year s ago icelandic settlers in what is now greenland brought cattle sheep and goats with them and perished with them possibly due to reliance on european livestock unable to find fodder in an increasingly harsh climate

remembered largely by specialists according to the ota report estima ted numbers of nonnative species in the united states increased over the past 100 years for all groups of organisms ota examined18 contributing factors include in creases in the number of people traveling the speed and methods of tr avel trade generally improved ability and speed in moving living plants and animals so that more of them survive the journey the increase in modes of transport for hitc hhiking organisms such as ship ballast water pallet wood and airpla ne wheel wells the desire to have familiar sport and game animals in new areas trade in horticultural and garden plants trade in pets and aquarium animals etc geographic origins of nonnative species plants and animals tend to survive best in new site when that site is similar to their original habitat formosan termites arriving in new orleans are much more likely to thrive than formosan termites whose next stop is anchorage and northern european grass seed traveling inside prize bull is much more likely to survive in the chicago area than the same species would in miami thus the plants and animals of northern europe korea northern china japan and

around the world are tending toward increasing biological homogenization as plant and animal species spread and the new arrivals thrive at the expense of natives this reverses the normal evolutionary

forests of the sierra madre in mexico have been separated for millennia by hundreds of miles of desert from ecologically ve ry similar forests of the rockies pests both plant and animal could evolve in comparative isolation in these two areas and be transported only recently with greater links of trade and traffic thus the flora and fauna of either disconnected area could pose thr eat to the

pathways of invasion to some extent pathways of invasion between countries can be predicted the arrival of zebra mussels and their attendant damage to city water supplies and electric utilities in the great lakes area focused much attention on the ballast water of cargo ships as pathway for biotic invasion similarly the propensity of brown tree snakes to hide in the wheel we lls of airplanes has done much to focus attention on air stowaways the recent arrival of asian longhorned beetles may play similar role in focusing attention on pa llet wood packing crates live plants and airport warehouses as pathways and centers of biotic invasi on in general any arrivalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs13 22 according to one author by far the most ecologically disruptive sector of the pet industry is the aquarium trade of those exo tic fish species established in the united states that are completely foreign to the country about 65 percent arrived through the aquarium trade bright p

eventually decided not to cook them and so put them in an aquarium when the fi sh got too big he released them into nearby pond they bred and their presence was discovered over year later see snakeheads belowof living or untreated material water wood soil etc should not be overlooked as possible pathway for biotic invasion comprehensive review of possible pathways their risks options for control and research needs is to the authors knowledge currently lacking within countries certain paths for species invasions are quite predictable in the 19th century the railroads over which cattle were transported were major path for the establishment of new plants in the 20th century the zebra mussel quickly escaped the drainage of the great lakes probably via the artificial connection to the illinois river and began its invasion fart her and farther south into the mississippi river drainage in addition to the accidental introduc tion of nonnative species introductions may occur from species deliberately brought into the country in some cases the importer does not intend for the imported plant or animal to escape to the wild and in other cases the purpose of importation is to promote its spread into natural habitats to achieve some sirable goal in the first category are the imports of non native pets and plants the importer is hardly ever interested in seeing the imported organisms escape but once the specimens are sold control is lost and purchasers sometimes release unwanted nonnative fish from aquaria or garden ponds for example into local lakes or streams often feeling they are doing humane thing by letting the fish go22 garden or greenhouse plan t imported for horticulture may scatter shoots or seeds far more widely th an expected water hyacinths for example were brought from south america in the late 19th century as pool ornaments the plant now covers thousands of acres in the southern united states plus parts of cape cod and california as well

prevention and control the critical first line of fense against harmful nonna tive species is prevention of introductions since success in contro lling these species once established has been poor prevention is desirable from an ecological standpoint and is usually economically advantageous as most established nonnative species cannot be eradicated and controlling them to acceptable levels when or if possible is usually expensive because many deliberate releases of nonnative organisms have not been well planned and have not taken into account the potentially injurious nature of the exotic species nor compared the potential risks with expected gains some organizations have developed guidelines nd codes of practice the american fisheries society24 the international council for the explor ation of the sea the world resources institute25 and the food and agriculture or ganization of the united nations26 have prepared such guidelines to assist regula tory bodies and other groups in determining whether an introduction is justified and then to advise them on what to do after an introduction is approved these guidelines complement legisla tion described later in this report by providing conceptual framework for determining whether the risk of introduction is acceptable and then ggesting quarantine monitoring andor adaptive management if an introducti on is approved components of these guidelines have been incorporated in national legislation in the united states and elsewhere inspections and quarantines are key co mponents of prevention by which the entry of nonnative species via specific pathways might be controlled this approach requires that species recognized as pest s be listed and thus prohibited from entry27 quarantines operate basically on either of two premises 1 invest in strict control at points of entry by which time it could be too late to prevent entry or 2 attempt to control what arrives ie try to act on the source or poi nt of export or regulate the pathway of import ballast water management for ocean vessels is means of quarantine whereby major pathway of potential import for aquatic species is managed quarantine may also be pos ted on an area where nonnative species has been introduced to prevent its furt her spread and promote its eradicationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs15 28 the extensive national public education prog

responsibility of the animal and plant health inspection service aphis of the us department of agriculture usda in addition various states particularly california arizona and florida and territori conduct their own inspection programs aimed at agricultural pests however inspections and quarantines may not be effective for many species especially nontarget h itchhiking species species which enter via uncontrolled or unrecognized pa thways and species that have invasive potential but are not yet recognized as pests public education also plays critical role in preventing the introduction of harmful nonnative species campaigns have been relatively effective in educating the public about the hazards of brin ging nonnative plant species home from vacation or releasing undesirable exotic pets or aquaria life into the wild28 agriculture extension offices and the mass media are two generally effective means for distributing popular informati on to the public in addition the importance of educating specific groups such as dock workers and vessel cr ew members about controlling harmful nonnative species could be emphasized and might be integrated when possible with regulatory measures if exclusion and quarantines fail to keep nonnative species out of an area and species becomes established the problem shifts to control of the pest which includes preventing its spread between local areas and beyond any established perimeter control of harm ful nonnative species is divi ded into two related tasks eradication where possible and reduction to manageabletolerable levels29 where eradication is not possible single method of control is likely to be panacea few control methods if any promise er adication under conditions where species is wellestablished but seve ral methods especially when used in combination and continuously might reduce some target sp ecies populations to tolerable levels30 eradicating very small popula tions before they become established

early in the process of formulating and evaluating control alternatives and to answer questions from the public about possible hum an health economic and other effects from control programs the pros and cons of these nine strategies and some of the information needed to apply them are described below31 comparatively more discussion is provided on biological cont rol methods as they can sometimes involve the introduction of add itional nonnative species baits and attractants baits and attractants may be used to draw unsuspecting individuals of target sp ecies toward potential source of food or mates see the additional discussion be low on pheromones under herbicides and pesticides biological where the target species can be count ed trapped killed or studied difficulties with baits and attractants commonly include sustaining long term monitoring effort and preventing harm to nontarget species baits and attractants seem most promising when the area needing protection is welldefined with clear boundaries and has signifi cant density of the target species traps trap use is limited primarily by cost time required to service traps and inability of traps to control target species over large areas various trap designs are available and most are used in combination with some type of bait for confined areas such as cargo holds buildings etc traps may be relatively successful on the other hand traps have obvious drawbacks in open situations w ith either abundant alternative food or very low target species densities traps are comparatively safe to use although they require some care when trapped individuals are killed and removed sticky traps have been used on rodents and brown tree snakes chinese mitten crabs have been trapped at irrigation screens during their downstream migration to spawn in saltwater fumigants repellents and barriers designed for confined spaces lethal substances can be used to target pests in confined areas or to prevent them from crossing geographic bottleneck thes methods can be used either to create pestfree islands in zone of infestation or to prevent invasive species from leaving an infested area via boxes cargo holds etc some species are known to avoid certain substances such as tear gas or gasoline obviously these substances can be used only to limited extent in areas where ther is infrequent human access rather than in areawide application fumigants can so be used to kill or exclude pests from confined areas such as cargo containers for example the environmental protection agency has approved methyl bromide32 as fumigant for the brown tree snake light is also known to repel some nocturnal animals submerged surfaces have been electrified at water and power facilities to discourage the settling of zebra mussel larvae and on ship hulls to inhibit barnacle settlement physical barriers can be used to prevent range extensions and access to new habitats such as the electrical

pheromones are given off that allow males and females to find each other sex pheromones work even when target species densities are low and they are highly speciesspecific for example disparlure the commercially synthesized sex pheromone of the female gypsy moth is used to trap male gypsy moths because it is sometimes difficult to determine whether natural pesticide controls pest by nontoxic means epa has established committee to determine whether pesticide meets the criteria for consideration as biochemical pesticide 35 public concern has arisen over the use of bt in some situations eg for controlling asian gypsy moths because of possible adverse he alth effects that may occur in people with compromised immune systems 36 both the protein and its genetic material are regulated by epa the plant itself is not regulatedbeing constructed by the army corps of engineers in the chicago sanitary and ship canal to prevent or reduce the dispersal of invasive aquatic species between the great lakessaint lawrence drainage and the missi ssippi river drainage screens are used to prevent the movement of aquatic plant fragments within waterways however care is required to ensure that barriers do not impede the migratory behavior or natural dispersal of native species herbicides and pesticides these chemical control agents can be subdivided into those derived from ma nufactured conventi onal or natural biological sources conventional where chemical control is an option herbicides and pesticides affecting or controlling only one or group of related species are strongly preferable since broadly toxic substances risk subs tantial harm to nontarget species for example tfm 3trifluor omethyl4 nitrophenol is very specific in its toxicity to the larval stage of lamprey similarly variety of aquatic herbicides can be used specifically for the control of hydrilla and water hyacinth however even if pesticides are highly specific safety precautions often suggest the use of chemical control in conjunction with baits thereby fu rther reducing risks to pets children and other nontarget organisms biological biological herbicides and pestic ides also known as biopesticides are derived from natural materials such as animals plants bacteria and certain minerals at the end of 2001 there were approximately 195 regi stered biopesticide active ingredients and 780 products33 biopesticides can be divided into three major classes 1 biochemical pesticides are naturally occurring substances eg pheromones that control pests by nontoxic mechanisms eg interfering with mating34 2 microbial pesticides contain microorganism eg bacterium fungus virus or protozoan as the active ingredient such as various types of the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis bt used to control certain insects harmful to cabbages potatoes and other crops35 and 3 plantincorporated protectants are pesticides that plants produce from genetic material that has been added to the plant such as when the gene for the bt pesticid protein is introduced into plants own genetic material causing the plant to manufacture the substance that destroys pests36 although biopesticides tend to pose fewer risks than conventiona l pesticides theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs18 37 the usda requires proof of hostspecificity before supporting an insect introduction for nonnative plant controltend to be less toxic usually are effective in very small quantities often decompose quickly and generally affect only the target pest and closely rela ted organisms users need to know great deal about managi ng pests to employ them effectively biological control biological control orga nism competes with preys on parasitizes or causes disease in targeted pest species ideally biological control agents attack the target species and others37 considerable knowledge of both the target species and the control organisms basic biology and ecology is necessary to select suitable control screening require ments vary for selectin g biological control agents with very stringent requirements fo r some uses while requirements for other uses may be nonexistent together indi vidual state laws and aphis through 7 cfr 371 regulate the introducti on of biological control organisms and the usda through the agricultural research service administers biological control documentation program particular concern with biological control organisms is that they might commence feeding on nontarget species once ta rget species are spar or eradicated an example of this problem is mong oose introductions in the 1600s mongooses were introduced in puerto rico to eradicate rats which they did with great success unfortunately mongooses proliferated and be gan to eat variety of birds and other native animals similarly the house sparrow passer domesticus or english sparrow was brought from europe to cont rol the canker worm this nonnative bird now crowds out native birds and damages crops in recognition of these problems vertebrate animals with broad feeding bits are seldom if ever used today as biological control agents production and release of large numbers of sterilized males has been particularly successful in controlling various insect pests eg medflies screwworm flies cochliomyia hominivorax and sea lamprey competitive mating by sterilized males results in lower reproductive rates for th invasive species population reducing its abundance and potentially c ontrolling population spread using disease or selective parasite may be an attractive option in some circumstances but again there is risk that the disease or parasite will attack non target species fieldwork in target species native habitat is usually necessary to identify diseases or parasites to which the target species may be susceptible although the requisite research might be ex pensive using biological control agents holds hope for longterm control the alligator weed flea beetle agasicles hygrophila for control of alligator weed alternanthera philoxeroides and the current program usin g several beetles galerucella pusilla g calmariensis and hylobius transversovitattus to control purple loosestrife are success stories for biological control of plants the brow n tree snake of guam could be possible candidate for biological cont rol since there is only one snake native to guam and its habitat is quite different from the brow n tree snakes thus the chance of an introduced parasite or disease affecting the native snake species is minimalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs19 natural biological control can also ccur through adaptive ecosystem response by native species to invasive species an example is the indigenous weevil euhrychiopsis lecontei which is specialist feeder on northern water milfoil myriophyllum sibiricum once this weevil is exposed to the nonnative eurasian water milfoil m spicatum it appears to change its feeding habits to preferentially feed upon the eurasian variety in oregon the native defoliating butterfly vanessa cardui feeds on introduced thistles cirsium arvense and c vulgare other forms for biological control ma involve planting competitive vegetation and managing livestock grazing for example grazing by sheep and goats can be an effective management tool for controlling leafy spurge bounties and commerc ial exploitation under bounty system someone is paid to catch and kill the targ et species high bounties may have to be paid to encourage sufficient control that results in substantial effect on the target species population the problem however is that paying bounties can create market incentive particular risk when population dwindles to very low levels and prices go up or bounties are increase d in addition thes methods may have incidental adverse ecological consequences for native species arising from increased human traffic and collecting methods in august 1999 the ca lifornia department of fish and game decided against per mitting the commercial rvest of nonnative chinese mitten crabs concluding that such harvest would not contribute to controlling this species and might encourage further introductions cultivation control use of such measur as timing of fertilizer applications adjustment of planting da tes and crop rotation can be valuable management and control tools for invasi ve weeds some cultivation control methods while minimal in cost and quipment may require an additional commitment of labor and are unlikely to be effective unless combined with other control methods mechanical removal mechanical controls may be used to collect and remove large volumes of invasive nonnative species particularly plants mechanical harvesters may be used in the manageme nt of nonnative aquatic vegetation such as hydrilla and water hyacinth but are ineffective for control of these species on large bodies of water mechanical controls are also used to prevent the further spreading of established nonnative species and includ methods such as cleaning of equipment eg during highway constructi on and using certified weedfree seed and feed eg weed seeds have been mechanically excl uded or removed mechanical control of terrestrial plants includes such basic procedures as handpulling and mowing some of these methods may require expensive specialized equipment or substantial commitment of labor to be effective site removal the recently introduced asian longhorned beetle still perhaps at low enough levels to have some slight chance of being eradicated is currently being controlled to some degree by removi ng all trees on which the pests might feed in neighborhoods where they have been found site removal has also been used in california to eradicate hydrilla by draining small ponds and filling their depressions with earth such drastic strategy would be unworkable if pest becomes widely dispersedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs20 38 some writers argue that evidence is lack ing on how disturbance affects susceptibility to invasions but scientists generally accept th idea that severe depletion of an ecosystems flora and fauna eg through fire storm volcanic eruption etc does offer significant opportunities for newly arrived species since the new arrivals face reduced competition in disturbed habitat 39 w belleville critter patrol florida news magazine of the orlando sentinel star 29 may 1994 812 15 some of this paragraph may reflect the reporters view of the subject more than strict interpretation of fact for example not all of the species mentioned actually reproduce in south florida in focusi ng only on exotic pets however the paragraph understates floridas problem unusually susceptible habitats harmful nonnative species occur thr oughout the united states but some ecosystems are more susceptible to invasion than others mild climate geographic isolation disturbance of the natural landscape38 and high rate of exposure to non native species are all factors which can make habitat particularly susceptible to invasion islands and other longisolated areas with uni plants and animals are also known to be particularly sceptible to invasive species hawaii and florida for example each have many threatened and endangered species and not coincidenta lly plethora of harmful nonnatives both states were long isolated biologically and have rge numbers of native species found nowhere else the mild climates of florida and hawaii make it easier for the rich flora and fauna from the rest of the tropical and semitropical regions to survive and also make the states attractive to businesses that im port and maintain or even breed nonnative animals and plants such as tropical fishes and ornamental plants in florida the number of nonnatives seemed ove rwhelming to local reporter in southern florida especially untrammeled whims of humans have introduced so many species of nonfarm animals mainly as pets that the native fauna is greatly diluted

pimentel report p 1 water daily for decades or even centuries are at severe risk of invasions even if only tiny proportion of newly arri ving nonnative species survive in the new habitat of san francisco bay chesapeake bay or boston harbor the actual number of successful invasive species may be very large the areas around airports with increasing volumes of international traffic nd tourism are also at risk in addition the greater the similarity of the point of origin the more likely the invasion is to be successful for example biotic invasion of the hawaiian islands is more likely to come from plane originating in guam than one originating in anchorage available estimates of costs and impacts it is difficult to quantify the damage due to invasive species one study by pimentel and his colleagues put annual co sts and damage due to nonnative species at 123 billion per year40 the study included information about the overall costs of excluding nonnatives the assumptions us ed in the study to make these estimates may be questioned as over or understating the costs pr obably two scientists or economists would make the same assumptions to derive such an estimate as one of the first attempts to make broad estimate over very large range of species the figure of 123 billion should be construed an informed estimate and the interested reader should examine the report itself to assess the validity of the assumptions used to derive the figures the handful of species highlighted in this report alone cau annual losses over 35 billion and two formosan termite and asian river cl am are responsible for 1 billion each in control costs diminished property values and other damage even if new imports of nonnatives were completely lted near impossibility the costs of controlling established nonna tive species would continue the value and the cost of prevention are difficult to assess in the absence of any other information since the first several thousand harmful nonnative species ie those for which any numbers could be gathered collectively were estimated to cause about 123 billion annually in costs nd damage it seems reasonable to assume that the next several thousand to arri ve and become established could cause comparable economic damage damage could include the same types of damage already known to affect economies and eco systems through power outages changes in flood regimes increased erosion loss of farmland property va lue contamination of grain spread of disease increased operating costs inefficient irrigation higher risk of fire collapse of buildings loss of sport game or endangered species ecosystem disturbance etc there could also be ffects on industries or ecosystems that have not yet been markedly harmed by nonnatives eg the threat to fall tourism and the maple syrup industry in new engl and from asian longhor ned beetles which attack and kill variety of tree species but are particularly fond of maple trees and their relatives targeting each newly arriving nonnative species individually seems very likely to be more costly than targeting pathways or groups of species focus on highrisk pathways could be more co steffective over the long rm but pathways approachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs22 41 the manager of one national wildlife refuge in hawaii told one of the crs authors that control efforts at all would be attempted at that time in one distant area of the refuge that was overrun with nonnative species since only very substantial budget and time commitments would produce results and any effort short of that would be waste of money failing that control efforts were instead dir ected to other areas with greater chances of success within available budgets restorati on costs at that refuge might therefore be considered either zero or completely insurmountableitself has costs as evinced by debate over the arrival of the as ian longhorned beetle in an effort to stop or slow the entry of this widespread

the controls threatened trade war with china it also escalated federal government attention to the problem of nonnatives to the highest levels of government see asian longhorned beetle below another cost of biological invasion is restoration of disturbed habitat if it is undertaken at all damage due to an inva sive species tends to rise as the species becomes established education of the pub lic

eradicating the nonnative typically increase s and once the species is established over wide area eradication could be virtually impossible for any reasonably foreseeable sum if nonnative beco mes

volunteers to pull nonnative plants hiring sh arpshooters or trappers to kill or capture animals transporting animals to native habitat dredging streams and lakes poisoning lakes etc many restoration efforts coul d involve not only major costs but also substantial political controversy41 the controversy illustrates the dilemma for policymakers specifically the high cost to many industries ven

while the ecological damage from some nonnative species can be great only small percentage of arriva ls have proved to be economi cally harmful and many are beneficial42 for many species the economic impacts are simply unknown some industries rely heavily on nonnatives fo r example nearly all food plants and animals in the united states are not native to the areas where they are now grown besides agriculture industries relying sign ificantly on nonnative species include the nursery aquaculture and pet industries most woody invasive plants in the unite d states were originally introduced by the landscape industry43 the giant hogweed whose toxic sap can cause severe scarring was introduced as an ornamental but escaped cultivation and is now widely listed as noxious weed44 similarly water hyacinths were introduced apparently as an ornamental fo r garden ponds see gallery below as result of this and similar escapes the nursery industry has been subjected to increasing criticism states are increasing their regulation of potentially invasive species45 some of those species are economically important to th nursery industry some industry groups have been working to develop voluntary cont rols to lessen the risk of inadvertent introduction of invasive plants production from private aquaculture n early tripled from 1985 to 1999 and was worth more than 987 million in 199946 many cultured species are not native there is concern about the escape and blishment of cultivated species that may be harmful to native ones examples include the threat of atlantic salmon in the pacific northwest and the inadvertent intr oduction of diseases such as dermo and msx in oysters or of other pest species concerns are similar for the aquarium and exotic pet trades which rely heavily on

lakes suburba n trees texas lawns are not the specific responsibility of one federal agency with so many pathways for the entry of nonnatives so many possible ente ring species and so many possible and nearly unknowable injured species the natu ral ecosystem as whole has specific guardian this scattered re sponsibility is result of the evolving legal history of species protection49 agriculture and import regulation us law concerning native wild plants and animals is not comprehensive body at the federal level under our system inherited from english legal tradition and stated very simply the government regulates the take of native wild animals generally and landowners c ontrol the native and other plants growing on their lands wild deer walking across pa sture does not belong to the landowner but is rather the governments to regulate the bush it eats belongs to the landowner thus colonial governments regulated native wild animals and after the us constitution was ratified the states retained the rights they previously had as colonies to control the wildlife within their boundaries aside from special rules for lands owne d by the federal government federal native wildlife law can be thought of as ries of exceptions to the general concept that states regulate wild animals nd landowners manage or dont manage wild plants some of the major exceptions to that generalization include federal laws regulating the taking of migratory birds pursuant to treaties marine mammals and endangered species the great majority of native wild plant and animal species do not fall into any of these categories and therefore are not direct federal responsibilities under current law native wild flora and fauna are freque ntly protected as consequence of protecting something else agriculture and endangered species for example where there have been specifi c injuries to other industrie s or interests utility intakes for example the pathway by which the rmful species arrived may be regulated to prevent other nonnatives arriving via that pathway natural ecosystems as result of the threats to other interests may benefit from an incidental reduced risk of harm arriving by pathway that is controlledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs25 50 plants are commonly covered under somewhat di fferent provisions than animals are to be covered under the lacey act plants must be indigenous to any state and either protected under the convention on international trade in endangered species or under state law protecting species threatened with extinction thus state like hawaii apparently could not use the lacey act to help enforce th at states laws designed to keep out common native mainland plants on the other hand the act might help the same state exclude animal pests from other states whether native to the state of origin or not 51 the term wildlife can have various meanings in federal and state laws including game species game species except fish mammals rather than birds or the entire animal kingdomfederal laws federal law concerning nonnative species is scattered laws focus on the broad problems of nonnative species th eir interception prevention and

for importing wild animals under humane and healthful conditions51 one portion of the act 18 usc 42 ppears to give the secretary of the interior and the secretary of the treasury considerable power to exclude three major categories of nonnative animals vertebrates crustaceans and mollusks moreover grounds for exclusion were expanded bey ond the traditional harm to agriculture horticulture and forestry interests to include harm to wildlife and wildlife resources the inclusion of the latte r could mean that nearly any nonnative member of these groups could be consider ed for exclusion ce most and perhaps all ecologists would hold that the proliferation of any nonnative species in an ecosystem risks harm to its wildlife resources the reach of the law is somewhat unclear however is the

nepa pl 91190 as amended 42 usc 4321 et seq requires among other things that federal agencies consider and consult with the public about the environmental effects of their actions the primary mechanism to achieve this end is the preparation of environmental impact statements eiss for major federal actions affecting the environment agencies are expected not only to prepare eiss but also to comment on the eiss prepared by other agencies53 this law could apply to so introductions of nonnative species if federal action might affect the risk of introducin g or spreading nonnative species thereby having significant impact on the natura l and human environments the associated eis would have to address this possibility the limitations of nepa visavis its application to nonnative species include limited applicability to actions without federal connection inapplicability to completed fede ral actions although these actions may have effects that c ontinue into the present limited utility if the possibility of introducing nonnative species is not foreseen and the inability of scientists to provi agency administrators with the information necessary to assess the risks or consequences associated with introducing most nonnative species if nepa is invoked the opportunity for si gnificant analysis of proposed action via an eis is great the resulting analysis may cause modification or abandonment of some actions or alternatives if seriou s objections are raised however because nepa is essentially procedur it does not by itself prevent an activity even if the risk of unfavorable environm ental outcomes is high nonetheless failure to consider the issue of nonnative introductions could be grounds for requiring an agency to amend its eis thereby delaying the in troduction and risk while the revision is preparedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs28 54 for more information about the generally see crs issue brief ib10072 endangered species difficult choices endangered species act the esa54 pl 93205 as amended 16 usc 15311543 focuses its attention on species that are rare not thos that are common to the point of being weeds or pests however the strong protections offered under the for rare species may provide vehicle for regulatin g nonnative species for example in the pacific northwest the thr eat to resident salmon speci protected under is major argument being used against the in troduction or expansion of aquaculture for atlantic salmon similarly introduction of mountain goats in an area where they are not native would be more likely to be stioned if there are local endangered or threatened plants likely to be harmed by the goats could provide protection in two ways first if the introduction were to be carried out by federal agency or requi re licensing financ ial support permits etc from federal agency the agency involve d would have to consult with fws or national marine fisheries service nmfs to determine whether the introduction or action leading to introduction would tend to jeopardize the continued existence of the listed species or adversely modify its critical habitat if so the introduction would usually be prevented or modified to reduce the risk second if the action had federal nexus but its effect s could result in taking as defined in the act listed species the party carrying out the action w ould have to obtain an incidental take permit from fws or nmfs questions of knowledge intent and cau sality affect whether violations under the have occurred and whether penalties may be applied therefore as practical matter is an unlikely lternative for penalizing the introduction of nonnative species because the persons re sponsible for introducing many nonnative species may never be known nd introduction is often inadvertent for example it is not known who intr oduced zebra mussels and it is likely that their probable introduction via ballast water was uni ntentional in addition introductions may go unnoticed for long time compounding the difficulty in determining responsibility for example the introductions of the br own tree snake on guam went unnoticed for years after their arrival though the brown tree snake is strongly suspected of being directly responsible for the extinction of several species on guam consequently enforcement actions under in the usual sense are unlikely however the policies of the and the duty of federal agencies to ensure that federal actions will not jeopa rdize species listed under the act may result in changes in certain practices and the tightening of regulation of potential pathways eg greater regulation of ballast water practices or design requirements for aircraft cargo holds to reduce the chance of biological stowaways although there may be some circumstances in which the will play role congress may see new laws more directly and better suited to the preven tion of introductions as also

short distances eg from san francisco bay which is highly invaded to puget sound which is less so and therefore likely to be carrying live organisms are exempt from controls with the exception of the great lakes critics point out that ecological surveys or ma nagement actions have been funded for inland waters such as the colorado rio gr ande or missouri ri vers in addition they claim that sections of nisa pertaini ng to invasive plan t management have not been funded or used others are critical of the provisions of 16 usc 4711k2a giving the vessel owner blanket exempti on to ignore any

both sections are part of the lacey act aspea does not make any new categories of plants or animals illegal to ship but rather makes it clear that use of the us mail is included among those forms of transport whose use is illegal for shipment of prohibited species pea appears to do very little to prevent the introduction of non native species especially if the sender is unaware that the shipped items are prohibited under the bove laws but aspea does appear to add one more law to the arsenal under which pros ecutors might bring cases involving shipment of various speci including nonnative species to court wild bird c onservation act of 1992 wbca the wbca pl 102440 16 usc 4901 et seq does not focus on the prevention of invasions by nonnative species but rather on the conservation of birds caught in the wild in foreign countries and imported into this country by regulating imports of certain wild birds the wbca may reduce imports of nonnative parasites and diseases that could affect wild popul ations of native birds prevention of invasions would therefore be potential effect of the law rather than its purpose it also could reduce the chance that an importe d wild bird

2000 the plant protection act of 2000 ppa 7 usc 7701 et seq consolidated several plant quarantine aut horities some dating back to the 1880s it gives the secretary of agriculture the authority to prohibit or restrict the importation exportation and the interstate movement of plants plan t products certain biological control organisms noxious weeds and plant pests62 the statute also gives the secretary the authority to inspect foreign plant imports to quarantine any state or premise infested with new pest or noxi ous weed and to coope rate with states in certain control and eradica tion actions these authorities have been traditional hallmarks of us plant pest regulations and are administered by aphis in collaboration with state depa rtments of agriculture and their plant protection boards traditionally all states have some type of domestic quarantin laws but federal regulations preempt state actions in interstate commerce the new plant protection act however allows states to petition the secretary for special needs exceptions to federal rules exceptions granted by the secretary would allow states more control over movement of certain plant material across their borders regulations for applying the new petition process have not yet been issued but the secretaries still would retain the power to grant these special need petitions the new law also allows individuals or states to petition the secretary of agriculture to add or remove plant pests from federal regulation regu lation of foreign nd interstate plant movement has been important to prevent or limit the

by the authority provided for in article ii of the constitution and specific constitutional authority granted to the president permits such action similarly act of congress empowers the president to take such executive action therefore executive order 13112 could potentially be challenged continuedthe authority to impose quarantines has also been an important element of federal plant protection statutes histor indicates however that the outcome of domestic quarantines is seldom certain for example under the authorities of this act and preceding ones aphis has for decad imposed quarantines to prevent the spread of imported fire ants which can be rbored in the root balls of nursery plants or in sod and soil its geographical range however continues to expand on the other hand the successful efforts to eradi cate the mediterranean fruit fly medfly in california and florida and those to prevent witchweed from spreading into midwestern states attest to levels of success the ppa includes new authorities for controlling noxious weeds and for regulating biological control agents u nder the ppa states and others have statutory process to list or delist pest s and weeds based on scienceproven special local needs the act expands the definiti on of noxious weed to include any plant that could bring harm to agriculture pub lic health navigation irrigation natural resources or the environment this ne w definition could poten tially allow federal action on hundreds of invasive plant species not previously regulated the old federal noxious weed act allowed regulation of limited number of invasive weeds restricting actions onl against weeds new to or not widely prevalent in the united states significantly under the new law noxious weeds would now be treated as other plant pests in respect to the declaration of emergencies the secretary of agriculture will have the authority to declare an emergency when newly introduced noxious weed poses signif icant threat and to transfer money from other agencies or corporations of the partment including the commodity credit corporation to cover the cost of eradicating the weed the ppa also clarifies the extent of the secretarys authority to regulate biological control agents and encourages the usda other federal agencies and the states to facilitate biological control of pests and other invasive species whenever feasible the act also provides usda with guidance on how to regulate the movement of biological control organism s and authorizes usda participation in activities that enable the effective transfer of biological

constituency criticized the executive order as an attempt to rule by decree and as threat to rural life and property64 however search of website s of groups which had expressed concern earlier suggests that by and large this concern is ntioned less frequently now than when the order was first issued the pet and nursery industries are another important constituency affected by the or der

port inspection are to be transferred to the new department of ho meland security it is unclear how much emphasis the new department can be expected to place on interdiction or contro l of nonnative species whose entry could be characterized as mistakes rather than attacks and whose effects might be primarily economic or environmental rather than acutely dangerous to society even so case could be made that the same precautions designed to avoid bioterrorism could also reduce biological invasi ons whose origins are not terrorists the focus on terrorism is too new to determine how it will affect invasive species problemsagency responsibilities programs and implementation these entries describe how federal agencies address non native species concerns most of these programs also address problems of native pest species or other domestic issues agency devotes large percentage of its resources to nonnative species issues even so in some cases eg aphis nonnative species account for substantial portion of the workload in others eg coast guard non native species are minor share of the total program outside of some activities in the agricultural sector evidence was found of efforts in any agency to control the exports of us species which could become harmful or invasive in the countries receiving them the management plan of the national invasive species c ouncil while discussing impr ovements in international cooperation in general terms does not describe any specific agency tasks which the united states itself might identify to preven t the spread of us species that might cause harm in other countries interagency efforts national invasive species council the nisc and its member agencies supported by its advisory committee was to develop recommendations for international coopera tion promote network to document and monitor invasive species impacts and encourage development of an informationsharing system on invasive species the c ouncil released the first national invasive species management plan meeting the invasive species challenge in january 2001 and recommended nine goals for invasive species management with the help of the advisory committee it also recommended research needs and measures to minimize the risk of species introductions66 the report constitutes the major federal attempt to date to coordinate inva sive species actions over broad range of species and habitats across federal stat and local governments and with private industry interest groups and private individuals some of the major features in the three key areas of prevention early detection and ra pid response and c ontrol and management are given belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs37 prevention actions in the plan include an effort to increase

taxonomic expert s particularly where the need risk is greatest developing methods to detect pa thogens and parasites that may affect the health of humans or any other species monitoring locations for likely introductions eg ports highways railroads airports construction sites etc creating convenient systems to id entify and report the presence of invasive species to federal state tribal and local governments as well as to share this and variety of related information via the web to interested parties including the public by 2003 the establishment by nisc and other federal government agencies of program to coordina response to incipient invasions including interagency response team s having members with range of expertise testing detection and control methods to termine which are most appropriate for pot ential invasionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs38 proposing revisions of current policies and procedures eg for quarantines pesticide applicati ons interagency jurisdictional

but is markedly limited in its ability to work on any but nps lands see discussion of nps below control and management acti ons in the plan include identifying and adopting sanitation methods to prevent the spread of invasives eg controlling the use of contaminated soils requiring pestfree mulch sod and ballast water and re stricting the transfer of potentially contaminated firefighting or construction equipment by january 2002 developing by epa proposal to cooperate further with private industry for th use of pesticides to control invasives in manner consistent with pesticide laws such proposal has been published as yet by january 2002 developing and proposing draft legislation by usda to the president to authorize matching funds for states to manage invasive species and to c ontrol invasives on state or private lands with the consent of the owner such proposal has been published as yet by january 2003 nisc to issue guidelines for ranking invasive species control projects at local regional and ecosystem levels this plan is to be updated biennially to report on progre ss toward recommended goals and objectives the council is to assess the effectiveness of this order at least once every 5 years with report to the office of management and budget on whether the order should be revised efforts to control invasive species have been remarkably bipartisan with little difference in approach between republicans and democrats per while some have advocated more or less spending for invasive species probl ems differences tend to be regional rather than partisan

discovered very few instances eg smallpox nutria in east anglia uk of control measures on wellestablished species leading to long term eradication for established species er adication is extremely improbable for very recent arrivals it could be possible in c ontrast prevention here including reduction in the number of nonnatives establishing bree ding populations each year is probably more feasiblecoverage of laws or policy actions and approaches comprehensive legislation on the trea tment of nonnative species has never been enacted and single law provides coordination among federal agencies in 1993 the office of technology assessment found the current federal framework is largely uncoordinated patchwork of laws regulations policies and programs some focus on narrowly drawn problems many others peripherally address nonindi genous species in general present federal efforts only partially match the problems at hand94 in the intervening decade nisc has taken substantial steps toward sharing more information across governments and with the public it has also begun to coordinate actions of federal agencies asking specific agencies to take the lead in developing policies within their existing legisla tive mandates through its 2001 report meeting the invasive species challenge it has also outlined set of actions some planned and few completed to addr ess the bulk of existing problems these actions include developing legislative proposals to fill gaps in current law to date legislative effort has involved an ad hoc focus on wellestablished probl ems the clear invasion of single species handful of specific pathwa ys of introduction or damage or risks to agriculture if congress should choose to regulate nonnative species across range of species ecosystems or pathways ar ticle i section 8 clause 3 of the constitution with its broad authority to regu late interstate comme rce appears to give it the authority to do so current laws do not clearly address prevention of biological invasion across foreseeable pathways besides ship ballast water or b explicit direction on management during that critical period between the introduction or intentional release of new nonnative species and wh the species becomes established and focus must shift from prevention to control95 many scientists assert that the period shortly after introduction offers one last chance to stop new harmful nonnative from becoming established moreover there may be economic and ecological savings from early intervention for example the effort to capture single snake that might be brown tree snake newly arrived at an airport in honolulu even if it were to cost tens of thousands of dollars c ould prevent the expenditure of millions of dollars annually to control the snake if it were to become established on oahu and millions more in damage or compensation for losses due to the snake congress could address these gaps either by explicitly delegating such authority to the president or by crafting legislationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs56 96 history did not provide grounds for optimism that the new order would be implemented effectively the ota report noted p 166 that the 1977 order in practice has been ignored by most federal agencies moreover the fish and wildlife service has yet 15 years later to implement the order in regula tions although specifically directed to do so opposition to proposed fws regulations came primarily from agriculture zoos game ranches aquaculture and the pet trade revised version was opposed strongly by the hobby fish industry the ota report also notes that at that time major industry supported the proposed fws regulations however the early years of the nisc suggest that this pattern may have changed substantiallyunder current approaches species are selected for control primarily based on the record of damage they have already inflicted rather than for preventing damage that may occur in the future ce predicting which species may produce catastrophic effects is difficult see predicting an invasion above some agencies have or are moving to pathways of invasion approach sometimes with the support or direction of specific legislation eg for ballast water exchange there appear to be current efforts to iden tify additional likely pa thways of invasion however see approaches to regulation sp eciesbyspecies vs pathways below also little emphasis has been placed on prev enting the export of native species from the united states to other countries where they are not native see box p 6 even though president carters 1977 executive orde r instructed federal agencies to use their existing authorities to do so president clintons executive order 13112 on invasive species see description above was step toward more comprehe nsive approach u ltimately it could lead to greater agency attention to nonnative sp ecies its stated purpose and to greater coordination among agencies96 however coordination of current efforts alone means that where current efforts have gaps due to lack of coverage by existing laws or agency jurisdiction those gaps will remain the 1999 executive order directed agencies to consider the impact of introdu ced species abroad but it did not prohibit exports of species not nativ to the receiving country the order also created the national inva sive species council subsequently the nisc has brought about major impr ovements in informationsharing among federal agencies and with state local and private officials among other things federal agencies working with the nisc have met to examine invasive species problems in light of their existing authorities and sought to allocate their efforts to those areas geographic and topical that are not handled by other agencies federal agency actions patchwork the nisc has become the federal focus for efforts to control and prevent non native species affecting broad range of industries or ecosystems however many of the shortages of personne l which hampered efforts to limit the entrance of and damage from nonnative rmful species remain some agencies have particularly focused on this problem the agriculture forestry sector is the clear focus of aphis and the army corps of engineers has led the control of nonnative aqua tic plants aphis can regu late imports of plants or animals that are listed as agricultural threats to this country but its authority tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs57 97 if they reach pest levels the wildlife services program within aphis can take steps to control pest populations 98 there is parallel with the state waterfowl hunting laws in the early 20th century states with restrictive conservationoriented laws were literally outgunned by states with more permissive laws when the waterfowl migrated through several states pressure from state governments and their hunters seeking to put all states on an equal footing in the burden of conservation was significant factor lead ing to federal migratory bird hunting lawsregulate living plants or animals once they are admitted is more limited most significantly it does not regulate the release of species into the wild once they have been admitted unless the species is already designated noxious weed or disease carrier it can for example inspect im ported emus or ostric hes for the sake of protecting domestic poultry from foreign diseases but after the markets for these birds crashed some years ago and many we re released by emu ranchers aphis did not have authority to control re lease of this nonnative species97 neither does aphis regulate the commercial sale of species that are already wellestablished purple loosestrife norway maple and english ivy continue to be widely sold in commercial nurseries even though all are important pests their sale does not violate federal law see di scussion of purple loosestrife in the gallery below for example the sale of some of these plants is forbidden by some states but the plant could be purchased legally in one state and then moved along with household effects to another thereby obvia ting the protection of the second states laws98 while these species spread naturally their sale in nurseries offers new opportunities to introduce such species in entirely new areas where they are not currently found even as expensive control effo rts occur in other parts of their ranges the army corps of engineers attempts to control noxious aquatic plant species eg hydrilla and other impediments to inla nd navigation yet the corps has role in preventing or regulating the release of such pests in the first place hydrilla infestations in florida and the potomac river for example were very likely caused by aquarium hobbyists dumping fish tank cont ents it is unclear whether the dumpers violated any state or fede ral laws even though their acts have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars of private and taxpayer costs see hydrilla below while the noxious aquatic plant program has been active in the past it has been reduced somewhat in shift in the balance from federal to greater local responsibilities for maintenance and operation costs in contrast fws does not ve authority to provide general protection for the countrys ecosystems nor even to prot ect those species popul ar for hunters and anglers it could not stop an african game fish for instance from being released in the bayous of louisiana or the mountai n streams of wyoming on the presumption that it would unbalance local ecosystems if th fish were to spread only if fws knew that the species might harm speci protected under would it have clear authority to stop the importation and release similarly if there were an effort to import new grass to improve forage on na tional grasslands it is unclear whether fws could prevent the release of the sp ecies on general ecological grounds nmfs has even less regulatory authority ce its responsibilities for inland waters are limited and largely confined to demonstrable effects on anadromous specieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs58 99 however good deal of information on quatic nuisance species was already collected by the ans task force which preceded the niscprotected under without clear federal legal author ity to protect the nations ecosystems except in agriculture the in formation sharing under nisc takes on even greater importance since simply informing responsible parties of the risks of their proposed actions may be one of the few vehicles available to deter potentially damaging releases interaction of state and federal programs the nisc has begun to step into the role of coordinato r for federalstate responses to nonnative species99 at the same time states do not appear to have role in carrying out many of the federal laws to prevent the invasion of harmful non native species for instance under the lien species prevention and enforcement act which makes it illegal to ship several categories of species through the us mail state role seems improbable nonetheless within some welldefined arenas substantial cooperati on does exist federal and state cooperation seems to be especially strong in control of invasive plants where they threaten agriculture or forestry aphis is the lead federal agency for this effort the forest service takes the lead in working with state local and private organizations to control tree pests and the natural resources c onservation service nrcs work s directly with private landowners to control inva sive plants native or nonnative some of the cooperation on federal lands is carried out through national public lands day an event coordinated by the national nvironmental education and training foundation nonprofit foundati on chartered by congress in 1990 events in 2002 include removal of exotic gr asses at saguaro national park az and exotic seaweed eradication gracilaria salicornia off the coast of waikiki hi the informationsharing promoted through the nisc may help states to play greater role by promoting broader awareness of the potential effects of such species thereby limiting plans for deliberate introducti ons or by providing states with new information about strategies to control pe sts within their borders federal agencies are also more aware of options and techni ques to control pests that lie on both sides of federal boundaries some examples of such cooperation include sea lamprey control in the great lakes and the nps exotic plant management teams which work closely with neighboring landowners approaches to regulation speciesbyspecies vs pathways under single species approach plants or animals must be placed on black list before they are regulated as harmful black list approaches to invasive species are of necessity done on speciesbyspecies basis harm can rarely be demonstrated unless the plant or animal is already at pest levels and inflicting damage somewhere ie generally after the species is reproducing and spreading usually damage must be read ily apparent before protec tion can begin at which point prevention could be nearly impossible seve ral examples of this approach are extant in law coverage of the brown tree snak under nanpca which otherwise regulates the pathway of ship ballast water and th requirement that i ndividual weed specieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs59 100 personal communication with jay randall coordinator exotic species program minnesota division of fish and wildlife on may 17 and july 14 1999 101 congress is considering many issues related to invasive species the list of options below focuses only on topics which cover broa d range of species pathways or agenciesbe placed on an exclusion list before they can be regulated under the plant protection act there are few instances of regulation and prevention by pathway among the most comprehensive has been nanpca as amended by nisa its focus is on ballast water as risk to saltwater and freshwater ports bays and estuaries its goals put prevention on an equal or higher footing with control of species that are already established it requires the participati on of several federal agencies promotes research and implements regulations on the midocean exchange of ballast water and various other measures to prevent nonnativ from entering us ports similarly aphis inspects imported agricultural products for pests pathway approaches also exist at the state level minnesota for example prohibits the transport of nearly all aquatic plants native or nonnative and of zebra mussels on public roads depending on the particular offe nse fines range from 50 to 500100 pathway approaches do not require lists of organisms to be implemented or effective and may even block the entry of species whos very existence is unknown to science few legislative or policy options specialists in this field suggest that the following areas are either not addressed in current law or might be explored by policymakers101 research to identify pathways and to improve control methods pathways approach to ensure that pathways are clean of living stowaways regardless of whatever policy regarding black or white lists may be adopted for intenti onal introductions could have some advantages stowaways per have supporters opposition to preventive action would proba bly be based on practical considerations of cost efficacy safety intrusion on otherwise legal goals etc however with the exception of agricultural threats there have been few comprehensive reviews to identify pathways providing the greatest risk of rmful nonnatives this research could be especially relevant to preventing unintentional introductions the research goals would overlap strongly with research to prevent certain kinds of terrorist threats and might benefit from cooperation with agen cies involved in antiterrorism programs education campaign after disastrous humancaused fire in new mexico young black bear cub survivor was named smokey by the forest service and became in only few years the nucleus of highly successful educational campaign to reduce similar fires smokey bear equivalent for non native species an educational campaign aimed in part at children to prevent simple inadvertenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs60 102 while smokey bear has become widely recognized other such efforts have been less successful for example the forest service s other symbol woodsey owl has been far less effective in reducing pollution and littering in the early 1960s usda attempted to create pestina to help educate the traveling public to the perils of nonnative species imports there was little effort to evaluate effectiven ess and little work with private and other federal agencies the program was eventually dropped ota report p 142 103 appendix iii of the convention on international trade in endangered species could provide model for this type of approach nation may list any species native to it under this appendix through that listing it reque sts the assistance of other member nations in controlling imports of that species when they arrive from the host nationacts by the public might play significant role in preventing some types of nonnative species introductions102 preventing releases of exotic pets and aquarium species after the point of sale might be particularly susceptible to this approach warning list while the current black list approach requires significant regulatory hurdles before species can be included an informational warning list or grey list of species might be created by the collaboration of federal and state agencies the warning list might include species currently restricted under state laws species thought to be newl arrived from other countries and other species felt to merit special attention by regulators103 although it would lack regulatory force the list could be designed to provide information on species w hose eradication or control is in its early phases unification of data and reporting from many agencies would add greatly to the utility of such list review of industries depende nt on importing and transferring non native species such review including focus on cooperative methods to reduce introductions or re leases after the point of sale could be in order the focus of past efforts has nded to be on the point at which these species enter the united states to protect their businesses importdepe ndent industries have naturally tried to reduce current obstacles and preven t imposition of new ones in this effort the pet trade including the hobby aquarium and nursery industries has been relatively ccessful yet this pathway offers other avenues to reduce risk be sides prohibition these avenues might include incentives for the sale of sterile animals or plants only or efforts to create point of sale educational programs to inform purchasers about the risk of releasing pets or plants into the wild and penalties for doing so the wild bird act see above could provide model for legislation to enc ourage homegrown if not native species over additional foreign imports multiagency federal center for first strike prevention and control since the creation of the nisc agencies have begun to respond across broad front in the days weeks or months after an invasion is discovered the pr ompt notification and agencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs61 104 these issues are addressed by federally coordinated national interagency fire center primarily under the management of the bureau of land management all federal land managing agencies participate and great deal of the program focuses on work with tribal state and local governments to bring ma ny resources to bear on major fires 105 for more on the national interagency fire center see httpwwwnifcgov for more on the centers for disease prevention and control see httpwwwcdcgov 106 meeting the invasive species challenge p 3233attention to the discovery of nor thern snakeheads in maryland is an example of such response see snakeheads below however while constraints on time budgets coordination and jurisdiction interfere with prompt responses fa r less than in the past further progress is possible nisc is movi ng toward the model of federal program which has long faced similar issues interagency fire management104 it seems possible that similar multiagency federal center devoted to first strike prevention and control of harmful nonnative species regardless of affected industry ecosystem or lead agency could be helpful with variety of expertise and resources it could provide critical support at time when eradication might still be possible another federal agency which plays somewhat similar role is the centers for disease control and prevention which c onducts research and provides degree of coordination for effo rts to protect human health105 in recent years one agency nps has adopted roughly this approach within their budget cons traints initially two teams were available to address i nvasive plant problems not only in crises but also for ongoing problems while the teams soon to number 16 can work only on nps lands they do work with adjoining landowners to control crossboundary problems expansion of this program perhaps with multiagency teams could provide more efficient method of addressing ne w or incipient invasions it seems unlikely however that each federal agency would need to create its own separate team modeled after thos of nps since the duplication of effort would be substantial expert review of planned releases panels of experts might be created to review and make recommendations on releases by governments at any level or by nongovernmental sources into any environment in which the species are not native according to the nisc106 steps along these lines are planned and in the case of plants which may affect agriculture are in progress while such panel could not have sounded the alar m on the unauthorized release of hydrilla into the potomac for instance it could provide public warning on planned release of exotic grasses by federal agencies or of nonnative game fish species into new drainage the use of the expertise of federal and ot her scientists and managers if it prevented even few illadvised introductions might be cost effective optionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30123crs62 measures to reduce the risk of exporting invasive species even in the absence of treaty the united states might wish to take internal steps to prevent exporting potentia lly invasive species to other countries these measures could be as simple as restricting their use in bilateral aid progra ms or certifying that identified us products eg used tires are free of pests this certification for example is done for agricultural shipments but other areas or programs may be at risk of transporting nonnatives as well the management plan of the nisc considers internationa l cooperation gene rally p 4142 and describes actions which might be taken on multilateral or bilateral basis to reduce the trans port of invasive species however it does not address steps the united states might take unilaterally nor assess any positive or negative results on us trade that might occur from such steps it is difficult to discern progress in this area in the last few years convening an international conference to prevent further economic damage and enlist international cooperation congress might consider urging the president to seek an international conference to develop treaty or other international agreements concerning this issue certificati on of the pestfree status of plant or animal specimens pallet wood or ai r cargo holds or the adoption of other measures might reduce th number of species entering this country as well as prevent threaten ed trade wars if steps are taken unilaterally in the face of new pest such protocols might have

the economic impact has been an added blow to beekeepers and therefore orchardists suffering from other serious pests such as bee mites described below in touch of environmental justice however these same bee mites attack africanized bees as well as european bees and the mites may be one reason why africanized bees unprotected in the wild by human keepers are expanding their us range somewhat more

reportedly made some areas of the southcentral and gulf coast states very unpleasant when its populations reach their highest densities economic impacts have included higher costs for mosquito control programs in humid areas its possible medical threat is more complex question its apparent failure to spread diseases so far has probably resulted from the complex biological interaction of the viruses the mosquitoes and the hosts the insects broad range of meal sources reduces the probability of transmitting most diseases if it picks up yellow fever for example it will not transmit it to human if its next meal is mouse blood and female mosquito may bite onl handful of times in her short adult life in another odd twist it may be th at the larvae of this mosquito are out competing the larvae of an introduced closelyrelated and dangerous cousin aedes aegypti very efficient transmitter of yellow fever the cdc responding to the public health threat took steps to require the disinfection of imported tires disinfection of exported tires is required as public health matter this disparity is unfortunate since difficult sa nitation conditions and reduced health care make the transmission of disease by this species far more likely in other countries than in the united states mediterranean fruit fly ceratitis capitata the mediterranean fruit fly or medfly is one of the worlds most feared plant pests because the species has wide range of host plants and its larvae stroy many kinds of fruit and vegetables medflies attack over 260 host fruits and ve getables and their maggotlike larvae

death and juveniles emerge deformed from th eir cells moderate infestations reduce pollination services and honey production and eventually kill colonies costs of keeping bees escalate increasing crop production costs and food prices119 hobby beekeepers are virtually eliminated as are wild populations of honeybees the spread of these two kinds of mites may be playing role in slowing the spread of africanized bees farther from the mexican border since they too are susceptible to these mites populations of native bees mostly solitary species such as carpenter bees sweat bees leafcutter bees and

attributed in part to the intr oduction of alewives which reduce zooplankton populations some attribute the extinction of the lake herri ng and the decline of chub species in the great lakes to the alewife today the alewife is the dominant fish in lake michigan where it accounts for 7090 of the fish weight biomass pacific salmonids were introduced to the great lake s in the mid1960s in part as an attempt albeit unsuccessful to control the alewife populations alewives have damaged sport and commercial fisheries in the great lakes by eliminating certain species such as lake herring and emerald sh iner and have damaged tour ism by undergoing periodic largescale dieoffs that litter beaches with rotting fish posing both nuisance and health hazard costs of cleaning beaches have declined

species probably arrived in freighter ballast water the species appears to be undergoing population explosion in lakes erie huron and michigan the round goby was first observed in lake superior in 1995 th round goby is aggressive feeding voraciously upon small bottomdwelling fishes eg sculpins darters and logperch snails mussels and quatic insects abundance of na tive fish species has declined in areas where this goby has become abunda nt with sculpins particularly affected thus there is concern that the round goby may harm sport and commercial fisheries in the great lakes as well as

islands in the 1990s it became established in hawaii to the tremendous annoyance of residents due to the loud calls which can reach 100 decibels its broader effects probably include predation on local insect populations and therefore compe tition with other native insectivores including birds since many resident hawaiian species are already under threat from still more invaders eg malarial
