cowan and charles hanrahan resources science and industry division joe richardson domestic social policy division possible expiration or extension of the 2002 farm bill summary the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 authorized an array of agricultural rural and nutrition programs many provisions of the 2002 farm bill were scheduled to expire in 2007 if new farm bill or yearlong extension were not enacted before the 2008 harvest permanent law would have taken effect under permanent law eligible commodities would be supported at levels much higher than they are now and many of the currently supported commodities might not be eligible including soybeans and peanuts permanent law for the commodity programs is so radically different from current policy and inconsistent with todays farming marketing and trade agreements as well as costly to the federal government that congress was unlikely to let it take effect lack of new legislation would have reduced or eliminated some conservation domestic nutrition assistance trade and foreign food aid and rural development programs six temporary extensions continued the authority of most programs in the 2002 farm bill until may 23 2008 new farm bill was enacted on may 22 2008 pl 110234 when the senate joined the house in overriding the presidential veto of hr 2419 however clerical error omitted title iii the trade and foreign aid title from the enrolled version sent to the president to resolve the absence of title iii another complete version of the farm bill hr 6124 was passed vetoed and overridden the final enacted version of the 2008 farm bill is pl 110246 prior to enactment of the farm bill programs that were not extended in the temporary extensions included the direct countercyclical and marketing loan programs for the 2008 crop year for the major crops such as corn soybeans wheat cotton and rice peanut storage community food projects authorized under the food stamp act the rural broadband program valueadded market development grants and certain renewable energy programs however the dairy sugar and wool and mohair programs were extended most of the longstanding usda conservation programs were permanently authorized and had current appropriation other conservation programs that pay farmers to remove fragile crop land from production were authorized and received mandatory funding from the 2002 farm bill but awaited renewal two conservation programs that pay farmers for adopting resource stewardship practices the environmental quality incentives program and the conservation security program were extended beyond fy2007 by the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 usdas domestic food assistance programs for example food stamps generally were permanently authorized and in most cases they were not affected by the possible expiration of the farm bill since they received fullyear fy2008 appropriation however two major provisions of the law could have been affected nutrition assistance grants to puerto rico

enactment of the new law suspends the provisions of permanent law that would have taken effect without new law for more details on the legislative history of the 2008 farm bill see crs report rl33934 farm bill legislative action in the 110th congress sidebyside summary of the provisions and changes in the 2008 farm bill is presented in crs report rl34228 comparison of the 2008 farm bill conference agreement with the house and senate farm bills background what were the consequences of congress not having enacted new farm bill before the end of fiscal year 2007 the commonly reported expiration date of many of the provisions of the 2002 farm bill what might have happened if new farm bill were not enacted in early 2008 would programs authorized by the expiring legislation have ceased to operate or would they have continued under nonexpiring provisions of permanent law where there is permanent law would the design and funding have changed2 the 2002 omnibus farm bill pl 107171 included wide range of program authorities some of which were mandatory and others discretionary mandatory in this context means that the authority to spend necessary funds is provided by statute3 1 the conference agreement on the 2008 farm bill was originally approved by the house and the senate as hr 2419 and vetoed by the president in may 2008 both chambers overrode the veto making the bill law pl 110234 however the trade title was inadvertently excluded from the enrolled bill to remedy the situation both chambers repassed the farm bill conference agreement including the trade title as hr 6124 the president vetoed the measure in june 2008 and both chambers again overrode the veto which made hr 6124 law as pl 110246 and superseded pl 110234 2 in addition to this analysis the usda released an unnumbered report on february 29 2008 titled the effects of failure to enact new farm bill permanent law support for commodities and lapse of other usda programs at httpwwwusdagovdocuments fbpaper022908doc 3 in this context the word mandatory does not relate to participation in the programs in all cases program participation is voluntary crs2 this mandatory category includes the commodity support programs export programs some conservation programs and food stamps4 discretionary programs are authorized but annual funding is subject to congressionally approved appropriations discretionary programs in the farm bill include some conservation programs federal farm loan programs rural development programs agricultural research and some foreign food aid among others in nearly all cases farm bill supersedes permanent authorizing law for period of four to six years the farm bill is important because it may substantially change program design from what is in the permanent law as is the case with commodity support programs typically with regard to appropriated programs the farm bill sets policy parameters and upper limits on program activity levels and appropriations authority without an extension most appropriated programs also referred to as discretionary programs in the 2002 farm bill and some mandatory programs such as food stamps would have faced the prospect of not having statutory authority for the appropriations committees to provide funding in fy2008 and subsequent years the lack of authority to appropriate funds for authorized programs and even for some programs not authorized has not been barrier for appropriations in past congresses temporary extensions fy2007 came to close on september 30 2007 without either new farm bill or an fy2008 appropriations act hence congress adopted several continuing resolutions pl 11092 pl 110116 pl 110137 and pl 110149 last fall that provided stopgap funding for most nondefense discretionary spending until the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 pl 110161 was enacted on december 26 2007 for the farm bill specifically six temporary extensions were enacted the first extension was in the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 it extended the authority for many expiring farm bill programs for nearly three months until march 15 2008 pl 110161 division sec 751 the second extension in pl 110 196 lasted for about one month until april 18 2008 then pl 110200 continued the extension for one week until april 25 2008 and pl 110205 for another week until may 2 2008 the fifth extension in pl 110208 lasted for two weeks until may 16 2008 the sixth extension in pl 110231 continued for one week until the earlier of may 23 2008 or the date the 2008 farm bill was enacted all but one title of the 2008 farm bill except the trade title which was mistakenly missing from the enrolled version were enacted on may 22 when the house and senate overrode the presidential veto5 of hr 2419 and the 2008 farm 4 crop insurance is an important farm program with mandatory funding that does not depend on periodic renewal through farm bills because it is authorized by its own permanent law 5 the vetoes in 2008 were the second and third presidential veto of complete standalone continued crs3 bill became pl 110234 because further temporary extension was passed the trade provisions in title iii of the 2002 farm bill expired to deal with the omission of title iii both chambers repassed the farm bill conference agreement including the trade title as hr 6124 the president vetoed the measure on june 18 2008 and both chambers again overrode the veto which made hr 6124 law as pl 110246 superseding pl 110234 while the 2008 farm bill was being completed in congress the temporary extensions stated that unless otherwise excepted 2002 farm bill provisions in effect on september 30 2007 shall continue until the new expiration date the extensions funded three conservation programs at specific levels farmland protection program at 97 millionyear ground and surface water conservation at 60 millionyear and wildlife habitat incentives program at 85 millionyear for the commodity title the dairy and sugar programs were included in the extension as were price support loan programs for wool and mohair programs that specifically were not extended included the direct countercyclical and marketing loan programs for the 2008 crop year for all other supported commodities eg feed grains oilseeds wheat rice cotton and peanuts peanut storage payments agricultural management assistance for conservation community food projects in the food stamp program the rural broadband program valueadded market development grants federal procurement of biobased products the biodiesel fuel education program and the renewable energy systems program commodity support programs6 the mandatory commodity support programs authorized in the 2002 farm bill cover the 2007 crops so all subsidy obligations related to 2007 crop production are covered by the law even if spending occurs in fy2008 for commodity support programs there was little reason to enact farm bill before the end of calendar year 2007 in fact past farm bills generally have been enacted late in the year after the end of the fiscal year the 1981 and 1985 farm bills were enacted in late december and the 1990 farm bill was enacted in late november what was expected to be 1995 farm bill was not enacted until april 4 1996 another case of belated action even in that case payments were made on the 1995 crops and farmers went ahead with planting operations for their 1996 crops7 5 continued farm bill president eisenhower vetoed hr 12 the first version of the agricultural act of 1956 the overrides in 2008 were the first time farm bill was enacted by overriding veto budget reconciliation package that included 1995 farm bill was vetoed in 1995 but the farm bill was not necessarily the basis of the veto see footnote 7 6 this section on commodity support programs is written by jim monke specialist in agricultural policy crs it was initially composed by jasper womach 7 the situation surrounding delayed enactment of 1995 farm bill until 1996 was complicated by several factors first some support provisions for some commodities had been extended through 1997 by budget savings action taken in the agricultural continued crs4 policy officials and the agriculture community expected 2007 farm bill to be enacted before the end of calendar year 2007 however lack of new commodity support legislation before harvest in 2008 did little harm other than leaving producers of covered commodities uncertain about the size of payments they might receive8 the uncertainty about future policy could have affected some farmers ability to acquire production loans from commercial lenders but even if congress had deemed one or twoyear extension necessary for the commodity support programs beyond the 2007 crop year that action likely could have waited until june 2008 when winter wheat the first of the 2008 crop year commodities was harvested9 possible reversion to permanent law if congress had not enacted the 2008 farm bill before the beginning of the 2008 harvest then the nonexpiring provisions of primarily the agriculture adjustment act of 1938 and the agriculture act of 1949 would have taken effect provisions of these permanent laws are temporarily superseded by each farm bill the commodity support provisions of permanent law are so radically different from current policy and inconsistent with todays farming marketing and trade agreements as well as potentially costly to the federal government that congress was unlikely to let permanent law take effect permanent law provides mandatory support for basic crops through nonrecourse loans but without the option of settling the loan obligations at posted county prices or receiving loan deficiency payments the only settlement options in permanent law are forfeiture of the commodities used as loan collateral or full repayment of the loans permanent law does not authorize countercyclical payments or decoupled direct payments also nonrecourse loan rates could be as high as 90 of parity but not less than 50 of parity for corn wheat and rice and 65 of parity for cotton10 acreage allotments and marketing quotas could be implemented for wheat and cotton milk support would be between 75 and 90 of parity support for soybeans other oilseeds and peanuts would not be mandatory other commodities 7 continued reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 sections 11011111 second 1995 farm bill was included in large budget reconciliation package hr 2491 that was vetoed on december 6 1995 by president clinton 8 under the 2002 farm bill farmers receiving direct payments have the option of receiving them in the calendar year prior to the applicable crop year this provision allows farmers to possibly achieve tax savings the delay of the farm bill until 2008 precluded the possibility for farmers to receive part of their 2008 direct payment in calendar year 2007 9 milk is commodity that required attention before the end of 2007 because the dairy price support program was scheduled to expire on december 31 2007 the temporary extensions avoided the reversion to permanent law whereby the government would have been obligated to purchase surplus cheese nonfat dry milk and butter at prices substantially higher than current support prices 10 parity is price relationship that gives unit of the commodity the same purchasing power it had in the 19101914 time period average prices received by farmers and commodity parity prices are reported monthly by the usdas national agricultural statistics service report agricultural prices crs5 now receiving mandatory support but not identified in permanent law are sugar beets sugar cane wool mohair small chickpeas dry peas and lentils for wheat and cotton permanent law requires usda to announce acreage allotments and marketing quotas during the prior crop year and to hold producer referenda on whether to implement marketing quotas twothirds or more affirmative producer vote for marketing quotas results in the highest levels of support but also mandatory restrictions on planted acreage and therefore on the quantity eligible for support for this analysis it is assumed the secretary announces marketing quotas and thus producer referenda therefore the only requirement is to announce wheat acreage allotments prior to the 2008 harvest11 table 1 summarizes the support estimates based on these assumptions as shown in table 1 not all commodities currently receiving federal support would be covered by mandatory provisions in permanent law the commodities losing mandatory support include peanuts wool mohair sugar beats and sugar cane soybeans and other oilseeds dry peas lentils and small chick peas any and all of these commodities could receive support under discretionary authority given the secretary of agriculture in the agriculture act of 1949 and the ccc charter act for budgetary and other reasons that discretionary authority has been seldom used and was unlikely to be applied in 2008 important to this supposition is the fact that with few exceptions market prices for agricultural commodities are high and there would be little economic justification for federal support to be implemented milk is supported currently and in permanent law through the offer of usda to purchase manufactured dairy products nonfat dry milk cheddar cheese and butter at prices equivalent to the mandated support price for manufacturing grade milk under permanent law those purchase prices based on january 2008 data would be about three times as high currently mandated and nearly 50 higher than market prices such high usda purchase prices could result in the government outbidding commercial markets for sizeable share of processor output under the 2002 farm bill permanent law would have taken effect on january 1 2008 however temporary extensions continued the dairy price support program under permanent law nonrecourse loan rates for wheat corn and other feed grains and cotton function as usda purchase prices unless commercial markets pay more than the nonrecourse loan prices farmers simply put their crops under loan and forfeit the commodities to usda when the ninemonth loans come due thus loan prices effectively are government purchase prices when market prices are lower than the nonrecourse loan rates commercial buyers have to raise their prices to outbid the usda to acquire wheat feed grains and cotton these crop subsidy programs were not extended beyond the 2007 crop year by the temporary extensions 11 in fact usda issued press releases on april 5 2007 fsa news release 143907 and september 25 2007 fsa news release 152607 stating there would be national acreage allotments or marketing quotas for respectively crop year 2008 wheat and

section 301 of the agricultural adjustment act of 1938 as amended by the agricultural acts of 1948 1949 and 1956 c an explanation of permanent law is provided by usda ers possible economic consequences of reverting to permanent legislation or eliminating price and income support aer 526 january 1985 for purposes of this table it is assumed permanent law is implemented without time to hold producer referenda on national quotas and so mandatory support would be implemented without marketing quotas conservation programs12 many of the usda conservation programs administered by the natural resources conservation service nrcs deal with evaluating the causes and severity of resource problems developing physical and management systems to address the problems and providing technical and financial assistance to farmers implementing preventive and remedial practices the cost of these programs largely relates to agency personnel who provide specialized technical training costsharing with farmers and administrative overhead conservation program spending recently has averaged about 5 billion annually while most of the larger conservation programs were authorized by the 2002 farm bill and would have expired the end of fy2007 several mostly older programs with total spending about 1 billion are permanently authorized and appropriations 12 this section on conservation programs is written by tadlock cowan analyst in natural resources policy crs it was initially composed by jeffrey zinn crs8 committees are to provide such sums as necessary to meet program needs thus there is constraint on appropriators in future years as with most appropriated discretionary programs funding depends heavily on budget requests from the administering executive agency so the future of these programs short of change in the permanent authorizing law largely is in the hands of the appropriators these programs are listed at the top of table 2 the food security act of 1985 pl 99198 and subsequent amendments have become the legal foundation for another set of programs that now account for almost 4 billion 80 of usda conservation spending most of these programs are administered by nrcs while the largest the conservation reserve program crp is administered by usdas farm service agency fsa with support from nrcs the original authorizing legislation expired in 1990 but has been extended and amended by periodic farm bills many of these programs were extended by the 2002 farm bill and most of the programs expired september 30 2007 however the temporary farm bill extensions continued these programs the absence of new mandatory program authority likely would mean that new contracts could be signed with farmers all existing contracts would stay in force for their specified lives and payments would continue to be made on the existing contracts three mandatory conservation programs were funded at specific levels by the temporary extensions the farmland protection program 97 million the wildlife habitat incentives program 85 million and the ground and surface water conservation program 60 million also two programs the environmental quality incentives program eqip and the conservation security program csp have been extended in earlier legislation to fy2010 and fy2011 respectively the mandatory conservation programs are listed in the bottom half of table 2 with

472 all of these programs were extended through fy2007 by the 2002 farm bill c each of these conservation programs expired on september 30 2007 under their 2002 farm bill program authority temporary extensions have continued their authority d subsequent to the 2002 farm bill the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 authorized the environmental quality incentives program eqip through fy2010 and the conservation security program csp through fy2011 nutrition programs13 at the end of fy2007 and with enacted farm bill to extend them number of authorities in domestic food assistance laws expired they effectively were extended by series of appropriations actions and temporary farm bill extensions because the appropriations act provided funding for all domestic food assistance programs through the end of fy2008 most programs and the terms and conditions under which they operate would have been unaffected if temporary extensions expired without new legislation however some provisions of domestic food assistance law would have terminated without some action authority to continue to pay out nutrition assistance grants to puerto rico and american samoa totaling some 16 billion for fy2008 would have terminated without temporary extension provisions allowing usda to reduce by just under 200 million year states regular federal matching payments for food stamp administrative costs also would have terminated without temporary extension this authority is intended to adjust for administrative costs shared with other federally supported public assistance programs 13 this section on nutrition programs is written by joe richardson specialist in domestic social policy crs crs10 other less significant authorities that would have been affected include continuation of several food stamp pilot projects in which elderly or disabled recipients receive cash benefits 5 million in grants for simplified application projects 5 million in grants for community food projects directive for minimum percase administrative cost payments for commodity supplemental food program csfp projects provisions regarding the amounts of cheese and nonfat dry milk to be provided to the csfp and provisions regarding contracting with private companies to process usdadonated commodities14 trade and foreign food aid programs15 several agricultural trade and international food aid programs were subject to expiration unless new farm bill was enacted in fact shortterm expiration occurred between may 22 2008 and june 18 2008 that is the period between enactment of the 2008 farm bill without title iii pl 110234 and enactment of the version with title iii pl 110246 these trade programs were authorized by the 2002 farm bill to receive mandatory funding the programs in question regarding expiration were export credit guarantees export credit guarantees for emerging markets facilities credit guarantees export market promotion general export and dairy export subsidies and technical assistance for specialty crops authority to carry out international emergency and nonemergency food aid programs is provided by pl 480 the agricultural trade development and assistance act several authorities in pl 480 expired without temporary extension or new farm bill these include the authorization of minimum volumes of commodity assistance under title ii title ii of pl 480 emergency and private assistance the authority to finance sales title i or enter into agreements to provide commodities for emergencies or development projects title ii and the authority to carry out pl 480financed agricultural technical assistance in subsaharan african and caribbean countries authority to replenish stocks of the bill emerson humanitarian trust reserve of commodities and cash used to meet unanticipated food aid needs also expired without temporary extension 14 the usda has determined that other authorities that might appear to be affected would not eg continuation of the senior farmers market nutrition program continued funding for employment and training programs for food stamp recipients support for tefap moreover ending the six affected authorities noted here may not in the short term have significant effect because of the existence of other authorities that could be used to replace them or the timing of grant decisions 15 this section on trade and aid programs is written by charles hanrahan senior specialist in agricultural policy crs crs11 rural development programs16 most rural development loan and grant programs are authorized through permanent law and funded through annual appropriations which were received for fy2008 in the consolidated appropriations act pl 110161 however several mandatory rural development programs were newly authorized or extended by the 2002
