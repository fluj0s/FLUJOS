bridge publications inc newsletter dianetics is an understanding of man there is much argument upon which we could adventure concerning whether dianetics is an art or science whether it is humanity or hoax but all this would avail us very little for we would only be quibbling with words dianetics is what it is and the totality of it can best be summed by the description an understanding of man we do not care whether or not it is science we do not care whether or not it is more properly cataloged under adventure or mystery we do care whether or not it is promulgated and known for everywhere it walks slavery ceases that mind which understands itself is the mind of free man l ron hubbard this excerpt was taken from the book dianetics 55 by l ron hubbard is there real solution to depression depression is now ranked as major global health crisis affecting over 120 million people according to recent study from the world health organization who and ranks fourth amongst all health problems in its economic and social costs the study published in the journal of the american medical association recently also estimated that 10 percent of the population in the united states suffers from depression and between 15 and 20 percent of sufferers commit suicide the symptoms of depression include feeling sad or down losing interest in everyday activities feeling guilty worthless or hopeless or having sleeplessness and lack of energy this means that practically every person on this planet suffers at one point or another from depression and according to the national institute of health bethesda maryland 19 million americans older than 18 are afflicted with depression in any given year despite the remedies from the leaders in the medical field which consist generally of various pillsthat are about as effective as the ageold just take deep breath methodthere is an actual solution to depression and it has been around for 54 years the remedy is described in the book dianetics the modern science of mental health by author and humanitarian l ron hubbard depression is often characterized as both disease and medical condition this means that if your favorite pet dies and you feel sad about it and that sadness lingers for few weeks or more and upsets your daily life you may somehow have contracted disease or medical condition only doctor or other qualified healthcare professional can make diagnosis of depression this is in contrast to the remedy hubbard describes in dianetics which has been used successfully by millions of people worldwide harvard university psychiatrist joseph glenmullen says the questionnaire or symptoms used to diagnose depression may look scientific but when one examines the questions asked and the scales used they are utterly subjective measures allen j frances professor of psychiatry at duke university medical center writes psychiatrys claim that mental illnesses are brain diseasesis not true there are objective diagnostic tests to confirm or disconfirm the diagnosis of depressionthere is blood or other biological test to ascertain the presence or absence of mental illness as there is for most bodily diseases while biochemical explanations for psychiatric conditions are the most common explanation of the cause of depression glenmullen is emphatic not one has been proven quite on the contrary in every instance where such an imbalance was thought to have been found it was later proven false according to biopsychologist elliot s valenstein phd author of blaming the brain the theories are held on to not only because there is nothing else to take their place but also because they are useful in promoting drug treatment there are three main treatments for depression symptoms as advocated by mental health practitioners antidepressant drugs electroconvulsive therapy and psychotherapy nobody knows exactly what the antidepressant drugs ssris do to the brain and while they temporarily handle some of the symptoms of depression their sideeffects are quite drastic as regards electroconvulsive therapy ect 2001 columbia university study found ect is so ineffective at ridding patients of their depression that nearly all of those who receive it relapse within six months of stopping treatment lastly psychotherapy can take years at great cost and has objective documentation as to its efficacy as with any condition treating only the symptoms not the cause has real longterm benefits with current mainstream treatments it seems therefore that safe effective therapy exists however it is not
