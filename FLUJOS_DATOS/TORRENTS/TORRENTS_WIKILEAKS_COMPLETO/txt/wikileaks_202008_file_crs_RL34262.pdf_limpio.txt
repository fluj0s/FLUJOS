michael f martin analyst in asian trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34262us clothing imports from vietnam trade policies and performance summary us clothing imports from vietnam grew from virtually nothing in 2000 to 43 billion in 2007 vietnam was the third largest source of clothing imports for the united states in 2006 behind in order china and mexico much of that growth was the result of the gradual liberalization of us trade policy towards vietnam although the unite d states terminated its trade embargo on vietnam in 1994 trade initially remain ed low because vietnam did not have normal trade relations ntr status the signing of bilateral trade agreement in july 2000 allowed president clinton to grant vietnam temporary ntr status effective december 2001 leading to sharp increase in us imports from vietnam including clothing the rise in vietnamese clothing imports led to the united states to push vietnam into bila teral textile agreement in 2003 that set quantity quotas on the import of selected clothing items the bilateral textile agreement remained in effect until the united states granted vietnam permanent ntr status on december 20 2006 as part of its accession into the world trade organization wto the liberalization of us trade policy towards vietnam raised concerns about possible dumping by vietnamese clothing exporters some members of congress and us clothing and textile companies argued that surge in vietnamese imports may harm the us clothing and textile industr in part to secure senate passage of permanent ntr status for vietnam the bush administration agreed to establish monitoring program for selected cl othing imports from vietnam from its inception there have been questions about the legality and ffectiveness of the monitoring program on october 26 2007 the department of commerce doc announced the completion of its first sixmonth review of the monitoring data finding that there was insufficient evidence to warrant the selfinitiation of an antidumping investigation on may 6 2008 the doc announced its second sixmonth review of the monitoring data had come to the same conclusion there are range of actions that congress might take with regard to us trade policy towards vietnam congress could take action altern atively congress could revisit the question of the docs legal authority to establish the monitoring program as well as examine the issue of the compatibility of the monitoring program with existing wto agreements and commitments congress could investigate vietnams compliance with its promise to terminate all wtoprohibited subsidies congress could also enact legislation signed to counteract perceived unfair vietnamese trade practices congress could examine the design and conduct of the monitoring program to ascertain if it provides reasonable basis for determining the need for an antidumping investigation ndor examine claims that the monitoring

commerce federal register volume 71 number 232 december 4 2006us clothing imports from vietnam trade policies and performance introduction in the relatively short period of time since the united states resumed normal trade relations ntr with vietnam in 2001 there have been veral controversies regarding the importation of clothing from vietnam into the united states1 the controversies surrounding us clothing imports from vietnam include allegations of dumping illegal transshipments viola tions of the world trade organization wto agreements and controversial im port monitoring program in addition us trade policy governing the import of vietnamese clothing has changed course several times leading to claims of significant market disruption and regulatory uncertainty these claims are bolstered by the volatility of us import data for vietnamese clothing ove r the last seven years there have been several shifts in us trade policy with vietnam since it was first granted ntr status in 2001 that have possibly affected us clothing imports from vietnam bilateral trade agreem ent concluded on july 13 2000 significantly lowered tariff rates on clothing imported from vietnam bilateral textile agreement that ran from may 1 2003 until january 11 2007 imposed quantity quotas on the import of certain categories of clothing im ported from vietnam also as part of its accession into the wto vietnam entered into an agreement with the united states that among other provisions requires th at vietnam terminate various nonwto compliant subsidy programs for its clothi ng and textiles indus tries finally on december 8 2006 congress passed legisla tion granting vietnam permanent ntr status as of december 29 2006 much of the recent contention about viet namese clothing exports to the united states has focused on the us departme nt of commerces doc implementation of an import monitoring program for lected categories of vietnamese clothing on the day vietnam joined the wto january 11 20 07 the announced import monitoring program began on the same day vietnam joined the wto and is to expire with the end of the bush administration taken to be january 19 2008 by

comments international trade administ ration us department of commerce federal register volume 72 number 14 january 23 2007while acknowledging that the program w ould have an impact on broad array of parties3 the doc maintained that the monitoring of some vietnamese clothing imports is not meant to inhibit legitimate trade4 supporters of the program principally us textile ma nufacturers maintain that the monitoring is necessary because the vietnamese government is illegally subsidizing its clothing industry and that vietnamese exporters are dumpi ng their products in the united states5 according to the programs backers the data being collected by the monitoring program will provide the necessary evid ence to initiate an antidumping action against vietnamese clothing exports opponents of the program mixture of clothing manufacturers retaile rs and importers assert that the collection of the data violates various provisions of the wt agreement runs counter to past anti dumping practices and has already had ne gative effect on vietnams exports to the united states interest in the monitoring program was heightened by expectations of the docs first formal review of the vietnamese clothing imports being monitored according to the federal register announ cement of the program the doc intends to conduct its formal evaluations of the information gathered under the monitoring program on biannual basis6 the doc has also indicated that the categories of products covered by the monitoring prog ram shirts sweaters swimwear trousers and underwear are not static and may be changed in response to input received from interested parties changes in the trade or as the department of commerce broadens its understanding of the compos ition and structure of the domestic textile and apparel industry trade statistics for the first six mont hs of 2007 provided some support to both supporters and opponents of th monitoring program see table 1 us imports of sweaters made in vietnam from january to june 2007 increased by over 85 when compared to the same period last year meanwhile the volume of shirts and trousers imported from vietnam the two largest imported categories being monitored in the doc program during the first si x months of 2007 rose by 281 and 258 respectively when compared to the fi rst half of 2006 however the amount of swimwear imported by the united states from vietnam from january to june 2007 was virtually unchanged from year ag and the amount of underwear imported declined by over 20 when compared to last

from vietnam using year onyear data may be potentia lly misleading for various reasons first under the terms of the usvietnam bilateral textile agreement the united states was permitted to set quotas on the volume of clot hing imported from vietnam in the years 2003 to 2006 as result the import figures for the last four years may have been kept artificially low and the ensuing gr owth in 2007 artificially enhanced second the international trade in clothing is comparatively seasonal so comparisons based on data from only part of year may be biased third because there is an approximately six month lead time in the contracting of clothing the trade volumes for january to june 2007 supposedly refl ect arrangements made prior to the announcement of the monitoring program nd therefore will not reflect the alleged negative impact the monitoring program s had on vietnams clothing exports to the united states on october 26 2007 the doc issued press release stating that it had concluded its first review of vietnamese clothing im ports and determined that there is insufficient evidence to warrant selfinitiating an antidumping investigation7 according to the press release there were imports from vietnam for 317 of the 486 clothing items being mon itored and unit prices had increased for many of the items where there had been imports from vietnam comparisons of imports from vietnam to imports from other nations also failed to provide sufficient evidence to warrant selfinitiating an antidum ping investigation assistant secretary for import administration davi d spooner said that despite the lack of evidence of dumping the department will continue to monitor apparel imports from vietnam until the end of the administration and work with all stakeholders to ensure an open and transparent monitoring process8 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34262crs4 9 commerce completes second review of vi etnam import data press release us department of commerce may 6 2008 10 ibid 11

that there is insufficient evidence to warrant selfinitiating an antidumping investigation9 according to the doc there were clothing imports from vietnam for 208 of the nearly 500 tendigit harmonized tariff system hts lines covered by the monitoring program10 as was done in the first review the doc comp ared trends in unit values and import levels to other nations supplying these pr oducts to the united st ates and concluded that the data did not support an antidum ping investigation the doc also announced that third sixmonth review was to be done in september 2008 while there was requirement that the doc take any action following the evaluations of the trade data the programs continuation arguably will keep the monitoring program an issue of concern fo r the us clothing manufacturers the us textile industry major clothi ng importers and large retail outlets in the united states among the possible administration actions that could have been ta ken were the self initiation of an antidumping investigation on select clothing imports from vietnam the opening of negotiations for new bilateral textile agreement andor the termination of the monitoring program for the next six months it appears that the administration has decided to take none of these options but it is to continue to monitor clothing imports from vietnam summary of usvietnamese clothing trade the recent conduct of clothing trade betw een the united states and vietnam has been relatively short in duration but vari ed in practice after president clinton terminated us trade embargo agains t vietnam on february 3 1994 trade between the united states and vietnam grew rath er slowly in part because of the non preferential treatment vietna m received under us trade laws vietnam was not member of the world trade organization wto so it was not eligible for normal trade relations ntr status via that mechanism11 also under us law vietnam could only be granted permanent ntr status by the passage of gislation or granted temporary ntr status by the conclusion of bilateral trade agreement and compliance with the freedom of emigra tion requirements of the jacksonvanik amendment12 lacking ntr status vietnams exports to the united states were subject to higher tariff rates than produc ts from almost all other nations for clothing imports products from vietnam faced tariff rates two to nine times

the world trends since the end of quotas by michael f martinhaving secured temporary ntr status vietnams exports to the united states accelerated rising from just over 1 billion in 2001 to 46 billion in 2003 see figure 1 one of the main beneficiaries of vietnams temporary ntr status was its clothing industry which saw its exports to the united states jump from 48 million in 2001 to 876 million in 2002 and 23 billion in 2003 by 2003 clothing was 513 of vietnams total ex ports to the united states although the temporary ntr status s timulated imports from vietnam its impact was mitigated by its impermanent nature under us law the president had to reconfirm the waiver of the jackson vanik amendment every year and congress had the authority to override the presiden ts reconfirmation via joint resolution passed by both the house and the senate from 1998 to 2002 such joint resolution failed in the house resoluti ons were introduced between 2003 and 2005 for the international clothing market the theoretical risk of vietnam losing temporary ntr status created two potential barriers to trade first major retailers and importers supposedly shied away fro m purchasing clothing manufactured in vietnam as the date for the waiver renewal neared or when joint resolution for disapproval was introduced in congress second given the longterm uncertainty of vietnams ntr status both domestic and fo reign investors in vietnams clothing and textiles industry allegedly curtailed or postpone d potential investment projects restricting the nations clothing and textile production capacity during the congressional debate over the bilateral trade agreement with vietnam many members of congress urged president bush to negotiate separate bilateral textile agreement with vietnam because vietnam was not wto member at the time its clothing exports were not covered by the agreement on textiles and clothing atc and therefore there were quotas on vietnams clothing exports to the united states15 several members of congress and in particular members with significant clothing and textile manufacturing in their districts or states voiced concern that surge in vietnamese clothing exports to the united states could cause damage to us clothing and textile companies and workers in their opinion it was important that the united states conclude bilateral textile agreement with vietnam that ensured fair competition and or restricted the growth of vietnamese clothing exports to the united states the vietnamus text ile agreement 20032006 negotiations of separate bilateral textile agreem ent began soon after the bilateral trade agreement went into eff ect on april 25 2003 the two nations agreed to the terms of bilateral textile agreement that pl aced quantity quotas on 38 categories of clothing imports from vietnam starting on may 1 2003 until december 31 2004 the quotas would automati cally roll over in subsequent years with the inclusion of annual quantity increases of 2 for

clothing following the implementation of the bilateral textile agreement vietnams total exports to the united states continued thei r rapid climb but the growth in clothing exports slowed dramatically see figure 1 total us imports from vietnam rose from 46 billion in 2003 to 53 billion in 2004 66 billion in 2005 and 86 billion in 2006 meanwhile us clothing imports from vietnam crept up from 23

imposition of import quotas on vietna mese clothing also altered the composition of vietnams clothing exports to the united states in 2003 781 of vietnams clothing exports to the united st ates were in categor ies subject to quotas however over the next three years the va lue of vietnams clot hing exports subject to quotas increased by 178 while clothing exports not subject to exports grew by

and importe rs may shift where they source products in response to the implementation of quotas according to th market experts importers do not want to risk exceeding the import cap and be unabl to import the products they desire and therefore turn to an alternative location to obtain the products as result the creation of an import quota on vi etnamese clothing may have diverted trade to other

stioned its legality and ec onomic merits in may 2 2007 letter to secretary gutierrez six members of the house ways and means committee representatives earl blumenauer jim ramstad mike thomps on jim mcdermott joseph crowley and ron kind stated they were deeply concerned that the disruption in trade caused by the import monitoring program is cutting away at many of the benefits of granting pntr to vietnam and that these negative impacts come at benefit to us apparel producers28 in addition the representatives wrote the department of commerce must demonstrate the specific statutory authority for this unprecedented type of program29 they also expressed concern that the program may violate number of agreements under the world trade organization having questioned the legitimacy and economic benefits of the monitoring program the representatives suggested th at the scope of the monitoring program should be limited to those pparel products defined at the tendigit hts level produced in commercially viable fashion in the united states for which producers of those products have asked for monito ring and for which there is evidence of material injury to those producers be ing caused by imports from vietnam30 senators dianne feinstein and gordon smith also expressed their concerns about the monitoring programs in parate letters to secretary gutierrez31 in her letter of december 26

outline in detail the statutory authority it believes it has to implement the announced monitoring prog ram and to selfinitiate antidumping measures under these circumstances senato r smith also suggested that the proposed program should undergo the usual noti ce of proposed rulemaking process32 criticism from us and korean business communities opposition to the monitoring program also came from various segments of the us business community coalition of eight trade associations and 29 separate us companies sent letter to secretary gutierre z and ustr schwab on october 11 2006 expressing their extreme disappointment at the agreement the administration negotiated with senators elizab eth dole and lindsey graham33 according to the letter implementing this illconsidered and damaging agreement places at risk the ability for us and all other us companies to continue current business and generate new business in vietnam the letter also voices their displeasure at the lack of consultation with interested us companies leading members of congress and the vietnamese government during the time the bush administration was discussing the matter with senators dole and graham overall most of the responses to th import administrations requests for public comments were generally critical of the monitoring program34 in addition to the concerns raised by members of congre ss about the statutory authority for the monitoring program its consistency with existing international obligations and the lack of period of public comme ntary for proposed rulemaking35 another major criticism of the program was the apparent lack of us clothing manufacturing industry that might be materially injured by the vietnamese imports in its written comments to the import ad ministration the us association of importers of textiles and apparel usai ta urged the department of commerce drop the monitoring program because us apparel manuf acturers supported it in his testimony at the public hearing about the monitoring program chairman of the international textile group wilbur l ross jr questioned whom the monitoring program was meant to protect to the best of my knowledge there are american apparel producers whose output is truly characterized as competitive to vietnamshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34262crs14 36 testimony of wilbur l ross jr chairman international textile group

lack of competitive us clothing manufacturers was reiterated by stephanie lester vice president for international trade at the retail industry leaders association rila according to ms lester most of the products that rila members purchase from vietnam could not be supplied by domestic us production37 the monitoring program was also challenged on its potential negative effects on us companies considering sourcing clothing from vietnam in his oral testimony at the public hearing on april 24 2007 gary ross of the usaita said the monitoring program has very real consequences by targeting broad categories of products made in vietnam it forces usaita member companies to reconsider vietnam as sourcing op tion at the very least importers and retailers are looking at the calendar and mapping out worstcase scenarios deciding what the earliest possible point in time is when vietnamese products brought into the us market could be subject to an additional bonding requirement or dumping duty38 in its written comments on the proposed pr ogram the national retail federation nrf stated in response to the greater unpredictability and risk to their sourcing operations created as result of the commitment t implement the monitoring program number of nrf members have decided to limit their exposure to vietnam either by substantially cutting their orders in the second half of 2007 or to terminate them entirely39 the nrf goes on to state that its members have indicated that the cancelled orders will move to other asian countries not the united states or other western hemisphere countries several of the commentators pointed to the biannual review mechanism as heightening the market uncertainty created by the program in the words of the american apparel and footwear associa tion aafa decision every six months about potential antidumping cases can be very unsettling and will doubt have chilling effect on trade40httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34262crs15 41 ibid 42 for example in its comments submitted on behalf of hanesbrands inc on january 31 2007 sandler travis and rosenberg pa wrot product categories used for collecting data the traditional threedigit textile category and the 10digit harmonized tariff system hts code are too broad to permit accurate analysis 43 for example the retail industry leaders ssociation rila wrote in their comments of december 27 2007 while the threedigit category system may be familiar lexicon to the industry these categories are overly broa d and could not be used for purposes of either an antidumping investigation or comme rces proposed monitoring program 44 comments submitted by sandler travis and rosenberg pa on behalf of hanesbrands inc on january 31 2007 45 the law firm of vinson and elkins submitted comments on behalf of kita and kaia on december 27 2006 and january 31 2007a third common comment from us businesses critical of the proposed monitoring program was the potential burden it would place on us companies importing clothing from vietnam in its written comments the aafa stated we are concerned that the program could resu lt in significant new paperwork or import entry requirements which would creat an unfair burden on us apparel importers41 fourth general category of criticism focused on the seemingly vague and fluid methodology being used in the monitoring program several commentators indicated that it was unclear how the data being collected could be used to evaluate the alleged presence of dumping42 some argued that the threedigit categories of imports being monitored were too broad for use in antidumping investigations43 others pointed out that us manufacturing data was pparently not available using the same categories as the import data being monitoring making impact assessment difficult44 virtually all of these commentators main tained that the import administration needed to clarify their methodology prior to implementing the program and to make the methodology more transparent in addition to critical comments from us businesses the import administration also received joint submissions from two korean trade associations the korea international trade association kita and the korean apparel industry association kaia45 the criticism contained in the two submissions made by kita and kaia were consistent with the categories desc ribed above with one additional concern kita nd kaia maintain that the monitoring program would deny benefits to other wt members by undermining the value of investments made by other wto members in vietnams clothing industry support from the us business community although most of the comments received by the import adminis tration were critical of the proposed monitoring program there were some that supported its implementation the supportive comments generally focused on four issues 1 the potential threat of surge in vietnamese clothing imports causing harm to us clothing and textile manufacturers 2 the dominance of stateowned manufacturers in vietnams clothing industry 3 the alleged subsid ies received by the vietnamese clothing industry from its government and 4 th ability to easily shift production from onehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34262crs16 46 comments submitted by the ncto on january 31 2007 47 according to amtacs webpage httpwwwamtacdcorg its mission is to preserve and create

ters of the monitoring program the perceived risk inherent in these four issues was sufficiently grave that it was vital for the monitoring program to begin as soon as possible in the words of the national council of textile organizations ncto the concerns of the us textile industry about surges of im ports from vietnam are based on recent experience not mere speculations46 according to the ncto imports from vietnam rose by 220 between 2002 and 2006 the american manufacturing trade action coalition amtac47 writes in its january 31 2007 comments since vietnam was given normal trade relations access to the us textile and apparel market on december 10 2001 its exports ve increased by 6849 and now total 34 billion48 the implication is that vietnams past rapid increase in clothing exports to the united states indicates an ability to rapidly increase exports in the future the supporters of the monitoring progra m maintain that this rapid growth in exports to the united states is in part due to the dominance of stateowned factories in the vietnamese clothing industry amtac states in its janua ry 31 2007 comments aside from china vietnam is th only other country with large state owned textile and apparel sector vinatex fully owned by the vietnamese government is the 10th largest garment producer in the world49 the alleged dominance of stateowned fact ories in vietnams clothing industry becomes important when examining the th ird issue raised by supporters of the monitoring program the supporters claim that stateowned factories receive significant indirect and direct subsidie s from the vietnamese government thereby allowing them to export clothing at prices below fair market value in the words of the ncto vietnam is one of two count ries the other being china which has large stateowned statesubsidized textile and apparel sector governments in both countries have poured billi ons of dollars in subsidies into their respective sectors with the apparent goal being dominan ce of global apparel supply chains50 according to amtac the subsidies which were revealed by vietnam during its wto negotiations take the form of preferential interest rates wage controls rent holidays export subsidies preferential tax rates and direct investments by the vietnamese government51 the fourth issue raised by supporters of the monitoring program has to do with the production conditions of vietnams clothi ng industry according to some of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34262crs17 52 ncto op cit 53 letter for the ministry of trade the socia list republic of vietnam

clothing manuf acturing is relatively laborintensive production using semiskilled workers as result these commentators maintain it is relatively easy for factories to shif t production from one clothing product to another and so it is vital that the monitori ng program covers wi range of apparel in the words of the ncto apparel manufacturing is in important ways simple process sewing machine operator can produce dozens of different types of garments from single machine to significant exte nt the operator does not become skilled in producing specific type of garment thus typical sewing plant can and does have the ability to assemble womans dress mans cotton pant childs sweatshirt and so on and so forth the reality of the production process therefore calls for monitoring on broader rather than on more specialized basis52 comments from the vietnamese government and companies the response of the vietnamese government and vietnamese clot hing manufacturers to the proposed monitoring program was muted in tone but critical in content in its submitted comments and testimony vietnams ministry of trade focused on the programs possible violation of us wt obligations and the negative effect on legitimate trade the vietnam textile and apparel association vitas reiterated many of the criticisms raised by us businesses but also challenged characterizations of vietna ms clothing industry as be ing stateowned and heavily subsidized in its december 22 2006 letter to the us department of co mmerce vietnams ministry of trade focused on the program s possible violation of existing us wto obligations after expressing disappoi ntment about the co mmerce departments implied intent to initiate antidumping investigations against vietnamese clothing exports the letter asserted this program is violati on of article 23 of the gatt 1994 as it causes nullification and serious prej udice to the interests of vietnam as wto member53 the letter continued by stating furthermore this program is also inconsistent with the bilateral agreement between vietnam and the united states on vietnams accession to the wto signed on 31 may 200654 the trade ministrys second letter to th commerce department shifts its focus to the negative impact it argues the monitoring program has had and will have on legitimate trade between vietnam and the united states although the additional information in the secondround proposal mentions the fact that this program does not aim at rest raining legal trade in fact it has created negative impacts causing worries and unstable

must continue to reaffirm our clear and consistent view to strongly protest the monitoring program on textile and apparel import from vietnam56 t h representative continued it is clear that this program is discriminatory contrary to the most important principle and the pillar of the wto gatt article 1 the trade ministrys testimony also claimed that monitoring program violates article 23 of the gatt by nullifying the benefits of wto membership and article 181 which governs antidumping actions between wto members the testimony also reasserted that the monitoring program was reducing legitimate trade between the two nations and thereby having severe effect on jobs and employment in vietnam the response of vitas to the proposed monitoring program was more detailed diverse and disapproving than that of th trade ministry one important aspect of its comments was challenge to the assertions that vietnams textile and garment industry was largely stateowned and heavily subsidized by the government in its december 20 2006 letter vitas stated the vietnam textile and garment industry consists of over 2000 enterprises of th only 50 are stateowned while 1400 are private and 450 are foreign direct investment fdi enterprises57 the letter also contested claims that stateowned enterprises dominate vietnams clothing exports to the united states stating in 2005 onl 25 stateowned textile and garment enterprises exported their products to the united states making up only 81 of total export turnover of textiles and garments to the united states according to vitas all of vietnams stateowned clothing nd textile enterprises will be privatized equitized by sometime in 2008 on the issue of subsidization vitas wrot that it takes strong exception to the unsupported and unsupportabl allegation in the comments submitted by amtac and the ncto contending that vietnam heavily subsidizes their industry58 calling amtacs reference to vietnams wto disclosure misleading vitas maintained in its letters that the vietnamese government has fulfilled its wto accession obligations to ter minate prohibited subsidies to its textile and apparel industries in addition vitas pointed

over the last few years the vietnamese government has started to pa rtially divest itself of some of the stateowned clothing companies in process vietnam calls equitization fina lly the vietnamese government has also allowed direct foreign investment in clothing companies either whollyowned or joint venture as re sult there are severa l different ownership arrangements in vietna ms clothing industry according to national survey of its industries vietnam had total 68429 clothing manufacturing establis hments as of june 30 1998 see table 3 the vast majority of those establishments 995 were household establishments families that were independently employed making clothes of the remaining 356 nonhousehold clothing establishments bout one in four were stateowned enterprises and about half were limited companies since 1998 vietnam has implemented seri of policy changes regarding the ownership of manufacturing establishmen ts in october 2005 vietnams national assembly passed new enterprise law77 that clarifies the distinction between different types of ownership as well as specifies which types of enterprises are open to foreign equity particip ation in addition the vietna mese government has also begun the process of divesting itself of fullownership of clothing manufacturers the purported goal is to transform the stat eowned enterprises in to joint shareholding or stock companies in which the state holds controlling interest the divesting process or equitization is to be completed in the clothing industry by 201078 table 4 distribution of real output of

companies does not insure that they will longer be subject to government intervention in their operations or free of state subsidies also unless there is corresponding change in managerial behavior the equitization of clothing companies does not automatically mean the new joint sharehol ding companies will be profitmotivated responsive to market pressures and free from political influence although most of vietnams clothing establishments are household operations the value of the nations clothing producti on is more evenly divided between the stateowned enterprises the domestic privat sector and foreigninvested companies see table 4 plus as the process of equitization continues and more overseas investors become partial owners of clot hing manufacturing facilities in vietnam there has been notable shift in the structure of production away from locallyowned state enterprises and household producers towa rds foreigninvested companies the decline of locallyowned state enterprises is most likely due to their transformation into joint shareholding companies th decline of household producers is probably attributable to increased competition from the joint shareholding companies

penetrate into potential markets fourth it will conduct research and improve technological applications in vietnams clothing and textile industries fifth vina tex will provide technical tr aining for the workers and management in vietnams cl othing and textile industry the equitization and restructuring of vinatex complicates the emerging structure of vietnams clothi ng industry from an ownership perspective growing portion of clothing production in vietnam is taking place outside of stateowned enterprises and in theory there will be stateowned clothing factories in vietnam by 2010 however the transformation of vinatex into holding company holding shares in many of vietnams largest clothing companies as well as major commercial bank raises questions about the real extent to which the vietnamese government is willing to release the clothing industry from state control level of subsidization there are number of direct and indi rect ways by which vietnam or any nation could subsidize its clothing industry among the direct ways are 1 financing investments for the clothing industry 2 offering incentive payments such as tax rebates for the achievement of export or production targets and 3 guaranteeing government procurement cont racts to domestic clothing manufacturers among the indirect ways are 1 offering below mark et loans or credit to vietnamese clothing companies 2 lowering or eliminating tariffs on imported materials or equipment used by the clothing industry 3 providing materials andor bor at below market prices and 4 erecting administrative barriers to foreign competition to vietnams clothing industry in its domestic consumer markethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34262crs27 85 under the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures defines two categories of subsidies prohibited subsid ies and actionable subsidies as the name implies the former are prohibited under the rms of the agreement because the subsidies are specifically designed to distort internati onal trade the prohibited subsidies consist of policies such as export targets or requirement s to use domestic goods actionable subsidies consist of government policies that another wto

wages down vietnams clothing companies can either earn higher profits or lower their prices below market prices higher profits woul d allow the clothing companies to expand their operations and secure larger share of the global clothing market and below market clothing prices woul d help vietnamese companies outcompete other clothing manufacturers there is some circumstantial evidence to support the claim that vietnams clothing companies are paying their work ers below market wage s several studies of vietnams clothing and xtile industry find that the av erage wage of clothing and textile

as re sult most of the profits in the clothing industry flows to the retailers ma rketers and branded manufacturers this analysis is based on commodity chain approach that examines the production flow of clothing from ra w materials to retail sale see table 5 in general the major retailers control both the design and the marketing of the final clothing items the wholesalers and expor ters typically

textile companies similarly purchase the raw materials they need from suppliers of either natural or synthetic fibers in gene ral this production chain is initiated by the decision of the retailers to

ilers once the clothing sh ipments are received and pass inspection the retailer pays the sourcing company who then pays the manufacturers within the confines of triangle manufacturing there is also pattern of progression for the clothing manufacturers at first the manufacturers tend to operate under cutmaketrim cmt rrangement with the sourcing company where the manufacturer is provided all the materials for the production of the clothing item and only assembles the fina l product later on the manufacturer may advance into an original equipment manufacturing oem arrangement in which the

separately product design and it is up to the manufacturer to purchas the necessary materials to make the clothing items in some cases clothing manufacturers have been able to expand their activities further out in the commodity chain and undertake original brandname manufacturing in which they may design the clothes to be sold either under their own brand name or under th brand name of major retailer because the sourcing company usually has significant number of manufacturers able to supply the clothing items competition for the subcontracts tends to be keen and the manufacturers ar often pushed to lower their prices and speed up their production in order to win the contract in vietnam the stateowned companies and the foreigninvested companies are generally considered better able to compete for triangle manufacturing contracts than the smaller private vietnamese enterprises because they are larger in size and have easier access to operating capital to improve the overall prof

indications that the modest shift away from the united states and back towards japan and the eu27 conti nued because of its concerns about the possible continuation of protective measures by the

being shifted to other asian sources rather than to manufacturers in the united states or elsewhere in the americas recent trends in us clothing production recent trends in the gross output of the us clothing industry provide an ambiguous picture of the possi ble effect of the recent rise in clothing imports from vietnam see figure 3 between 1997 to 2004 there was general decline in the value of us clothing production that co rresponded with the period of most rapid growth in the clothing imports from viet nam in 2005 us clothing production rose slightly at the same time that the growth in clothing imports from vietnam slowed down both of these trends were generally c onsistent with the argument that clothing imports from vietnam were displacing clot hing manufactured in the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34262crs37 however there are aspects of the recen t trade trends that raise doubts about causal link between the rise in clothing imports from vietnam taken alone and the decline in us clothing production first the decline in us production predates the end of the us trade embargo on vietna m indicating that other factors may be involved second the decline in us production between 2000 and 2004 over 30 billion is nearly 13 times the size of the increase in clothing imports from vietnam during the same time period another possible indication that other factors may be responsible for the decline in us clot hing production third both us clothing production and clothing imports from vietnam rose in 2005 which is contrary to the relationship expected if clothing imports from vietnam were causing decline in us production finally because its has b een relatively short period of time since vietnam has been allowed to export clothing to the united states it is difficult to demonstrate any reliable tre nds or conduct time series analysis that will provide statistically significant results implications for congress the completion of the two reviews by the department of commerce of its monitoring program provided little resolution or clarity to number of questions raised about the authority and the necess ity of establishing such monitoring program the doc press releases appear to have been carefully worded to avoid flat denial that there was evidence of dumping by vietnam while simultaneously providing possible grounds for the conti nuation of

one possible response for congress is to take action given that the doc is monitoring trade flows and has so far determined that there is insufficient evidence to initiate an antidumping i nvestigation it would appear that clothing imports from vietnam are generally in compliance with current us laws and regulations if congress were to consid er taken some action on this issue there are several aspects of the current status of usvie tnamese trade relations for clothing that might be examined first the departme nt of commerce has not publicly responded to requests from some members of congre ss the vietnamese government and some major us clothing importers for the legal basis for establishing the monitoring program the federal register announcem ent of the creation of the monitoring program did not include the usual federal law citation establishing the authority to create the program congress could act to revisit the question of docs legal authority for establishing the monitoring program second there was concern by several members of congress that the current us trade policy towards vietnams clothi ng imports may violate both the spirit and the letter of the us commitments to other wto members as such congress might act to review the monitoring prog ram to decide whether or not it violates existing wto agreements exposing the united states to the risk of formal complaint from vietnam third congress could investigate vietnams compliance with its promise to terminate all wtoprohibited subsidies to its clothing and textile industry as indicated by their submitted comments on the monitoring program some us textile manufacturers are concerned that vietnam is not living up to its promise and continues to use direct and indirect subs idies to support its clothing exports such an investigation might also include research into vietnams labor market to ascertain if the vietnamese government is suppr essing the wages of clothing and textile workers below fair market values fourth possibly based in part of the re sults the investiga tion mentioned above congress could choose to pass legislation designed to counteract perceived unfair trade practices by vietnam in its export of clothing to the united states the proposed legislation might incorporate provis ions that would make it easier to initiate antidumping or countervailing duty inves tigations in cases involving nonmarket economies such as vietnam fifth congress may decide to consider the claims of major clothing retailers and importers that the monitoring program has stunted trade with and investments in vietnam thereby possibly causing them economic harm the doc review was designed to examine trade data to determine whether or not there was sufficient evidence to selfinitiate an antidumping investigation against vietnam it did not analyze the trade data to determine if the program had distorted trade during its first six months of operation sixth congress could also investigate the administration and operation of the monitoring program to determine if it is co rrectly identifying the types of clothing in which there might be possible dumping by vietnam among the criteria typically considered as being necessary conditions for proof of possible dumping are below market prices and significant market share in its review of clothing imports fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34262crs39 vietnam the doc reported rising unit prices and implied that prices were comparable to other clothing suppliers as for market share some experts assert that unless supplier provides more than 4 of the overall supply of product it cannot cause sufficient harm to substantiate dumping claims at present there are very few categories of clothing for which vietna m achieves the market threshold level finally congress might decide to authorize its own study of the monitoring program data to see if there is any evidence of dumping andor sufficient evidence to warrant the continuation of the program one criticism previously raised with the docs biannual review proce ss was the problem of the s easonal nature of the global clothing market by assessing the monito ring program for full year congress could take into account the seasonal characteristics of the clothing market in evaluating the trade data
