postconflict iraq initially fell to the office of reconstruction and humanitarian assistance orha established in early 2003 orha was headed by lieutenant general jay m garner us army ret by june 2003 orha had been replaced or subsumed by the coalition provisional authority cpa which was led by ambassador l paul brem er iii on june 28 2004 cpa ceased operations whether cpa was federal agency is unclear competing though not necessarily mutually exclusive explanations for how it was established contribute to the uncertainty about its status some executive branch documents supported the notion that it was created by the president possibly as the result of national security pres idential directive nspd this document if it exists has not been made available to the public another possibility is that the authority was created by or pursuant to united nations security council resolution 1483 2003 finally two years after cpa was established justice department brief asserted that the thencommander of us central command centcom had created cpa given that its organizational status is uncertain an examination of selected features of cpa might be instructive in assessing what type of organization it was the authority was closely aligned with the department of defense dod the under secretary of defense designated the secretary of the army as executive agent for cpa other significant features of the authority included its office of inspector general oig or ig which was expected to work closely with the dod and us agency for international development usaid offices of inspector general the extent of its procurement activities its regulatory authority and its program review board an undated organization chart provided some insight into the structure of the authority although it did not include some key offices and positions such as the deputy administrator the oig and the legislative affairs staff provisions in several statutes included reporting requirements that bore directly or indirectly on cpa these included sections 2202b 2203 2207 and 3001 of pl 108106 117 stat 1209 and section 1203 of pl 108136 117 stat 1392 subsequent to the dissolution of cpa the question of its status arose in lawsuit filed against custer battles llc cb company that perf ormed work for cpa two former employees of cb alleged in lawsuit filed under the false claims act fca that the company had defrauded the federal government the case is united states ex rel drc inc v custer battles llc va cv04199a justice department attorneys concluded that cpa was an instrumentality of the

authority is not readily available instead there are three alternative explanations for how it was established one version suggests that the president established cpa another alternative suggests that cpa was established pursuant to united nations security council resolution and the third indicates that it was created by general tommy franks us army who was commander of the us central command centcom from july 6 2000 through july 7 2003 24 as will be discussed below these three possibilities are not necessarily mutually exclusive from the inception of cpa in 2003 until apr il 2005 when department of justice doj document stated that general franks had created cpa either of the first two alternatives presented here seemed to be the most likely explanations for the establishment of cpa the justice departments statement would seem to answer the question of who established cpa however general frankss role was not revealed publicly until april 2005 nearly two years after cpa was established and it is not clear whether there are any written materials that document general franks having established cpa and that predate his retirement also the revelation of his role in cpa followed other somewhat vague and sometimes contradictory explanations or comments about cpas origin during its 13month tenure therefore some might suggest that either of the other two alternatives could still be valid explanation for the origin of cpa

organization that succeeded orha was established by nspd 24 another directive nspd 36 dated may 11 2004 suggests how the president could have used this type of document to establish temporary organization within the federal government 25 one purpose of nspd 36 was to establish organizations that would succeed the cpa the iraq reconstruction management office irmo within the department of state and the project and contracting office pco within dod26 the president established both organizations pursuant to 5 usc 316127 this statutory provision addresses the employment and compensation

established by law or executive order for specific period not in excess of three years for the purpose of performing specific study or other project and 2 is terminated upon the completion of the study or project or upon the occurrence of condition related to the completion of the study or project it bears noting that none of the organiza tions mentioned herecpa irmo and pcowas established by executive order or statute however nspd 36 addressed this issue in the concluding paragraph this nspd shall be effective immediately shall constitute an executive order solely for purposes of 5 usc 3161 and shall not be subject to executive order 11030 of june 19 1962 as amended 28 it is possible that the language found in nspd 36 had been used in nspd 24 to establish ohra and eventually the cpa to oversee the reconstruction of iraq29 in january 2006 the special inspector general for iraq reconstruction sigir issued report on civilian personnel management under orha and cp by confirming that 5 usc 3161 was used to hire some of the civilian personnel for orha and cpa the report suggests that the administration established an organization using this provision of the us code an excerpt from the relevant section of the report follows the primary statutory provision that was used for employing civilians in iraq was title 5 section 3161 of the us code the 3161 provision enables temporary organizations to acquire staff through temporary appointments to the excepted service of the civil service orha and cpa used 3161 extensively to hire civilian personnel for periods of up to one year with the possibility of renewal accord ing to former cpa personnel specialist the 3161 hiring authority had long existed under 5 cfr 2133199 but it had been typically used to fill boards or commissions the provision was useful for rapid hiring because it allowed appointments from outside government without the usual competition required under formal job classifications the use of 3161 to staff the temporary stabilization and reconstruction organizations in iraq appears to have been unprecedented 30 it is possible to infer from the following excerpt from report to congress provided by the office of management and budget omb on behalf of the president that the president may have played role in creating the authority31 of particular interest are the statements that the cpa 28 us president gw bush united states government operations in iraq p 3 executive order 11030 governs the preparation presentation filing and publication of executive orders and requires that executive orders be published in the federal register 3 cfr 610612 1962 29 the legislative history concerning temporary organizations began in 1944 with the enactment of public law 359 during the 78th congress 31 usc 1347 section 213 of this statute prohibits the use of appropriated funds for or by any agency or entity established by executive order and in existence for more than one year if the congress has not appropriated any money specifically for such agency or instrumentality or specifically authorized the expenditure of funds by it section 1347 of pl 97258 codified this provision in title 31 of the us code however 5 usc 3161 supersedes both of these statutes because it was enacted at later date 30 special inspector general for iraq reconstruction iraq reconstruction lessons in human capital

the cpa exercises powers of government temporarily in order to provide for the effective administration of iraq to restore conditions of security and stability to create conditions in which the iraqi

and judicial authority necessary to achieve its objectives exercised consistent with relevant security council resolutions including security council resolution 1483 32 and the laws and usages of war the cpa administrator has primary responsibility for exercising this authority33 the clearest statement that the us government played part in establishing the authority is found in letter submitted to the president of the united nations security council by the permanent representatives of the united states and the united kingdom dated two days after ambassador bremer was appointed by president bush as the presidential envoy to iraq the letter stated in part in order to meet these objectives and obligations disarming iraq and providing for the humanitarian needs of iraqis in the postconflict period in iraq the united states the united kingdom and coalition partners acting under existing command and control arrangements through the commander of coalition forces have created the coalition provisional authority which includes the office of reconstruction and humanitarian assistance to exercise powers of government temporarily and as necessary especially to provide security to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid and to eliminate weapons of mass destruction 34 while this excerpt can be viewed as an acknowledgment that the united states and the united kingdom established cpa it does not explain how the authority was established nor does it resolve the question of its organizational agency status government documents supporting the notion that cpa was federal entity which suggests in turn that it was created by the president include two presidential memoranda may 6 2003 memorandum as amended by december 5 2003 memorandum stated in part 35 32 security council resolution 1483

reconstruction multiple agencies are deployed with the coalition provisional authority cpa and are serving as implementing partners or executing agents for programs and projects these agencies will identify funding requirements for such programs and projects through cpa omb will work with cpa to transfer funds to the appropriate implementing agency 36 the authoritys intimate involvement in the funding process for work done by federal government agencies in iraq further suggests that the cpa is federal entity language in the fy2004 emergency supplemental also stated that the cpa was part of the federal government in describing how the apportionment of 18649 billion was to be carried out pl 108106 stated funds appropriated under this heading iraq relief and reconstruction fund shall be apportioned only to the coalition provisional authority in iraq in its capacity as an entity of the united states government the department of state the department of health and human services the department of treasury the department of defense and the united states agency for international development 37 according to this excerpt the authority was an entity of the federal government information provided by cpa itself indicated that its sector program management offices spmos were part of the federal government the cpas pmo was supported by six spmos in written response to question asked at january 21 2004 preproposal conference on contracting opportunities the cpa stated that the sector program management office spmo is government entity 38 yet another organization related to cpa is on record as stating that the us government created cpa39 the special inspector general for iraq reconstruction included this statement in its january 2006 report on civilian personnel management under orha and cpa nonetheless questions remain regarding how cpa was established who established it the precise nature of its relationship to dod including dod components and other federal entities and whether cpa was federal agency or some other type of government organization another continued reconstruction and humanitarian assistance or orha be replaced by coalition

possibility is that united nations security council resolution 1483 2003 was instrumental in creating the authority view supported by several documents released by the executive branch solicitation issued by the pentagon renovation office on behalf of cpa for procuring pmo support services stated in the overview the cpa was enacted by the united nations security council under resolution 1483 2003 40 other government documents including the presidents proposed budget for fy2005 and pl 108106 stated that the authority was established pursuant to resolution 148341 this statement does not necessarily contradict the language found elsewhere in the fy2004 emergency supplemental stating that cpa is an entity of the us government for the reason discussed above nevertheless repeated references to resolution 1483 might be viewed by some as implying that the resolution alone authorized or established coalitionbased organization in iraq or might contribute to confusion about the organizational st atus of the authority relevant portions of the resolution are as follows the security council noting the letter of 8 may 2003 from the permanent representatives of the united states of america and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland to the president of the security council s2003538 and recognizing the specific authorities responsibilities and obligations under applicable international law of these states as occupying powers under unified command the authority calls upon the authority consistent with the charter of the united nations and other relevant international law to promote the welfare of the iraqi people through the effective administration of the territory including in particular working towards the restoration of conditions of security and stability and the creation of conditions in which the iraqi people can freely determine their own future 42 while recognizing the responsibility to be borne by the united states and the united kingdom in restoring security and stability in iraq this resolution did not establish or authorize the creation of specific organization to carry out this responsibility in the words of former administrator of the office of federal procurement policy the resolution noted and recognized but did not establish cpa 43 lending support to the notion that the authority was not federal agency but instead was an amorphous international organization are statements by the department of the army in 2003 two protests were filed with the general accounting office gao this agency was renamed the government

dismissed both protests without having to rule on the status of cpa in letter submitted to gao during the protest process the us army legal services agency was unequivocal in its argument that cpa is not federal agency the cpa is not federal agency rather as the hca cpas head of contracting activity explains the coalition provisional authority cpa is multinational coalition that exercises powers of government temporarily in order to provide for the effective administration of iraq during the period of transitional administration to restore conditions of security and stability to create conditions in which the iraqi people can freely determine their own political future including by advancing efforts to restore and establish national and local institutions for representative govern ance and facilitating economic recovery and sustainable reconstruction and development cpa is vested with all executive legislative and judicial authority necessary to achieve its objectives to be exercised under relevant security council resolutions including resolution 1483 2003 and the laws and usages of war this authority is exercised by the cpa administrator the gao does not have jurisdiction over this protest because cpa is not federal agency the cpa is an organization comprised of members from coalition of countries cpa is analogous to an organization such as natos north atlantic treaty organizations stabilization force sfor in bosnia and croatia the sfor has its own contracting organization the theatre allied contracting office taco which may utilize the services of united states military personnel like the taco cpa is not federal agency like nato and sfor cpa is composed of an international coalition security council resolution 1483 2003 recognizes cpa as the authority to govern iraq and grants the cpa discretion to disburse funds in the development fund for iraq dfi 44 while the cpa did employ individuals from coaliti on countries there were at least two significant differences between cpa and sfor the sfor is overseen by multinational organization the north atlantic treaty organization na to and it was authorized by united nations security council resolution 1088 1996 45 the security councils resolution explicitly authorized the establishment of sfor as it also did for the precu rsor entity the implementation force ifor the security council authorizes the member states to establish for planned period of 18 months multinational stabilization force sfor as the legal successor to ifor under unified command and control 46 given that pl 108106 and other government docum ents stated that cpa was us government entity the armys response raises questions arguably the army was concerned that some would assume precisely because of references to the authority as government entity that cpa was federal agency another possibility is that the army as the executive agent for the authority discussed below assumed responsibility for certa in procurement activities and tasks such as responding to protests and thus argued st rongly for excluding cpa from the gao protest process 44 maj frank march department of the army united

of the authority the fy2004 emergency supplemental referred to cpa as an entity of the united states government47 in the national defense authorization act for fy2004 section 1203b1 mentioned civilian

postconflict iraq 50 eschewing the word agency in favor of entity group and activities in legislation and congressional documents could be reflection of the administrations approach an acknowledgment that cpas status was uncertain or sign that congress agreed that cpa was not an agency documents produced by the administration and the cpa do not state precisely how this organization was established

iraq general tommy franks united states army who was also the commander of the us central command the establishment of the cpa by the coalition was formally recognized by unscr united nations security council resolution 1483 since the coalition forces had established and exercised actual authority over the territory of iraq under the laws of war and occupation the authority of the defeated iraqi regime of saddam hussein passed into the hands of the coalition forces general franks established the cpa under the laws of war to perform civil government functions in liberated iraq during the brief occupation 53 this statement by the justice department may not settle the question of how cpa was established by whom and under what authority54 the fact that cpa had predecessor in orha raises questions about the justice departments explanation for the origin of cpa although orha and cpa were responsible for essentially the same mission in iraq and although cpa subsumed or succeeded orha the origins of these two organizations apparently differed orha was established by the president through nspd 2455 cpa was established according to the justice department by the commander of centcom under the laws of war56 as noted above the cpa ig stated that ohra became cpa in may 200357 while the dod ig indicated that the deputy secretary of defense dissolved orha and shifted orhas functions responsibilities and legal obligations to cpa58 it is unclear why two different methods were used to create these organizations and why w ith orha already in place and functioning under nspd 24 it was necessary for the centcom commander to establish another new organization while the statement that the authority of the defeated iraqi regime of saddam hussein passed into the hands of the coalition forces59 may be accurate and while it suggests why general franks established cpa the statement appears to overlook the existence of orha as noted above orha had been created in january 2003 two months prior to the fall of baghdad the authority that passed into the coalition forces hands when they invaded iraq presumably would have been accorded to orha the supplemental brief apparently fails to mention not only that cpa was preceded by orha but also that orha apparently was still in existence when cpa was established as noted above it appears that the justice departments supplemental brief represents the initial disclosure of the thencentcom commanders role in creating cpa however the legal brief does not include source for this statement and it does not otherwise indicate that there is any written documentation of this action it is not known how general franks established cpa or 53 supplemental brief of the united states in response to the courts invitation at pp 67 united

destruction61 the complete text of this document is at the appendix despite the text included in the april 16 2003 leaflet dod does not appear to have issued any statement in 2003 documenting general franks decision to establish cpa62 the lack of document that implemented or authorized the creation of cpa also was noted by the federal judge presiding in united states v custer battles who wrote this proclamation the april 16 2003 leaflet was not followed by any formal document or order establishing the cpa or defining its legal responsibilities 63 additionally mention was made of general franks role in creating cpa during ceremony at the white house on december 14 2004 when he ambassador bremer and george tenet the former director of central intelligence were awarded presidential medals of freedom by the president64 the apparent lack of publicly available documentation about the creation of cpa by centcom and the fact that disclosure of cpas origins was made by the justice department and did not occur until spring 2005 might lead some to question whether this explanation of cpas creation accurately reflects what occurred in may or june 2003

of the cpa arguably extended to its status within the executive branch it is not clear whether the authority was federal agency or could be treated as such what is known is that the cpa was neither an executive department nor government corporation executive departments are identified by statute and government corporations are corpo rations owned or controlled by the government 60 in its lessons

following description of dod executive agent indicates that executive agents are assigned responsibility for dod missions activities or tasks the head of dod component to whom the secretary of defense or the deputy secretary of defense has assigned specific responsibilities functions and authorities to provide defined levels of support for operational missions or administrative or other designated activities that involve two or more of the dod components the nature and scope of the dod executive agents responsib ilities functions and authorities shall be prescribed at the time of assignment and remain in effect until the secretary of defense or the deputy secretary of defense revokes or suspends them 75 this definition would arguably cast cpa as dod component broad interpretation though might allow the secretary or deputy secretary to appoint an executive agent for nondod entity or even nongovernmental entity dods policy governing the use of executive agents leaves open this possibility 41 the dod executive agent designation sha ll be conferred when 411 existing means to accomplish dod objectives exists 41 2 dod resources need to be focused on specific area or areas of responsibility in orde r to minimize duplication or redundancy or 413 such designation is required by law executive order or governmentwide regulation 76 74 paul wolfowitz deputy secretary for defense

assigned to nondod or non governmental entity it appears that item 411 item 412 or both might have applied to the circumstances surrounding dod and cpa it seems likely that item 413 would not have applied because law executive order or government regulation had been enacted issued or produced that required or authorized the army to serve as executive agent mention is made in the deputy secretarys january 14 2003 memorandum of which rationale applied to the authority deputy secretary of defense wolfowitz did note th at department of defe nse instruction number 400019 applied to the provision of supplies and services to the cpa this document provides guidance for intragovernmental and interservice support which are defined as follows intragovernmental support is support provided by dod activity to nondod federal activity and vice versait does not include support provided to or received from foreign governments interservice support is support provided by one dod activity to dod activity of another military service defense agency unified combatant command army reserves navy reserves air force reserves marine corps reserves air national guard or field activity 77 deputy secretary wolfowitzs memorandum did not indicate whether the authority received support from the army under an interservice or an intragovernmental agreement which leaves unanswered the question of whethe r cpa was part of dod or simply attached to it for the purposes of facilitating coordination with and receiving support from the department of the army nevertheless dod inst ruction 400019 clarifies that nondod entity may receive support from dod in either case intragovernmental or interservice agreement documentation is required broad areas of recurring interservice and intragovernmental support and cooperation that do not require reimbursement should be documented with memorandum of agreement moa or memorandum of understanding mou recurring interservice and intragovernmental support that requires reimbursement shall be documented on dd department of defense form 1144 support agreement or similar format that contains all the information required on dd

responsibilities and authorities outlined in the inspector general act of 1978 5 usc appendix82 the cpa inspector general ig was authorized to conduct supervise and coordinate audits and investigations of the treatment handling and expenditure of appropriated funds by the coalition provisional authority in iraq83 this involved for example monitoring obligations and expenditures reconstruction activities contracts and transfers of funds and associated information between and among the cpa and other departments agencies and entities of the federal government 84 it seems that the cpa ig was to be treated the same as any federal agencys oig the cpa office was to coordinate with the dod and usaid offices of inspector general85 additionally any federal department or agency that was asked to provide information or assistance to the cpa oig was to do so86 in his statement on the emergency supplemental the president apparently placed some restrictions on cpa s oig he noted that the inspector general was to refrain from initiating carrying out or completing an audit or investigation or from issuing subpoena which requires access to sensitive operation plans intelligence matters counterintelligence matters ongoing criminal investigations by other administrative units of the department of defense related to national security or other matters the disclosure of which would constitute threat to national security the secretary of defense may make exceptions to the foregoing direction in the public interest 87 the cpa ig was to terminate its operations six months

solicitations for support for the cpas program management office pmo and sector pmos proposals were to be s ubmitted to the pentagon renovation office but there was requirement for proposals for the program management office pmo and sector program management offices spmos contracts to be submitted to the iraq reconstruction contracting office solicitations were issued on january 6 2004 and by march 26 2004 all 17 contracts were awarded 97 apparently official explanation as to why the cpa did not issue these solicitations was offered possible factor in the decision to decentralize the solicitation evaluation and award processes might have been the scheduled termin ation of the cpa knowing that the cpa would terminate operations by june 30 2004 administration officials might have chosen the route they did in order to maintain continuity another possible reason why cpa was limited to monitoring contracts may be that government officials ascertained that the authority did not have enough personnel or enough personnel with sufficient experience in the types of work to be done in iraq to develop solicitations and evaluate proposals for seven major sectors the pmo and the spmos the fact that cpa needed contractor support for its pmo and spmos tends to support the notion that it did not have enough resources to perform all of the necessary procurement tasks third consideration might have been the possibility of protests particularly the possibility that contractor would file protest with gao chal lenging the authoritys actions or decisions concerning the award of contract as discussed below few companies did file protests with gao concerning cpa decisions perhaps the us government wanted to avoid the possibility that additional protests targeting cpa would be filed with gao as noted below cpas own 95 paul wolfowitz deputy secretary of defense determination and findings available from the author in this document the deputy secretary used the public

only allowed for protests to be filed with cpa officials the former administrator of the office of federal procurement policy in writing about contracting with the authority offered another possible explanation of why government officials chose to have dod components issue solicitations and award contracts for the reconstruction of iraq the cpa is not the united states government accordingl if one enters into contractual relationship with the cpa one is not entering into contractual relationship with the united states the rights and remedies available to pa rties contracting with the united states will not be available in contractual relationship with the cpa the remedies available to an aggrieved contracting party will be determined in part by the source of the money through which the contracting party is paid 98 government officials may have considered the question of the cpa s organizational status and the possibility that contract with the authority would not be contract with the us government these considerations might have contributed to determination that it would not be appropriate for cpa to enter into contracts funded by appropriated funds there is some question as to whether the authority used appropriated funds for projects involving the reconstruction of iraq in letter it submitted to gao on the matter of the turkcell consortium protest see below the united states army legal services agency stated the funds cpa is using for contracts are not appropriated funds even if this action issuing licenses for mobile telecommunications was procurement that involved the use of funds cpa would use dfi development fund for iraq funds not us appropriated funds for its cpa mission99 this letter was written few weeks before the fy2004 emergency supplemental was enacted so possibly the army was commenting only on conditions at the time if so then the armys assertion in the turkcell consortium bid protest might not have applied to subsequent procurement actions other evidence suggests that cpa used appropriated funds for reconstruction activities news article that mentioned the activities of the cpas program review board see below indicates the authority spent appropriated funds from minutes published by the cpas program review board it appears that the cpa has the power to shift monies between appropriated funds accounts and the development fund of iraq which contains funds from both iraqi and foreign donated sources 352 restore iraqi infrastructure 711m million the board considered the request from task force rio restore iraqi oil for changing the funding source from appropriated funds to the development fund of iraq previously approved request 352 total amount approved 962m 251m was already provided from the natural resource risk remediation fund nrrrf an appropriated funds account tf rio indicated that 711m is outstanding and required but of that amount 466m was immediately required to complete projects under phase i the

units battery cells vehicles berets turbine parts police records management system information technology products agricultural equipment satellite data communications and railroad equipment parts and services 101 it is unknown what funds cpa used to purchase items and services listed in its solicitations if cpa used iraqi funds then cpa memorandum number 4 applied iraqi funds were defined in this memorandum as funds under the control of the coalition provisional authority consisting of proceeds from iraqi stateowned property that has been vested or seized in accordance with applicable law and made available to the cpa to assist the iraqi people and assist in the reconstruction of iraq and b funds in the development fund for iraq the establishment of which is noted in resolution 1483 2203 as used in this memorandum iraqi funds do not include funds provided through the appropriations process of coalition member governments for example funds provided directly to the cpa by the go vernments of the united states or the united kingdom 102 if cpa used appropriated funds it would seem reasonable for authority personnel to have followed the federal acquisition regulation far which governs federal agency procurement activities review of three cpa solicitations showed that two sand bags and information technology included numerous references to the far sand bags and information technology products the third solicitation for berets included only one reference to the far without additional detailed information about the authoritys contracting activities it is difficult to ascertain the source of funds and the guidance used for each procurement the former administrator of the office of federal procurement policy ofpp has stated that rules are in place for contracting by

board prb which reported directly to him the boards general duty was to be responsible for recommending expenditures of resources from the development fund for iraq and other resources identified elsewhere in the regulation in developing funding plans the prb recommends disbursements of appropriated funds iraqi property lawfully vested in the us treasury funds cash or other financial instruments owned by iraq or the former regime and the development fund for iraq news article asserted that the prb really controls only the iraqi money 104 however as noted above news article indicated the prb was involved in spending appropriated funds the board was also responsible for proposing principles and standards for expending funds for the relief and recovery of iraq in fair consistent and transparent manner through contracts or otherwise105 the board consisted of chairman who was appointed by the cpa administrator the directors of economic policy civil affairs policy the usaidiraq mission operations and security affairs all of whom apparently were cpa personnel and authorized representatives of the commander of coalition forces the iraqi ministry of finance the united kingdom australia and the chairman of the council for international coor dination if the prb took action on any matter relating to the disposition of appropriated funds then the voting membership was also to include authorized representatives of dod and departments of the treasury and state additionally the status of the authorized representatives of the iraqi ministry of finance the united kingdom australia and council for international coordination shifted from voting to nonvoting on the disposition of appropriated funds others who were permitted to attend board meetings as nonvoting members included the cpa comptroller and general counsel program coordinator of the board and authorized representatives of omb the office of the secretary of defense the international monetary fund

telecommunications licenses gaos second bid protest decision identified the cognizant agency as department of the army for the agency109 reportedly the us army was also listed as the cognizant agency on gaos docket for the first protest and the solicitation number was listed as unknown110 citing dismissal request submitted by the army gao stated in its decision on the second protest the department of the army argued that our office lacks jurisdiction to hear this protest because the cpa is not federal agency111 due to the fact that both protests were dismissed on other grounds there was need for gao to resolve the question of whether the cpa is federal agency for purposes of our gao bid protes t jurisdiction under cica competition in contracting act of 1984112 in its second decision on this case however gao explained its authority to decide bid protests and described circumstances under which it could have jurisdiction to handle bid protests concerning cpa the authority of our office to decide bid protests is based on the competition in contracting act of 1984 cica and encompasses written objection by an interested party to solicitation or other request by federal agency for offers for contract for the procurement of property or services our jurisdiction does not turn on whether appropriated funds are involved or on whether the competition requirements of cica apply we note that even if we ultimately determine that the cpa is not federal agency we may well assume jurisdiction if the challenged procurement is conducted on the cpas behalf by an entity that is federal agency such as the department of the army in any event we would also consider request by the cpa for our office to consider protests outside the framework of cica 113 cpas award of contract to nour usa to equip the iraqi armed forces and the iraqi civil defense corps also was the subject of protests solicitation was issued on november 11 2003 and cpa which was explicitly identified as the contracting activity in the press release received 19 bids 114 in press release dated january 31 2004 cpa announced that it had awarded contract for 327 million to nour usa in midfebruary it was reported that two co mpanies cemex global inc and bumar group had filed separate protests which were combined by gao into one protest challenging the awarding of this contract to nour usa among their concerns were 1 the relatively low cost of the nour usa proposal which was 231 million lower than the bumar groups proposal 2 the fact that nours president was huda faouki who allegedly is friend of ahmad chalabi who had been member of the iraqi governing council and 3 the belief that nour usa which apparently was established in may 2003 had experience in performing the work necessary to fulfill the terms of the contract 115 subsequently four additional protests were filed with gao in each of 109 us general accounting office turkcell consortium bid protest file b2930482 november 12 2003 p 1

g344g345g561the six protests the department of the army was listed as the cognizant agency and the solicitation number fy586604r0001 was included116 reportedly cpa indicated on march 3 that it would reevaluate all timely proposals and make new source selection decision117 in light of the governments decision to reevaluate proposals gao dismissed all protests118 in march 5 2004 press release the cpa pmo briefly described plans for rectifying the situation which involved the army but not cpa today the army announced it will terminate its contract with nour usa to equip the new iraqi army protests were filed subsequent to the award to nour protests are part of transparent and fair procurement process as result of an internal review the army has determined there were irregularities in this specific contract action and took appropriate measures to assess the validity of the protests the army will conduct complete resolicitation schedule release of the solicitation is to be determined the army wants to ensure the pro cess is transparent fair and conduct in an expeditious manner 119 reportedly control of the procurement process transferred from cpa to the army materiel command120 explanation was provided as to why the army terminated the contract when the press release that announced the award of contract to nour identified cpa as the contracting activity see above possible question could be posed for ex ample why cpa if it was the organization that awarded the contract initially did not cancel the contract while the department of the army provided support to cpa particularly in the ar ea of acquisition it is unclear how why or under what circumstances federal agency might cancel contract awarded by another entity and assume responsibility for subsequent procurement activities neither cpa nor dod disclosed why the department of the army and not the authority was listed on gaos bid protest docket for protests involving contracting actions apparently undertaken by cpa as for reconstruction contracts funded by the fy2004 supplemental the fact that dod components such as the army corps of engineers and the naval facilities engineering command were the contracting activities would seem to preclude the possibility that an offeror would file protest with gao challenging cpa considering the department of the armys assertion during the protest by turkcell consortium that cpa was not an agency it suggests that there might have been some unknown advantages to shielding cpa from protests 121 without further information about cpas procurement process and organizational status it is unclear whether any advantages existed and if so what they might have been it is unknown whether any offerors filed protests under the provisions of coalition provisional authority memorandum number 4 which as noted above provided procurement rules for what 116 the file numbers assigned by gao to these protests were b293676001 through b293676006 117 dooley

authority invested in cpa by the president unlike the heads of federal agencies however the administrator did not follow th administrative procedure act apa which governs informal and formal rule

these contracting activities and us government funds were not expended although some may concur with the judges 2006 an alysis of the status of cpa see below arguably the significance of custer battles aside from the outcome may have more to do with the insight provided by department of justice attorneys and judge ts ellis iii133 in brief dated april 1 2005 and submitted to judge ellis doj attorneys examined two issues related to financial transactions involving custer battles and the biap and ice contracts thus the specific issue to be determined is whether the money which defendants custer battles requested from the cpa via their invoices under these two contracts was to be paid out provided or approved by the united states government the answer lies in the nature of the funds used to fund these two contracts the second issue is whether the claims were presented to us government officials 134 the department of justice determined that the us government possessed controlled andor administered the funds used to pay custer battle s the us government paid out approved or provided these funds and custer battles had presented claims for funds to an officer or 131 brief of the

custer battless claims presented to the cpa under the biap and ice contracts would violate fca if the claims are shown to have been knowingly false because those claims were for funds in which the us had an interest or exercised certain dominion and were to be paid out provided or approved by the united states and they were ultimately presented to an officer or employee of the united states government 136 in response to an order from the us district court dated april 12 2005 justice department attorneys filed supplemental brief that addressed the question of whether cpa was us government entity agency or instrumentality for the purposes of the fca in their supplemental brief the attorneys emphasized several times that determining the status of cpa was unnecessary yet they did present set of criteria for determining whether cpa was part of the us government for the purposes of the false claims act137their criteria and excerpts from their responses follow how and under what circumstances was the entity created the cpa was created by the commander of the coalition forces in iraq general tommy franks united states army who was also the commander of the us central command the establishment of the cpa by the coalition was formally recognized by unscr united nations security council resolution 1483 is the entity subject to the general supervision and direction of the executive branch is its head appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate the cpa administrator was subject to the direction of the president admi nistrator bremer served as presidential envoy and reported to the president through the secretary of defense is the entitys funding or its capital formed or replaced out of the public treasury and are any gains returned to the public treasury th cpas operating funds were appropriated by congress are all of the entitys officers and other personnel employees of the united states many if not most officers and employees of the cpa were employees of the united states others were employees of other member states of the coalition are there close budgetary auditing and fiscal controls that resemble those imposed on the ordinary government agency while congress initially imposed close budgetary auditing and fiscal controls over the cpa operations with regard to the dfi development fund for iraq that resemble those imposed on the ordinary government agency congress created the office of inspector general for the cpa to perform those types of oversight functions is the structure of the entity simply an administrative device established for the purpose of carrying out federal program with public funds the cpa was the administrative device 135 brief of the united states at pp 2830 3435 37 39 136 ibid p 40 137 as reported in the washington post the briefs came after multiple requests from judge ellis who chided the justice department for only reluctantly weighing in on th case ellis said it may be because the

it could griff witte judge considers whistleblowers iraq contracting suit washington post may 13 2005 p e3

perform civil government functions in liberated iraq during the brief period of occupation as an active member of the coalition the united states played an important role in and had certain responsibilities for the occupation which it chose to fulfill through creation of and participation in the cpa the cpas structure was not established by congress and thus the structure is not the typical congressionally created administrative device to fulfill government function 138 in reaching their determination that cpa was an instrumentality of the us government the justice department attorneys wrote two factors tip the scale in favor of the conclusion that the cpa should be deemed to be an instrumentality of the united states for purposes of the false claims act first is the nature of the appointment and supervision of ambassador bremer as presidential envoy and administrator of the cpa all authority of the cpa rested in the administrator and ambassador bremer was employed by the unite d states served at the pleasure of the president and was under the supervision of the president and the secretary of defense second coupled with the status of ambassador bremer is the fact that all of the money used for the two contracts at issue in this case was spent only on the authority and control of an officer or employee of the united states or member of the armed forces of the united states thus while we emphasize again that the answer to the courts latest question on the nature of the cpa is not necessary to determine whether or not defendants violated the fca when they presented claims to the cpa under the two contracts at issue in this litigation we nevertheless conclude that the cpa is an instrumentality of the united states for purposes of the false claims act 139 in july 2005 judge ellis issued an opinion noting first that if cpa had been us government agency the question of whether the fca applied to cpa contract actions would be largely resolved140 however the judge went on to note that the essential nature of the cpa is shrouded with ambiguity the cpa s origins are difficu lt to pin down as there is formal document whether statute united nations security council resolution or other organic documentthat plainly establishes the cpa or provides for its formation 141 near the end of his opinion the judge suggested that the question of cpa s status might need to be addressed again at some later date although it initially appeared otherwise it now appears unnecessary to reach and decide at this time whether the cpa is an instrumentality of the united states the dispute as to the nature of the cpa may ultimately prove to be material142 judge ellis then turned to the question of the source and ownership of the three funds in questionvested funds seized funds and the development fund for iraq dfi143and determined that the fca applies to vested and seized funds but it does not apply to the dfi144 138 supplemental

payment from seized or vested funds constitutes claim within the meaning of the fca requests for payment from funds in the dfi however were requests for iraqi funds and thus did not constitute an fca claim judge elliss ruling permitted the case against custer battles to go forwardbecause vested and seized funds were used to pay the biap contract and seized funds were used in part to pay for the ice contractand in march 2006 it was reported that jury found that cb had submitted 3 million in false claims against funds seized by the united states 145 however in august 2006 judge ellis issued second opinion in response to custer battles request for directed judgment overturning the jurys verdict he ruled in favor of custer battles noting that the relators did not prove that the claims were presented to the united states146 in crafting his 2006 opinion which addressed the iraqi currency exchange project judge ellis concluded that it was necessary to address the question of cpa s status147 after revisiting the analysis of cpa included in hi s 2005 opinion the judge wrote the result of that analysis is clearalthough the cpa was principally controlled and funded by the us this degree of control di d not rise to the level of exclusive control required to qualify as an instrumentality of the us government see rainwater 356 us at 59254 in fact the evidence clearly establishes that it was created through and governed by multinational consent 148 judge ellis ruled on the claim involving custer battles baghdad international airport contract in early 2007 he determined that custer battles had not fraudulently induced iraqs coalition provisional authority cpa to award it contract to perform security services for the baghdad international airport biap by representing that it would provide 138 security personnel149 specifically judge ellis noted the following in summary undisputed facts manifestly demonstrate that relators cannot establish fraudulent inducement claim under the fca because they have failed to show i that custer battles made false statement regarding fixed security personnel staffing levels ii that custer battles knowingly made this allegedly false statement and iii that this allegedly false statement was material to the cpas decision to award the biap contract to custer battles 150 except for summary of what transpired previously in this case the judge did not revisit the issue of the status of cpa in his 2007 opinion 145 martha matthews jury finds custer battles made 3m in false claims under one iraq contract federal contracts report vol

attorneys determined for the purposes of the fca that it was an instrument ality of the us government but judge ellis reasoned that it was not additionally at least one alternative explanation still exists regarding the creation of cpa which was discussed above that is the president may establish an organization under 5 usc 3161 however without access to nspd 24 which apparently created or authorized the establishment of orha and which also may have been the instrument under which cpa was created it is difficult to ascertain whether this could be valid alternative explanation or the definitive explanation yet another possibility is that cpa was hybrid organization meaning that it had multiple origins perhaps then the seemingly contradictory explanations actually are reflection of the organizations hybrid status furthermore if cpa was hybrid organization could this mean that it was part us government organization and part multinational organization if so how might this arrangement have affected how cpa operate d what would the implications have been for cpas activities and to whom was cpa accountable the differing interpretations offered by justice department attorneys and judge ellis and the questions surrounding nspd 24 highlight the difficulties inherent in attempting to discern the true origins of cpa thus it appears that the question of how cpa was established by whom and under what circumstances remains unanswered at least for some g6g146g156g140g158g156g156g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g5g18g3g561 the status of this organization remains open to question letter exists that states that the united states and the united kingdom created the authority in 2005 justice department attorneys identified general franks as the individual who established cpa and the possibility exists that the organizations origins are to be found in nspd 24 explicit unambiguous and authoritative statement has been provided that declares how cpa was established under what authority and by whom and that clarifies the seeming inconsistencies among alternative explanations for how cpa was created perhaps this ambiguity allowed the authority to pe rform multiple roles each with its own chain of command stakeholders or constituents funding and accountability policies and mechanisms statement in the fy2004 emergency supplementali n its cpa capacity as an entity of the united state governmentsuggested that us government entity is only one of cpas roles other roles might have included temporarily aiding in the governing of iraq and serving as part of coalition possibly the mix of arrangements allowed cpa to operate with greater discretion and more authority and have access to more resources than if it had been solely federal agency or an arm of the united nations 151 cpa personnel also might have been able to work more 151 in briefing on contracting programs in iraq lawrence di rita principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for public affairs

to necessarily be the one whos patient enough to sort through all the peacetime restrictions on the use of f unds thats somebody elses job people are doing that these restriction are real they were put in place for very g ood reason but theyre restrictions that bear some scrutiny now that were trying to address problem that is real time and its not only realtime problem its realtime continued

than one set of laws regulations and policies cpa possibly could have expanded the scope and reach of the organizations authority beyond what it would be otherwise for example the cpa administrator drafted the regulations orders memoranda and public notices that applied to iraq and the program review board had jurisdiction over four funding sources including appropriated funds an advantage of having the cpa treated as part of the department of defense is that the chain of command ran through the executive branch which would not have been the case if cpa were purely an international organization or coalition billing itself as an international coalition whil eschewing the label federal agency might be construed as an effort to make the organization more palatable at least symbolically to iraqis and others for example the cpa website address ended com and the pmo website ended net united states government website addresses typically end gov furthermore the iraqi flag is the only flag that appeared on the two websites flags from coalition countries were displayed potential drawbacks of this arrangement were that the lines of authority and accountability could have become tangled or even obscured cpa personnel possibly could have found it difficult to understand and delineate clearlyon daily basisthe organizations different roles and associated funds laws and rules 152 personnel might have been hampered by this tangle of resources laws and documents and could have found themselves engaging in questionable and perhaps unethical or criminal activities this scenario also could have proven challenging for organizations that attempted to monitor cpa and its activities when the authority made decision or expended funds it might not have been clear to external parties under what authority it was acting without transparency the cpa might have given the appearance of shifting funds personnel and tasks among different roles further compounding the problem oversight initiatives might have been met with the response that the activity in question was carried out under an authority over which the oversight bodycongresshad jurisdiction while greater transparency possibly could have helped to clarify cpas roles knowing how cpa was established and under what authority would go long way in helping to determine whether it was federal agency the scope of its authority and the forms types and mechanisms of accountability to which it was subject these questions remain relevant even after cpas continued problem where people are being killed but i can tell you that the people who are responsible who have that more who have that broader view of how this money is allocated and what those restrictions are are working through the problem in very aggressive wayambassador bremer general abizaid general sanchez we have lot of restrictions on the way some money can be spent fewer restrictions on the way other money can be spent and were trying our best to kind of make those determinations all the time rear admiral david j nash ret director cpa program management office and lawrence di rita principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for
