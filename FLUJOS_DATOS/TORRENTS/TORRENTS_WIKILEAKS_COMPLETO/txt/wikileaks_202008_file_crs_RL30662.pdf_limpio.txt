continuedembassy security background funding and the budget background us embassy security needs have evolved and expanded over recent decades during the 1950s us embassies were intentionally grand and highly visible to showcase the american way of life and promote democracy it was believed then that by placing embassies in the center of foreign cities us diplomats and services would be more accessible and inviting to americans as well as local officials and residents throughout the 1960s vietnamrelat ed demonstrations and attacks at embassies mostly involving destruction of property were on the rise and in 1965 the united states witnessed the dawning of new level of violence when 3 embassy employees were killed in the us embassy in saigon the 1970s were marked by frequent terrorist attacks on embassies the decade ended with the hostage taking in tehran in 1979 in response to the increasing frequency and seriousness of incidents the state department with congressional support initiated the security enhancement program sep in august 1980 the object of sep was to improve protection of mission personnel us government property and classified information at posts where the foreign government was unwilling or unable to provide effective protection experts were sent abroad to assess certain embassy security needs where high medium or low threat of mob violence had been determined and then recommend improvements the issue of embassy security again gained focus and urgency after the bombing of the us embassy in beirut lebanon in april 1983 the bombing of the marine barracks in beirut in october 1983 and the bombing of the embassy annex in beirut in september 1984 these incidents awakened the united states to the destructive power of explosiveladen trucks and car bombs the bombings resulted in the passage of the 1984 act to combat international terrorism pl 98533 which authorized reward payments for information leading to the arrest of individuals involved in terrorist acts against americans or american property and 3563 million for enhanced embassy security also in the wake of the three beirut bombings secretary of state george p shultz formed commissionthe advisory panel on overseas securityheaded by retired admiral bobby inman which reported its recommendations sometimes referred to as the inman report in june 19851 the findings and recommendationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30662crs2 1 continued of state june 1985 2 telephone conversation with office of legislative affairs department of state september 20 2001as modified by subsequent reviews continue to be the standards often referred to as the inman standards for todays security measures some of the recommendations by the inman panel included 1 reorganization of the offices in the department of state that are primarily responsible for security and counterterrorism and consolidation of operational security offices into new bureau for diplomatic security 2 improvements in states protective intelligence threat analysis and alerting procedures 3 improvements in the departments training of foreign service personnel and dependents to deal more effectively with terrorist threats 4 improvements in contingency planning at the posts 5 assigning marine security guard detachments to all highly sensitive posts 6 revising the diplomatic security service physical security standards 7 pursuing substantial building program to correct security deficiencies and 8 initiating capital budgeting procedure to avoid security improvement delays due to budgetary reasons the panel also offered number of classified recommendations contrary to widespread belief the report specifically did not recommend 100 foot setback for embassies and 9 foot wallsfrequently cited as inman standards these criteria resulted from the magnitude of the beirut bombs and the measures that would have protected those facilities at the time the inman panel set in motion the focus on security from which the current standards evolved following the advisory panel report congress took up the issue of international terrorism and security and passed the omnibus diplomatic security and antiterrorism act of 1986 pl 99399 this act became the permanent authorization often duplicated by the biannual foreign relations authorization act for embassy construction and security programs in 1985 the advisory panel identified 126 facilities with inadequate security 50 of them consulates as of september 1 1998 49 facilities have been built or enhanced to meet new security standards as of september 2001 the administration estimates that about 80 of us overseas facilities do not meet minimum security requirements2 immediately following the bombings of us embassies in africa in august 1998 there was disagreement between the department of state and capitol hill over primary responsibility for under funding embassy security over the years since then congress has sought even greater funding levels that the clinton administration for overseas security purposes at the same time state department experts are somewhat conflicted between wanting to maintain embassy visibility and accessibility overseas while trying to increase setbacks and barriers which would prohibit terrorist actionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30662crs3 3 americas overseas presence in the 21st century the report of the overseas presence advisory panel department of state november 1999 4 secretary of state madeleine k albright and spanish foreign minister josep pique press conference state department august 3 2000in february 1999 secretary of state albright announced the selection of the overseas presence advisory panel opap chaired by lewis kaden the panel reported its recommendations in november 19993 including 1 improving windows and barriers warning systems and emergency response training 2 creating an interagen cy committee to determine the right size and locations for us overseas presence and 3 establishing an overseas facilities authority ofa to manage the building maintenance and renovation of american overseas facilities in an august 3 2000 press conference secretary albright responded to question regarding lack of success in capturing bin laden we will never forget the victims of those bombingswe will continue to do what we must in terms of sanctions and do what we can generally with our friends and allies to try to hunt down the terrorists their day will come and there is statute of limitations and we will pursue them as necessary4 slightly more than year later after the september 11 2001 terrorist attack on the world trade center and the pentagon with more than 6000 dead the united states is now leading worldwide effort to end terrorism once and for all determining embassy security needs the bombings of the us embassies in africa in august 1998 reinforced the belief that it is impossible to attain 100 security even though the embassies in nairobi and dar salaam did not meet inman standards the size of the blasts underscored the vulnerabilities of major buildings in densely populated areas after the attacks number of administration officials asserted that as bombs get bigger and more sophisticated standards will need to be continually revised but there can be guarantees for complete security overseas every us overseas post goes through threat assessment process authorized by the diplomatic security act of 1986 the threat level associated with each post is an evaluation of threat levels for particular time period and can be changed as events occur or when new assessment is deemed necessary the four threat level categories are critical high medium and low each post is given threat level that helps the department of states diploma tic security service allocate resources for overseas security given that the assessed threat levels of the us embassies in kenya and tanzania were medium to low the state department is reviewing its methodology for evaluating threat levels and the significance the administration places on threat assessments in its allocation of security resources according tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30662crs4 5 state makes plea for funds by toni marshall washington times september 18 1998 p a13 6 telephone conversation with diplomatic security office department of state september 4 1998secretary of state albright after the africa bombings we can longer consider any post low threat one5 currently security resource needs of each post are reflection of the potential for terrorist activity or unrest within particular country and other factors such as the physical location of the facility ie in city in rural area close to busy street set far back from any streets etc security determinations are made after consultation among states office of diplomatic security office of foreign buildings operations and the embassy security officer in the overseas facility responsibility for requesting resources for overseas post security ultimately rests with the secretary of state upon receiving recommendations from the assistant secretary of diplomatic security and the deputy assistant secretary for foreign buildings in the bureau of administration procedures for dealing with terrorist threats one problem for us security personnel is deciding how to respond to threats against us facilities and personnel currently according to state department officials 10 12 threats are aimed at us overseas posts each day that amounts to approximately 3000 to 4000 threats handled each year by the department of state there is one set procedure to handle all threats made against american overseas facilities and staff the us response might differ depending on the country the type of facility an embassy consulate or living quarters and whether the threat comes from walkin or phone call nevertheless state department officials are quick to point out that all threats are taken seriously generally procedures include first level response in which the resident security officer and the regional officer of facility confer with officials in washington to discuss the credibility of the threat subsequent discussions determine whether the local post can handle the threat alone or whether greater response is warranted normally the regional security officer seeks information from the local police to assist in determining the credibility and the nature of the threat us intelligence also tries to verify the significance of the threat some of the actions that the chief of mission can take include closing surrounding streets with local police concurrence putting up concrete barriers temporarily reducing staff size in the building and evacuating all personnel from the area or country state department officials in washington with responsibility for security say that administration officials would not take any action against perceived credible threat without first consulting with the chief of mission6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30662crs5 7 formerly the acquisition and maintenance of us buildings account and currently referred to as the embassy security construction and maintenance escm account subaccounts holding security funding include capital physical security construction security primarily security against infiltration at construction sites and counterterrorism 8 state department briefing on embassy security august 24 1998history of congressional action on embassy security funding congress provides the bulk of funds for overseas facility and personnel security in the commerce justice state cjsappropriations for states security and maintenance of us missions7 diplomatic security and regional bureau accounts see table 1 and table 2 smaller amounts are contained in the foreign operations appropriations for us agency for international development security funding for example and department of defense appropriations for salaries and expenses and some housing funds for the marine guards stationed at the embassies in 1980 the state department had estimated sep funding needs for the next five years to be 191 million congress appropriated total of 1363 million from fy1980 fy1984 for the program following the 198384 beirut attacks president reagan submitted request for new supplemental appropriation of 1102 million only for fy1985 this reportedly was the difference between the state departments own budget request and that agreed to by the office of management and budget omb for submission to congress in the fy1985 presidents budget the 1102 million was part of larger authorization requestthe 1984 act to combat international terrorism pl 98533 that among other things included 3563 million program for increased security for us diplomatic missions overseas the supplemental request was in addition to funds already set aside in 1984 for the sep the inman study completed in june 1985 recommended 35 billion to meet security needs overseas subsequent landmark authorization measure the omnibus diplomatic security and antiterrorism act of 1986 pl 99399 became the basic authorization for embassy construction and security programs that are also authorized by the biannual foreign relations authorization act congress authorized 21 billion in that act and accordin g to state department officials it has appropriated 12 billion for inmanrelated embassy security measures at the same time state department officials acknowledge that it is impossible to identify what past funding is or is not linked to the inman recommendations 8 in contrast as shown in table 1 and table 2 below the administration requested 58 billion for security within several different state department accounts for security from fy1987 the first post inman appropriation to fy1998 while congress appropriated 50 billion excluding any rescissions of unused endofyear funds over the same time period by themselves these reductions an average of 667 million annually from the departments total requests for security funds do not appear to support the implication by some critics that congress has failed to supporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30662crs6 the inman panels recommendations especially since the cuts were often made for specific reasons related to construction delays or other practical considerations rather it would appear that the state department has not asked for funds in the magnitude necessary to implement inman recommendations if more than the appropriated 5 billion was necessary furthermore in at least two yearsfy1995 and fy1996congress rescinded combined total of nearly 100 million of unobligated funds in states security and maintenance of overseas missions account this suggests that the department was not spending all the appropriations that it did receive although some lack of spending may be attributable to such factors as delays in construction or in negotiating the purchase of property neither the state department nor congressional appropriators had highlighted embassy security upgrade programs in budgets during the early 1990s according to state department budget requests and appropriations conference reports between fy1985 and the embassy bombings of august 1998 only two cjs conference reports had mentioned new security requirements the state department budget request mentioned new diplomatic security funds only for the fy1987 budget request furthermore neither the adminis trations budget requests nor the appropriations reports over the last 12 years connect security funding to the inman recommendations in fy1996fy1997 in addition to security funding in the diplomatic security account and in the security and maintenance of us missions account and without request from the administration for such security funds congress earmarked funds in the diplomatic and consu lar programs account for security116 million in fy1996 and 237 million for fy1997 following congress lead the administration requested in its fy1998 budget 237 million for security funds in the diplomatic and consular affairs program account on september 22 1998 the president submitted to congress request for an fy1998 emergency supplemental appropriation amounting to 18 billion to address immediate expenses resulting from the embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania and improve us security and antiterrorism efforts worldwide state department officials claimed that since the bills from the august 1998 bombings were paid with fy1998 appropriations and since department officials wanted to avoid being in violation of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 the funding needed to be in the form of an fy1998 emergency supplement as opposed to adjusting fy1999 appropriations which would exceed fy1999 spending caps the administration also pointed out that any increased hiring for improved worldwide embassy security as result of an fy1998 supplemental would increase the state department out year budget needs beginning in fy2000 of the amended 19 billion in the enacted emergency supplemental pl 105 277 156 billion came within the

diplomatic security as it is not specific line item in the budget during the early consideration of the fy2000 state department budget request congress criticized the administrat ion for requesting inadequate funds total of 303 million for worldwide security upgrades the administration had testified that much of the emergency supplemental funds was still in the pipeline to be spent on security needs on november 19 1999 after the administration had resubmitted its request increasing security funding congress approved the fy2000 state department appropriation hr 342111 which included total of
