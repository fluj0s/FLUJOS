the audit covered activities with total expenditure of 105 million in 2003 and 2004 unov has accepted most of the recommendations made and is in the process of implementing them administration of entitlements the staff administration unit of hrms generally dis charged its responsibilities effectively dependency allowance the imis database included 94 children between the ages 18 to 21 who must be full time students to qualify for dependency for 61 f these children the student status was not reflected furthermore in several cases it was doubtful that the children were fulltime students considering the financial implications all 94 cases need to be followed up the staff administration unit of hrms is following up education grant education grant claims in respect of school childre n were complete and accurate and schools duly completed the form certificate of att endance and costs and receipt for payments p41 however some universities did n ot complete the required p41 forms and the accuracy and completeness of information in the p41s that were submitted without supporting documents could not be verified the p41 reduces administrative work and there was only one case in the audit sampl where the p41 had contradictory information but considering the financial risks p resented by inaccurate or incomplete information on the p41 staff members should be as ked to submit proof of payments made to universities two cases were noted where staff members had adopte d blood relatives in the one case the children remained in the custody of the natural parent after the adoption and in the other case the child was adopted at the age of 15 the regulations and rules regarding adoption and dependency are quite vague nd ambiguous but an implicit pre requisite for adoption is that the child resides wi th the staff member oios is concerned about adoptions where ties between the staff membe r and the adopted child appear to be limited to mere financial support at the expense of the

human resourc officer p3 there are 12 general service staff members of whom five administer the ntitlements of 1380 staff members the remaining seven positions perform other administrat ive functions

allowance that together accounted for more than 60 per cent of the total expenditure of entitlements 5 the findings and recommendations contained in th is report were discussed during the exit conference held on 7 december 2004 with the director division for management the chief human resources management service the chie f financial resources management service and the head of the staff administration it draft of this report was shared with the director division for management on 19 januar 2005 whose comments have been reflected in the report in italics unodc has accepted most of the recommendations made and is in the process of implementing them ii audit objectives 6 the overall objective of the audit was to evalua the adequacy of arrangements for handling staff entitlements it involved assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of u novunodc arrangements for handling staff entitlements b reviewing compliance with regulations rules and administrative 2 instructions and c assessing the integrity of imis data iii audit scope and methodology 7 the audit covered entitlements paid in 2003 and 2004 until 30 september 2004 amounting to 105 million through review of th payments and risks associated with the entitlement sample was selected per entitlement the main criterion was compliance with staff regulations and rules as well as administr ative instructions the second set of criteria pertains to processing and payments in ter ms of timeliness of processing of staff members entitlem ents accuracy and completeness of payments of entitlemen ts 8 the audit activities included review of imis d ata discussions with staff in the staff administration unit and review of personnel files iv audit findings and recommendations education grant 9 education grant is payable to cover part of the educational expenses of an expatriates dependent children claims submitted by staff members 10 except for three cases audited staff members d uly completed the form request for payment of education grant andor advance against ducation grant and submitted the required certificate of attendance and costs and r eceipt for payments p41 the latter certificate is completed and certified by the educa tional institution and provides evidence to support three important requirements ie the peri od of full time attendance at the educational institution eligibility breakdown of the costs incurred admissible expenses and amounts paid evidence of payment 11 in two cases the p41s were not submitted and although hrms relied on other supporting documentation that oios found adequate t support the claims it is not in compliance to the rules although only two cases t he cases demonstrate the difficulties that the requirements in stic20025 that are rather s trict it provides that where the p41 certificate cannot be obtained from the educational institution the staff member must submit certificate of school attendance form p41b together with receipted school bills interaction with the institution is still obligator because responsible official of the educational institution should certify the document s in fact as in the p41 the same level of assurance is obtained from the certificate on p41 b and the required school bills therefore claim cannot be accepted without certification fr om the educational institution 12 hrms informed us that austrian universities do not complete p41s because actual attendance is not mandatory in austria in these p articular cases the fees were also nominal and hrms questioned the need for the required forms hrms felt that where only nominal expenses are involved the financial returns that w ould be gained would not warrant the administrative overheads incurred in efforts to obt ain these forms oios wishes to point out that while tuition fees may be only nominal the c laim consists of more than the mere amount 3 of tuition paid to the educational institution the re are lump sum amounts such as cost of board and books therefore staff member should make every effort to obtain the required certificates or proof of attendance eg through s ubmission of examination certificates if impossible hrms should record the circumstances in note for the file that should be submitted to frms for review during the settlement of the claim recommendation head2right the hrms unodc should ensure that the required p 41 or p41b certifications are submitted with education grant c laims in cases where it is not possible to obtain the aforementioned fo rms from an educational institution note for the file to tha t effect should accompany the claim to frms for its review and settlement of the claim rec 01 13 oios will consider the recommendation implement ed when it receives copy of the revised procedure to ensure submission of the requi red forms and requirements 14 except for confirmation that student was in full time attendance the other requirements ie evidence of payment and admissib expenses can be obtained from vouchers of payment bills etc the p41 certifica tion certainly reduces the intervention of the administration substantially ie the checking of vouchers calculations and review of claims the problem is that the p41 certification could be incorrect or invalid and there is supporting evidence required to substantiate the in formation therein even if there is suspicion that the information could be incorrect there is procedure in place to follow up the issue with the educational institution this i s risk that the administration should manage for example the international schools in vienna prepare numerous p41s and it was evident that they duly complete the forms however two cases reviewed and where the students studied at universities the p41s either included inaccurate or contradictory information in one case additional bills were bmitted and the administration corrected the claim in the other claim index number 115836 t he submitted p41s included contradictory information the staff member left the organizatio n and therefore further followup would not serve any purpose at unog staff members have to submit in addition to the required p41 proof of payment to the educational instituti on although this increases the reviews and verifications it may be worthwhile for hrms to sider the same requirement in the case of universities recommendation head2right the hrms unodc should considering the risks attac hed to an incomplete or inaccurate p41 request staff member s to submit proof of payments made to universities rec 02 15 oios will consider the recommendation implement ed when it receives copy of the instruction requiring proof of payments to universi ties b noncompliance childs dependent status is questionable 16 education grants and dependency allowances were paid to staff member index number 12198 for child who was not dependent c hild as defined in the rules pertaining to education grant staff rule 10320 or that of depe ndency staff rule 10324 17 child is defined as child of staff membe r who is dependent on the staff member for main and continuing support staff rule 10320 ai as far as the education grant is 4 concerned according to staff rule 10324 the pendent child is defined as either natural or legally adopted child 18 legal opinion was obtained in july 1997 foll owing request from the staff member to recognise the child as dependent child in the co ntext of staff rule 10324 in august 1997 hrms recognized that guardianship would normally t be sufficient to recognize child as dependant under staff rule 10324 but considerin g the unusual circumstances it was approved that the child should be recognized as d ependant 19 oios does not question the relationship legall the staff member exercises parental authority given to him by court of law and accord ing to correspondence the authority is indefinite or otherwise between the staff member and the child but oios does not find the child to be child of the staff member as defined in the staff rules the child is neither natural or adopted child oios is of the opinion t hat this case was an exception to staff rule 10324 and should have been referred to the secreta rygeneral for approval pursuant to staff rule 1122 and stai234 rev 1 of 22 march 1989 recommendation head2right the division for management unodc should seek the approval of the secretarygeneral pursuant to staff rule 1122 to exceptionally grant dependency status to the staff member index number 12198 in respect of child who is not child of the staff member s defined in staff rule 10324 rec 03 20 hrms stated that this was indeed very exceptional case and will seek ohrms guidance on the best course of action taking into consideration the interest of the organization and that of the child 21 oios will consider the recommendation as implem ented when it receives copy of decision on the case by the secretarygeneral education grant paid to preprimary student 22 according to section 2 of administrative in struction stai9994 replaced by stai20042 education is deemed primary when t he child is five years or older at the beginning of the school year or when the child rea ches five within three months of the beginning of the school year in one case an educ ation grant of 6470 was paid to staff member index number 382808 for child who attend ed school at the preprimary level and did not reach the age of 5 within three months of the beginning of the school year oios determined that the payment was not in compliance t the rules and frms should recover the amount recommendation head2right the frms unodc should recover the amount of 6470 from the staff member index number 382808 who was incorrectly pa id an education grant per pyeg 1141in respect of child that had n ot reached five years of age within three months of the beginning of the school year and therefore did not meet the criteria of primary ed ucation as per section 2 of administrative instruction stai19994 n ow stai20042 rec 04 23 hrms will seek advice from ohrm as to whether recov ery is necessary oios will consider the recommendation as implemented when it receives copy of the proof of recovery 5 of the incorrectly paid education grant c adoption of children 24 the term adopted child is not defined in the rules or in any administrative instruction but it is generally accepted that adop tion is an action sanctioned by court of law naturally the reasons for adoption vary and the gal requirements for adoption may also differ from country to country 25 the audit noted case where the staff member dopted two of his one brothers children and another child from another brother but the chi ldren remained in the custody of the brothers oios suggested that unodc and unov should consider extending the requirement of continuous support to more than mere financial support in cases where children are adopted after the staff members appoi ntment and especially where children of family members are adopted and continue to live wit h their natural parents 26 unodc stated that the rules were followed accordin g to unodc it was not possible for hrms to determine whether children have been ad opted merely for financial reasons hrms recognizes the adoption if all conditions laid down in the policy are met and cannot be expected to make subjective assessments 27 also from the replies received on matters rais ed in the draft report further adoption case was noted where child age 15 was adopted f rom collateral relative by blood in three generations 28 oios recognizes that it is difficult for hrms t adequately follow up on the cases andor to establish extended requirements neverth eless oios is concerned about cases where the ties between the staff member and the ado pted child appear to be limited to mere financial support at the expense of the organizatio n b dependency allowance discrepancies in the dependency status as per i 29 imis listed 94 children who were 18 to 21 years of age the children must be full time students for staff members to qualify for the dependency allowance however the student statuses of 64 of the children were not ind icated and uptodate in imis but it was indicated that they were students there were case s in which education grant claims were submitted in 2003 or 2004 ie index numbers 17735 3 and 177400 and where there was evidence that the child was in fulltime attendanc 30 the list of 94 dependants needs to be reviewed and where children are not students in fulltime attendance recovery may be necessary hrms was in the process of following up on three of the cases the 64 cases in which the student statuses were not uptodate should be revised recommendations head2right the staff administration unit of hrms unodc should review the complete list of the children between the ages of 1 8 to 21 shown by imis as dependants to ensure that they are fulltime st udents rec 05 31 oios will consider the recommendations implemen ted when it receives information on the result of the review of these data c other entitlements 6 32 exceptions were found during the audit of mo bility hardship and nonremoval allowance assignment and repatriation grants home leave and family visit as well as language allowance and most cases included in the d raft report were satisfactorily followed up overall oios found the staff
