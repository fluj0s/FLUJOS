bioterrorism preparedness and response act pl 107188 provisions and changes to preexisting law introduction the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks nd the subsequent deliberate release of anthrax spores in the mail have focused policymakers attention on the preparedness and response capability of the u s public health system though small in scale compared to the scenarios envisioned by bioterrorism experts and played out in recent government exercises the recent anthrax attacks strained the public health system and exposed weaknesses at the fe deral state and local levels many bioterrorism experts believe that had t hose responsible for the anthrax attacks employed more sophisticated deliv ery mechanism or released deadly communicable biological agent such as smallpox the health care system may have been overwhelmed bioterrorism poses unique challenge to the medical care and public health systems unlike an explosion or chemical attack which results in immediate and visible casualties the public health impact of biological attack can unfold gradually over time until sufficient number of people arrive at emergency rooms and doctors offices complaining of similar illnesses there may be sign that an attack has taken place the speed and accuracy with which doctors and laboratories reach the correct diagnoses and report their findings to public health authorities has direct impact on the number of people who become ill and the number that die the nations ability to respond to bioterrorist attack therefore pends crucially on the state of preparedness of its medical care systems and public health infrastructure public health experts have for years co mplained about the terioration of the public health system through neglect and lack of funding they warn that the nation is illequipped and insufficiently prepared to respond to bioterrorist attack for example they point out th at there are too few medical personnel trained to spot biological attacks shortage of sophisti cated laboratories to identify the agents and inadequate supplies of drugs and vaccines to counteract the threat they also contend that inadequate plans exist for setting up quarantines and emergency facilities to handle the sick and infectious victims improving public health preparedness and response capacity offers protection not only from bioterrorist att acks but also from naturally occurring public health emergencies public health officials are increasingly concerned about our exposure and susceptibility to infectious disease and foodborne illness because of global travel ubiquitous food imports and the evolution of antibioticresistant pathogenshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31263crs2 1 senate bioterrorism preparedness bills intr oduced in response to the
