studies and analyses new delhi india balochistan has been in the midst of full ﬂedged insurgency for over ﬁve years now pakistani establishment has tried to project the current insurgencyas tribal mischief being perpetrated by few feudal lords but the widespread support that the insurgents have been enjoying and the impunity with which they have been targeting symbols of government authority notonly across the entire length and breadth of balochistan but even outside indicate that there are deep rooted well deﬁned causes that have led to this insurgency the paper attempts to analyse the factors that have led to currentround of insurgency in balochistan keywords pakistan balochistan baloch internal disorders gwadar bugti insurgency bla balochistan which has been relatively peaceful for three decades is once again in the midst of fully ﬂedged insurgency it has been the scene of violent protest in the form of bomb blasts random killings and acts of sabotage at vital installations for some time the current bout of violence in balochistan which was triggered in late2003 refuses to subside and keeps resurfacing with amazing regularity indecember 2005 the government troops launched fully ﬂedged operation againstthe baloch insurgents in kohlu district region dominated by marri tribesmen themost belligerent of various baloch tribes this was the third time in 2005 whensecurity forces confronted the baloch nationalists in an open armed confrontationhowever the scene of action in previous instances was the contiguous dera bugti district dominated by the bugti tribe the largest baloch tribe subsequent killing of nawab akbar bugti the chieftain of bugti tribe in an armed action in august 2006further infuriated the baloch and brought disparate tribes on to one platform thebaloch are too miniscule part of pakistans population to inﬂict direct defeat onthe state forces but despite their overwhelming military superiority the state forceshave not been able to establish their writ in the region although the assassination ofbenazir bhutto subsequent political developments in pakistan and the rising tide offundamentalism have pushed the happenings in balochistan away from the media glare the violence has continued unabated even the assassination of nawabzada ballach marri in november 2007 believed to be the commander of the baloch issn 09592318

the writ of the state by targeting the symbols of government authoritylike cantonments police stations railway lines power transmission lines andtelephone exchanges the ethnic violence and the way the state is handling the issuesraised by the baloch underlines the fragility and inﬂexibility of the pakistani state 1 the ruling elites in pakistan in their quest for nationalism and national unity have always tried to suppress any spirit of genuine federalism perceiving it as prelude to separatism2the main challenge to pakistans effort to have unitary structure can be attributed to the extreme ethnic consciousness and sense ofstrong sociocultural identity of most of the ethnic groups residing insidepakistan although the lahore resolution had originally talked of constituentunits that would be autonomous and sovereign 3such ideas were viewed with enormous apprehension by the urduspeaking ruling elites of pakistan who hadpropagated the two nation theory and led the movement for the creation of aseparate homeland for the muslims of the indian subcontinent which eventually resulted in partition of india they felt that the new state could only be united by afghanistann north west

of all other identities and feared that ethnolinguistic cleavages could lead to the disintegration of thenewly established state they therefore abhorred providing encouragement to subnational identities whether symbolically by recognising their sociocultural and linguistic identity or politically by accommodating them in the statestructure on the basis of ethnicity 4right from inception the centre had problems delegating powers to the provinces in accordance with the federalarrangement that had been visualised for the state and it assumed powers to runthe provincial governments that did not rightfully belong to it 5 most baloch never wanted to join pakistan and joined the new state quite reluctantly the predominant baloch princely state in balochistan was the state of kalat which technically was princely state of british balochistan having treaty relations with whitehall as against other princely states which were part ofbritish india accordingly the khan of kalat ruler of the princely state hadsought status similar to that of nepal 6and claimed that his bid was supported by mohammed ali jinnah the ﬁrst governor general of pakistan who was then thelegal advisor to the state the baloch also claim that the control over the balochterritories which had been acquired by the british was also transferred to the stateof kalat prior to independence after independence both the houses of parliament in kalat unanimously rejected the proposal to merge with pakistan yet the areas of balochistan that had been under direct british rule were merged with pakistanand the proposal was ratiﬁed by the municipality of quetta 7a body that was overwhelmingly dominated by non baloch settlers subsequently the khan ofkalat was forced to sign the merger document and kalat was annexed this led tothe ﬁrst armed insurgency in 1948 led by prince karim the brother of the khan 8 since then the baloch have risen in revolt three time and have faced the security forces in 1958 196369 and 197377 baloch chronicles project continuous tale of treachery and deceit by the rulers from islamabad though the insurgencies in the past have been crushed with heavy hand they have left scarsthat are yet to heal each insurgency has been more intense than the previous oneand the organisational capabilities and the popular support for the insurgents haveincreased with each insurgency at the height of insurgency in 1973 55000insurgents faced 80000 pakistani troops supported not only by pakistani airforce but also the iranian air force more than 5000 insurgents and over 3300soldiers were killed in the insurgency that lingered on until 1977 9pakistani armed forces used brute force to crush the insurgency as they had to redeem their honour after their humiliating defeat in bangladesh the insurgents werehoping for soviet intervention which did not materialise 10zia ul haq followed policy of cooperation towards the baloch leaders granted general amnesty andrehabilitated most of the insurgents 11thereafter section of baloch nationalists was always part of the provincial government at quetta pakistani elites have rather simplistically attributed the triggering of violence to the desire of baloch sardars feudal lords to retain their ﬁefdoms and their consequent opposition to development as that would increase awareness and expose184 bansaldownloaded by open university library at 1710 18 july 2008 their tribes to modern concepts of democracy thereby posing challenge to their leadership they also feel that the revival of the insurgency in 2004 was because thebaloch nationalists who had retained some sort of stake in the provincial government have been out of it since the last elections however the fact is that despite support of thesardars the baloch insurgent movement is led by urbanised educated baloch youth inﬂuenced by marxist thinking who have been receiving support across thetribal divide it is pertinent to note that out of 250 odd baloch sardars n l yb u g t i marri and mengal sardars have been opposing the government in recent times 12 baloch cutting across tribal barriers have certain genuine grievances as far as baloch grievances are concerned ethnicity intertwined with sense of politicalmarginalisation and economic exploitation continues to be potent force in evoking baloch mobilisation such feeling is more intense amongst the baloch as compared to other ethnic groups in pakistan for historical and economic reasons lack of representation in the government baloch representation in the central government of pakistan has always been marginal until zafarullah khan jamali was made prime minister by generalmusharraf baloch had risen to any key position in the federal administrationin the ﬁrst three decades of pakistans existence only 4 of the 179 persons whojoined pakistani cabinet at different points of time were ethnic baloch despitehaving been termed martial race their presence in the pakistani army has beenat best nominal and this appears to be legacy of british rule of all the peoplerecruited by the british from what came to constitute the state of pakistan 77 per cent came from punjab 195 per cent from nwfp 22 per cent from sindh and 06 per cent from balochistan 13however efforts were made to rectify this anomaly in post independence pakistan in 1970 of all the military ofﬁcers inpakistan approximately 70 were punjabi 15 per cent pathan pakhtoon 10per cent mohajir 14and 5 per cent baloch and sindhi the condition was much worse in the higher echelons of the armed forces in june 1959 out of 24generals in the pakistan army 11 were punjabis and 11 pathans 15to date there have been hardly any baloch in the top echelons of the armed forces according to former baloch chief minister ataullah mengal there are only few hundred balochs in the entire pakistani army the famous baloch regiment has nobaloch in it the kalat scouts was paramilitary force raised during the ayubregime and had only two people from kalat within its ranks the same is the casewith the sibi scouts created to police the marri areas it does not have singlebaloch in its ranks the ofﬁcers are from punjab and soldiers from thefrontier 16pakistan has quota system for recruitment of soldiers and the quota from balochistan and sindh was raised to 15 in 1991 simultaneously height and educational standards were relaxed for these communities which had hitherto been largely unrepresented in the army to facilitate recruitmenthowever in december 1998 there was still shortfall of about 10000 other ranksfrom balochistan and interior sindh 17as the quota is on provincial basis mostsmall wars insurgencies 185downloaded by open university library at 1710 18 july 2008 of the recruits to the army from balochistan are pathans and other settlers rather than balochs18 according to one estimate of 830 higher civil services posts in balochistan only 181 were held by the balochs in 1979 there was only one baloch each holding the rank of secretary director and deputy commissioner19as far as the police force was concerned baloch constituted only 25 of its strength and itsentire top hierarchy consisted of nonbaloch ofﬁcers the situation was similarfor the judiciary 20in 1980 after the insurgency zia tried to assuage the baloch by promising them share in central jobs in accordance with their proportion inthe population of pakistan and accordingly 39 of central jobs were earmarkedfor citizens from balochistan 21however the baloch are even today very poorly represented in the government even today their representation in the government has not reached the stipulated level 39 even amongst those that have beenrecruited from balochistan the bulk of the recruits have been outsiders mainlypakhtoons who are in the majority in the northern districts there are scarcely anybaloch in the pakistani army civil service or diplomatic corps in 2002 out of atotal of fourteen provincial government secretaries in quetta only four werebaloch of total of 3200 students at balochistan university fewer than ﬁvehundred were baloch of total of 180 faculty members only thirty were baloch 22according to baloch mp abdul rauf mengal as of march 2005 there were very few government servants from balochistan in islamabad and not asingle baloch in foreign missions abroad 23balochistan continues to be grossly underrepresented in all the organs of the pakistani state and as result people ﬁndit difﬁcult to identify themselves with the government the government and itsorgans are therefore perceived as aliens lording it over baloch territory economic exploitation balochistan is the poorest province in pakistan its per capita income is the lowest amongst all the four provinces of pakistan not that it is devoid of naturalresources yet its natural resources which provide sustenance for economicdevelopment in the rest of pakistan have failed to either provide livelihood or raise living standards within the province though there is not much vegetation in the province it is quite rich in natural resources and besides vast deposits ofnatural gas has large reserves of minerals like chromium copper iron and coalgas is found in commercially viable quantities in sui and pirkoh 24the regions gas reserves supply most of pakistan with its energy and its sparse populationmakes it viable location for nuclear tests balochistans long coastline with itsﬁsh wealth should have been source of prosperity for its people but the balochpeople complain that they do not beneﬁt from the exploitation of the provinces natural resources especially gas 25 the province also has plenty of marble and limestone reserves and is believed to contain around 95 of the worlds asbestos it also has signiﬁcant reserves ofbarytes chromites silica gypsum magnesite antimony manganese graphite186 bansaldownloaded by open university library at 1710 18 july 2008 sulphur ﬂuorite and iron ore the region is also believed to have large petroleum deposits underground26but exploration has not been possible due to ﬁerce opposition from baloch tribes in the marri area the government had the economic objective of enhancing oil exploration activity with the development of road communications but since the proﬁts were to go to the nationalgovernment and foreign companies rather than the provincial treasury balochnationalists linked it with the exploitative tendencies of islamabad therefore thebaloch peoples liberation front bplf delayed the construction of 57kilometres of road which was perceived as being built for oil exploration forover ﬁve years and ﬁnally it could only be constructed after the army managed tosubdue the insurgents somewhat 27the situation is much the same today one of the main reasons for starting the recent round of military operations in kohlu district has been pakistans quest for oil in the region the pakistani government often tends to project balochistan as wasteland of deserts and mountains and an economic liability but nothing could be furtherfrom the truth balochistan is not only self sufﬁcient but also supports the federalgovernment with the resources of its own soil on and under the land in the sea onthe mountains and even over and beneath the deserts the province is ﬂush withimmense natural resources 28the baloch have always been convinced that they are not being given fair share of the wealth that the state acquires from their land29concerns about utilisation of their natural resources pervade the baloch nationalist discourse and baloch political leaders have consistently pursued theissue of the distribution of resources between the centre and the provinces 30 the baloch interpret the disparity between the value of the gas produced in balochistan and the poverty of the province as consequence of their exploitationby outsiders 31the manner in which suis gas reserves were usurped by the federal government has long been sour point with baloch nationalists sui gas ﬁeld which currently comprises of ﬁve gas wells was discovered in 1952 and at present supplies 38 per cent of pakistans domestic and commercial energyneeds but only six per cent of balochistans population has gas connectioneven this gas came to balochistan only after it had been supplied to the rest ofpakistan and that too only because general zia decided to set up cantonment inquetta even today only 6 of baloch households have piped gas connectionfor the baloch nationalists it proves their point that their resources are exploitedby punjabis since the federal government controls the exploitation and distribution of gas and the federal government is dominated by the punjab and so the gas went where the punjab wanted it to go and there are few convincingcounterpoints to their argument 32 balochistan supplies 80 of pakistans gas requirements and most of its coal thereby enabling pakistan to save hundreds of million dollars worth of energyimports the baloch nationalists have always complained that their resources aresiphoned off by the punjabidominated centre at 125 of the wellhead pricethe gas royalty is amongst the lowest in the world 33 the royalty issue has allowed disgruntled elements in balochistan to take up cudgels on behalf of the people thesmall wars insurgencies 187downloaded by open university library at 1710 18 july 2008 baloch nationalists believe that the federal government should pay them huge sum as royalty for gas supplied over the decades34the late nawab bugti regularly complained that pakistan petroleum ltd had gone back on its commitments to the local tribesmen at sui in response the government tried to bribe or browbeat him to keep quiet but failed and then went on to propagate the notion that the tribalsardars were greedy and did not want their areas to develop this stiffened the tribal resolve as it introduced personal acrimony into the conﬂict 35the coalmines are almost all owned and operated by nonbaloch balochistans coal is sent to thepunjab so the baloch have to burn wood trucked in from sindh its onyx andmarble are shipped to karachi for ﬁnishing and its natural gas is piped to industrialbelts in the punjab and sindh returning in cylinders to balochistan 36all these have failed to create sense of ownership in the people of the area ethnic marginalisation until the 1970s the fact that balochistans north was ethnically pakhtoon whereas the south was almost entirely baloch was not perceived in conﬂictual terms by either community with the abrogation of the one unit formula and balochistanbecoming province in 1970 the tensions became more discernible the inﬂux ofa large number of afghan refugees during the war in that country of pakhtoonorigin created an abrupt and disruptive imbalance in the numerical strength of thetwo communities the baloch are longer the dominant ethnolinguistic groupin large parts of the province as balochistans population has considerablyincreased on account of the largescale inﬂux of afghan refugees 37the tension between the two communities reached high point in 1991 resulting in violent ethnic clashes today with large number of afghan refugees not having goneback the demographic proﬁle in balochistan has changed if the refugees decideto stay permanently the traditional ethnic balance between the baloch andpakhtoon population would shift in favour of the pakhtoons 38this has created sense of identity crisis for balochs and has contributed to ethnic tensionsbetween balochs and pakhtoons 39in the current standoff with the government pakhtoons of the province are with the nationalists and the pakhtoonkhwa milli awami party pmap which represents the pakhtoons of the province has been collaborating with other nationalist parties the largescale inﬂux of refugees and protaliban elements has also given rise to fundamentalism in the last elections the alliance of religious partiesmuttahida majliseamal mma did extremely well this also indicated theprevailing protaliban and antiamerican sentiment in the province as the mmahad contested the elections on the plank of antiamericanism as the governmentof pakistan is perceived to be kowtowing to american dictats there has been strong resentment against the government however the emergence of fundamentalism and the rise of islamic political parties in balochistantemporarily eclipsed the baloch nationalist movement which has always beenassociated with some sort of leftist ideology some in the government believe that188 bansaldownloaded by open university library at 1710 18 july 2008 the main reason for the violence in balochistan is the fact that the feudal lords who control the nationalist parties were sidelined in the last elections by theelectorates and are trying to regain the centre stage through violence of late there has been largescale inﬂux of people from punjab and sindh along the makran coast large swathes of land along the coastal highway havebeen acquired by land maﬁa and sold to outsiders this coupled with largescaleprojects being undertaken within the province has accentuated the fears of thebaloch of being ethnically marginalised in their own traditional homeland erosion of autonomy the baloch leaders feel that there has been gradual erosion of provincial autonomy as deﬁned in the constitution when the 1973 constitution was adopted with the support of the provincial government of balochistan it was assured that the concurrent list 40would be gradually eliminated within decade however even after the passage of more than 30 years the list still stands and the federal governmentcontinues to interfere in subjects which should be within the domain of provinceslike tourism environmental pollution labour welfare transfer of propertynewspapers educational curriculum etc to name but few 41under the current constitutional arrangement econom ic resources and political power are concentrated in the hands of the federal government the situation in balochistan is the worst where even law and order is the responsibility of federally controlled paramilitary troops the masterservant relationship is starker there than any otherprovince the return of military rule further aggravated the situation even thepresent promilitary provincial government does not have any real power 42this has led to the economic backwardness of balochistan and the lack of jobopportunities for the baloch 43the general belief among the baloch nationalists is that the military government has either confronted the political forces in the provinceor tried to marginalise them 44 in this context the baloch leaders have been agitating vociferously in parliament and outside against the setting up of new cantonments in theprovince 45today provincial governments in pakistan have rights to levy either the entertainment tax or property tax on property located inside thecantonments including private properties the cantonments have become asort of parallel government by themselves where the writ of the provincialgovernment does not run 46the baloch perceive these cantonments as nothing but grabbing of their traditional land by the army over 500 acres of land was forcibly occupied in sui when citizens refused to sell their land and the same process is being repeated in kohlu leading to similar resentment47 lack of political and cultural freedom the baloch inhabit region located in iran pakistan and afghanistan as result of the great game balochistan was divided amongst these countries in thesmall wars insurgencies 189downloaded by open university library at 1710 18 july 2008 nineteenth century by the british despite the size of its territory and relatively large population the baloch hardly enjoy any political or cultural freedom thebaloch have always been noted musicians and poets and have songs for virtually every occasion 48they have rich cultural heritage and are proud of their culture concerns about political and cultural autonomy have dominated the balochnationalists discourse 49the governments of the countries where the baloch live have not taken steps to allow the baloch culture and language to develop50in pakistan balochistan despite its huge territorial expanse is the least developedprovince and has the lowest literacy rate within the country 51there are not adequate provisions for reading teaching or propagating the balochi language andthe pakistani elite considers balochi to be primitive and undeveloped language as result the baloch feel that they have been denied the right to be educated in their own language or to pursue their own musical and cultural activities 52 mega infrastructural projects as tools of colonisation the issue that has agitated the baloch mind most in recent times is the issue of mega projects being undertaken in balochistan purportedly for the economicdevelopment of the province the basic issues of underdevelopment pertaining tothe baloch and balochistan have lost their relevance in the ﬂux of politicscomprising certain deeprooted biases political forces are out to malign eachother in their effort to gain power and pelf and have often worked to the detrimentof the poor masses of the province as the channelling of funds had been mainlyin the hands of the nonbaloch mostly punjabi bureaucracy it was alleged that the baloch plea for control over decisions pertaining to development activities had been ignored added to this is the issue of colonisation the balochcomplained that punjabi settlers have been grabbing prime farmland and thepunjabi real estate speculators had been buying up property in quetta 53 severe opposition to developmental projects in the province is one of the major reasons for the resurgence of insurgency in balochistan gwadar port including thecoastal highway the saindak copper project and the mirani dam are the megainfrastructural projects being undertaken within the province and have long been overdue they have the potential to trigger economic development in pakistans most backward province the mirani dam for instance could bring 33000 acresof barren land under cultivation in the turbat area the coastal highway will lead toan increase in transportation and give boost to tourism while gwadar would turninto major port serving as an outlet for afghanistan china and central asia 54 the targeting of these projects often bafﬂes western analysts as well as otherpakistanis who feel that the rebels do not have the good of balochistan in their hearthowever the baloch leaders complain that the manpower for the project which is being run by the federal government is drawn largely from outside the province they take the same view of the saindak copper project and the coastal highway 55 it is repeatedly being impressed upon the baloch that the mega projects will provide lot of opportunities not only of employment but business trade and190 bansaldownloaded by open university library at 1710 18 july 2008 investment for everyone according to abdul hakim baloch former chief secretary of balochistan the basic issue is not the construction or the operation ofthese projects but their ownership the state land around gwadar and the coastal highway which belongs to the province has been usurped by the land maﬁa in collaboration with the mekrani underworld and its members who are ingovernment and the legislative bodies the provincial government has losttrillions of rupees because of this fraud moreover gwadar is being connected tokarachi but not to quetta through the baloch hinterland thereby denying the restof the province any stake in the project this is making the people restive as theyfeel that they are being converted into landlocked province despite having thelongest coastline in the country 56 on the other hand people from outside will not only gain economically but will also colonise the coastal regions baloch nationalists feel that the fruits of thesedevelopmental projects will not reach the baloch people on the contrary they feelthese projects will lead to largescale inﬂux of outsiders into balochistan 57 making them minority in their own province there are also fears that unbridledforeign investment and development projects will bring too much foreigninﬂuence threatening the indigenous social and cultural patterns 58according to ataullah mengal if there are jobs in gwadar people would ﬂock there pakistanis and foreigners alike with time they would get the right to vote the problem is that one karachi in gwadar is sufﬁcient to turn the whole population ofbalochistan into minority gwadar will end up sending more members to theparliament than the rest of balochistan we would lose our identity our languageeverything thats why we are not willing to accept these mega projects 59in addition the baloch nationalists also feel that economic development is not theprimary consideration of the government while undertaking the work and thegovernment is more interested in gaining strategic superiority over the insurgents in the past the location of roads was decided by the army rather than by economic factors as the sole objective was to crush insurgents the roads were built toprovide access to inaccessible guerrilla strongholds 60 external stimulus an insurgency of this magnitude cannot last without fair amount of foreign support intelligence agencies in islamabad and government circles in quettaestimate the monthly expenses of baloch liberation army blas operationsfrom 40 to 90 million rupees respectively 61according to reports in the pakistani urdu press there is conspiracy to make balochistan secede from thefederation large body of men are being trained for terrorism against thepakistani state and the immediate motive is the huge oil reserves that are likely to be discovered in the province external powers want this resource to be governed by an independent balochistan rather than pakistan 62it is widely believed that the bla is funded by external powers who are keen to have stake in theprovince 63the members of the bla appear to be well trained and theirsmall wars insurgencies 191downloaded by open university library at 1710 18 july 2008 selection of targets indicates that they understand their tactical and strategic aims quite clearly they also appear to be everywhere and seem to have an effectivecommunication network all these tend to indicate that at least core group if not larger number of bla members have been trained by persons who are well versed in military matters as there are unlikely to be bla sympathisers in thepakistani army the obvious interpretation is that military training is beingimparted to the bla by foreigners moreover the weapons being used by thebla are russian in origin which are not held by the pakistani army according to shireen mazari director general of the institute of strategic studies islamabad pattern can be discerned which points to deliberatetargeting of communication systems and national assets impacting the country across provincial boundaries with more sophisticated explosives which demonstrate greater access to external sources of weapons and money the blahas moved away from targeting soft civil society targets to installations militarysetups and communication links the acts of sabotage are clearly not random buthave careful planning behind them as well as certain level of technicalsophistication and of course there is the very important ﬁnancial aspect allthese indicators prove the strong external linkages to what is happening inbalochistan 64according to ayesha siddiqa fellow at the woodrow wilson international centre washington dc the ﬁre could be stoked by the indians possibly iranians there are even rumours of american intelligence operating inbalochistan 65 if an external power is involved then who could that power be the countries contiguous with balochistan are iran and afghanistan the bla has never beenin short supply of sophisticated arms and ammunition and possesses largequantity of rockets and rocket launchers more than 626 rocket attacks and 122bomb explosions were carried out in 2004 in january 2005 in four days of ﬁghting in sui insurgents ﬁred 14000 rounds of small arms 436 mortar and 60 rockets 66similarly on 17 march 2005 in dera bugti insurgents not only matched security forces in pounding each others positions in day long shelling but alsorefused numerous offers of cease ﬁre indicating good stock of arms andammunition the obvious question that arises is where do they get these suppliesof arms and ammunition the most probable source appears to be afghanistan inthe early 1970s when bhutto was forced to launch the military operation inbalochistan afghanistan was the sole source of arms and ammunitions to the insurgents however president hamid karzai has neither any reason nor any resources to stir trouble in balochistan secondly the american presence inafghanistan would not allow the government to indulge in activities opposed toits policies 67pakistan also believes that gwadar deep sea port project is opposed by iran because this project would compete with irans newly builtchahbahar port on balochistan coast 68being built by india to emerge as gateway to central asia pakistani intelligence agencies believe the insurgentsare getting ﬁnancial support and arms from iran and india who are not happy with the construction of the gwadar port 69this seems quite unlikely as iran192 bansaldownloaded by open university library at 1710 18 july 2008 also has substantial baloch population and their province of seistan is primarily inhabited by baloch any insurgency that espouses the cause of balochhomeland is bound to generate unrest in balochinhabited areas in iran this is exactly the reason why shah of iran went out of his way to provide military support to pakistan during the last insurgency in balochistan like everything else that goes wrong in pakistan some pakistani politicians and journalists have blamed india as the force behind this insurgency thebalochistan chief minister has claimed that research and analysis wing rawwas running at least 40 camps in the province they also feel that with the indianpresence on pakafghan border and in zahidan the opportunities for sponsoringlow intensity conﬂict have multiplied for india 70though many in india would feel inclined to ﬁsh in the troubled waters as quid pro quo for interservices intelligence isi activities in india and also to keep it tied down within pakistanin order to prevent it from indulging in its nefarious designs in indian territoryyet the timing of the insurgency makes it fairly unlikely moreover the factremains that not single indian agent has been arrested even according topakistani media which has been rather lavish in ascribing enormous capabilitiesto indian intelligence agencies also india does not have contiguous borderwith balochistan and therefore could not supply the heavy arms that are being used by the bla not single arms consignment has ever been apprehended either at the sindh border or at the makaran coast 71in the absence of contiguity with balochistan it is actually not feasible for india to pitch in the troubledwaters all by itself even if it wanted to it could however provide support inconjunction with other countries in the region however it does not make sensefor india to stir up trouble in balochistan at time when indopak relations are onthe upswing russianorigin weapons being used by the bla have led some media persons in pakistan to speculate about russian hand in the baloch insurgency their familiarity with balochistan on account of their involvement with theprevious insurgency and the belief that they are peeved with pakistan forhumiliating them in afghanistan and for providing widespread support tochechen rebels may lend some credence to this speculation central asianwebsite has reported the presence of sovietera agents previously involved inbalochistan running camps in afghanistan and balochistan in collusion withindia and the usa 72however russia is too preoccupied with its own problems and problems in its own backyard to spare time and resources for stirring up trouble in remote balochistan which has lost its strategic signiﬁcance for themwith the disintegration of the ussr it is also inconceivable that the usa wouldallow russia to run such camps in afghanistan the involvement of certainindividuals with previous experience in balochistan however cannot be ruledout but the individuals by themselves would hardly have the resources to triggeran insurgency of this magnitude that brings us to the possibility of the involvement of the sole superpower which is today occupying afghanistan and has direct access to balochistan onsmall wars insurgencies 193downloaded by open university library at 1710 18 july 2008 the face of it it would appear preposterous that the usa might stir up trouble inside pakistan after all pakistan is their prime ally in their ﬁght against talibanand qaeda however according to leading pakistani english magazine the herald the usa tops the list of possible sources of the blas funding as it may want to put damper on growing chinese presence in balochistan 73large sums of cash are reported to be ﬂowing into these camps and number of cia agentsare believed to be moving cash from afghanistan to balochistan 74 the usa is deﬁnitely uncomfortable with the chinese presence at gwadar next to their main base in the region as it views china as its potential rival75 interestingly gwadar potential chinese naval base and city that has thepotential to turn the baloch into minority in their own province is thorn both for the baloch and the usa it brings about deadly convergence of interests in delicate geopolitical era 76as long as balochistan remains unstable and the law and order situation remains uncertain gwadars true potential cannot be realisedand the chinese will certainly be compelled to take second look at their growingeconomic commitment in pakistan 77in the recent past number of chinese have been targeted in balochistan probably with the intention of dissuading chinafrom investing in the troubled province the recent usiran dispute has furtherincreased the geographical importance of balochistan in the eyes of us policymakers 78though it is not in us interests to destabilise the present political dispensation in pakistan the pentagon has reclassiﬁed china as strategicadversary and chinas strategic presence in gwadar is reason enough for wellcalibrated low intensity boil in balochistan 79in addition as long as balochistan remains disturbed the iranpakistanindia oil pipeline cannot materialise andthe usa has not hidden its discomfort with the proposed pipeline there is also need to analyse the implications of sovereign balochistan it would provide the ideal gateway to afghanistan and central asia and preclude the requirement of depending on pakistan or iran for access to central asia it would also cut iran down to size without having to go to an internationallyunpopular war with it these are in us interests and in any case the balochnationalists are not islamists but leftleaning secularists the baloch in generalare not very staunch in their religious practices and the resurgence of balochnationalists has started the marginalisation of mma 80which is in power in balochistan and has signiﬁcant support base amongst pakhtoons in balochistanthus the rising baloch nationalism has started rolling back taliban and fundamentalist inﬂuence in balochistan which is something the usa always wanted this is not to suggest that the usa wants to create sovereignbalochistan it merely wants to keep that option open in case any future regimein pakistan refuses to play ball with them or in case their prote gein islamabad is eliminated by islamic hardliners us ambassador to pakistan ryan crockersmeeting with baloch nationalists on 14 february 2005 in karachi was pointer inthis direction 81 moreover for the usa baloch instability is far more preferable to stable and economically booming balochistan with its strategic location especially since the194 bansaldownloaded by open university library at 1710 18 july 2008 latter will have positive economic fallout for neighbouring iran82the usa is keen to isolate iran in the region and would like iranpakistan relations todeteriorate by planting reports about iranian involvement in balochistan as the us rhetoric against iran has increased in belligerency the acts of sabotage in balochistan have increased in frequency and intensity 83the usa realises that sanctions are not going to work against iran moreover sanctions will result inoil prices hitting the roof which may throw the global economy into recessionthe military option is also out of the question at this stage when us forces areoverstretched in iraq and afghanistan thus the best course possibly available to itat this point of time is to embroil iran in internal conﬂict with the ethnic minoritiesthat inhabit irans periphery 84the baloch ahwazi arabs azheris and kurds constitute these minorities which are restive today seymour hersh has also written about special operations being launched from balochistan against iranian nuclearassets 85iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has already accused the usa and its allies of trying to destabilise iran through ethnic unrest86 according to shireen mazari for the us there is much wider context to what is happening in balochistan breaking up larger muslim states redrawing bordersbetween some of them creating new political entities all these are part of the newstrategic game plan in pakistans context it is important to remember that the afghan elections revealed clear ethnic split and that targeting iran also includes seeking opportunities to encourage old notions of greater balochistan 87the new us agenda is possibly the creation of kurdish state it would not come as surpriseif this were extended to the creation of new baloch state an independent balochstate would give the usa an excellent base which could possibly replacesupplement both afghanistan and pakistan it would be clear corridor from the indianocean to central asia for pipelines etc with problem clients like the pakhtoontaliban or the pakistani military junta with its very own personal power problems 88 conclusion if violence in balochistan intensiﬁes the pakistani army will deﬁnitely be sucked into war that could fester and bleed pakistan already the rising tide of fundamentalism has spread out from federally administered tribal areas fata and is threatening to engulf the entire northwest frontier province nwfp thefundamentalists have identiﬁed musharraf as their prime target and the recentassassination of benazir bhutto clearly shows that they are willing to eliminate anyobstacle from their path to power the political turbulence and the allpervasiveviolence have not only stretched the pakistan army but also affected its motivationand cohesiveness the arid desert of balochistan could bring the pakistan army to ahostile environment where its mechanised forces are unlikely to be useful the latest weapon of mass destruction in the world is the suicide bomber and pakistan is ﬂush with them the pakistani army despite being professional army does nothave good track record of dealing with internal disorders they have used suicidebombers against others the socalled inﬁdels but would ﬁnd it difﬁcult to tacklesmall wars insurgencies 195downloaded by open university library at 1710 18 july 2008 them when they start targeting them as is now being done since dargai in october 2006 over the years persecution complex has taken ﬁrm root amongst most baloch and there is substantial evidence to prove that balochistan has not received its due share from the federal government for the natural resources that it provides to sustainpakistans economy 89the state building efforts of the pakistani leadership since independence have been counterproductive as was amply demonstrated by the turnof events in east pakistan during 195870 90t h ei s s u st h tp l g u ep k i s t nt d are basically the same that led to the emergence of bangladesh although the balochare relatively weaker and more fragmented their complaint against the federation isthe same as that of the bengalis in 1971 namely that the punjabi army tries to run the state according to its whims and fancies the armys belief that it would be able to crush the baloch in the absence of hostile neighbour to provide arms and shelterhas made them complacent but this will only aggravate the trust deﬁcit and derail theeconomy 91pakistan is playing dangerous game in exercising power with colonial mindset and using brute force to browbeat the baloch into submissionwhile the pakistani army with 70000 troops in waziristan and six brigadesdeployed in balochistan is already overstretched 92in addition other ethnic minorities are coming out in support of the baloch the killing of nawab akbar bugti has managed to unite different baloch tribes as never before in the aftermath of his killing grand jirga convened by the current khan of kalat virtually declaredthe independence of balochistan today there has been proliferation of arms inpakistan and all pakistanis whether baloch or otherwise are better armed than everbefore if the issue is not dealt with prudently the ethnonational ﬁres emergingfrom balochistan could sound the death knell for the state of pakistan and sardarataullah mengals words on the current conﬂict
