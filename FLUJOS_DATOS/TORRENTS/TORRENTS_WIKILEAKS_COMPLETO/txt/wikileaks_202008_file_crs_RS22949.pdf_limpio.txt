the world trade organization wto agreements and its potential effect on laws and rules governing the provision of legal services by foreign lawyers in the united states and legal ethics rules introduction1 as the role of lawyers in most countri has evolved from dvocates regulated by local courts and their rules to legal advisors for transactions in economic activities the increase in crossborder provision of legal services led to the inclusion of such services in the trade agreements and negotiations under the wto over the objections of some countries the scope of agreements under th wto has expanded over the years to cover issues and sectors not traditionally considered to fall within trade laws and regulations through periodic multilateral ne gotiations that are called r ounds the latest being the doha round the commitments the united states has made and may ma ke in current and future negotiations could affect domestic regulation of the legal profession including ethical issues legal services in the wto legal services are classified as part of professional serv ices which in turn are under the business services sector covered by the general agreement on trade in serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22949crs2 2 this is the obligation to treat service suppliers from given wto country more or less favorably than service supplier from any other wto country mfn is

or administrative review of domestic regulation under gats article vi2 and recognition agreements under gats article vii3 in addition to the general obligations under the gats the united states included legal services in its schedule of co mmitments under the gats not all wto countries included legal services in their schedules such schedules set forth specific additional obligations made by wto country with respect to specific service s ectors including any limitations or qualifications to obligations undertaken thes obligations include market access under gats article xvi national treatment4 under gats article xvii and any other additional commitment s under gats article xv iii including those regarding qualifications standards or licensing matters schedule also summarizes obligations as they apply via four modes of supply 1 crossborder supply the ability of non resident service suppliers to supply serv ices crossborder into wto country 2 consumption abroad the ability

gotiations in the doha round legal services are potentially subject to changes indee d several members have sought concessions from the united states regarding legal services such changes could affect

procedures for attorneys the european union which together with th united states has the most active trade in legal services among wto members5 is seeking several new legal services concessions from the united states6 one significant change sought by the european union is to eliminate the requirement in the us states and territories that qualified us lawyers providing legal services must be natural persons not law firms or other organizationalcorporate persons this apparently is not requirement in some other wto countries the eu and the united states also propose eliminating the us requirement that an attorney admitted to the patent bar for the purpose of prosecuting patent before the uspto must be us citizen in addition there has been consideration of whether disciplines wto parlance for certain guidelines on domestic regulation in the legal services sector should be adopted and applied this may be accomplished by negotiation of discipline specific to legal services or by application of the existing disciplines on domestic regulation in the accountancy sector7 to legal services under gats article vi4 disciplines on domestic regulation are developed with vi ew to ensuring that measures relating to qualification requirements and procedures tec hnical standards and licensing requirements do not constitute unnecessary barrier s to trade in services disciplines aim to ensure that requirements are not more burdensome than necessary to ensure quality of service and that licensing procedures are not per restrictions on the supply of the service after the accountancy disciplines were developed and adopted there was active consideration and debate about whether they s hould be extended to legal serv ices which the international bar association recommended against any substantive doha round concessions or any agreement to legal services discipline by the united states would oblig ate it under gats article i3a to take reasonable measures to ensu re that each of its political subdivisions observes such agreements this could pose federalism issu since the rules governing practice in state are matter for the highest court of state or for its legislature and not traditionally matter for federal legislation or policy the us trade representative ustr does not make wto commitments with which the united states is not in position to comply this is the reason the current schedule of commitments notes obligations in terms of which states have certain requirements such as instate residency for licensure in accordance with 102 of the uruguay round agreements act uraa8 the ustr has consulted with several states concerning the negotiating position of the united states on legal services apparently to consider what changes these

temporar practice by foreign lawyers and that the committee on the unauthorized practice of law of the district of columb ia court of appeals continuedif the united states were to commit to liberalizing the rules for foreign lawyers or firms to provide legal services in the united states any related complaint against the united states could be brought only by nother wto country and would be resolved through the wto dispute settlement system an individual foreign attorney or firm could not bring complaint because disputes can only be brought by one wto country against another wto country nor could an individua l attorney or firm bring suit domestically for noncompliance with wto obligation wto agreements are not selfexecuting international agreements so obligations under those agreements must be implemented through domestic legislation or other domes tic measures section 102 of the uruguay round agreements act uraa9 provides that only the united states may bring an action to declare state law invalid because it is inconsistent with an uruguay round agreement and that private person may challenge state or local law or other measure on the grounds that it is not consistent with an uruguay round agreement certain us rules relating to foreign lawyers the global nature of business including gal services and its continued growth has necessitated the consideration and adoption of rules concerning multijurisdictional practice of law in 2007 71 persons were li censed as foreign legal consultants in the united states across 16 jurisdictions twentynine jurisdictions have rule permitting the licensing of foreign legal consultants10 some adopted version of the aba model rule on foreign legal consultants first approved in 1993 most recently revised in 2006 itself modeled on the new york rule first adopted in 197411 others adopted their own rule differing significantly from the aba model rule12 the aba model rule provides that foreign legal c onsultants may be licensed to provide certain legal services in jurisdiction wit hout an examinati on if they are members in good standing in recognized legal profession in foreign country they are not actually admitted as members of the bar in the host jurisdiction in the united states and are prohibited from providing certain services such as appearing in court to represent c lient or giving

assist in preventing the unauthorized practice of law hereinafter model code althoug h the model rules superseded the model code the legal ethics rules in some states remain based on the model code 17 aba model code of professional responsibility ethical considerati on 39 footnotes omitted regulation of the practice of law is accomplished principally by the respective states authority to engage in the practice of law conferred in any jurisdiction is not per grant of the right to practice elsewhere and it is improper for lawyer to engage in practice where he is not permitted by law or by court order to do so however the demands of business and the mobility of our society pose distinct problems in the regulation of the practice of law by the states in furtherance of the public interest the legal profession should discourage regula tion that unreasonably imposes territorial continuedlawyers not admitted in us jurisdiction may provide legal services in that jurisdiction in certain circumstances including among others where they are working with lawyer admitted to practice in that jurisdiction or where they are advising clients with regard to legal proceedings in foreign jurisdic tion where they are admitted to practice14 us ethical implications the wto secretariat has noted that wto c ountries generally require foreign legal consultants to submit to the local code of ethics as prerequisite to licensing in the host country15 the wto has observed that the legal pr ofession does not consider this major obstacle to trade in legal services there are certain common principles shared by the national legal ethical codes including rules on conflicts of interest loyalty to the client and confidentiality the wto has observed for example that the eu has developed common legal ethics code applicable to so eu countries the us japanese and european lawyers professiona l associations have compared their ethical codes and found serious differences and bilateral agreement exists between the aba and its counterpart for england and wa with regard to mutual recognition on matters such as ethical standards however the agreements of such associations are not binding on the us jurisdictions whose courts or legisl atures would implement such recognition in conjunction with the bar discip linary authorities negotiations in the doha round of the wto could help resolve ethical issues that have arisen in the crossborder provision of legal services the prohibition against the unauthorized practi ce of law is basic tenet of us legal ethics16 therefore any new agreement under wto au spices that may affect the regulation of legal services providers admitted to the practice of law in foreign jurisdiction could have implications for ethical compliance howe ver us legal ethics rules or codes have recognized that business demands and the m obility of society necessitate refraining from unreasonable territorial limitations17 any liberalizing of li censing requirements couldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22949crs6 17 continued limitations upon the right of lawyer to handl the legal affairs of his client or upon the opportunity of client to obtain the rvices
