21 act summary on october 28 2003 president bush signed the check clearing for the 21st century act into law pl 108100 check 21 act to become effective on october 28 2004 in the check 21 act congress gave the board of governors of the federal reserve system fed the responsibility to prescribe regulations necessary to implement the provisions of the act on july 26 2004 the fed published its final regulations for the check 21 act the purpose of the act is to allow banks to take advantage of the potential cost savings of processing checks electronically the final regulations facilitate the wider use of electronic check processing without demanding that any bank change its current checkcollecting practices it does this by authorizing the use of the substitute check check 21 makes substitute check the legal equivalent of an original check for all persons and all purposes including any provision of federal or state law if bank has provided the warranties and if the substitute check 1 accurately represents all of the information on the front and back of the original check at the time the original check was converted electronically and 2 bears the legend this is legal copy of your check you can use it the same way you would use the original check it is important to note that this law makes each bank financially responsible for any substitute checks it handles if consumer suffers loss due to the use of substitute check the consumer has the right to make recredit claim which the consumer may file with the bank holding his or her account if the bank determines that the consumers claim is valid the bank will recredit the consumers account for the amount of the consumers loss up to the amount of the substitute check plus interest if the account is an interest bearing account later than the end of the business day after the banking day on which the bank makes that determination if the bank determines that the consumers claim is not valid because the substitute check for which the consumer made the claim was in fact properly charged to the consumer account the bank must send notice to the consumer later than the business day after the banking day on which the bank makes that determination this report begins with brief background of the check truncation issue including brief legislative history of the check 21 act the next section discusses what check 21 does and does not do next it discusses the key rules and procedures of the feds final regulations these rules range from the provisions governing the substitute check to the expedited recredit for consumers and banks the report also examines consumer protection provisions that were incorporated in the law and those that were left out the section on banks adopting electronic check clearing suggests that the costs will slow adoption and the conclusion suggests that check 21 is not likely to reduce paper check clearing significantly in the short run other methods of electronic payments however will reduce paper check clearing more rapidly this report will be updated as legislative and financial developments warrant contents background 1 the legislation 2 some of what the check 21

of the check clearing for the 21st century act check 21 act is to allow banks to take advantage of the efficiencies and the potential cost savings of processing checks electronically the term bank as specified in the act is used to include commercial banks savings institutions credit unions and the banklike functions of the us postal service and the us treasury the us banking system processes more than 40 billion checks annually but only fraction of these checks is processed electronically the cost savings of electronic processing are unknown because estimates of the cost of using check and the number of checks written each year remain in dispute as result estimates of cost savings range from 14 billion annually for truncation1 alone to 68 billion for replacing checks with fully electronic straight through processing2 most of the savings from clearing checks electronically come from eliminating some or all of the handling sorting and physically transporting of checks to the paying bank under the law before check 21 bank that presents check for payment must present the original check the paying banks could get around this law according to the uniform commercial code ucc sections 3501b2 and 4100 by negotiating processing agreements that make it unnecessary to physically present the paper check but since the benefits of electronic check clearing are not uniformly dispersed among the participants banks have found it difficult to obtain these agreements thus constraining the widespread adoption of various forms of electronic check clearing the most efficient form of electronic check clearing is one in which there is paperwork in the process this is called straight through processing stp the recipient of check is paid electronically by debiting the payers bank account as soon as the check is presented the check 21 provisions fall short of stp consequently the cost savings are not as great as some other alternative electronic clearing processes such as internet billpay or debit card payments 1 check truncation occurs when the check is stopped before it reaches the paying bank and the check clearing process is completed electronically in some check truncation processes the paperwork is not eliminated following the electronic payment the check is sent to the paying bank if paperwork is required to complete the process there will be less cost savings 2 see crs report rl31591 electronic banking the check truncation issue by walter w eubanks and joanna stavins comparison of social costs and benefits of paper check presentment and ecp with truncation new england economic review julyaug 1997 p 33 crs2 the legislation on december 17 2001 the federal reserve board fed sent proposed check truncation act cta to both the house financial services committee and the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs the feds proposed legislation would have authorized the creation of substitute checks an electronically produced instrument that allows banks to truncate the original check clearing process and complete the process with an electronically generated image replacement document ird substitute check the customers would receive the substitute check which would be the legal equivalent of the original check the concept was supported by americas community bankers the american bankers association the consumer bankers association and the financial services roundtable they argued that the legislation would enable the industry to garner cost savings and speed up the check clearing process for consumers the opposition to the bills came from the consumers union supported in its testimony by the consumer federation of america the us public interest research group and the national consumer law center they wanted consumers accounts to be fully protected from disputes caused by the use of substitute checks the consumer would be made whole while the dispute is being resolved on june 5 2003 the house of representatives passed hr 1474 the check clearing for the 21st century act of 2003 and sent it to the senate banking committee on june 27 2003 the full senate passed the check truncation act of 2003 s 1334 the major differences between the bills were mainly in the area of consumer protection the senate cta was more generous than the house bill in its consumer protection provisions for example s 1334 gave consumers 40 days to file an expedited recredit claim while hr 1474 would have given 30 days in addition the senates cta shifted the burden of documentation more to the banks and less to consumers than the original hr 1474 the senate incorporated its s 1334 into hr 1474 before going into conference with the house in conference the house agreed to the senates changes and hr 1474 was passed by congress on october 28 2003 president bush signed the check clearing for the 21st century act into law pl 108100 to become effective on october 28 2004 in the check 21 act congress gave the fed the responsibility to prescribe regulations necessary to implement the provisions of the act on july 26 2004 the fed published its final regulations for the check 21 act3 some of what the check 21 act does and does not do the check 21 act facilitates the wider use of electronic check processing without demanding that any bank change its current check collecting practices it does this by authorizing the use of the substitute check which is new negotiable paper reproduction of an original check that contains an image of the front and the back of the original check and is suitable for automated processing it contains magnetic ink character recognition line micrencoded in the same manner as the original check any bank that transfers presents or returns substitute check warrants or confirms that 1 the substitute check contains an accurate image of the 3 see httpwwwfederalreservegovboarddocspressbcreg200420040726defaulthtm crs3 front and the back of the original check and legend stating that it is the legal equivalent of the original check and 2 that depositary bank drawee drawer or indorser4 will be asked to pay check that is already paid substitute check for which bank has made these warranties is the legal equivalent of the original check for all purposes and all persons the check 21 act does not require any bank to use electronic check processing receive electronic presentation or create substitute checks nor does it make electronic check images or electronic information the equivalent of the original checks however after october 28 2004 any bank or other person that requires an original check must accept the substitute check as legal equivalent in satisfaction of that requirement consequently all banks are affected even though they are not required to create substitute checks or change their check processing equipment or practices to illustrate bank that simply receives substitute check created by another bank automatically warrants that substitute check when it tries to deliver that item for presentation collection or return to provide that item to its customer as result of the check 21 act any bank that receives consideration for substitute check or presentation of substitute check that it transfers presents or returns is also responsible for indemnifying5 any person who suffers loss due to the receipt of that substitute check instead of the original check now that the fed has released its final check 21 regulations all banks are required to provide disclosure that describes substitute checks and substitute check rights to consumers who could receive substitute checks key implementation rules and procedures congress gave the fed the responsibility to prescribe regulations as it determines to be necessary to implement prevent circumvention or evasion of or facilitate compliance with the provisions of the act6 on december 22 2003 the fed approved proposed rule to amend regulation cc which regulates bank funds availability for check collection7 the fed added subpart d that contains the requirements substitute check must meet to be the legal equivalent of the original check subpart d covers the reconverting banks duties the warranties and indemnities associated with the substitute check expedited recredit for consumers and banks liability for violations of part d and the interaction between subpart d and existing federal and state laws the federal reserve board also proposed new model notices for consumer awareness disclosure and other consumer notices regarding substitute checks as required by the check 21 act the following is brief summary of selection of these rules and procedures8 4 the fed uses the word indorse as variant of endorse throughout its regulations 5 the bank must make compensation for incurred losses or damages 6 pl 108100 sec 15 7 regulation cc is the result of the expedited fund availability act of 1987 efaa which established stringent checkhold rules 8 board of governors of the federal reserve system regulation cc docket r1176 continued crs4 general provision governing substitute checks for substitute check to be the legal equivalent of an original check for all persons and all purposes including any provision of federal or state law bank must provide the warranties and the substitute check must 1 accurately represent all of the information on the front and back of the original check at the time the original check was truncated 2 bear the legend this is legal copy of your check you can use it the same way you would use the original check the reconverting bank duties reconverting bank is 1 the bank that creates substitute check or 2 the first bank that receives substitute check created by person that is not bank and transfers either that substitute check or the first paper or electronic presentation of the substitute check this bank must ensure that the substitute check bears all indorsements applied by parties that previously handled the check in any form including the original check substitute check or another paper or electronic representation of the original check or substituted check for forward collection or return b identifies the reconverting bank in manner that preserves any previous reconverting bank identifications c identifies the bank that truncates the original check substitute check warranties bank that transfers presents or returns substitute check for which it receives consideration warrants to any subsequent recipient which could include collecting or returning bank the depository bank the drawer the drawee the payee the depositor and any indorser that the substitute check meets the requirements for legal equivalent of the original check and b depository bank drawer drawee or indorser will receive presentment or return of or otherwise be charged for the substitute check or the original check that was already paid substitute check indemnity bank that transfers presents or returns substitute check for which it receives consideration must indemnify the recipient and any subsequent recipient including collecting or returning bank the depository bank the drawer the drawee the payee the depositor and any indorser for any loss incurred by any recipient of substitute check if that loss occurred due to the receipt of substitute check instead of the original check in general the amount of the indemnity depends on the nature of the breach if the loss is caused by breach of substitute check warranty the amount of the indemnity will be the amount of any loss including interest costs reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses of representation caused by the warranty breach on the other hand if the loss did not result from breach of substitute check warranty the amount of the indemnity is the sum of the amount of the loss up to the amount of the substitute check and interest expenses including interest costs reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses of representation related to the substitute check comparative negligence if loss results in whole or in part from an indemnified persons negligence or failure to act in good faith the indemnity amount 8 continued ava i l b i l i t f

negligence or bad faith attributable to the indemnified person expedited recredit for consumers consumer may make claim for reimbursement if the consumer acting in good faith asserts that the bank holding the consumers account charged that account for substitute check that was provided to the consumer the consumer need be in possession of the substitute check at the time he or she makes the claim b the substitute check was not properly charged to the consumers account or the consumer had warrant claim with respect to the substitute check c the consumer suffered resulting loss the production of the original check or sufficient copy is necessary to determine whether or not the substitute check in fact was improperly charged or whether the consumers warranty claim is valid procedure to file claim the procedure for the consumer making recredit claim begins with filing the claim with the bank holding his or her account the claim should be submitted to the bank such that the bank receives the claim by the end of the 40th calendar day after the later of 1 the calendar day on which the bank mailed or delivered the periodic account statement that contains information concerning the transaction giving rise to the claim or 2 the substitute check giving rise to the claim the content of the claim should describe why the consumer believes his or her account was improperly charged for the substitute check or the nature of the warranty claim of the check the claim should have statement that the consumer suffered loss and an estimate of that loss it should also have the reason why production of the original check is necessary to determine whether or not the charge to the consumers account was proper or the consumers warranty claim is valid overall the claim should have sufficient information to allow the bank to identify the substitute check and to investigate the claim if the bank determines that the consumers claim is valid the bank must recredit the consumers account for the amount of the consumers loss up to the amount of the substitute check plus interest if the account is an interestbearing account later than the end of the business day after the banking day on which the bank makes that determination the bank must send the consumer notice that informs him or her of the amount of the recredit and the date on which the recredited funds will be available for withdrawal if the bank determines that the consumers claim is not valid because the substitute check for which the consumer made the claim was properly charged to the consumers account or that the consumers warranty claim for that substitute check was not valid the bank must send notice to the consumer later than the business day after the banking day on which the bank makes that determination the notice must include the original check or sufficient copy except where the consumer agrees to accept an electronic image of the original check or sufficient copy electronically for example via the internet recredit pending investigation if the bank has not taken any of the required actions described above before the 10th business day after the banking day on which the bank received the claim it must by the end of that business day recredit the consumers account up to the lesser of the amount of the substitute check or crs6 2500 plus interest on that amount if the account is an interestbearing account the bank must also send the consumer the notice mentioned above and recredit the consumers account for the remaining amount of the consumers loss if any up to the amount of the substitute check plus interest if the account is an interestbearing account later than the end of the 45th calendar day after the banking day on which the bank received the claim also the bank must send to the consumer the required notice unless the bank prior to that time has determined that the consumers claim is or is not valid and therefore followed those required procedures in that circumstance expedited recredit for banks parallel procedure for recrediting consumers is set up for recrediting banks bank may make an expedited recredit claim against an indemnifying bank if the bank has received claim for expedited recredit from consumer with respect to substitute check the procedure is that the claimant bank sent its claim to the indemnifying bank such that the indemnifying bank receives the claim by the end of the 120th calendar day after the date of the transaction that gave rise to the claim later than the 10th business day after the banking day on which the indemnifying bank receives the claim it must recredit the claimant bank for the amount of the claim up to the amount of the substitute check plus interest if applicable or b provide the information to the claimant bank regarding why the indemnifying bank is not obligated to comply disclosure requirements each bank is required to provide brief disclosure statement to each customer who receives paid checks with periodic account statement that describes substitute check and its legal equivalency to an original check and the consumers recredit rights that apply when consumer in good faith believes that substitute check was not properly charged to his or her account the disclosure statement must be distributed later that the first regularly scheduled communication with the consumer after october 28 2004 but the bank need not give separate disclosures to each customer on jointly held account these disclosure provisions were crafted to overcome potential consumer confusion about process with few or visible benefits for them consumer protection consumer protection was critical consideration in the development of the check 21 law from the feds initial legislative proposal in 2001 this is evident in the extensive provisions concerning warranties indemnities and expedited recredits for consumers and banks the strongest opposition to the check 21 act came from the consumers union cu its views in testimony were supported by the consumer federation of america the us public interest research group and the national consumer law center the cu argued that the act would make it impossible for an estimated 458 million us households who are currently getting their paper checks back to continue to do so 9 cu stated that these consumers would 9 us congress house committee on financial services check clearing for the 21th century act of 2003 hearing 108th cong 1st sess apr 8 2003 unpublished statement of janell mayo duncan legislative and regulatory counsel consumers union also continued crs7 be less protected from fraud under the check 21 act than under the existing check clearing process when there are disputes about errors in the check payment process consumers would longer be able to verify their signatures and the accuracy of the amounts paid to payees from the original checks the consumers union suggested changes in the proposed legislation that would significantly increase consumer protection when checks are cleared electronically these changes focused mainly on the recrediting procedure10 first the cu wanted to extend the recredit provisions in the act to all checks where the original checks are not returned to the consumer and there is claim of improper payment or warranty claim this amendment would expand the indemnification coverage beyond the substitute checks in the check 21 act it could extend coverage to more than 20 of all bank checks that are currently not returned to customers and more than 80 of credit unions drafts that are also not returned to their members financial institutions opposed this extension because it would significantly raise financial institutions cost of handling disputed checks and drafts they argued that the protection was unnecessary and pointed to credit unions that have not returned checks since 1980 with almost complaints or problems the protection was not extended beyond the substitute check in the check 21 act second the consumers union argued that 10 days is too long for consumers to not have access to the disputed funds due to the use of the substitute check it preferred the expedited recredit provisions in the feds original proposal that the disputed amount of the payment would be credited to the consumers account by the close of the next bank business day after receiving the claim the purpose of the provision is to reduce consumer inconvenience due to the use of the substitute check however the check 21 act provides for recredit after 10 business days which the banking industry argues is appropriate in practice some banking analysts believe that most banks will recredit the accounts before the 10th business day third cu would have liked to raise the expedited recredit amount from 2500 to 5000 in hr 1474 disputed substitute checks for up to 2500 would be automatically recredited by the next business day while the dispute is being resolved cu sought to have the expedited recredit limit raised to 5000 because the size of the amounts of these transactions is expected to increase over time in addition cu sought to shorten the number of days required to complete the overall recrediting process to less than 20 days financial institutions on the other hand prefer the longer time to clear up disputed checks in order to make sure that corrections are made accurately these suggested changes however could significantly raise the cost to financial institutions to the point where it is longer costefficient to adopt check truncation in pl 108100 the expedited recredit amount stayed at 2500 9 continued supported by consumer federation of america us public interest research group and the national consumer law center httpfinancialserviceshousegovhearingsasp formmodedetailhearing204 10 see httpwwwconsumersunionorgfinancecheckwc102htm crs8 counter to the cus argument for protection against processing errors is that in cases where check truncations have been used for years processing errors are practically nonexistent and when they occur they are quickly resolved asked by senate banking committee chairman richard shelby how many complaints she has received from credit union members about electronically produced copies of checks the president and chief executive office of the nih federal credit union said that over period of 14 years she had received none in response to question from senator john sununu the vice chairman of the federal reserve system said that in his seven years on the fed board he has never heard of case in which checks were doubledebited11 the already declining use of checks the overall number of checks being written has been declining partly because the fed is already truncating three million checks day for its member banks12 and additional checks are being truncated by private banking associations as well however the majority of banks use the traditional paper check clearing process the federal reserve with the largest single check clearing operation closed 13 of its 45 checkclearing centers in 200313 and announced plans to shut down nine more in 2005 and 2006 the fed estimates that 2004s check processing will fall 9 from 2003s and further 13 to 15 in 200514 as consequence of the expected decline in the use of checks the fed has increased its fees for processing check by almost 8 to cover the increased cost per check cleared15 the decline in the number of checks being processed is not due to the just implemented check 21 but it is due to the growing popularity of alternative payment methods including debit transactions and online payments in addition because of the rapid consolidation taking place in the banking industry more checks are being cleared inside the mega banks as internal settlements of these alternatives the most significant is the growth in automated clearinghouse ach transactions achs are electronic payment systems that are run by the fed and private banking organizations they are mainly large volume electronic payment systems that enable corporations and consumers to make electronic payments payroll recurring bill payments and social security benefits are examples of typical ach payments normally achs send or receive 11 richard cowden consumer groups prefer paper checks bna daily report for executives 65 friday

httpwwwamericanbankercomarticlehtmlid 20041104482gtl4ofromwashregu crs9 payments from payment centers16 the wider use of ach payments is the single most important reason for the decline in paper check processing17 banks adaption to check 21 the check 21 act is not likely to significantly accelerate the decline in number of checks being processed in the near future while more checks will be processed electronically under check 21 the original checks will just be replaced by the substitute check after check 21 is implemented the major banks such as citibank bank of america and wells fargo are likely to increase their use of the substitute check at first because of the initial cost of devices used in producing the substitute checks or irds experts expect that most smaller banks will not already have the installed technology to generate substitute checks and the cost of acquiring the technology will stop them from participating in the check 21 process in 2003 an ird cost about 510 cents an item making the substitute check more costly to clear then than paper check right now18 some of the nations largest banks are said to be budgeting 100 million to 200 million for truncation hardware and software19 for the typical smaller community bank the price tag runs between 250000 and 400000 according to several experts in contrast according to an independent community bankers of america survey last year most community banks 46 had budgeted less than 50000 for 2004 technology spending20 even though the cost of producing substitute checks is expected to decline rapidly initial up front cost of clearing checks is expected to increase under check 21 another reason for the higher cost initially is that banks are now using multiple presentment formats paper electronic and ird the fed and private check clearinghouses provide clearing services in all three formats for banks receiving the substitute checks back office paperwork operations including the sorting and handling is not eliminated even with check 21 banks will still need their back office operations and they may have to make additional investments in these back office operations to accommodate efficient management the substitute checks along with the original checks some bankers believe that they should wait until straight through processing stp becomes more popular stp is an entirely electronic clearing environment that would combine checks into the same stream as debit and credit cards atm and point of sales clearing 16 for more details see crs report rl31476 electronic payments and the us

banker may 2004 p 28 20 ibid crs10 conclusion the check 21 act establishes an electronic check clearing mechanism in which banks may voluntarily generate image replacement documents in place of checks however in terms of using and being responsible for the physical substitute checks banks are mandated to participate in the new mechanism whether bank employs electronic check clearing depends on how well it fits with the banks business strategy bankers faced with expensive technology adoption costs would not be likely to adopt check truncation if their customers place high value on the float and on receiving their canceled checks large banks with millions of checking accounts supported this legislation and are expected to be the greatest beneficiary of this law smaller banks would have to increase their technology spending far beyond what they do now with the expectation of capturing fewer benefits or savings than the larger banks however even some of these large banks which are heavily invested in other forms of payment such as internet banking and credit and debit cards that have electronic clearing processes may view check 21 as unwelcome competition they may oppose initiating use of substitute check themselves and as the act is implemented many of these large banks may refuse to go beyond meeting their legal responsibilities in the new process the new system may also confuse consumers who receive few or visible benefits from it in sum check 21 places the check clearing process in kind of way station between paper check clearing and fully electronic processing the latter is more efficient but is of concern to many consumers electronic clearing is also most welcomed by banks and recipients of funds because it is faster and actually less prone to error over the years the payment system has improved by adding micr encoding to speed up the old system and debit cards and online bill paying with other forms of payment these additions have gained enough popularity to completely replace paper checks for some customers check 21 is yet another way to shift out of paper checks into electronic clearing many banks may not participate fully because check 21 to them is too temporary to make the required investment now for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32668
