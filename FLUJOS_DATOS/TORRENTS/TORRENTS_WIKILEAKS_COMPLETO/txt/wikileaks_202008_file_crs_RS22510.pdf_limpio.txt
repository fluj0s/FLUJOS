scott analysts in american national government government and finance division summary when seat becomes vacant on federal c ourt of appeals the president has the opportunity to nominate new judge for the sena tes consideration geography is often factor in the decision particularly whet her the new judge will be nominated from the same state as the predecessor one scholar refers to the custom of maintaining state continuity in seats within court eg m issouri seat or an ohio seat as state representation federal statutes currently re quire that judges res ide in the circuit at the time of appointment and while in active service and that each state within the circuit be represented among the courts judges but do not require that particular seats be reserved for nominees from particular states this report provides an overview and analys is of changes in state representation of circuit court judges confir med since 1891 when congress created the modern regional appeals courts the data reveal that some seats are consistently filled by judges from the same state other seats are filled by judges from various states in that circuit overall changes in state representation have occurre d in 24 of confirme d nominations since 1891 changes in state representation were more common prior to the 1960s than in recent decades 14 of appointments to circu it courts after the ke nnedy

the federal courts of appeals often called circuit courts remain the last avenue of appeal for all but the ndful of cases heard by the supreme court of the united states eleven regional circuits cover the 50 states and us territories each circuit court includes at least three states and is currently authorized to have between six and 28 judgeships total of 179 authorized judgeships are available to the courts of appeals although not all pos itions are currently filled1 there are also courts of appealshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22510crs2 1 continued columbia circuit and the court of appeals for the

courts of appeals the constitution of the united states empowers the president to make nominations for judicial vacancies with advice and consent from the senate2 state representation what one scholar describes as particular judicial seats on the circuit courts being affiliated with particular states is customary for many seats but it is not formal requirement3 1997 law4 requires that every state within circuit be represented among appeals court judges by resident of that state in addition except for the dc and federal circuits appeals nominees must reside within the circuit at the time of appointment and thereafter while in active service5 otherwise the president is not required by statute to nominat appeals judges from particular states selection of appellate nominees is genera lly the product of consultation between the president and senators representing states w ithin the circuit in question some highprofile nominations to circuit court judgeships have been controversial in part because they represented changes in state representation at least three such cases have occurred since the mid1990s in 1995 dispute emerged over the nomination of james l dennis louisianan nominated to fifth circuit seat previously occupied by mississippian charles clark6 dennis was eventually confirmed by the senate some senators also publicly objected to the nomina tions of claude allen fourth circuit and norman randy smith ninth circuit on staterepresentation grounds7 allen from virginia was first nominated to the court in 2003 after the death of judge francis murnaghan of maryland allen s nomination was eventually returned to the president at the end of the 108th congress without nate approval th nomination was not resubmitted in the 109th congress and the seat remains

senators also objected to the nomination9 by contrast idaho senators larry craig and michael crapo nd others contended that smith should be confirmed to the seat because its previous occupant judge stephen s trott maintained chambers in idaho and because judges from va rious states had previously held the seat10 at the beginning of the 110th congress president bush renominated smith to fill judge trotts vacancy but later withdrew that nomination and renominated smith to replace judge thomas nelson who had taken senior status nels on was originally nominated from idaho11 the senate confirme d smith to the nelson seat on february 15 2007 in addition according to media accounts virgin ia and north carolina senators in 2006 urged the president to nominate judge from thei r states to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of fourth circuit judge michael luttig of virginia from the court12 as of this writing nominee has been named to that seat methodology this report relies primarily on the multiuser database on the attributes of united states appeals court judges 18011994 13 compiled by auburn university political scientists gary zuk borah j barrow and gerard s gryski professor gryski provided crs with par tially updated data wh ich crs supplemented with information from the federal judicial history office at the federal judicial center fjc the fjcs federal judges biographical database the legislative information system lis nominations database the senate executive journal and other sources to make relevant portions of the database current th is report limits the inquiry to 1891httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22510crs4 14 see 26 stat 826 this legislation is commonly known as the evarts act 15 this information is based on email correspondence with prof gerard s gryski auburn university may 26 2006 the state from which judge was nominated is the state listed in the multiuser database as described in the methodology above this report takes position on whether this reflects the legal residence of nominee 16 mabel gracias staff member in the crs knowledge services group performed these checks 17 this includes one change in state representation the multiuser database identified judge jeter c pritchard who was confirmed to the c ourt of appeals for the fourth circuit in 1904 as having been nominated from south carolina the senate executive journal indicates that pritchard was nominated from north carolina 18 sheldon goldman picking federal judges pp 1361372007 since congress established the modern circuit courts in 189114 according to professor gryski information in the multiuser database on the state from which judges were nominated came from the senate executive journal judiciary committee questionnaires and the executive calendar15 using the senate executive journal and the lis nominations database crs reference assistant16 manually checked in the multi user database all cases of apparent changes in state representation eg judge nominated from florida replacing judge from georgia crs also conducted random checks of changes in state representation and other cases listed in the multiuser database and found only minimal clerical errors17 in the few cases of conflict between the multiuser database and crs research the authors re lied on information listed in the presidents nominating statement in the senate executive journal or the lis nominations database as the decisive recor d based on this methodology the multiuser database appears to be highly reliable for this report crs limited the da tabase to 435 cases in which changes in state representation were possible meaning that the first appointee to each seat was omitted since those appointment s necessarily could not have represented changes changes in state representation on federal courts of appeals the data indicate that seat is usually filled by judge nominated from the same state as the predecessor in that seat where changes to state representation on the regional circuit courts of appeals have occurre d some patterns can be discerned first slightly more than threequarters of confirmed minations did not change st ate representation second noteworthy decline in the number of chan ges in state representation has occurred particularly in the past 40 years third some circuits have experienced greater changes in state representation than others one explanation for the latter two patterns might be practice of rotating seats among smaller states18 particularly before federal statute required that each state be represented on its circuit court and before congress created enough judgeships within each circuit to allow each state to be represented at the same time the court of appeals for the first circuit for example covers the states of maine massachusetts new hampshir and rhode island until 1978 the court had only three authorized judges so not all of the st ates could be represented on the court simultaneously in general however the public record contains very limited information about why changes in stat representation occurred httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22510crs5 19 percentages in this section were rounded to the nearest whole number 20 94 stat 1994table 1 summarizes changes in state representation across the regional circuit courts since 1891 the cells in the table list the num ber of changes in state representation each president made in each circuit eg 1 of 2 meaning one change in state representation out of two total appointments to that circ uit of the 435 opportunities for changes in state representation since 1891 104 confirme d nominations 24 resulted in such changes19 viewed differently slightly more than threequarters of all appellate vacancies have been filled by judges nominated from th same states as thei r predecessors the 104 switches count the total number of changes in state repres entation so if state loses seat but regains one at later date it would be counted as two switches in table 1 accordingly the 24 figure does not reflect net gains or losses by states on their respective circuit courts of appeals although the subtotal s for each president and each circuit suggest variation in changes in st ate representation one should exercise caution when generalizing from isolated data points because vacancies in given circuit have occurred infrequently any change in state re presentation could have had substantial impact on the values in each cell of table 1 summary percentages provide information only about how common changes in state represen tation have been in particular circuit or presidency not the political context surr ounding those changes such as the impact of negotiations between the president and the senate some circuit court seats experienced changes early in their histories but have since stabilized other seats expe rienced frequent changes thr oughout their histories table 1 shows that changes in state representati on were relatively co mmon through the kennedy administration compared with more recent administrations specifically 40 of nominations through the kennedy administration marked changes in state representation compared with 14 for the johnson administrati on through the present in fact half or more of all circuit court nominations for presidents cleveland taft harding and franklin roosevelt represented changes in state representation by contrast beginning with the johnson administration more than 22 nixon of any presidents appointments have changed stat representation most ve resulted in substantially fewer changes president george w bush 6 has the lowest percentage of changes in state representation since benj amin harrison president clinton had the fourthlowest 11 percentage some presidents may have been able to compensate state that lost seat by appointing judge fro m that state to new seat when an additional judgeship was created but new appe llate judgeships have been created since 1990 table 1 also shows that changes in state representation have varied by circuit the eleventh circuit created from the old fifth circuit in 198120 has experienced changes in state representation state representati on in the second circuit has also been very stable over time on that circuit only four of 51 appointments to the court 8 have resulted in changes in state representati on by contrast appr oximately 3040 of appointments have signaled changes in state representation on the first fourth eighth and ninth circuits httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22510 crs6 table 1 appeals court appointments 18912007 summary
