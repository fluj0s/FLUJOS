that was estimated by nhtsa in the proposed rule based on my2011 reformed standard compliance with the standards is measured by calculating salesweighted mean of the fuel economies of given ma

the manufacturers new car fleet for that year civil penalties collected from 1983 to 2003 totaled slightly more than 600 million however these penalties have been paid mostly by small and speciality european manufacturers not by the major us or japanese automotive manufacturers the effectiveness of cafe standards since inception has been controversial since 1974 domestic new car fuel economy has roughly doubled the fuel economy of imports has increased by roughly onet hird some argue that these improvements would have happened as c onsequence of rising oil prices during the 1970s and 1980s regardless of the existence of the cafe standards some studies suggested that the majority of the gains in passe nger car fuel economy during the 1970s andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33413crs4 1980s were technical achievements rather than the consequence of consumers favoring smaller cars between 1976 and 1989 roughly 70 of the improvement in fuel economy was the result of weight re duction improvements in transmissions and aerodynamics wider use of frontwheel drive and use of fuelinj ection the fact that overall passenger car fleet fuel economy rema ined comparatively flat during period of declining real prices for gasoline also suggested that the cafe program may have contributed to placing some sort of fl oor under newcar fuel economy recent and historic fleet fuel econom averages are shown in figure 1 source us department of transportation national highway traffic safety administration summary of fuel economy performance march 2007 major issues in the cafe debate some of the arguments ma on behalf of or in opposition to raising cafe or making significant changes in the program touched on longstanding themes that are also complex these issues include what is the effect of combin ing the passenger automobile and lightduty truck fleet for the purpose of calculating manufacturers average cafe during the congressional debate some contended that it should make difference whether the average is calculated across one entire fleet or weighted across two1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 20061520253035 combined passenger automobiles light trucksfigure 1 passenger car and light truck fuel economy averages for model years 19782006 miles per gallonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33413crs5 if an umbrella standard has to be met for the entire fleet on the other hand had the classes been kept separate there might be differential effects of the standa rds on different vehicle classes opponents of eliminating the distin ction between the fleets referred to that policy as backsliding under the cafe program prior to the enactment of eisa manufact urer was required to meet the cafe standard separately for its fleet of passenger cars produced in the united states and abroad the cafe of each could not be averaged across one another manufacturer could not earn cafe credits for one fleet that could be applied to bring its other fleet into compliance nor could manufactur ers buy and sell credits from one another the twofleet rule had been crafted originally to protect the diversity of models manufactured in the united states the united auto workers uaw argued that eliminating the distinction between foreign and domestic fleets could cost jobs in the industry domestically the final bill retained the distinction between the two vehicle classes the presumption is that this will place greater weight for fuel economy improve ment on passenger cars than on light trucks will higher cafe standards bring about loss in jobs some argued that higher standards might compel manufacturers to make fewer vehicles that consumers want as result older less efficient vehicles might be retained longer others suggested that any impact on jobs in the industry would be selective that is unionized jobs might be more vulnerable if high er standards do affect demand for vehicles what might be the effects of allowing credit trading among manufacturers andor between passenger car and light trucks fleets under the previous structure of the cafe program automakers could bank excess cafe credits for use in future years but could not trade those cred its with other automakers manufacturers also could not trade credits between their passenger car and light truck fleets each fleet had to meet the standards independently under the fuel economy program restructure by eisa credit trading is allowed s upporters of this approach argued that it may improve the economic efficiency of the system and lower the cost of compliance opponents raised the possibility that allowing credit trading could lead to competitive advantage for some manufacturers and could ffect auto industry employment do higher cafe standards have an effect on gasoline price there are many external and often shortterm and cyclical variables that can affect gasoline prices if higher standards do reduce overall oil demand from baseline projecti on world oil prices may be less volatile when an incident or sequence of events raises uncertainty about the adequacy and security of world supply however it is impossible to make any reliable projections given such large universe of possible scenarios httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33413crs6 2 see additional discussion later in this report cafe and reduc tion of carbon dioxide emissionshow do attributebased standa rds work and what are the advantages and disadvantages of them any system for regulating cafe will have winners and losers whether an attributebased system or the previous straightline average additionally the choice of which attribut or attributes on whic h to base cafe will also affect individual automakers differently under the new system nhtsa will set fuel economy target calculated for each new car as mathematical function of indi vidual vehicle attributes the final regulations developed by nhtsa ma for example base standards on vehicle size or footprint under that scenario and visualized on graph each years standard would longer be represented by single line but appear instead as curve that would peg desirable fuel economy targ et for vehicles based upon their footprint in successive model year s the curve would be replotted with the intention of reaching designated cafe fleetwide average in some future model year individual vehicle would be required to meet specific fuel economy standard but the average of the fleet would need to meet or exceed the average of the individual vehicles sizebased targets see figure 2 in the detailed discussion below are there arguments to be made for and against designating cafe standards as an expression of both miles per gallon and as grams per mile of co2 emissions one bill hr 2927 included such provision technically co2 emission rates are not measures of fuel economy but of gree nhouse gas missions however there may be few ways to reduce emissions other than increased fuel economy currently states may establish emissions standards under the clean air act but are preempted from setting fuel economy standards by the ergy policy and conservation act epca amending epca to establish cafe standards both in terms of miles per gallon and grams per mile of co2 could have bearing on states authority to regulate co2 on april 2 2007 the supreme court issued its ruling in case commonwealth of massachusetts v epa brought by 12 states

continued them come under cafe regulation but eisa dir ected first that the national academy of sciences conduct study on the feasibility of including work trucks with nhtsa to conduct subsequent ev aluation of its own reformed standards prior to the passage of eisa one of th key criticisms of the cafe structure was that increased cafe standards promoted smaller lighter vehicles because fuel economy tends to decrease as vehicles get heavier the concern was that fuel economy standards would be met to great degree by decreasing vehicle weight because larger vehicles tend to offer great er passenger protection in accidents and tend to be heavier fuel economy program structure that does not factor vehicle size into the setting of cafe standards could promote the use of smaller less safe vehicles corollary and further criticism of the program was that it favored producers of smaller vehicles that would tend to be more fuel efficient some proponents of higher cafe st andards responded by arguing that through the use of new technology vehicle fficiency can be improved without affecting size or performance under the proposed rule fuel economy ta rgets vary with vehicle size with smaller vehicles required to achieve higher fuel economy th an larger vehicles under the system in the proposed rule each vehicle would be assigned fuel ec onomy target based on its footprint which is the product of vehicles track width the horizontal distance between the tires and its wheelbase the distance from the front to the rear axles the average of the targets for manufacturers fleet is the cafe average that the manufacturer must achieve in given model year in this way specific vehicle is required to meet specific fuel economy but the average fuel economy required will vary from manuf acturer to manufacturer the challenge to the rule and court decision as noted earlier november 15 2007 deci sion by the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit overturned fina l rule issued by nhtsa

introduction the analysis accompanying the nopr for my2011my2015 appears intended to address the deficiencies identified by the court in the earlier rulemaking whether if challenged the court would find it sufficient is uncertain however there is some prospect of challenge should nhtsa issue final rule that maintains as is expressed in the nopr that any state regulation that affects fuel economy including any state regulation g overning tailpipe emissions is forbidden by epca the text of the nopr observes with emphasis added for those rulemaking actions undertaken at an agencys discretion agencies are instructed to closely examine their st atutory authority supporting any action that would limit the policymaking discretion of the states and assess the necessity for such action this is not such rulemaking action nhtsa has discretion not to issue the cafe standards proposed in this document epca mandates that the issuance of cafe standards for passenger cars and light trucks for model years 20112015 given that state regul ation for tailpipe emissions of co2 is the functional equivalent of cafe standard there is way that nhtsa can tailor fuel economy standard so as to av oid preemption furt her epca itself precludes state from adopting or enforci ng law or regulation related to fuel economy 49 usc 32919a6 cafe and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions additional history and discussion carbon dioxide emissions clearly figure d into the challenge and ruling on the nhtsa my2008my2011 light truck fuel econom rulemaking mobile sources are key source of greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the united states transportation accounts for roughly onet hird of all us carbon dioxide co2 emissions passenger vehicles alone re present roughly 60 of transportation emissions or roughly 20 of total us co2 emissions because passenger vehicles play such significant role in us ghg emissions there is growing interest in reducing their emissions as part of strategy to address climate change concerns in general there are three ways to reduce vehicle greenhouse gas emissions these choices are to 1 reduce vehicle miles traveled through strategies such as carpooling transit or teleworking 2 reduce vehicle permile fuel consumptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33413crs11 7 eg fluorinated gas emissi ons from air conditioner systems 8 for more information on the clean air ac t waiver process see crs report rl34099 californias waiver request to control greenhouse gases under the clean air act through improved fuel economy and permile noncarbon emissions7 through improvements in vehicle systems and 3 convert to lowercarbon transportation fuels as consequence there is likelihood that any program to reduce ghg emissions will likely raise fuel economy conversely any program to increase fuel economy will lower ghg emissions there is some debate whether raising th cafe standards would be an effective or marginal way to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide on one hand improvements in fuel economy should enable the same vehi cle to burn less fuel to travel given distance however to the extent that technologies to improve fuel economy add cost to new vehicles it has been argued that consumers will tend to retain older less efficient cars longer further improving fuel economy lowers the permile cost of driving to the extent that fuel saving s are reduced by additional driving the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will so be offset some this is what is referred to as the rebound effect perhaps the most significant current issue regarding automotive fuel economy has its origins in the 2002 decision by the state of california to require carbon dioxide emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks legislation passed by the state legislature that year b 1498 requires the state to promulgate regulations to achieve the maximum feasible and costeffective reduction of greenhouse gases from cars and trucks the regulations adopted by the california air resources board on september 24 2004 require reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of 30 by 2016 the regulation covers passenger vehicles but would not affect heavier vehicles such as commercial trucks or buses although states do not have authority to regulate fuel economy under the clean air act california solely may be granted an exemption from restrictions on setting vehicle pollutant emissions standards subject to the state filing petition with the environmental protection agency epa and being granted waiver by that agency any stateestablished standards must be at least as stringent as the federal standards and as long as they are needed to m eet compelling and extraordinary conditions8 while only california can petition for waiver other states may adopt any california standards that are put into place following the granting of the waiver several auto manufacturers and dealers challenged the california auto greenhouse gas standard in court central valley chryslerjeep inc vs witherspoon 104cv06663 ed cal filed december 7 2004 the plaintiffs argued that california lacks the authority to establish standards that are almost certain to bear on vehicle fuel economy requireme nts and that greenhouse gases are not pollutant under the clean air act californi officials maintain that they have the authority under the clean air act to regu late vehicle greenhouse gas emissions the state estimates that complying with the standard could cost 1000 per vehicle by 2016 while opponents argue that costs could be as much as 3000 per vehicle depending upon the cost of compliance the new standards could reduce demand forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33413crs12 9 for additional background see crs report rl32764 climate change litigation growing phenomenon by robert meltznew vehicles the impact of the sta ndards on manufacturers would likely vary depending upon the mix of vehicles they offer in early 2007 the court indicated that it would withhold decision pending re solution by the supreme court of case that might bear on the one before the court on april 2 2007 the supreme court issu ed its ruling on that related case commonwealth of massachusetts v epa in that case 12 states and the district of columbia challenged epas decision not to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles arguing that epa has the re sponsibility to set greenhouse gas standards for passenger vehicles under that deci sion epa is required to establish greenhouse gas standards for automobiles or explicitly justify why such standards are not justified the decision in that case will likely affect the outcome of the case against california9 on december 11 2007 the united states dist rict court for th eastern district of california ruled that bot h epa and california through the waiver process are equally empowered to regulate ghg and th at preemption of state laws regulating fuel economy di d not preempt the proposed california standard to reduce ghg then on december 19 2007 epa administrat or stephen johnson sent letter to california governor arnold schwarzenegger informing h im of epas plan to deny californias waiver re quest without this waiver californias prog ram cannot move forward epas rationale appeared to consist of two arguments first that california has not shown that its regulations are needed to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions as required by the clean air ac t and second that the administration and congress are addressing climate change through national standards specific reference was made to the newly enacted cafe standards in eisa as addressing vehicle emissions officials in california were not satisfied by the agency explanation for its decision on january 2 2008 california along with 15 other states filed suit against epa in the us court of appeals 9th circuit challenging epas rejection of the petition overview of congressional interest in cafe 19912005 significant efforts to raise cafe be gan in the early 1990s and were highly controversial one proposal included in omnibus energy legislation was so controversial that it contributed to an in sufficient number of votes in the senate in 1991 to bring the bill up for debate on the fl oor general criticis ms of raising the cafe standards was that owing to the significant lead times manufacturers need to change model lines and because of the roughly ten years it generally takes for the vehicle fleet to turn over increasing cafe is slow and inefficient means of achieving reductions in fuel consumption further it was argued that the

with consumer choice and jeopardizing the economic wellbeing of the automotive industry opponents of raising cafe have of ten cited concern that higher efficiency will likely be obtained by decreasing vehicle size and weight jeopardizing vehicle safety proponents of cafe increases have argued that boosting the standards could bring about the intr oduction of technological improvements that would not compromise features that consum ers value but which would otherwise not be added because of the increase in vehi cle cost stemming from these improvements language in the fy1996fy2000 depar tment

council facing the hard truths about energy comprehensive review to 2030 of global oil and gas released in late july 2007 argued that vehicle fuel efficiency could be doubled by 2030 through the use of existing and anticipat ed technologies and assuming vehicle performance and other attributes remains th same as today the draft report noted that technologies to improve fuel efficiency had been used to compensate for the addition of horsepower and other amenities to curre nt vehicles the council estimated that doubling fuel economy could achieve savings of 35 million barrels day by 203010

economy estimates the fuel economy of indivi dual vehicles is calcula ted by running vehicles through test on dynamometer intended to simulate driving cycle that assumes 11 miles driven in an urba n setting and 10 miles on open highway to bring this calculation more into line with inuse fuel economy experienced by drivers the epa makes downward adjustment of 10 for th city portion of the cycle and 22 for the highway portion however many argued in the past that this adjustment was longer sufficient and that the gap betw een estimated fuel economy and actual inuse fuel economy had widened significantly epact required revision of the adjus tment factor applied against tested vehicle fuel economy to estima consumer inuse fuel economy on december 11 2006 epa finalized rule to incorporate the effect of factors such as higher speed limits faster acceleration differences in the ratio between city and highway driving and use of air conditioning on inuse fu economy the inuse fuel economy stickers posted to the windows of new cars will reflect the results of these tests beginning in my200811 the change affects only the estimation of inuse fuel economy it does not affect the cafe
