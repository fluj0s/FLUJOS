law on the importation of prescription drugs was recently amended by the medicare prescription drug improvement and mode rnization act mma pl 108173 the three bills2 with provisions compared to current law are s 2307 introduced by senator grassley on ap ril 8 2004 the grassley bill s 2328 introduced by senator dorgan3 on april 21 2004 the dorgan bill and s 2493 introduced by senator gregg4 on june 2 2004 the gregg bill the new law and the three bills all seek to balance the availability of imported prescription drugs both for commercial nd personal use and the assurance that those imports would be safe and effective the underlying goal is to reduce or restrain the growth of the financial burden that prescription drugs place on us consumers they all would act primarily by replacing or amending section 804 ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32568crs2 the federal food drug and co smetic act ffdca that had been initially added to the ffdca by the medicine equity and drug safety meds act of 2000 individual bills would amend other laws impetus for developing new importation legislation so soon after enactment of the mma is the result of the new laws retaining the meds act provision that importation not be allowed unless the secretary of health and human services hhs certifies that imports are safe and offe r cost savings to us consumers the three bills each eliminate this requireme nt and instead include other potential safeguards regarding drug safety and effectiveness differences among the bills some of the major areas of difference among the bills are the following monitoring while the mma relies on laboratory testing of samples of every shipment of imported drugs to verify their content potency and labeling the three proposed senate bills focus on documentation of monitored uninterrupted chain of custody from manufacturing facility to importer the mma requires canadian exporters to register with the secretary the grassley and dorgan bills specify extensive requirements for that registration and th dorgan bill extends similar registration requirements to importers as well as exporte rs to do so they require ongoing and onsite physical monitoring of the facilitie s of drugs manufacturer registered exporter and registered importer includi ng inspection if the secretary determines it necessary of any facility that handles th product along the chain of custody the gregg bill has extensive registration requirements for importers and dispensers of imported prescription drugs including providing to the commercial purchaser identifying information on all preceding transactions that transferred the drug since it left the manufacturers control fda approval the mma and the gregg bill explicitly require that an imported drug be approved for us sale by the food and drug administration fda the grassley and dorgan bills allow different administrative requirements for importation while maintaining the substantive elements of fda approval the grassley bill also requires that the imported drug be manufactured in the same facility as the equivalent fdaapproved drughttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32568crs3 5 the most inclusive list is in hr 2427 not included in this reports table the gutknecht bill which follows the language in the meds act of 2000 permitted countries would be australia canada israel ja pan new zealand south africa switzerland members of the european union iceland li echtenstein and norwaypermitted countries the three senate bills5 and current law vary in the countries from which they would permit drug importation the grassley bill include s australia canada japan new zealand switzerland members of the european union iceland liechtenstein and norway it also allows the secretary to designate additional countries that have equivalent regulatory requi rements regarding safety and effectiveness for commercial imports the dorgan bill differs in that it excludes iceland liechtenstein and norway and specifies european uni on countries as of january 2003 thereby excluding the 10 admitted to membership in may 2004 the dorgan bill alone distinguishes between commercial and personaluse imports regarding permitted countries allowing only canada for the tter the gregg bill includes canada and allows the secretary three years after enactment to designate as eligible any members of the european union as of december 2003 current law the mma includes only canada althoug h it allows the secretary to grant waivers permitting personaluse importation from other countries logistics the grassley bill would allow the ma nufacturer of an fdaapproved drug distributed in the united states to petition the secretary to stop the importation of that drug when it has been manufactured in or exported to another country the petition would have to assert that the imported drug differs from the us drug enough that it would require supplementa l application to fda if the manufacturer wanted to introduce it to the us mark et the manufacturer would through fees similar to those established for supplemen tal applications unde r the prescription drug user fee act pdufa pl 102571 pay the expense of the secretarys review the dorgan bill would require the manufacturer of any drug that may be imported to submit notice with extensive documentation of the differences if any between drug it produces for commercial marketing in per mitted country and the drug it produces for the us market he re too the manufacturer would pay for the review of these materials with fees simila r to those required for supplemental or new drug applications under pdufa the gr egg bill does not require the manufacturer to document differences between its us marketed and foreig nmarketed products reports the mma and the grassley bills require the hhs secretary to submit reports to congress the mma also requires report from the commerce secretary and others the dorgan bill requires report the gregg bill requires three reports to congress covering which countries the s ecretary has designated as permitted for imports and the reasons why the implement ation of registration fees and the use of

dorgan bill includes exporter and importer fees based on the share of volume of im ports adjusted annually to not exceed 1 of the price of drug imports the gre gg bill sets 5000 first time registration fee and requires the secretary to set annually fee based on an ticipated costs to enforce the act without further appropriation incentives implementation of the mma is restricted by the requirement that the secretary certify safety and cost savings criticis m of the mma cites anticipated manufacturer resistance the grassley and dorgan b ills propose links to antitrust patent and internal revenue titles of the us code to influence indus try behavior the grassley bill includes tax incentives and penalties to minimize manufacturer interference the dorgan bill creates an antitrust provision to compel manufacturer participation and amends patent law to remove obstacles to importation the gregg bill includes neither positive nor negative incentives to influence manufacturer behavior internet pharmacies neither current law the mma nor the gr assley and dorgan bills as introduced address internet sales6 the gregg bill presents an extensive statutory and regulatory structure for internet pharm acies placing it in the ffdca although set apart from the importation sections in addition to registration the bill requires that internet pharmacies provide specific professional services including confidential patient medication profiles inter active and meaningful consultation by licensed pharmacist and verification of prescription validity it requires advance notice of commercial shipments of prescription drug shipments and includes licensing fee providers of interactive computer services are liable if they accept advertising for prescription drug from an unlicensed internet pharmacy or accept advertising stating physicians prescription is not needed to obtain prescription drug the bill requires policies and procedures to pr event payments for unlawful internet pharmacy requestshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32568crs5 effective dates the mma does not specify when importati on could begin other than linking it to the required safety and cost

grassley bill requires that the secretary promulgate and make effective an interim final rule not later than 90 days after enactment for commercial imports from canada it allows imports from other
