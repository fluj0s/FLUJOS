courtroom and to require courtrooms to be scheduled based on the needs of the circuit and district courts the intent of the section is to address circumstances in which courtrooms are not in full use and the sharing of courtroom will help reduce the overburdened judicial docket related issues and legislation the 109th congress considered but did not act upon legislation to address several longstanding issues that could impact the judiciary budget two of the issues judicial pay and rent payments to gsa will continue to be relevant in the 110th congress judicial pay in the 109th congress on february 10 2006 senator feinstein for herself senators patrick j leahy and john f kerry introduced s 2276 the federal judicial fairness act of 2006 to increase the salaries of federal judges salaries by 165 in introducing the bill she stated this legislation is needed to prevent continuing decline in the pay of our federal judges and prevent damage to the quality of our judiciary impartial dedicated and wise judges are critical to our justice system nevertheless in the past three decades our federal judges have been neglected since 1969 the salaries of federal judges have declined by nearly 24 percent in inflation adjusted dollars by comparison in the same time period the salary of the average american worker has increased over 15 percent32 the bill would have increased the salaries of the chief justice of the united states associate justices of the us supreme court judges of us circuit courts district courts and the us court of international trade bankruptcy judges and fulltime magistrate judges in addition s 2276 would have ended the link between congressional and judicial salary adjustments which has prevented increases in judicial pay when congress does not provide an annual cost of living increase to its members under the bill the annual pay increase for federal judges would have been based on the employment cost index33 s 2276 was referred to the senate judiciary committee but further action was taken before the 109th congress adjourned on march 28 2006 representative adam b schiff for himself and representative judy b biggert introduced hr 5014 the federal judicial fairness 32 congressional record daily edition vol 152 16 feb 10 2006 p s1073 33 according to the us bureau of labor statistics the employment cost index is measure of the change in the cost of labor free from the influence of employment shifts among occupations and industries the series measures changes in compensation costs wages and salaries and employer costs for employee benefits crs15 act of 2006 bill identical to s 2276 in his introductory remarks representative schiff said that when compared with the private sector judges salaries have declined so significantly that consequently judges have been leaving the federal bench in increasing numbers many before reaching retirement age and large proportion leaving to work for private law firms he noted that if congress does not provide reasonable compensation adjustments nor address the growing pay disparity between judges and other members of the legal profession the quality of our judiciary will be compromised34 the bill was referred to the house judiciary committee on the judiciary but further action was taken before the 109th congress adjourned the judicial conference speaking on behalf of the judiciary has repeatedly expressed concern about inadequate judicial salaries chief justice john g roberts jr strong advocate for higher judicial pay devoted his 2006 yearend report on the federal judiciary to the issue the chief justice stated that the subject of judicial pay increases had been ignored far too long and has now reached the level of constitutional crisis that threatens to undermine the strength and independence of the federal judiciary emphasizing that judicial salaries have not kept pace with inflation over the years he noted that today federal district judges are paid substantially less about half what the deans and senior law professors at top schools are paid the retention of federal judges is further concern for the chief justice he said many judges who must attend to their families and futures have realistic choice except to retire from judicial service and return to private practice the numbers are sobering in the past six years 38 judges have left the federal bench including 17 in the last two years if judicial appointment ceases to be the capstone of distinguished career and instead becomes stepping stone to lucrative position in private practice the framers goal of truly independent judiciary will be placed in serious jeopardy35 on january 8 2007 senator leahy introduced for himself and senators john cornyn dianne feinstein harry reid and arlen specter s 197 legislation to provide an fy2007 salary adjustment for justices and judges36 the increase would be 17 and would be retroactive to january 1 2007 the senate

cong 2nd sess srept 109293 washington gpo 2006 crs16 unanimous consent on the same day on the next day the bill was referred to the house where it is pending in the house judiciary committee on january 17 2007 us attorney general alberto r gonzales expressed his belief that higher salaries for judges would help to attract and retain the best legal talent he also said that he had talked with too many potential judicial nominees who have politely declined consideration precisely because they did not feel they could afford to serve i hope that congress will consider enacting meaningful pay raise for judges so that future candidates for judicial office will not be faced with that choice and so that judicial independence will be strengthened37 not everyone however believes substantial increase in judicial pay is warranted opponents of the increase assert that the current judicial pay levels are small sacrifice judicial public servants undertake which are offset by their perquisites associated with the prestigious positions38 rental fees paid to general services administration39 the judiciary pays rent to gsas federal building fund fbf for the use of federally owned and leased space40 according to the judiciary budget request those payments will total 9978 million in fy2007 and have increased an average of about 58 each year since 1999 for fy2006 these payments will comprise about 20 of the total judiciary budget in his 2005 yearend report on the federal judiciary chief justice roberts stated during fiscal year 2005 the judiciary paid 926 million to gsa in rent even though gsas actual cost for providing space to the judiciary was 426 million the disparity between the judiciarys rent and that of other government agencies and between the cost to gsa of providing space and the amount charged to the judiciary is unfair the federal judiciary cannot continue to serve as profit center for gsa escalating rents combined with acrosstheboard cuts imposed during fiscal years 2004 and 2005 resulted in reduction of approximately 1500 judicial branch employees as of middecember when compared to october 2003 37 the text of attorney general gonzales

by the public buildings amendments of 1972 pl 92313 40 usc 592 as codified by pl 107217 the fbf is financed by the rental charges that gsa assesses federal tenants for use of space crs17 the judicial conference in letter dated december 3 2004 to thengsa administrator stephen perry requested an exemption of 483 million in rent relief for fy2005 to ensure the judicial branchs ability to maintain its operations and independence in february 2005 gsa denied the judiciarys request but reaffirmed gsas commitment to help the judiciary identify opportunities to reduce space costs by law gsa is required to charge commercially equivalent rent for the space that agencies occupy41 gsa views the judiciary request as not consistent with its authorizing legislation or with omb and congressional direction rent exemptions according to the gsa are infrequently granted and are not permanent unless required by statute gsa maintains that since 1990 the courts have received approximately 36 of benefits while paying 11 to the fbf42 according to gsa such an exemption could erode the fbf and the rentuser charge system and could have negative impact on other agencies congressional interest in the rent issue has led to actions in both the senate and the house on may 13 2005 three months after gsas denial of rent relief 11 members of the senate judiciary committee including the committee chairman senator specter and ranking member senator leahy wrote to the gsa administrator to request that the judicial branch be exempt from all rental payments with exception of those funds required to operate and maintain federal court buildings43 the senate appropriations committee in its july 2005 committee report on the fy2006 transportationtreasury bill expressed concern about the rent increases and support for the judiciarys efforts to work with gsa to reduce costs the committee also stated however that it does not believe that the gsa rent charges for courthouses are the appropriate focus for financial relief by the judicial branch especially since the committee believes that the federal building fund fbf is critical to the preservation and development of federal buildings including increased requirements for the judicial branch in general the gsa rent policies are appropriate and necessary44 the house has also examined the rent issue the house transportation and infrastructure committees subcommittee on economic development public buildings and emergency management held hearing on june 21 2005 and heard testimony from representatives of the judicial conference gsa and the government accountability office gao about the judiciarys ability to pay for current and future space needs gao reported that it was studying the judiciary request for rent exemption but noted that previous exemptions had been principal reason why the 41 40 usc sec 586b 42 based on gsa documents provided to the senate committee on environment and public works on the courts rent waiver request and the gsa response dated jan 27 2006 43 the letter was also signed by senators charles grassley edward m kennedy orrin g hatch joseph r biden jr jon kyl herb kohl mike dewine dianne feinstein and john cornyn 44 srept 109109 pp 194 and 219 crs18 fbf had accumulated insufficient funds for investment45 year later on june 22 2006 the subcommittee held followup hearing the future of the federal courthouse construction program results of gao study on the judiciarys rental obligations the gao report46 undertaken at the committees request attributed judiciary rent increases to new space and the increasing costs of energy and security costs the report found that neither gsa nor the judiciary had routinely and comprehensively analyzed the factors causing rent increases making it more difficult for the judiciary to manage increases gao recommended that the judiciary track rent trends and improve its management of space and associated costs such as providing incentives for efficient use and updating its criteria for space allocation according to gao gsa generally agreed with its report gao also said that aousc strongly disagrees with the usefulness of the tracking rent trends and asserts that it is already implementing incentives and updating criteria gao said actions the aousc identified do not fully address our recommendations judge jane roth testifying on behalf of the judiciary said that she had read the draft report but had not had the benefit of reading the final report which was publicly released on the day of the hearing she said she believed the draft version was seriously flawed and that the assessment of the reasons for the rent increases was insufficient and misleading judge roth said that since 1985 rent increased 333 adjusted for inflation while square footage increased by only 166 she expressed concern that gao decided what challenges the judiciary faced without consulting judiciary officials with policymaking responsibilities despite concerns with the report findings judge roth said that the gao recommendations were consistent with efforts we already have underway to control rent costs which included tighter budgetary controls and rent caps on facilities decisions judge roth also said that although the judiciary would continue to enhance its facilities planning and management processes the judiciary still faced the situation where mandatory rent payments to gsa have been increasing at faster rate than the judiciarys appropriations increases47 representative bill shuster chairman of the subcommittee said at the hearing that the gao findings only solidify my and i believe this committees stance against such rent waiver and that rent exemption would be disastrous among other things he recommended that the judiciary reevaluate its position on gsa cost saving proposals and also expressed concern about the judiciarys claims of gsa errors in rent bills and appraisal inaccuracies and that he was eager to hear how the 45 us

the third branch july 2006 vol 38 7 p 5 crs19 gsa is addressing these concerns and solving the problem chairman shuster said he was pleased that the fbf was working as originally intended48 members in both the house and senate introduced legislation in early 2006 during the interval between the two house subcommittee hearings which would direct gsa to establish rental fees that would not exceed the actual costs of operating and maintaining accommodations it provides the judiciary on february 8 2006 representative james f sensenbrenner jr chairman of the house judiciary committee for himself and representative lamar s smith introduced hr 4710 the judiciary rent reform act of 2006 which was referred to the house judiciary committee and the house transportation and infrastructure committee and subsequently referred to the subcommittee on economic development public buildings and emergency management on february 15 2006 senator specter chairman of the senate judiciary committee for himself and senators patrick j leahy john cornyn saxby chambliss dianne feinstein joseph r biden jr james m talent daniel k inouye richard m burr and wayne allard introduced s 2292 similar measure to provide relief for the judiciary s 2292 was referred to the senate judiciary committee on april 27 2006 the committee reported the bill however congress did not take further action on either bill prior to the adjournment of the 109th congress according to cbo cost estimate of s 2292 appropriated money would be needed for gsa to construct operate maintain and repair federal buildings cbo said that amounts appropriated directly to gsa would have to increase to cover expenses longer covered by the judicial branch rents and amounts appropriated to judicial branch agencies could simultaneously decline by the same amounts to reflect lower requirements or such rents cbo estimated that rent charges to the judicial branch would be reduced by annual amounts between 300 and 350 million over the next five years reflecting net estimated changes in both the reduction in rents paid by the judicial branch and its direct payments for the costs of repairs and alterations assuming that gsa would perform all planned building operations maintenance and construction work during this period appropriations directly to gsa would increase by the same amount cbo said that if future appropriations to these agencies were adjusted accordingly implementing s 2292 would not have significant net effect on federal spending 49 the judicial conference supported both rent relief bills the conference also took another approach at its biannual meeting on march 14 2006 it voted to affirm its support to shift the responsibility from gsa to the judiciary for the management operation repair leasing and construction of federal courthouses50 the vote followed recommendations contained in space and facilities committee report but the conference left the timing of seeking and implementing such authority

first supported this position in 1989 see httpwwwuscourtsgov press_releasesjudconf031406html for the mar 14 2006 press release crs20 with its executive committee in consultation with the space and facilities and budget committees at the meeting the conference also approved in concept setting an annual budget cap for space rental costs the budget committee in consultation with the space and facilities committee would determine those caps as noted earlier the senate appropriations committee encouraged the judiciary to continue working with gsa on fair and accurate rent charges and to report to the appropriations committees actions on steps for more efficient use of space in the district and circuit courts the committee also included administrative language to prohibit any judge from being entitled to sole use of courtroom for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33339
