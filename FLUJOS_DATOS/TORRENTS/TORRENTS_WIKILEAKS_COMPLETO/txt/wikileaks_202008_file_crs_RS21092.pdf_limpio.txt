more detailed background information see mcdademurtha amendment ethical standards for justice department attorneys crs report rl30060 dec 18 2001 background prior to enactment of the mcdademurtha amendment as section 801 of the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act of 1999 112 stat 2681118 justice department attorneys had long been required to be licensed to practice law by some state territory or the district of columbia and as consequence were obligated to honor the ethical standards imposed upon members of the bar to which they were admitted the federal courts when called upon to establish ethical standards for attorneys appearing before them generally adopted the rules of the states in which they were located httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21092crs2 early in 1980 the justice department ruled that nothing in these state and local federal court standards should be construed as an impediment to federal law enforcement efforts attorneys general thornburg and reno subsequently reemphasized the point in the meantime however congress had begun to express its concern the house government operations committee conducted hearings and recommended among other things thorough examination of the ethics rules applicable to department attorneys while expressing concern over the problems inherent in any system of selfpolicing and regulation hrept 101986 at 35 1990 later the house judiciary committee held hearings on legislative proposal cast in language much like that of the mcdademurtha amendment thereafter apparently frustrated by the perceived lack of an effective mechanism to curb prosecutorial abuse by federal prosecutors both independent counsel and regular justice department attorneys congress added the mcdademurtha amendment to the 1998 justice department appropriations act divisive issues debate over the amendment and proposals to change it revolve around the same issues that have marked the subject from the beginning some are general others particularized who should determine what ethical standards federal litigators must honor should federal standards be uniform throughout the united states or compatible with local standards should local contact grand jury or honesty regulations apply to federal litigators even if they impede the performance of federal attorneys these issues touched upon below in the context of specific legislative proposals are discussed in greater detail in mcdademurtha amendment ethical standards for justice department attorneys crs report rl30060 dec 14 2001 professional standards for government attorneys act s 1437501 of s 1510 senator leahy introduced the professional standards for government attorneys act of 2001 s 1437 for himself and senators hatch and wyden on september 19 2001 147 congrec s9509 the bill passed the senate as section 501 of the senates terrorism bill s 1510 147 congrec s10622 daily ed oct 11 2001 but was not included in the final usa patriot act pl 10756 it repeals the mcdademurtha amendment and instead places federal litigators under the exclusive control of the local federal court rules where they conduct their activities subject to several specific exceptions it calls for studies and reports designed to remove specific divisive issues from the domain of local federal court rules and place them within the federal rules of criminal and civil procedure more specifically when federal litigators are engaged in conduct in connection with or reasonably intended to lead to proceeding in or before particular court they are bound by the ethical standards of that tribunal otherwise they are bound by the rules of the local federal court where they ordinarily perform their duties the sponsors summary indicates that this last category is for cases of uncertainty as when venue is possible in more than one district or when proceedings are being conducted or anticipated in more than one district in other circumstances where court has clear supervisory authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21092crs3 over particular conduct an attorney would be subject to the professional standards established by rules and decisions of the united states district court for the judicial district in which the attorney principally performs his officials duties 147 congrec s9511 daily ed sept 19 2001summary of the profe ssional standards for government attorneys act of 2001 accompanying the introductory remarks of sen leahy the bill codifies the appropriations requirement that federal litigators be licensed to practice law in some american jurisdiction like most local federal court rules it does not require them to be admitted either in the state where they ordinarily represent the united states or in any states where they otherwise perform their duties federal litigators are thus returned to where they stood prior to the mcdademurtha amendment ie remote from the enforcement mechanisms of state bar counsel whenever they are employed in state other than the one in which they have chosen to be licensed the proposal also addresses potential limitations on the use of undercover investigations stings and other forms of undercover investigation are highly valued law enforcement techniques for any number of reasons including the fact that federal prosecutors are now more likely to direct supervise or advise those conducting undercover investigations conflicts have arisen under two sets of rules the contact rules and the honesty rules the contact rules formulated in order to prevent lawyers from taking unfair advantage of unsophisticated laymen prohibit attorneys from approaching represented client unbeknownst to the clients lawyer for any number of reasons law enforcement undercover investigations will ordinarily not be considered violation of the contact rule in most jurisdictions but there are exceptions eg united states v hammad 858 f2d 834 83940 2d cir 1988 the bill leaves the contact rule issue to be resolved by the uniform rules it anticipates will follow from the study it mandates the bill deals with the honesty rule issue more directly the honesty rules ban attorneys from making false statements during the course of their representation of client or from engaging in dishonest deceitful or fraudulent conduct under any circumstances the oregon supreme court has held that an attorney violates the honesty rules when he misidentifies himself and his purpose in the course of investigating possible fraud committed against client in re gatti 330 ore 517 8 p3d 966 2000 in doing so it refused to recognize law enforcement exception for either state or federal authorities 300 ore at 53033 8 p3d at 97476 it has been suggested that the problems presented by gatti could be overcome if federal prosecutors simply disassociated themselves from undercover investigations until the case was ready for prosecution the justice department replies that early attorney participation helps prevent constitutional violations and is more conducive to successful prosecution the bill creates an undercover exception for federal litigators notwithstanding any provision of state law including disciplinary rules statutes regulations constitutional provisions or case law government attorney may for the purpose of enforcing federal law provide legal advice authorization concurrence direction or supervision onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21092crs4 conducting covert activities and participate in such activities even though such activities may require the use of deceit or misrepresentation s1437 proposed 28 usc 530bd although the courts have generally held that prosecutors ethical violations do not in and of themselves constitute grounds for the exclusion of evidence few have held otherwise the bill declares that otherwise admissible evidence may not be excluded from evidence in federal criminal proceedings on the basis of prosecutors ethical violations in addition to the contact rule study the bill directs the judicial conference to report to the house and senate judiciary committees within two years on 1 the actual and potential conflicts between the performance of federal law enforcement duties and ethical standards dictated by the bill and 2 the amendments necessary to resolve those conflicts s 1435599a of hr 2506 as passed by the senate senator wyden introduced the federal investigation enhancement act of 2001 for himself and senator leahy on september 19 2001 it was incorporated into the foreign operations appropriations act hr 2506 and passed the senate as section 599a of that bill on october 24 2001 147 congrec s10961 unlike the more comprehensive s 1437 it does not repeal the mcdademurtha amendment but imports into it an undercover law enforcement exception similar to that found in s 1437 hr 3309 the investigation enhancement act of 2001 introduced on november 15 2001 by represent ative walden for himself and representatives defazio wu hooley and blumenauer replicates s 1435 with one exception it applies the exception both to federal litigators and to justice department attorneys who are investigators rather than litigators
