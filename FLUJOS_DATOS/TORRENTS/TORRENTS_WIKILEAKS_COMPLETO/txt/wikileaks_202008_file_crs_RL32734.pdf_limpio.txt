in time for the fiftieth anniversary of alaskas statehood in 2009 this report provide s background on these claims and summary of the acts provisions background the alaska statehood act the st atehood act was passed in 1958 and allowed the state to select for ow nership approximately 104 million acres of unclaimed and unreser ved federal land1 soon after passage of the statehood act however alaska natives began to challenge many of the states selections arguing that native lands were not available for state selection under the statehood act in 1969 the ninth circuit ruled in favor of the alaska natives2 making it difficult for the state to continue the selection proce ss without clarification as to the specific boundaries of alaska native lands congre ss attempted to resolve this problem in 1971 with the alaska nativ claims settlement act3 ancsa which was designed to settle the aboriginal claims of the alas ka natives ancsa authorized the transfer of over 45 million acres of land and the payment of nearly 1 billion to alaska natives the ancsa approach to the native land transfers is unique in its reliance on the corporate form to manage the lands transferred to the alaska natives ancsa created two tiers of native corporations th village corporations of which there are over 200 and the larger regional corpor ations of which there are thirteen4 village corporation files an application sel ecting certain lands and if this application is approved then the village corporation is conveyed title to the surface estate while the regional corporation is generally conveyed title to the subsurface estate the conveyance process is similar to the stat application process in that the corporations first file app lications for selections of land which blm then reviews and if approved surveys tran sfers and issues final patent to the land to the appropriate nativ corporationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32734crs2 5 see s hrg 108416 alaska native subdivision act alaska land

complications in the surveying of lands neither the statehood act conveyance process nor the ancsa conveyance proce ss has been completed blm estimates that of the 1045 million acres to which th state is entitled under the statehood act blm has completed the survey transfer and patent process for about 43 million acres an additional 47 million acres have been transferred but the state is still awaiting patent of those lands this leaves 15 million acres on which according to blm the conveyance process has not even begun5 blm further estimates that of the 456 llion acres to which the native corporations are entitled under ancsa blm has issued final patents on approximately 18 million acres blm has transferred an additional 19 million acres that are still awaiting final patents blm fficials say that they cannot complete the survey and conveyance proce ss on the remaining 84 million acres of land for variety or reasons the primary one being th at many of the native corporations have overselected lands be yond their entitlements6 the native corporations were encouraged to do this so that they would receive their full entitlement even if certain lands were not approved for transfer but these overselections require blm to determine which of the overselected lands will be used to fulfill the corporations entitlements further complicating the land transfer process is the native allotment act of 19067 under this act alaska natives we re authorized to acquire individual allotments of up to160acre pa rcels of unreserved and unappropriated land alaska natives filed roughl 10000 pplications for 16000 parcels of land before the allotment act was repealed by ancsa8 in 1998 congress passed the alaska native veterans allotment act9 which allowed those viet nam veterans who missed the opportunity to apply for allotments under the 1906 act the chance to do so blm estimates that it still has pendi ng applications for 3256 acres of land under these two acts10 all of which must be finalized before the state and ancsa entitlements can be filledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32734crs3 11 pl 85508 6a note preceding 43 usc 21 12 this information was provided to the aut hor in

environmental groups and private oil timber and mining interests in 2001 blm came up with plan to complete the land transfer process by 2020 many have expressed the st rong desire however that the process be completed by 2009 the 50th anniversary of alaskas statehood in order to meet this deadline blm and the department of the interior requested legislative action to streamline process that has traditionally moved ve ry slowly the alaska land transfer acceleration act is congresss response the alaska land transfer acceleration act title i title i represents an attempt to speed up the state selection process under section 6a of the statehood act the state is allowed to select 400000 acres of national forest land and 400000 acres of other public lands all adjacent to existing communities approval authority for these community development grants is vested in the secretary of agriculture for national forest lands and in the secretary of the interior for all other public lands11 the statehood act requi res blm to convey tracts of at least 160 acres but many pending app lications for selections of public lands are in violation of this minimum tract requirement further because the statutory application deadline has passed these app lications cannot be amended giving the secretary of the interior alternative but to reject the applications12 the act waives the minimum tract requirement for five grant applications totaling almost 400 acres13 in addition the act approves any co mmunity grant applications for other public lands on file with the interior secretary on the date of enactment14 many of the states current community grant selections are in areas likely to be conveyed to ancsa corporations which c ould leave the state without sufficient remaining selections to fulfill its comm unity grant entitlement to 400000 acres to remedy this problem the act allows the st ate to convert selec tion applications from its much larger general entitlement under section 6b of the statehood act15 into community grant selection applications16 these 6b entitlements amount to more than 102 million acres of vacant unappropria ted and unreserved federal lands and cannot be selected from national forestshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32734crs4 17 pl 96487 codified as amended at 16 usc 3101 et seq 43 usc 16311641 18 pl 108452 102 19 id at 103 20 s hrg 108163 at 20 2003 t

conservation act17 anilca in 1980 congress granted the state the ability to prioritize its selections the act clarifies the states respons ibilities as to these prioritizations18 some of the lands prioritized by the state have reversionary interest vested in the united states as the statutes under which the lands were conveyed to the state require the federal government to retain such an interest to ensure the lands are used consistent with the respective purposes of the conveyances th act allows the state to fulfill its land entitlement by selecting these reversionary interests19 this would have the effect of removing the federal governme nts control and oversight of these lands and possibly allowing development incons istent with any surrounding federal lands in testimony before senate subcommittee blm official conceded that much of these lands are within national wildlife refuges but argued that the lands are generally adjacent to towns and villages and are already developed in ways beneficial to the local communities eg they have schools or community centers built on them20 since the passage of anilca the state has been allowed to fulfill its 6a and 6b entitlements by selecting lands that are presently withdrawn for some other purpose but may become open for selection at future date21 the state is still waiting for much of the land selected acco rding to these socalled top filings to become available the act makes available eight parcels of land topfiled for selection that were previously reserved for power projects or withdrawn as hot or medicinal springs22 the act excludes land within conservation system units csus23 from availability under this provision24 congress in 1929 granted 100000acre land entitlement to the university of alaska25 but disputes abound as to just how much land remains to be conveyed under this entitlement the act sets the remain ing entitlement at 456 acres and allows the state on behalf of the university to fulfill the universitys entitlement by selecting mineral interests in land the unreserved portion of which is held by the universityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32734crs5 26 pl 108452 105 27

flexibility to enter into binding agreements with the state to finaliz alaskas entitlements under the state hood act27 in addition the act allows the state to select or topfile specific parcels of land in the chugach national forest and the transalas ka pipeline system that were mistakenly omitted from previous applications or topfilings28 the act institutes streamlined procedur for the conversion of certain federal mining claims to state mining claims29 some lands selected by the state are encumbered by federal mining claims making the lands unavailable for selection the surrounding lands can be conveyed to the state but that creat isolated tracts of federal land which bl m has complained are very difficult to manage30 the act allows for the holder of valid federal mining claim on stateselected or topfiled lands to relinquish that claim and have it converted to state mining claim the lands attached to the mining claim are then transferred to the state so long as the land was selected or topfiled as of january 3 199431 title ii title ii of the act attempts to finalize the regional and village corporation land selecti ons under ancsa under anc sa regional and village corporations had limited time in which to select lands and could only select lands that were available during that period in other words they did not have the option to topfile withdrawn lands for future lection when they became available title ii of the act allows the corporations to lect previously unavailable land that is part of or adjacent to town in whic h village corporation is located32 section 12 of ancsa gave the village corporations two separate selections of land selections of land within which the native villages were located 12a selections and excess land reallocable to the village corporations by the regional corporations on an equitable basis 12b selections33 the regional corporations have been slow to reallocate the 12b lands and the act requires the regional corporations to complete the process by october 1 200534 the act also attempts to counter the effects of overselections and ease blms surveying duty by allowing the 12a and 12b selections to be

one year of the bills passage id conveying those lands35 if village has overselected its 12a lands for example it can take smaller amount of 12b lands to fulfill its entitlement blm has argued that one of the primary obstacles to completing the conveyance process is the requirement that blm survey down to the very last acre to ensure that conveyances do not exceed the corporation s entitlement according to blm this often takes more than one field survey season to accomplish36 the act addresses this problem by allowing the interior secretary to enter into an agreement with the affected corporation according to which the secretary conveys some or all of the next whole prioritized section 640 acres of land if doing so would satisfy that corporations entitlement37 exactly how much the secretary is allowed to round up under this provision depends on the status of the land if the land is managed by blm and is not within csu then the secretary can convey th next whole section if the land is not within csu and is managed by an agency other than blm then the secretary can convey the next quartersection with the concurrence of the other agency and if the land is within csu then the secretary can convey the next quarter of quartersection if ma naged by an agency other than blm then the concurrence of th at agency is also required38 ancsa authorized the secretary of the interior to withdraw 2 million acres of unreserved and unappropr iated public lands nd convey them to corporations and native groups for special situations and pur poses such as cemetery land and reserved mineral charges against regional corporation entitlements39 delays in finalizing these conveyances have according to blm created significant delays in enabling regional corporations to know their final entitlements40 the act creates an expedited process for the conveyance of roughly 1800 existing cemetery and historical sites41 according to ancsa any of these 2 million acres of special purpose land left over are to be distri buted among the regional corporationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32734crs7 42 43 usc 1613h8a 43 pl 108452 205 there are two minor exce ptions the chugach native

provides that if regional co rporation does not have sufficient land selected to fulfill its entitle ment under the remainder provision then the secretary may withdraw land to fulfill that entitle ment so long as the land is vacant unappropriated nd unreserved44 section 17d1 of ancsa gave the secr etary of the interior the authority to withdraw lands for further study and recla ssify them for various uses in the public interest45 much of this land remains withdrawn today but has yet to be reclassified and the question of what to do with these lingering withdrawals estimated by blm to comprise over 53 million acres of land proved to be one of the most controversial aspects in the debates leading to the passage of the act46 of this 53 million acres blm estimates that roughly 28 million acres are selected by the state native corporation or both leavin g 253 million acres potentially open for economic activities under fede ral law should the lands withdrawn under 17d1 be

id at 302while overselection of lands by native co rporations presents practical obstacles to the completion of the land transfer process there is also relatively small number of corporations that have not selected enough lands to fulfill their entitlements federal officials have been grappling with these underselections for years congress included in anilca proce ss for dealing with underselections49 but blm argued that this process is too cumbersome50 this process includes two steps first the secretary issues public land orde r plo withdrawing twice the amount of land necessary to fulfill the corporation s entitlement then the corporation has ninety days in which to file an appli cation selecting from that amount enough land to fulfill its entitlement51 the act allows the parties to agree in advance which lands are to be selected the secretary may then withdraw the agreedupon amount of land which the corporation would formally select52 similar to the authority that granted to the secretary of the interior to negotiate with the state to finalize its entitlements the act grants the secretary that same authority with regards to the native corporations53 title iii in 2003 blm estimated that the remaining pending allotment applications totaled 3256 acres of land approximately 1100 acres of which were erroneously conveyed to the state or to na tive corporations and so longer belong to the united states54 recovery of title55 of these lands has proven especially difficult and the act seeks to ameliorate this problem by allowing the secretary of the interior to either correct erroneous conveyances ie th conveyances that caused the lands to pass from the federal governments ownership in the first place to exclude allotment land56 or enter into agreements with native corporations whereby the corporations reconvey the land to the united states57 if the parties cannot agree to use the processes described above then the act allows the state or native
