authority is made up of several components including regular annual appropriations emergency appropriations rescissions and offsets2 huds programs and acti vities are funded almost entirely through regular annual appropriations also referred to as discretionary appropriations3 as result the amount provided in the annual appropriations acts each year generally determines how much will be obligated and eventually spent for each of huds programs and activities in some years congress will also provide emergency appropriations generally in response to disasters through one or more of huds programs these funds are generally provided outside of the regular appropriations actsoften in emergency supplemental spending billsand are generally provided in addition to regular program level funding congressional appropriators are generally subject to limits in the amount of new nonemergency discretionary appropriations they can provide in year one way to stay within these limits is to provide less in regular annual appropriations another way to stay within these limits is to find offsets for spending portion of the cost of huds regular annual appropriations acts is generally offset in two ways the first is through rescissions or cancellations of unobligated or recaptured balances from previous years funding the second is through offsetting receipts and collections generally derived from fees paid by hud partners or clients the interaction between new appropriations and offsets provided through rescissions receipts and collections determines huds total budget authority budget authority is also the cost of the hud budget as estimated by the congressional budget office in its scorekeeping process 4 the total amount of budget authority provided to hud each year while important for federal budgeting purposes is not necessarily the best measure of the amount of funding that is being provided for huds programs and activities for example if congress has increased appropriations for huds programs and activities at the same time that offsetting receipts are increasing by greater amount then huds total budget authority may appear to be declining conversely if congress has reduced appropriations for huds programs and acti vities at the same time that offsetting receipts are declining by greater amount then huds budget authority may appear to be increasing if congress wished to maintain level budget authority for hud programs congress would increase appropriations if offsets are declining or provide less appropriations if offsets are increasing 2 for more information see crs report rs20095 the congressional budget process brief overview by james v saturno 3 according to the congressional quarterlys american congressional dictionary discretionary appropriations are defined as appropriations not mandated by existing law and therefore made available annually in appropriation bills in such amounts as congress chooses the budget enforcement act of 1990 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority provided in annual appropriation acts and the outlays derived from that authority but it excludes appropriations for entitlements 4 according to the congressional quarterlys american congressional dictionary scorekeeping is defined as the process of calculating the budgetary effects of pending and enacted legislation and assessing its impact on applicable budgetary targets as required by the congressional budget act of 1974

authority for hud increased 28 between fy2002fy2008 from over 29 billion to just under 38 billion however the increase in total budget authority masks several important trends from fy2002 to fy2008 regular annual appropriations which is the amount available to fund huds programs and activities grew by 20 du ring the same period the amount available in offsetting receipts and collections which congress uses to reduce the cost of providing new appropriations declined by more than 65 see figure 1 as result the increase in total non emergency budget authority for hud from fy2002fy2008 is not fully attributable to increases in appropriations for huds programs and activities rather part of the increase in total budget authority is attributable to decreases in the amount available in offsetting receipts for example in fy2007 congress provided 39 billion in regular appropriations for huds programs and activities since 3 billion was available from offsets and rescissions huds total budget authority was 36 billion if less had been available in offsets the cost to congress of providing 39 billion in regular appropriations would have been higher figur 1 hud funding fy2002fy2008

pared by crs on the basis of an nual ap prop riations documents the increase in regular nonemergency appropriations shown in figure 1 from just over 35 billion in fy2002 to over 40 billion in fy2008 is largely attributable to the growth in appropriations for the projectbased and tena ntbased section 8 program from fy2002fy2008 appropriations for section 8 grew by more than 40 appropriations for all other programs and activities during that period declined by about 4 as can be seen in figure 2 appropriations for the section 8 program have grown from about 45 of huds regular appropriations in fy2002 to about 55 of huds regular appropriations in fy2008

the budget authority for the tenantbased rental assistance account is made up of two components current year appropriations and adva nce appropriations current year appropriations are provided in fiscal year for use in that fiscal year advance appropriations are provided in fiscal year for use in the subsequent fiscal year for budget scoring purposes the appropriations committee is charged for an advance appropriation in the year it becomes available for use since fy2001 funding for the section 8 program has included an advance appropriation and for most years the advance appropriation was the same amount every year as result the amount of funding that was provided in given year the current year appropriation plus the advance for the next year was equal to the amount of budget authority available to the program for that year the current year appropriation plus the advance from the previous year in fy2008 the advance appropriation provided by congress to become available in fy2009 was less than the amount of the advance appropriation that became available in fy2008 and was provided in fy2007 as result the amount of budget authority provided in fy2008 16391 million was less than the amount of budget authority available to the program in fy2008 16426 million congress was scored by cbo for the amount of budget authority available in the fiscal year rather than the amount provided by the bill fy2008 funding for the tenantbased rental assistance account was further complicated by rescission that was included in the administrative provisions of the fy2008 appropriations law section 238 of division k pl 110161 directed that hud reduce the advance appropriation that was provided in fy2007 for use in fy2008 by 723 million this rescission did not affect the amount of budget authority provided by the fy2008 funding bill but it did affect the amount of budget authority available to the program in fy2008 reducing it from 16426 million to 15703 million in his fy2009 budget request the president requested that congress again provide less in advance appropriations for the section 8 tenantb ased rental assistance account than will become available in fy2009 the president requested that c ongress provide 4000 million in advance appropriations for use in fy2010 decrease from the 4158 million in advance appropriations provided in fy2008 for use in fy2009 in ddition to the advance the presidents budget requested 11881 million in current year funding for fy2009

presidents request 4200 million compared to 4000 million however s 3261 includes rescission of 800 million from the advance appropriation provided in fy2008 for use in fy2009 as result s 3261 would

appropriations intended to be used for renewal funding as described above the net funding for renewals in fy200813971 millionwas intended to be supplemented with agencies use of their net restricted assets net restricted assets are accumulated unspent funds that agencies are not permitted to spend because their use would result in the agency leasing more than their allocated number of vouchers referred to as overleasing 7 in order to enable agencies to spend their net restricted assets congress directed hud to reduce agencies fy2008 funding by the amount by which their net restricted assets exceeded 7 of their prior year renewal funding see discussion under renewal formula heading below it was estimated that roughly the same amount of net restricted asset funding would be freed up as was rescinded 723 million as result it was assumed that the overall funding available for renewals in fy2008 would be equal to just under 14695 million 13971 million in appropriations plus 723 billion in newly freedup net restricted assets for fy2009 the president requested 14319 million for voucher renewals an increase over fy2008 13971 million huds congressional budget justifications indicated that the president anticipated supplementing the amount requested for renewals by freeingup phas remaining net restricted assets which hud estimated to be worth roughly 600 million combining the presidents requested appropriations level with the 600 million anticipated to be available from net restricted assets the fy2009 program level would be 14919 billion an increase over the estimated fy2008 program level 14695 million including the use of 723 million in net restricted assets of about 250 million or 17 this rate of increase is likely below the annual adjustment factor aaf which is the inflation

used in fy2008 the bill would provide 14819 million for renewals but also rescind 800 million from the advance appropriation provided in the prior year the resulting net funding level 14019 million would be less than the amount requested by the president for renewals 14319 million however the bill assumes that phas will have access to their net restricted assets in an amount roughly equal to the amount rescinded making 14819 million available for renewals this amount would be more than was provided in fy2008 and more than the overall program level proposed by the president including the use of net restricted assets g20g142g151g142g160g138g149g561g8g152g155g150g158g149g138g561 one of the most contentious aspects of the hud budget in recent years has been how congress directs hud to allocate voucher renewal funding to phas although statutory allocation formula exists it has been overridden in the annual appropriations acts each year since fy2003 in some years phas have been funded according to the cost of their vouchers and the number of vouchers they have leased called their utilization rate in other years phas have been funded on the basis of what they received in the previous year without adjustments for cost or utilization changes for more information see crs report rl33929 recent changes to the section 8 voucher renewal funding formula by maggie mccarty in fy2008 congress directed hud to fund phas on th basis of their costs and utilization from the previous year adjusted for inflation and other factors congress then directed hud to reduce each phas allocation by the amount that their net restricted assets exceeded 7 of their previous years allocation and then prorate phas budgets to fit within the amount appropriated 13921 million 9 some phasphas participating in the moving to work demonstration phas that spent more than they were allocated in the previous year certain phas affected by the 2005 hurricanes and phas under hud receivershipwere subject to different formula moving to work phas were funded on the basis of their contracts with hud phas that spent more than their allocations were funded on the basis of what they received in the previous year plus inflation and the others were funded on the basis of the higher of what they received in the previous year plus inflation or what they were eligible to receive under the fy2008 funding formula the prohibition on overleasing was continued in fy2008 additionally congress provided 50 million for rental subsidy reserve that hud could use to fund phas that would either not have enough fund ing to maintain their current vouchers or that faced high portability10 costs for fy2009 the president requested that phas be funded on the basis of what they received in the previous year plus inflation reduced by their remaining net restricted assets and prorated to fit within the amount appropriated the presidents budget also included request for 50 million rental subsidy reserve to adjust the budgets of phas facing unforeseen circumstances or high portability costs finally the presidents budget proposed allowing phas to use excess budget authority to fund additional vouchers above their baseline allocation overleasing which as noted earlier they have been prohibited from doing since fy2003 9 13971 million less the 50 million rental subsidy reserve 10 portability is the term used to describe the process in which family with voucher moves from the jurisdiction of one pha to the jurisdiction of another in some cases phas can face increased costs due to portability moves

with increased leasing between the end of the fiscal year the period upon which the cost and utilization data are based and the end of the calendar year the period for which phas are funded or 3 with

to fy2003 administrative fee funding was provided as part of voucher renewal funding phas were paid administrative fees on per voucher basis in an amount based on formula tied to hudestablished fair market rents fmrs in th eir communities in fy2003 congress separated administrative fee funding from voucher renewal funding and directed hud to provide administrative fees to phas on prorata basis according to what they received in the previous year this formula change was maintained until fy2008 when congress directed hud to allocate administrative fees to phas on the basis of the pe r voucher formula tied to fmrs that was in use prior to fy2003 however congress continued to setaside fixed amount of funding for administrative fees 1351 million in fy2008 while more administrative fee funding was made available to phas in fy2008 than fy2007 it is estimated that the amount provided in fy2008 would not be sufficient to fund 100 of phas administrative fee eligibility under the formula for fy2009 the presidents budget requested an increase in administrative fee funding by about 50 million to 1400 million the presidents budget request proposed using the same formula for allocating administrative fees as was used in fy2008 s 3261 would provide 1500 million for administrative fees that amount includes 1400 million for administrative fees to be allocated using the formula used in fy2008 as requested by the president of the remaining 100 million 50 million would be set aside for phas requiring extra funds to administer their vouchers and 50 million would be setaside for family

contract renewal with property owner which had been the departments past practice the fy2007 funding level had been sufficient to fund partial contract renewals but not sufficient to fund all contract renewals for their full 12 month terms the office of management and budget omb and hud worked together to identify sufficient funding to resume payments to landlords for the remainder of fy2007

fy2008 funding request would be sufficient to partially fund contracts through the end of fy200813 figure 4 helps illustrate the concept of full contract funding versus partial contract funding projectbased contracts expire throughout the year when contract expires hud can either provide funding for the full 12month term of the contract the light plus dark shaded areas of figure 4 or some shorter period such as through the end of the federal fiscal year september 30 the dark shaded areas of figure 4 for example if contract expires at the beginning of july in order to fund it through the end of the federal fiscal year as shown in the dark shaded area in figure 4 hud would be required to provide 3 months worth of funding to fund the contract for full year through the following july hud would be required to provide 12 months of funding as shown in the dark and light shaded area in figure 4 assuming all of the roughly 18000 projectbased section 8 contracts expire evenly across the months of the year which is likely not the case in order to fund all 18000 contracts through the end of the fiscal year hud would need 78 months worth of funding see dark shaded area of figure 4 in

funding available for new capital grants and project rental assistance would be 321 million down from the 566 million that is estimated to be available from the fy2008 appropriation the proposed

million more than the amount provided in fy2008 and 225 million more than the presidents budget request of the amount that would be appropriated in s 3261 80 million would be available for the service coordinator program the same level requested by the president and 20 million increase over fy2008 the bill would provide level funding of 25 million for the assisted living c onversion program like the presidents request s 3261 would appropriate 15 million for leveraging financing demonstration program described above s 3261 includes language that would make change to the refinancing provisions of the statute governing the section 202 program under current law section 202 owners may refinance their properties if they agree to operate the project under terms at least as advantageous to tenants as the terms of the existing loan and if the refinancing results in lower interest rate and reduced debt service under the language in s 3261 the new loan would not be required to have lower interest rate as long as the project owner would use the new funding to address the projects physical needs this would make it possible for older section 202 developments many of which have loans with interest rates of 3 to refinance their loans and use the proceeds to make improvements to the property the senate appropriations committee bill also includes provision that would require hud to provide enhanced vouchers to section 202 tenants in cases where insufficient projectbased rental assistance is made available to the development g21g142g140g157g146g152g151g561g350g343g343g561 the

made available for capital grants and project rental assistance which is expected to support 1050 units the administration recommendation would not provide any funding for new section 811 vouchers for persons with disabilities although the fy2008 appropriation did not contain funds for new vouchers through the section 811 program it provided 30 million for vouchers for nonelderly disabled families through the section 8 account see earlier discussion for fy2009 the administration has proposed that funds from the service coordinator program provided through the housing for the elderly account be provided for section 811 developments as well as developments designed for elderly households the hud budget documents note that legislation to expand the service coordinator program to include section 811 could be introduced this congress and if it is that approximatel 19 million of the 80 million requested for new service coordinator contracts would be available to section 811 developments for the second year in row the president has proposed to fund leveraging financing demonstration program similar to the one proposed for the section 202 program the presidents budget would make 10
