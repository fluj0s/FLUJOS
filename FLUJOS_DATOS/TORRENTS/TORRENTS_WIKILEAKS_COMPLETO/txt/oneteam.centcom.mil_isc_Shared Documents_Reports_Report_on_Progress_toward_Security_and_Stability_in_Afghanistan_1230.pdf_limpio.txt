unit ed states and our international partners toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan ending years of brut misrule and denying qaeda safe haven from which to launch its attacks the united states is committed to helping afghanistan recover from decades of strife and preventing it from ever again becoming safe haven for terrorists our strategic goals remain th at afghanistan is 1 reliable stable ally in the war on terror 2 moderate and democratic with thriving private sector economy 3 capable of governing its territory and borders and 4 respectful of the rights of all its citizens achieving these goals requires the applicatio n of wholeofgovernment approach along multiple lines of operation including security governance and development this report describes both the progress we are making in achieving our national objectives and the challenges we continue to face security although security remains frag ile in many parts of afghani stan our counterinsurgency approach demonstrates how combination of military and nonmilitary resources can be integrated to create stable and secure environm ent and to connect the afghan people with their government khowst province is an example khowst was once considered ungovernable and one of the most dangerous provinces in afghani stan today tangible im provements in security governance reconstruction and development are being made these improvements are achieved through the closely coordinated efforts of th local government the afghanistan national security forces ansf international organizati ons as well as us military diplomatic and development experts importantly lessons l earned from the successes in khowst are being shared with our partners and pplied elsewhere in the country the increase in us forces in the spring of 2008

the ana has taken the lead in more than 30 significant operations to date and has demonstrated increasing competence effec tiveness and professionalism operation maiwand executed in the summer of 2007 in the andar district of ghazni province is just one example of the anas progress planned re hearsed and executed under the direction of the afghan 203rd corps commander combined ana and isaf task force cleared the entire district and removed taliban shadow governor this wellint egrated security operation was quickly exploited with the synchronized app lication of governance an d development efforts consisting of medical treatment for 2300 citizens 10 new schools the delivery of 260 tons of humanitarian aid and one million dollars committed toward additional development this operation resulted in the signifi cant disruption to enemy forces in ghazni province and is manifestation of the growth and maturation of ansf as well as the spread of governance and development the afghanistan national police anp are improving although at slower pace than the ana generally police development has b een hindered by lack of reform corruption 5unclassified insufficient us military trainers and

developments afghanistan continues to face challenges the taliban regrouped after its fall from power and have coalesced into resi lient insurgency it now poses challenge to the af ghan governments authority in some rural areas insurgent violence increased in 2007 most visibly in the form of asymmetric attacks as afghan and international forces relentless pressure forced the in surgents to shift the majority of its effort to targeting police and civ ilians more than 6500 people died as result of suicide attacks roadside bombs and combatrelated violen ce the 2007 isaf and ansf military campaign caused setbacks to the afghan insurgency includ ing leadership losses and the loss of some key safehavens in afghanistan despite these setbacks the taliban is likely to maintain or even increase the scope and pace of its terrorist attacks and bombings in 2008 the taliban will challenge the control of the afgha n government in rural areas esp ecially in the south and east the taliban will also probably attempt to increase its presence in the west and north up to the first quarter of 2008 the most signi ficant threat to stability in th north and west of the country has come from warlords criminals and drug tr affickers the power of these entities is increasingly challenged by th growing competence of local and national government narcotics remain significant challenge for afghanistan and the international community while progress has been made in so areas overall counternarcotics efforts in afghanistan have not been successful as secretary of defense robert gates stated in his testimony to the house armed service comm ittee on december 11 2007 the drug trade continues to threaten the foundations of afghan society and the young government of afghanistan opium production in afghanistan increased substantially in 2007 the narcotics trade dissuades work and investment in legitimate activities provides the insurgents with lucrative source of funding and c ontributes heavily to heroin addiction in central asia europe and increasingly east africa although counternarc otics cn efforts have resulted in gains over the past six years the battle against drug traffi ckers is ongoing and will be for some time in conjunction with the afghan ministry of fense mod cstca is assisting with the development and fielding of new cn infantry kandak battali on for the

rights afghanistan was the prime example of faile d state in 2001 aside from the talibans enforcement of its version of sh aria law most functions of gove rnment were nonexistent there were few social services and little investment in health education roads power or water afghans were denied participati on in their government enjoyed civil or political liberties and were afforded avenue of dissent since 2001 afghanistan has made significant progress rebuilding its national political institutions afghans wrote and passed new constitution in 2004 81 million people voted in 6unclassified the nations first presidential election and 64 million voters helped reestablish their national assembly after 32 years without legislature ministries are in creasingly capable of executing their responsibilities part icularly the ministries of defense foreign affairs and finance since 2006 the supreme court has been headed by an internationally respected and highly capable jurist with formal legal education the international community continues to help develop afghanistans justice sector and provincial governments progress is slow in part because of afghani stans human capital shortage only three in ten afghans can read aving very shallow pool of literate citizens to staff the courts government offices police armed forces or pr ivate enterprises despite important progress made since 2001 af ghanistans human rights record remains poor though most human rights vi olations are perpetrated by the talibanled insurgency weak governmental and traditional in stitutions corruption narcotics trafficking and the countrys twoandahalf decades of violen t conflict exacerbate the problem abuses by security forces continue however the government has worked to professionalize its army and police force increased oversight of police by internal and ex ternal monitors has helped to prevent some abuses and human rights training has become regular element for police and army personnel reconstruction and development setting the conditions necessary for economic gr owth is essential to longterm security and stability afghanistan has come long way in seven year s since 2001 gross domestic product per capita income and foreign direct investment are all up there has been considerable growth in afghanistans domestic re venues as well as international reserves which have nearly doubled since 2004 however af ghanistan still faces formidable economic challenges the afghan government remains ove rly dependent on forei gn aid with official revenues covering only 20 percent of recurrent costs costs particularly for food and fuel are rising as is inflation access to credit is limited and few afgh ans are able to borrow four strategic economic priori ties support the count erinsurgency effort these include 1 embracing free market economic policy at nior levels of government 2 enhancing government resources 3 addressing inflation nd 4 implementing structural reforms commitment to free markets means resisting costly subsidies and price controls that serve to reduce resources for other more c onstructive expenditures in areas like infrastructure education and healthcare us and intern ational community efforts are ssisting the afghan government in moving towards sustainable fisc policy capable of generating revenue managing resources and operating without foreign fina ncial support the in ternational community is also trying to boost economic growth by modernizing the countrys infrastructure particularly in the areas of electrical power road construc tion water management and agricu ltural development provincial reconstruction teams prts are key elements in these endeavors ensuring that reconstruction and development efforts are coordinated at all vels and responsive to local needs finally trade is benefiting albeit slowly from growing regional integration afghanistan is scheduled to join the south asian free trade area bringing gr eater access to and integration with six other countries in the region including bangladesh bhutan india maldives nepal pakistan and sri lanka looking ahead the us commitment to afghanistan is unw avering success in afghanistan is both crucial to global security and is moral responsi bility achieving that success will take time effort resources and the sustai ned interest and commitment of the international community 7unclassified moreover success will never be achieved through military means alone but through comprehensive approach that involves all ements of power military diplomatic and economic above all it will require sustained effo rt to continue to develop the capacity of the afghans themselves where we have begun to pply such an approach real progress is being made it is critical that we continue to build on the mo mentum that has been achieved 8unclassified intentionally blank 9unclassified section 1 security 11 counterinsurgency strategy the us operational approach to the security component of counterinsurgency in afghanistan is to build afghan security capacity while degrading the capacity of the taliban us forces work to root out insurgents while increasing the ability of the afghans to do so on their own throughout afghanistan this is achieved through kine tic and nonkinetic efforts to separate the enemy from the cal population by part nering with the ansf and engaging afghan leaders shuras key leader engagements medical engagements humanitarian aid missions and combined presence patrols provide venue fo r ansf forces to interact with the general population and discuss needs for local improvement s these missions work to create trust between the local populace afghan leadership an sf and isaf forces as trust increases support for the government of the islamic republic of afghanistan giroa the anp and the ana evolves proportionately afgh an civilians are beginning to report enemy activity including improvised explosive device ied emplacements suspicious activity and potential future attacks in an effort to gain the support of the populace and demonstrate the superior governance capabilities of the giroa as opposed to the taliban ansf and international forces have increased governance outreach and development activities 12 nature of the threat in 2008 there is the potential fo r two distinct insurgencies in afghanistan kandahari based insurgency dominated by the taliban in the south and more complex adaptive insurgency in the east the eastern insurgency is loose confederation of affiliates such as the haqqani network and likeminded groups that are prepared to cooperate with the talibans kandaharibased insurgency these groups include alqaeda hizbe islami gulbuddin and pakistani militant groups jaishe mohammed shkaretayyiba tehrik nefazishariat muhammad their shared goals include the xpulsion of all foreign military forces from afghanistan the elimination of external governm ent influence in their respective areas and the imposition of religiously conserva tive pashtunled government principal strength of the ta libanled kandahari insurgency is its ability to regenerate combat power by leveraging tribal networks exploiting lack of governance and the afghan peoples inherent resistance to change and outside influence the talibans strategy hinges on their ability to prevent the afghan government and isaf from achieving victory and the international community eventually losing the will to tactically intervene in the counterinsurgency effort the insurgencys critical capabilities are its ability to project strength and mystique of the inevitability of taliban ru that is constantly sustained through focused information effort in other words not losing is winning principal vulnerability of both the talibanled kandarhari and eastern insurgencies is that beyond forcibly imposing shariamodeled law nd order they are unable to deliver to the afghan people sustainable governance or devel opment of commercial infrastructure both insurgencies are anticipatory in nature and maximize every opportunity to separate the afghan population from the giroa the insurgencies are powerless to provide development and they lack the capacity to meet the basic needs of the citizens of afghanist an however it is worth noting that this limitation did not prevent the orig inal taliban from controlling through force of 10unclassified arms the majority of the count ry in the late 1990s the pr eponderance of both insurgencies influence stems from the use of fear and intimidation tactics as result of these efforts in the minds of the afghan people insurgent forces are cognitively becoming separated from the respected mujahidin fighters that defeated the soviets and sustained afghans for decades

during this time period figure 1 distribution of attacks in afghanistan by province violence increased in afghanistan in 2007 significant factor in the increase in violence was aggressive afghan and international force tactics combined with insurgent recognition that while they cannot defeat afghan and international forces on the battlefield they can harm political will by increasing casualties violence may also have increased because afghan and international forces are asserting c ontrol over greater area in increased numbers thus increasing their exposure to insurgent attacks attack levels alone are not ways good indicator of the secu rity situation even in areas where insurgent activity is high afghan and international forces often have the full support of the local population khowst province again provides succes s story in this eastern province the level enemy activity and attacks remains relatively high but most of the population lives without fear trusting the government to keep them safe the success of afghan and international fo rces in military engagements has led insurgents to increase asymmetric attacks as such ied attacks are on the rise ied incidents reached high of 2615 incidents in 2007 up from 1931 in 2006 counteried training is an important part of us and isaf efforts to im prove security in the country it includes curriculum that the nato operational

were discovered and predetonated as well as those that were reported by local citizens the success of the giroa in meeting the needs of the populat ion and winning their allegiance has been uneven and sometimes tempor ary in many provinces and districts the governments failure to connect ffectively with the pe ople of the country nd provide security and prosperity has provided an opening for the taliban to successfully install shadow 11unclassified governments that provide basic security against wlessness the taliban is likely to continue efforts to emplace shadow governments in order to enhance local control by insurgent forces undermine the authority of district and provincia l level officials appoint ed by kabul and present locally acceptable alternative to the karzai g overnment

emphasized the importance of giving commanders in the field the maximum possible flexibility to ensure that they can accomplish their mission in the fastest possible timeframe while minimizing risk and loss of life just over half of the allies in isaf have some form of caveats on the geog raphical andor functional deployment of their forces some allies have written caveats on their forces but operate with facto restrictions that can be even more severe than caveats th erefore rather than focus exclusively on caveats the us has pressed all allies and partners to provide commanders on the ground with the maximum possible flexibility in terms of when where and how they utilize forces under their command the most significant and commonly cited caveats are restrictions that keep some troops currently in the north west and in kabul from moving to regional commandsouth without prior approval from their respective nations capitals the united states takes advantage of every opportunity to urge allies to lift these re strictions 14 operations within the primary operational area for us forces regional command east operational tempo and the ability to extend th reach of

outposts and forward operating bases along known insurgent routes nd support areas this expanded isaf and ansf presence probably contributed to the increase in enemy attacks from 2006 to 2007 141 civilian casualties the increase in civilian casualties is largely due to shift in insurgent focus to operations in populated areas and the use of indiscriminant asymmetric attacks series of wellpublicized events during the spring and summer of 2007 high lighted the negative consequences of civilian casualties caused by combat operations in afgha nistan the willingness of the afghan populace to support international forces and the giroa is directly proportional to their trust and confidence in those forces the support of th afghan people is essential to the security

21287 11845 15790 and 9671 the yeartodate reenlistment average in th fielded ana is 50 percent for soldiers and 56 percent for ncos factors that challenge reenlistment include the desire for larger salaries better leadership and to be stationed closer to family in february 2008 the ana had an 84 percent absentee rate this is down from 12 percent at the height of summer the three corp s most consistently in contact with insurgents and antigovernment elements had the highest aw ol rates but on average they experienced less than 10 percent awol over the past year th is decrease in awol rates has contributed directly to an increase of 20000 in ana endstre ngth since january 2007 this increase in end strength coupled with deliberate effort to st aff combat units fully and overfill entrylevel soldier authorizations should fu rther mitigate problems of absenteeism during the past year overall awol rates in ana combat forces have decreased three percent as compared to the previous

battalio nssquadrons and three brigade hq that are still not formed or reporting an overall assessment of the ana officer corps effectiveness from the kandak to corps level is positive and ana officers continue to work to improve their professionalism national illiteracy rates remain high but the members of the officer corp s are required to have basic reading and writing abilities and plans are bein g made to improve the education level of the officer corps overall officers are proficient at the tactical level though not yet fully mature in operational and strategic concepts the majority of the officers and most importantly the very senior officers believe in the concept of national military they are starting to use the military decisionmaking process and to provide information and decision briefs to their superiors the chain of command works well when exercised and there is strict adherence to direction from higher ranks although there is credible reporting on estimated numbers or percentages of insurgents infiltrating the ana th ere are multiple reports of insurg ent intent to do so as well as occasional reports of ana personne l collaborating with andor ssisting insurgents these reports usually mention ana personnel providing in surgents with information and supplies or collaborating with insurgent operations however we assess that these isolated reports of collaboration are often the result of insurgen t threats and intimidation against ana members in highthreat regions or criminal economic ventur on the part of ana members as opposed to actual insurgent penetrati on of the organization there have been two in cidents of ana soldiers shooting us soldiers both ana soldiers involved in these incidents had reportedly been influenced by insurgents while home on leave but we assess that these cases were probably more opportunistic in nature than contrived attempts at infiltration we are also aware of several ana members who are reportedly under investigation by afghan authorities for being hostile agents 21unclassified however we have indications that these auth orities have established proof of guilt although we are certain that there are cases of successful insurgent infiltration of ana units we assess that the current level of ana infiltra tion is not operati onally significant the current assigned strength of the ana as of february 2008 stood at just over 49000 personnel across 63 kandaks and three commando kandaks with planned expansion of one kandak roughly 600 personnel every month this population allows two of the five corps to field nearly all of their subordinate units and join their international partners in some of the most contentious areas of rc east and south after gaining experience in partnered us operations the 201st and 203rd corps have taken the lead and are now capable of independent operations at the company level fifty percent of the kandaks in these corps maintain steady state operations independently and plan future operations last fall the 203rd corps staff increased capacity sufficiently to plan and execute brigade level operation with us and other international forces in supporting role the 201 st and 203rd corps engineers conducted bridging operations with international engineer units repairing and replacing bridges through the summer and fall allowing greater development in those areas the ana ve started basic explosive ordnance disposal and counter ied training expanding their capabil ity to counteract one of the enemys most important weapons against the ansf the afghanistan national military command center is able to host weekly video teleconferences vtcs with its corps across the country w ith newly installed communications equipment this is

comm ittee meetingsactively coordinating ana anp and national directorate for security nds opera tions with the international forces these meetings allow for common intelligence nd operational picture among the anp ana and nds which facilitates shared goals and objectives in developing stable security environment the 201st corps commander has effectively organized provincial governor meetings within his three brigade zones complementing security efforts with local governance and development efforts the ana commando program continues to advance the first kandaks demonstrate great resolve under fire capacit for tactical patience and the capability for precision operations well above their conve ntional counterparts the 201st corps commando kandak continues to make progress toward autonomous companylevel operations they have conducted six different missions as part of larger ana and isaf operations nonotice operation with other us and isaf special forces and an independent company level operation the 203rd commando kandak conducted its first combat operation in december 2007 ana air corps anaac capacity and capab ilities also grew in 2007 they are now executing resupply

earned recogniti on and is credited with saving more than 1200 lives by performing flood relief missi ons the relief missions built the anaacs confidence in its own abilities as well as the co

result of yearlong mentorship between task force tf pegasus and the anaac in january 2008 the anaac conducted medical evacuation test of concept that will further build capacity to conduct independent operations this operation allowed the anaac to move patients from craig military hospital 22unclassified at bagram airfield to the ana national milita ry hospital in kabul and proved the anaac to be an independent and strong partner for inte rnational forces during medical evacuations 154 afghan national police anp anp capabilities still lag behind those of the ana the current anp force has not been sufficiently reformed or developed to level at which it can adequately perform its security and policing mission generally police development has been hindered by lack of institutional reform corruption insufficient trainers and adviso rs and lack of unity of effort within the international community recentl cstca in coordination with the giroa the department of state and other internationa l partners implemented the focu sed district development fdd initiative enabling concentrated effort to reform the afghan uniform police full implementation of the fdd program under the

collective training all reports on this new national police force have indicated solid performance in operations to dismantle illegal checkpoints seize illegal wea pons and retake lost districts in the locations where ancop has deployed it has successfully conducted counterinsurgency operations and secured the trust and confidence of the people the abp provides broad law enforcement capabili ties at borders and entry points to deter the illegal entry of people and material as well as other criminal activity the abp has been challenged by the fact that they have received th least attent ion funding and training this has caused them to lag behind their aup counterparts they are currently manned at levels below 50 percent in ma ny areas are poorly equipped and under resourced however efforts to build the forc and to fill available training slots during fdd will continue to build the abp albeit at slower rate than the aup the majority of the abp facilities along the border is run

will be reassessed to determine if additional police forces are required currently lack of trainers and mentors preclud the acceleration or xpansion of reform and mentoring efforts through the fdd current reform and mentoring fforts are principally focused on the aup the aup are closest to the population and are therefore the most immediate face of the afghan government 1542 anp training and

established by the mini stry of the interior unlike the ana police forces are not fielded as units all policemen must be trained as individuals the objective for anp training is minimum of initial entry training iet for all new recruits when training capacity meets demand it may be possible to tie police pay to training thereby adding incentive for immediate training attendance current training capacity cannot meet demand and many untrained policemen remain in the force efforts to expand the training capac ity to meet demand should make it feasible to require iet for all police recruits in

pmts mentor team staffed with civilian police advisors to each aup police district each provincial and regional headquarters each abp company and battalion and each ancop company and battalion however

function and their efforts are tailored to develop skills capacity and professionalism in these areas the final element of every pmt is security force the majority of formal training should be provided under the guidance of qualified civilian police advisors at one of the eight training centers however due to the security s ituation police training is most often provided by military personnel with civilian or military police experience there is area of afghanistan that permits independent mentorship by civilian police or very small pmts mentoring of the anp must occur locally in

mentoring pr ovided through fdd will build the aup as reformed service loyal to the afghan people nd afghan national interests as the primary government interface with the afghan people an eff ective aup is critical to the extension of the rule of law and to building tr ust in the institution of the police among the general populace accordingly fdd concentrates resources on the di strictlevel aup reformed more effective police force that can improve security in an area can facilitate the realization of other desired outcomes the first part of the fdd process is an asse ssment of the district by district assessment and reform team composed of pmt several representatives of th moi and other afghan government ministries and in some cases other international partners especially canada and the united kingdom this assessment leads to sele ction and vetting of ne w leaders as required recruiting to authorized levels and building of equipment inventories as well as assessments of facilities status of the rule of law the district polices relationship with the local leaders and 25unclassified overall professional effectiveness once the assessment is complete an ancop unit is deployed to the district to relieve the local aup forces the aup forces then report to the rtcs to begin eight weeks of reconstitution this reconstitution period includes three different levels of training ie new

ethics reinforcement th aup participating in the rtc training programs receive daily mentorship from pmts the pmt remains with the reformed police after the eight week recons titution phase to continue collec tive training and mentoring in the district ensuring the police put into practice the key indivi dual and collective competencies as well as the ethical standards learned during tr aining at the rtc at the conclusion of this phase which is proficiencydriven rather than timedriven the distri ct is validated as reformed police force using the same objective assessmen t checklist that was used in the preliminary assessment phase six cycles of fdd are planned for completi on in 2008 the first cycle which began in seven districts in late 2007 is nearing completion w ith district anp reinsert ed in their districts and undergoing intensive mentoring the second cycl of fdd is midcourse in five districts with district anp undergoing reconstitution at th regional training centers the third cycle being implemented in nine districts is in the initial assessment phase current challenges facing the fdd program are shortage of pmts shortage of trained ancop units currently growing program limite d capacity at the rtcs in some cases lack of provincial governor support due to the perceived loss of power as the aup become loyal to the nation and the potential loss of source of revenue for the governor and integration of other aspects of rule of law and governance reform we anticipate that over the course of 2008 these challenges will lessen with the training of ad ditional ancop units the construction of the national police training center and the ability of fddreformed districts to strengthen ties with district governance and populations the fdd initiative is linked and complementary to ongoing isaf operations and will center on the eastern and southern regions that have experience d increased instability due to antigovernment elements it is aimed at focusing limited resources to maximize the overall development of the aup ultimately creating commun ities able to sustain st ability in the long term popular perception of the fdd program particularly in t hose districts where it is being implemented is favorable and the national gove rnment views the fdd initiative as catalyst for similar programs which might benef it other governmental branches cstca

retention the accession process for the anp mirrors th process described above in the ana section minus the additional step of name ci rculation implemented by the ana anp forces have been difficult to man and sustain current ly usg is examining options for pay incentives to boost anp recruitment and retention 26unclassified from march 24 2007 through march 2 2008 the nationwide recruiting numbers for all police programs was 17474 4795 abp 1414 ancop and 11265 aup and specialty police recruiting efforts are the critical lynchpin to the efforts to build and sustain viable and resourced national police force the ministry of interior has been ge nerally successful in obtaining the required number of personnel to keep the growth in police on an upward trend however some critical actions must be taken to preserve the forces on hand and to prepare for replacing expected losses the first area for improvement is recruiting staff within the moi the giroa should ensure that appropriate recruiti ng personnel are authorized and trai ned due to shortage of recruiters the efforts to recruit personnel to date have been successful though not as expedient as desired additionally dispersing recruiters to regional and provincial locations enables the police to fill upcoming losses quicker by reducing recruiter travel time and utilizing their familiarity with the area ma ny international force commanders have requested recruiting officers at the provincial level w ho can travel with them to area s where the village elders have committed to provide men for the police forces due to the shortage of recruiters these offers usually go unmet by the moi recruiting departme nt because the vetting and recruiting team cannot focus on multiple areas simultaneously on successful program utilized in the central zone has been the utilization of assigned police personnel officers at the unit level to assist in the recruitment process these officers both know th area and the elders nd village leaders who bring forward their best personnel to serve their count ry in the anp similarly the moi must capitalize on the effo rts that international forces have made towards building relationships with the local elders and tribal leaders successful recruiting effort in nation led by patriarchs will work only if tribal leaders are included in the process if these leaders submit their own candidates for the police forces they are staking their reputation alongside that of the future officer in afghanistan tribal affiliations still play more important role than loyalty to the nation the tribal elders certification of prospective police officer almost guarantees their viab ility as an asset while recruiting the right personne l for the national police force is crucial to its success retention is equally critical one of the first steps towards retaining the police officers that have been recruited is completion of functional personnel management system that can track personnel assignments and completion of service co mmitments additionall police officers are given incentives to stay on the force when th eir commitment is complete possible solutions could include reenlistment bonuses and combat incentive pay for those serving in high threat areas the ministry of defe nse has employed incentives for the ana and has seen tremendous increases in the retention of their soldiers upon rmination of enlistment contracts some of the incentives include relocation of family incr eased salary or promotion and professional schooling it is hoped that programs such as thes when implemented will lead to an overall increase in the professionalism of those who serve in the police forces another issue that continues to plague the anp and challenge recruiting and retention is pay corruption cash payment of salaries leaves ample opportunity for corruption the implementation of electronic funds transfer to the anp will limit the amount of handtohand money transfers that must occur in order to implement this pr ogram some districts near major population centers are bringing in automated teller machines atms that are linked into the afghan banking systems payment of salaries in full and on time significantly reduces pay corruption and improves the morale of anp fficers as the spre ad of atms and banks continues across the country the lack of adequa commercial or generator power maintenance 27unclassified will hinder continued progress highlighting the cr itical need for additional police to prevent attacks on the power system recruiting for the ancop is done through instit utionallevel recruiti ng by the moi in the context of initial moi reform senior level moi officials unde rgoing rank reform have been vetted by unama and the state department the mois recent success in recruiting and vetting wellqualified candidates for ancop presents s ound model for the recruitment and vetting of all anp individuals vetting for regular anp recruits is still done on an adhoc group basis in the case of ancop recruits are so licited through selfinitiative ra ther than local nomination masse as such the individuals applying for ancop training classes are those with the personal drive and initiative to qualify for entry into the institu tion ancop recruits are vetted individually through the nationa l directorate of security nd the mois counterterrorism division and their citizenship and health record s are verified finally two local community representatives are require d to attest to their suitability for the anp several similar checks will be applied to aup officers in districts undergoing the new fdd program including candidate approval by cal elder the district police chief and senior representative from the moi upon arriva l at an rtc for fdd training all aup officers are then vetted once again by regional police r ecruiter during the c ourse of the eightweek fdd training us civilian police mentors monitor ll trainees and identify those that need to be removed from the class police officers that fa il to graduate from the fdd course are removed from the police force although vetting of officerl evel recruits is systematic vetting at the basic recruit level would benefit from more thorough process this deficiency is the result of number of factors including the need to recruit new trainees in relatively short timespan because afghanistan national police office rs can leave at any time unlike their counterparts in the afghan nationa l army there are numbers fo r absentee or awol rates for the anp furthermore the lack of pmts in th field preclude effective monitoring of force levels in the field 1545 anp salary and pay implementing pay equity between the ana and anp will contribute to

across regions and levels of government there is cause and effect relationship between good governance and security in areas in which capable giroa officials exercise the full scope of the duties and pow ers of their appointed office the population turns to the government for answers to their problems the inverse is true for weak or ineffective leaders or in areas where lack of security does not

authorities as well as judges have minimal trai ning and little or acces s to published law often basing their judgments on their personal understanding of sharia law trib codes of honor or local custom judges and prosecut ors with jurisdiction over the districts often reside in the provincial capital the lack of trained and qua lified judicial personnel hinders the courts and results in very

afghan prisons are decrepit severely overcrowded unsanitary and fall well short of international standards many prisons hold more than twice th eir planned capacity at the local and municipal levels there are still functional standardized criminal justice procedures in place in af ghanistan because the focus of establishing the rule of law has been primarily on the provincial and national vels once suspected criminal has been arrested the subsequent process is inconsistent and illdefined the arrest of suspect for any offense requires viable form of detention but jails and prisons ar overcrowded and under equipped viable and complete investigation is dependen t on having trained capable and honest investigators as well as forensic sp ecialists although the police manning document authorizes specialists in each province the trai ning and availability of these personnel vary pending the outcome of the investigation the individual is either released or the case is referred 33unclassified to the system of justice that takes precedence in that area usually sharia or tribal law in the absence of viable criminal justice system these nonconstitutio nal legal mechanisms fill gap and are somewhat effective in deterring crimin ality and dispensing justice though they often violate the rights of women and minorities as the rule of law in afghanistan matures standardized procedures for the prosecution of all serious crimes must be established throughout the country at the provincial regional and national levels at present there is reliable data to estima the cost of

the legitimacy of the giroa insufficient analytical work has been completed to give the exact scope and extent of corruption in afghanistan some analysis c onducted by the members of the donor community and the afghan government as well as anecdotal ev idence suggest that afghanistans sources of corruption are composed of both typi cal sources of corruptio n as well as corrupt ion that is unique to afghanistan the sources and forms of corruption include i low public sector salaries nd unqualified public officials discretionary power of public administration weak legal legislative and regulatory frameworks weak or nonexisting mechanisms and systems for public scrutiny dysfunctional justice sector and insufficient law enforcement the narcoeconomy fraudulent ngos that are actual ly forprofit businesses limited oversight of the cen tral government over the s ubnational administration 38unclassified an unprecedented amount of international assistance corruption in the management of natural resources political social and economic uncertainty and tribal and regional lead ers outside the central governments control advancement to higher positions in some governme nt agencies is often tied to bribes and influence this limits the advancement of those who can not afford to pay for it and creates perception of unfairness and inequality by those who see corrupt officials advance while their position remains unchanged for years at time anticorruption efforts in afghanistan have be the focus of much discussion at recent meetings of the us embassys special comm ittee for the rule of law scrol examples abound of corrupt public officials who are imm une from prosecution judges and prosecutors whose discretion is subject to influence and pol ice who not only refuse to take action to stem corruption but also engage in co rrupt activities themselves it should be noted that what is perceived as corruption in need of correction by western standards may simply be indicative of the way afghan society operates the real issue is not whether corruption exists but whether the amount of corruption that does exist has reached the point where it undermines the legitimacy of the afghan government 251 anticorruption efforts the primary focus of anticorruption efforts has been the removal of corrupt government officials from public service this process however has been significantly hampered by afghan law the afghan civil service system does not contain mechanism for the administrative removal of civil servants there are only two wa ys that civil servant can be removed from office the first method involve s direct removal by the presiden t of afghanistan the second method is via criminal conviction the em ployee must be found guilty of misconduct by an afghan court the authorized punishment for the offense must include dismissal and the court must determine that dismissal is in fact warrant ed cstca is currently working with the moi on redrafting the personnel regulation that govern s moi employees specifically the anp these efforts are aimed at empowering lowerlevel officials to make removal decisions while providing sufficient administrative due process to the employ ee subject to termination the creation of an administrative separation mechanism will dramatically speed the process of removing corrupt government officials unfortunately implementing th is new process is likely to take at least two years once adopted these laws will serve as model for reforming the remainder of afghanistans personnel laws anticorruption effo rts for

level judicial corruption remains endemic in af ghanistan since his appointment to the supreme court in august 2006 chief justice abdul salam azimi has made cleaning up the courts his top priority working with usaid he has instituted an aggressive twopronged approach to reduce the level of co rruption in the courts and to raise the level of public trust and confidence in the judiciary the

governance at the provincial district and municipal levels is the independent direct orate for local governance idlg president karzai issued decree on august 30 2007 blishing the idlg as focal point for governance policy under his presid ency and new home for the mois dysfunctional civil administration division the idlg oversees provincial governors district governors provincial councils and municipalities except kabul the idlg has established specific assessment criteria for selecting and evaluating di strict and provincial gove rnors those criteria include loyalty to the presiden t and the constitution freedom from corruption good management and leadership skills success in working w ith the international community and good public outreach this codification of core values required for the selection and evaluation of provincial governors and subgovernors represen ts step towards establishing standards to which current and future governors will have to adhere using the established criteria the idlg has removed and replaced many provincial governors in the past six months with few exceptions these changes have resulted in more effective gove rnors and by extension improvements in overall governance the longterm effect of these chan ges cannot yet be precisely determined but the outlook is very positive the im petus behind this approach is in keeping with the idlgs mandate of providing good governance by tablishing and strengthening government institutions at the subnational vels to achieve open transparent particip ative accountable and effective governance structures that are ba sed on consensus and rule of law recently the idlg targeted six governors for replacement or reassignment the idlg recently played pivotal role in the replacemen t of the governor of ghazni province due to consistently poor performance conversely the idlg capitalizes on the strengths of top performing governors by reassigning them to provin ces that are in need of sound leadership and management case in point was the recent relocation of the laghman governor to helmand province 41unclassified the idlg staff frequently travel to each of the 34 provinces to monitor the performance of provincial governors and district governors the idlg uses this visibility and awareness to appoint capable and respected memb ers of the community to village and district shuras that serve to link the village community to the government to this end the idlg has effectively spearheaded several districtlevel shuras aimed at promoting the capacity of local governance the idlg also participates in frequent working group meetings that bring t ogether various stakeholdersministries agencies international organizations and embassy officials to discuss governance challenges and soluti ons in collaboration with id lg usaid through the local governance and community development lgcd program is strengthening the capacity of provincial and district level offi

completion of provincial development plans pdps after less than three months effort through aggressive interaction with the provincial development committees and elected provincial councils ever province now possesses an initial pdp much work remains to expand the pdps into co mprehensive actionable documents but progress has been remarkable on the anticorruption front the idlg recently signaled its intent to foster public sector accountability when it filed suit with the attorn ey generals office against six nonperforming firms that were contracted under the afghan st abilization program to construct government facilities eight additional companies are expect ed to face prosecution in the short term with technical assistance and support from growi ng consortium of donors including usaid key idlg leaders are implementing measures aimed at advancing the mandate of the giroa as it relates to the promotion of good governance ru of law and anticor ruption initiatives as part of its mandate the idlg has establis hed other short and long term goals aimed at achieving the following ensuring that afghan women enjoy greater equity in education politic participation and justice elimination of discrimination against women and promotion of their involvement in leadership activities ensuring participation of the peopl at all levels of government promotion and advancement of security improving the performance of service delivery institutions at the provincial district and village levels and fighting public and private sect or corruption to improve the effectiveness transparency and accountability of government thus cr eating the conditions for investment 28 key measures of political stability progress in government effectiveness is one of the most difficult areas to measure most indicators are subjective in nature primarily because they require measurement of human capacity leadership and effectiv eness although public perception surveys provide quantifiable insight into government effectiven ess as it relates to the population other qua ntifiable indicators can cause an inaccurate assessment of overall govern ment effectiveness as they fail to consider the inherent qualitative nature of leadership 42unclassified any subjective measurement of governance sh ould include the population acceptance of government authority government capability to provide for andor protect the population effectiveness and use of the judicial system to resolve disputes and th level and effect of corruption though down from high of 83 per cent in 2005 63 percen t of afghans polled approved of president karzais leadership in 200 7 point of concern is afghans perception of corruption as major problem for the country 25 percent of afghans believed that corruption was the biggest problem facing their country down slightly from 27 percent in 2006 but large increase over previous years objective measures of the governments instit utional effectiveness vary across ministries and organizations according to the outcome they are charged with accomplishing for example the ministry of finances eff ectiveness could be measured by the populations tax compliance rate the governments tax revenue as percentage of gdp or the governments budget execution and disbursement rates the ministry of refugees effectiveness could be measured by the number of refugees succe ssfully resettled the ministry of educations effectiveness could be measured by the number of schools built teachers hired students enrolled or students graduated unfortunately afghanistan is datapoor environment and it is difficult to create comprehensive or systematic picture of the quality of institutional performance in the afghan government most ministries do not track their own performance make data widely available or keep accurate statistics the lack of solid baseline of data continues to hamper reconstruction efforts better in formation statistical analysis nd intelligence will help create clearer picture of afghan governan ce in the future we aim to make improvements in data collection key part of continuing capacity development programs difficulties persist in implementing reform at both central and provincial levels improving subnational capabilities remains an ssential component of continued progress success in the fight against

some rural provinces and districts 53unclassified defining unemployment is difficult in afghani stan as many afghans are employed on temporary basis in the informal eco nomy or on seasonal basis during the agricultural harvest regardless of the actual unemployment rate the increase in international support activity since 2001 combined with the exponential growth of afghanowned businesses has created more jobs this growth has been consistent even though the number of unem ployed is still high though an accurate prediction of unemployment numbers may not be possible until the completion of the next afghan census unemploymen t indicators remain cause for concern 332 poverty levels poverty remains significant problem for afgha nistan according to broad estimates of afghanistans national income and population per capita income is about 300 this makes afghanistan one of the poorest nations in the world despite recent economic growth given the overall low level of national income it is difficult to establish poverty measures in afghanistan however the latest surveys of the national risk and vulnerability assessment nrva conducted in spring 2007 show ed that approximately 50 percent of the afghan population lives below the poverty line an additional 20 percent of the population is concentrated close to the poverty line and is at ri sk of falling into poverty the impact of rising diesel fuel prices and the doubling of wheat prices may be driving some of these families below the poverty line poverty may be even hi gher among rural and nomadic populations the latest poverty analyses identify the ex istence of large number of working poor in afghanistan low salaries place many who are employed at risk of falling below the poverty line including government employees the anal ysis also showed th at poverty was unevenly spread throughout afghanistan the poverty rates of provinces vary from around 10 percent in some provinces to more than 70 percent in othe rs poverty is more severe in the northeast central highland and parts of the southeast despite significant increas in public spending in key sectors to support poverty re duction scarce domestic resour ces and limited international assistance resulted in only limited as sistance to the poorest of the poor the afghan government and its internationa l partners are committed to address the problem of widespread poverty poverty research was vital part of the overall development of the ands to improve poverty data the central statistics office and th ministry of rural rehabilitation and development mrrd launc hed two national risk and vulnerability assessments in 2003 and 2005 approximately 45000 households from across the country were interviewed this research d to the preparation of comprehensive poverty analysis in 2007 which has been used as basis for drafting th ands poverty profile and formulating the ands poverty reduction policies the ands will also serve as afghanistans

to terrorism in the last 18 months finally approximately 30000 to 40000 students graduate from high school every year but only one third are admitted to universities due to lack of university capacity in accordance with the ands the afghan government intends to guarantee access to primary education for all children by the year 2020 and provide for mo st to attend secondary school access to higher education will be readily available and th government will ensure that 56unclassified university graduates have realistic hope of obt aining jobs to achieve these goals the united states and the international community must tinue to support the ong oing development of the comprehensive national educational system this effort requires constructing or rehabilitating schools upgrading

this comprehensive plan for national education system in turn will directly contribu to the longterm sustainable growth of the afghan economy and hence an improved way of life for the afghan people 34 economic development outlook the giroa continues to make slow but meas urable progress in the area of economic development afghanistan has met most of the targets on monetary and fiscal policy under its international monetary fund imf economic pr ogram but it has fallen short on benchmarks related to structural reforms the national budget process has improved significantly as noted by the imf in its latest assessment and the gover nment adheres to strict fiscal policy of borrowing and overdrafts with the banking system incremental improvements have been made in raising government revenue from customs duties and other sources and budget deficit targets were met in the current fis cal year march 21 2007 though march 20 2008 the giroas challenges include increasing revenue controlling the afghani exchange value and increasing ministry capacity to plan and implement development programs afghanistan continues to have one of the world s lowest domestic reve nue to gdp ratios at about 8 percent the afghani appreciated in re terms against the us dollar in 200406 owing in part to large aid inflows and drugrelated financial flows in the first seven months of this fiscal year however the afghani remained steady despite rising infl ation the concern is that an overly strong afghani could inhibi t the growth of domestic industrial base and the employment it would bring by encouraging im ports and discouraging exports 57unclassified 40374585595273068399 00102030405060708090100 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006us billionsafghanistan gross domestic product licit only smallest gdp for us state is

year which ended on march 20 2008 gd p per capita has increased by around 53 percent in the last five years and grew from around us200 to around us306 inflation declined to five percent in 2007 but rose to double digits in 2008 owing mainly to sharp increases in the prices of imported fuel nd foodstuffs some of th is inflation is tied to instability in pakistan as well as pakistans increased dependency on imports in 2007 and early 2008 pakistan is usually rge exporter of basics food nd fuel to afghanistan but pakistans difficulties in meeting internal dema nds due to drought significantly affected the afghan economy the underlying tr ends however signal that domestic inflationary pressures are being contained confidence in the domestic currency which has remained broadly stable against the us dollar has been instrumental due largely to sound monetary policy according to the imf the afghan economy has grown by an average of 114 percent per year in real terms since 2002 albeit from sma ll base this strong growth can be attributed largely to reconstruction efforts fuelled by development assistance as well as to recovering agriculture sector in 20062007 real economic growth was at an estimated 75 percent weaker than recent averages the slowdown was the re sult of return to drought conditions which caused agricultural production to dr op considerably that year ther has been better weather to date through 20072008 and agriculture is expected to rebound due to increased agricultural output the imf projects that economic growth in afghanistan will rise to 13 percent in 2007 2008 but it expects gdp to begin to normali ze and fall to around 9 percent in 20082009 major challenge for the giroa is progress toward fiscal sustainability while the giroa has increased it revenue collection it cannot keep pace with increased expenditures largely driven by the security sector increasi ng the number of ansf and sufficient pay is 58unclassified clearly important for security but it has fiscal implications for the giroa which will eventually have to pick up those substantial costs it is estimated that the giroa will roughly cover less than 20 percent of its total r ecurrent expenditures including the core and external budgets in 20082009 furthermore the giroa has now begun to experience difficulty meeting its annual revenue target due in part to politic interference and

progress to date although there has been some limited progress in the fight against narcotics afghanistan remains the leading producer of opium in the wo rld while many provinces have seen success in reducing poppy cultivation 12 of 34 provinces had more than 50 percent decrease from 2006 to 2007 and the number of provinces that did t cultivate poppy rose from 6 in 2006 to 13 in 2007 four provinces experienced significant incr ease in cultivation helmand in the south farah and nimroz in the west and nangarhar in the east each saw an increase of more than 4000 hectares from 2006 to 2007 helmand alone now accounts for 53 percent of the total poppy growth in afghanistan one of the foremost problems is the lack of comprehensive cn strategy among afghanistan and its regional and international ne ighbors especially pakistan with growing evidence of link between the insurgency and the na rcotics trade it is becoming increasingly apparent that security in afghanistan is directly tied to counternarcotics efforts another major issue that requi res resolution is the lack of coordination between the mod and moi the current framework leads to compartmentalization of responsibility between these ministries the cnik is an example of improvement the mod initially opposed the augmentation of the cnpa with ana forces ma inly due to the potential risks posed by association with counter narcotics operations in early 2008 the mod changed its position and the cnik went into development however the issues that still need to be worked out are officer training for the cnik memorandum of understanding with moi on equipment loans and shared logistics during opera tions and joint coordination and mission planning between the ministries 68unclassified 452 impact of counternarcotics on the counterinsurgency mission us forces provide support to cn law forcement operations within the scope of current rules of engagement applicable law and regulation and within th limits of their means and capabilities use of limited forces in afghanistan is zerosum endeavor shift in force application from one mission set to another comes with cost of reduction of available forces for the former mission set shift of limited ssets may result in degradation of the counter terrorism mission intelligence sharing limited l ogistical support and inextremis rescue and medical evacuation are currently being provided by us and international forces towards the cn mission additional resources targeted to the cn mission would be needed to expand direct dod support to counternarcotics operations sim ilarly changes in rules of engagement and national law would also be required the cn mission affects the counterinsurgenc and counterterrorism missions in another way it is likely that counternarc otics operations have in some areas enabled insurgents to make common cause with farmers against the afghan government and isaf insurgents can set up protection racket exchanging prot ection against eradication forc for support supplies and equipment from locals 453 potential improvements the impact of building giroa cn operational capacity complements the dods primary mission of ct and counterinsurgency in afghanist an there is clear nexus between narcotics and the insurgency in afghanistan that threaten s us gains in afghanistan and the region the narcotics trade has strong links with the anti government insurgency most commonly associated with the taliban narcotics traffickers provide revenue and arms to the taliban while the taliban provides protection to growers and traffi ckers and keeps the government from interfering with their activities by enabling the giroa to confront drug traffick ing organizations we positively impact the effort

following the first regional economic cooperation conference in december 2005 limited regional cooperation sections have been established within the admini strative structures of some afghan

group for regional cooperation within the framework of the ands has helped create platform s of dialogue and interaction betw een different stakeholders on regional cooperation however there is very little discussion or lively debate on regional cooperation in the afghan media and hence little public awareness of the subject for the most part progress has been limited in achieving visi ble and

influence numerous iranian companies continue to expa nd their presence in afghanistan employing large numbers of afghans there is evidence that the insurgency in af ghanistan has been provided with lethal aid originating in iran since at least 2006 it is unclear what role and at what level the iranian government plays in providing this assistance at present th lethal support that has been provided to the insurgency in afghanistan has not proven militarily significant analysis of interdicted weaponry ordnance and explosively formed penetr ators efps in afghanistan indicate that the taliban has access to iranian weaponry produced as recently as 2006 and 2007 we monitor and take seriously any ch assistance to the insurgency iran will continue to pr otect its stated national interest s and there remains potential for disagreement between afghanistan and iran an example of potential source of conflict is watersharing rights which could be affect ed by current afghan dam projects forced expulsions of afghan refugees and undocumented economic grants within its borders challenge the afghan governments ability to sure the wellbeing of its citizens further deportations of
