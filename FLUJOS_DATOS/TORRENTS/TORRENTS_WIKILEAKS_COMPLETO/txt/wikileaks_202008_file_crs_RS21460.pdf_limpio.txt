for construction completed in fy2003 some of noaa stakeholders have cautione d that the presidents estimated fy2003 funding figures should not be used to co mpare with the fy2004 request that budget

190 million for noaa as compared with the fy2003 budget request however the increase beco mes far less when compared with either fy2003 congressional ppropriations 132 million or the fy2002 enacted budget 70 million many of noaas constituents ve urged congress to consider fy2002 appropriations as baseline for comp arison with the fy2004 budget to assess how noaa programs might fare also of concern for many who may bene fit from noaa programs and services just as in the presidents fy2003 request the fy 2004 request contains number of personnel related mandatory funding ob ligations to be scored against noaas budget rather than opms consequently many of noaas constituents have become apprehensive about the possibility of reduced discretiona ry budget authority for the agency
