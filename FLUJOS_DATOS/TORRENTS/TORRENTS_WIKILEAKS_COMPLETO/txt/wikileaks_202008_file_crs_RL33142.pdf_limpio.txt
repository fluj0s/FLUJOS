changes have occu rred since libya became independent in 1951 these changes have been fueled by the countrys emergence from italian colonization the discovery of vast oil nd natural gas reserves and the domination of political life by the authoritarian government of muammar qadhafi2 who overthrew the libyan monarchy on septem ber 1 1969 the legacies of antiitalian insurgency and world war ii

using his military title and identifying himself with formal government position although he retains fa cto control over libyas affairs he is now commonly referred to as the guide of the revolution or brother leaderthe qadhafi era on september 1 1969 cabal of libyan military officers led by army captain muammar qadhafi seized important government institutions in the eastern city of benghazi and abolished the libyan monarchy facing negligible internal resistance the leadership of the movement know n as the revolutionary command council rcc established authority and announced th at it would direct the activities of new cabinet the rcc also made statements affirming libyas arab and islamic identity and its support for th palestinian people afte r renaming the country the libyan arab republic the rcc announced the promotion of captain qadhafi to colonel and named him commander in chief of libyas armed forces3 like qadhafi the other members of the rcc were panarabist and socialist ideologues from rural and somewhat marginalized communities the united states did not oppose the 1969 coup as the rcc initially presented an antisoviet and reformist platform colonel qadhafi and the rcc focused intensely in their early years in power on taking steps to safeguard national indepe ndence and consolidate their rule through populist and nationalist political and economic programs the members of the rcc were determined to secure the immediate and full withdrawal of british and us forces from military bases in libya wh ich occurred on march 28 and june 11 1970 respectively italian expatriates were expelled and their assets were confiscated on october 7 1970 all three date s subsequently were declar ed national holidays the new government also pressu red us and other foreign oil companies to renegotiate oil production contracts and cede larger share of production revenues some british and us oil operations eventually were nationalized in the early 1970s the rcc gradually reversed its stance on its initially icy relationship with the soviet union and extended libyan support to revol utionary antiwestern and antiisraeli movements across africa europe asia and the middle east these policies contributed to rapid souring of us libyan political relations although economic relations particularly u s oil purchases from libya remained steady the green book and qadhafis ideology beginning in the early1970s muammar qadhafi and his regime carried out drastic and frequent reorganizations of libyan political and economic life in line with his third universal theory the theory which blends pan arab islamic and socialis t values is enshrined in qadhafis three volume green book the redistribution of land and wealth the allocation of fluctuating oil revenues and near total decentralization of political institutions reshaped libyas social landscape in line with qadhafis principles these trends also helped qadhafi and his supporters maintain political control overseas qadhafi promoted his political nd economic third international theory as an alternative to the capitalist and communist systems of the united states and the soviet union for the developing count ries of the third world qadhafis confrontation with the united states was both catalyst for and product of the libyan governments violent and destabilizing activities abroad qadhafis ideological

filing of new cases related to previously filed cases that would otherwise be timebarred as such the provisions could have prove n applicable to libya because libya was previously designated as state

percent of foreign fighters in iraq were libyan the records suggest that many of the libyan nationals traveled from the countrys northeastern coastal region esp ecially from the cities of darnah and

during his long reign in libya in spite of numerous internal and external challenges to his rule he has exercised nearly complete if at times indirect political control over libya over the last thirtyplus years by carefully balancing and manipulating complex patronage networks traditional tribal structures and byzantine layers of national regional and local governance libyas foreign and

could be prosecuted for the ugly crime that he committed in 1986 against the libyan children33 political dynamics libyas often contradictory political dynamics are product of competing interest groups seeking to influence polic within the confines of the countrys authoritarian political system and amid libyas emergence from international isolation elements of muammar qadha fis ideology permeate political discourse on many security and foreign policy issues while in other cases such as economic reform new frameworks are being embraced to meet societys current and changing needs the legacies of colonial occupation and liby as struggle for independence continue to influence libyan politics rhetorical references to preserving sovereignty and resistance to foreign domination are common in

the ottoman empire nd qaramanli dynasty ottoman forces first occupied the coastal regions of the territory that now constitutes libya in the mid16th century however ottoman administrators faced stiff and near constant resistancefrom tribal confederations and rival i ndependent state in the fezzan region all of which limited the ottomans political influence beginning in 1711 semi independent state under turkis h official ahmed qaramanli emerged in tripoli and established control over the ottoman provinces of tripolitania and cyrenaica with fezzan remaining contested the qaramanli family maintained its power and independent rule until the early 19 th century through naval privateers and pirates under its control who were used to collect tribute and ransom from merchant vessels seized in the mediterranean sea the shores of tripoli the qaramanli naval for ces of tripoli formed one component of regional grouping commonly referred to as the barbary pirates which played pivotal role in shaping the foreign and military policies of the young united states beginning in the late 1780s series of confrontations between us merchant ships and naval ra iding parties from tripoli and other neighboring city states such as algiers and tunis led to the destruction of us maritime cargo and the seizure of us hostages subsequent ne gotiations between the united states and the governments of the barbary states conclude d with the signing of some of the first bilateral treaties in us history including us agreements to pay tribute to tripoli in exchange for the safe passage of us vessels off what is now the libyan coast disputes over the terms of this bilate ral agreement and continuing attacks on us merchant ships impressed upon the us government the need for naval protection force to safeguard us commercial activity in the mediterranean this need eventually was satisfied by the creation of the united states navy by congress in april 1798 an attack on the us consul ate in tripoli in 1801 and further attacks on us ships sparked open hostilities between the newly commissioned light naval forces of the united states and the privateer s of tripoli freque nt naval engagements from 1801 to 1805 were often won by us forces but one skirmish in 1804 ended with the grounding of the uss philadelphia and the capture of her crew the conflict culminated in the overland

regional resistance to ottoman reforms and central authority persisted into the 20th century italian annexation and post war uncertainty italy annexed tripolitania and cyrenaica in 1911 and the ottoman empire s subsequent release of its claim to its territory in 1912 marked the beginni ng of violent twentyyear period of resistance to italian rule led by the sanu ssi order and local tribes
