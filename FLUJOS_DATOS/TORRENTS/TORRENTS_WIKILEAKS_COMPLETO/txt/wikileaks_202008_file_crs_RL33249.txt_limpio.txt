the end of fy2003 however under provisions of the rehabilitation act title i of the act was automatically extended for one additional year through fy2004 other programs under the act were extended for one year through fy2004 under provisions of the general education provisions act gepa for fy2005 and fy2006 congress has continued funding for the act through appropriations legislation for the

final action was taken in the 109th congress hr 27 passed by the house on march 2 20056 and s 1021 reported by the senate health education labor and pensions help committee7 would extend authorization of appropriations for the act through fy2011 the rehabilitation act amendments are part of bills that would also reauthorize programs authorized by the workforce investment act wia following are selected provisions of the 109th congress bills vr program funds used to support the workforce investment act wia system the workforce investment act wia enacted in 1998 pl 105220 is intended to consolidate coordinate and improve variety of employment training literacy and vr programs for adults under the oversight of local workforce investment boards8 each board is responsible for developing onestop system intended to provide coordinated and seamless system of employment and training opportunities for individuals the law requires partnerships among programs that provide employment services the federalstate vr program is required partner in the onestop system along with other programs such as vocational education and welfaretowork programs although persons with disabilities may receive services 5 for description of all programs authorized under the act see crs report rl31378 rehabilitation act programs and funding by sidath panangala 6 us congress house of representatives

background on wia see crs report 97536 job training under the workforce investment act wia an overview by ann lordeman for description of wia changes proposed in hr 27 and s 9 see crs report rl32778 workforce investment act of 1998 reauthorization of job training programs by ann lordeman crs3 under the onestop system the federalstate vr program is the primary source of vr services for this group under current provisions of wia and the rehabilitation act there is requirement that vr funds must be used to provide support to wia onestop systems however each required partner must develop memorandum of understanding with local workforce board to determine how operating costs will be funded hr 27 would require that each states governor determine how much of the administrative funds of required onestop partners including state vr agencies could be used to pay part of the infrastructure ie nonpersonnel costs of onestop centers operations this would mean that some of the funds allocated to states for vr services could at the option of the governor be used to contribute toward the states onestop infrastructure system s 1021would require local wia boards and onestop partners to determine how much local partners must contribute toward the onestop system if local areas fail to reach agreement the governor would determine an amount to be contributed by onestop partners from their administrative funds subject to federally prescribed cap the cap would apply to all federal funds allotted to partner program for the federalstate vr program the cap would increase from 075 to 15 over fiveyear period other caps would apply to other partner programs for example for wia programs and the employment service the cap would be 3 and for other programs 15 transition of students with disabilities from school to vocational rehabilitation services under current law state vr plans are required to coordinate with state education officials to facilitate the transition of students with disabilities from school to receipt of vr services state vr and education agencies must develop interagency agreements that at minimum provide for consultation and technical assistance to assist education agencies to plan for transition of students from school to postschool activities describe the financial responsibilities of each agency determine which agency will be the lead agency and provide for student outreach among other things some policymakers have been concerned that not enough coordination exists between educational institutions and the vr program resulting in lack of effective planning for transition of students with disabilities to postschool employment both hr 27 and s 1021 include provisions to expand student transition services for students with disabilities the bills would require that states reserve from title i allotments specific amount of funds for expanded transition services the total amount reserved for transition services for all states would be 50 million in the first year and subsequent years when funds appropriated for title i exceed the fy2004 level by at least 100 million s 1021 would limit administrative costs to implement transition services to 5 of the funds reserved under both bills state agencies would be required to use these funds to facilitate student transition from school to vr services improve student achievement of postschool goals provide them career guidance and exploration and job search assistance and conduct outreach activities s 1021 also would require that students individualized plan crs4 for employment ipe include description of hisher projected postschool employment outcome and the specific transition services needed to achieve the outcome in both bills students are defined as those eligible for vr services eligible and receiving services under the individuals with disabilities education act idea or eligible under section 504 of the rehabilitation act9 hr 27 refers to students age 1621 and s 1021 to students age 1421 appointment of the commissioner of the rehabilitation services administration rsa under current law the commissioner of the rehabilitation services administration rsa is appointed by the president and approved by the senate hr 27 would change this provision to require that the secretary of education rather than the president appoint director of rsa the director would not have to be approved by the senate s 1021 does not include this proposed change coordination of the vr program with ticket to work both title i of the rehabilitation act and the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 pl 10670 ticket program provide rehabilitation services to persons with disabilities state vr agencies provide services directly as well as through other providers approved by the state the ticket program offers vouchers so that individuals may choose rehabilitation services providers from an approved employment network s 1021 includes number of provisions to coordinate vr services with services provided through the ticket program these include requirements that vr agencies inform clients about the ticket program and how to contact ens established under the program and that an individuals ipe include list of services the individual is to receive as part of hisher work plan under the ticket program s 1021 also would require the government accountability office gao to conduct study on the interaction of the title i vr program with the ticket program including the impact of the interaction on beneficiaries rehabilitation programs and state vr agencies the help committee report indicates that the study is intended to assist congress resolve challenges that the two programs face as they attempt to serve similar populations hr 27 does not contain these provisions title i allotment formula title i vr funds are allocated to states according to formula that takes into account state population and per capita income data used to calculate states allotment are updated annually in addition the law requires that title i appropriations be increased by the annual percentage increase in the cpi some states have been concerned that because data used to calculate each states annual allotment percentage are adjusted to account for population changes from year to 9 section 504 prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities by any program or activity that receives federal funding crs5 year they may not receive full benefit of the annual cpi adjustment that is even though states caseload may increase or even remain the same if it loses population compared to other states whose population is growing it may not receive the full cpi increase s 1021 would address this issue in two ways first states that did not receive full cpi would be given first priority to receive any funds that may be available for reallotment to other states some states have unused federal funds at the end of year due to their inability to garner state match for these funds these funds are therefore available for reallotment to other states secondly the bill would require gao to study the relationship between the title i state allotment formula and the ability of states to provide vr services in accordance with state plan requirements the senate help committee report indicates that the study will assist congress to determine what steps can be taken to help resolve funding inequities among state vr agencies hr 27 does not contain these provisions in other legislation related to reallotted funds pl 10982 signed september 30 2005 provides assistance to people with disabilities in states affected by hurricanes katrina and rita the law requires the commissioner of rsa to give priority for reallotted funds to affected states it also allows the commissioner to waive the required nonfederal match for fy2005 for affected states that receive reallotted funds and in the case of louisiana that receive federal funds that were relinquished due to that states inability to meet the required nonfederal matching amount the law also allows affected states to use reallotted funds for vr services to help people with disabilities work in reconstruction or other disaster assistance activities and to pay for vr services for people who do not meet the affected states order of selection criteria which specify the states priorities for how people will be served if the state cannot serve all people with disabilities under their vr programs fy2006 budget request the administration requested 3 billion for rehabilitation act programs for fy2006 an increase of 01 over the fy2005 amount table 1 the request for the title i vr program is 27 billion an increase of 31 which meets the statutory requirement that the program be increased in accordance with the cpi adjustment in addition as part of its overall job training proposals the administration proposed consolidation of certain job training programs under workforce incentive plus consolidation grant program certain programs would form base of the consolidated program and would include adult training the dislocated worker program youth training and the employment service states would be given an option to consolidate the vr program along with other programs under the consolidated grant program states choosing to consolidate programs would submit single state integration plan but would not be allowed to reduce levels for target populations including people with disabilities the administration also proposed to eliminate four programs authorized under the rehabilitation act programs for migrant and seasonal farmworkers recreational activities supported employment state grants and projects with industry crs6 pwi the administration maintains that these programs are now an integral part of the program and therefore longer need separate funding streams to ensure provision of services fy2006 appropriations
