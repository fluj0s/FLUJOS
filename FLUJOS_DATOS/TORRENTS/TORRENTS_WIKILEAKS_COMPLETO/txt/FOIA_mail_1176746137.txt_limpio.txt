from pjonesueaacuk to c g kilsby cgkilsbynewcastleacuk subject re outputs from wg date mon 16 apr 2007 135537 0100 bst cc davidsextonmetofficegovuk phil jones pjonesueaacuk colin harpham charphamueaacuk h j fowler hjfowlernewcastleacuk chris et ill sedn some more thoughts on thursday when back from the egu it is too hot in vienna to sit through too many talks i suspect we need subset of indices the program will calculate all those recommended in various programs one possibility is to keep them all and let users decide we do need to make series of checks though at some stage to make sure they are ok i think youll have some fruitful discussions on some of these on april 24 i hope you can come to closure on few things cheers phil all indices i had session with ukcip last week and we did get on to dicsussing what outputs might come out of wg as well as ddp etc and the issue of indices derived from daily data ie requiring time series came up with the distinct possibility of confusioninconsistency as david mentions i would be happy to produce indices only from wg as long as we can check they are sensible first of course eg heatwave duration various thresholds drought duration various accumulations of rainfall less clear cut might be gale days definition snow days proportion of days above temp threshold etc i think we will need to consider the list in detail as far as what is included stardex list how they are calculatedvalidated and also whether they can be calcualted from some other source and found to be inconsistent eg is it planned to take the 17 rcm runs and analyserelease these indices as well rainfall stats pdfs i think hope lag1ac and skewness will actually be quite well behaved if not realistic even when you convertdownscale the more validationanalysis we do of these fields the better anyway separate topic measures of reliability may be can of worms but i think we need to address it sooner rather than later ukcip02 had subjective measures of reliability attached to different variablespredicted changes we must do better and case in point is the wg where we sidestep the bias issue by using change factors we therefore need to provide some measure per grid square per varaible of reliability for example if control annual rainfall is more than say 10 biased reduce reliability measure and inform the user when generating problem 1 which model runs to use for this check problem 2 how to assess more complex measures eg annual cycle in rainfalltemperature problem 3 need common easily understood scale of reliability furthermore wg procedure introduces more uncertinty eg for wind thoughts cheers chris original message from davidsextonmetofficegovuk mailtodavidsextonmetofficegovuk sent 16 april 2007 0807 to phil jones cc davidsextonmetofficegovuk c g kilsby colin harpham subject re outputs from wg hi we will try for lag1 correlation and skewness but an issue for us is whether something doesnt work when we convert the equilibrium pdfs to timedependent ones or we downscale to 25km as phil has said that you can do all the derived indices except gale days if we could get decision from the project management team to cut those variables from mohc list of outputs without making any extra work for you then that would free up some time for us to investigate this further looking forward to seeing colins results on 24th cheers david on fri 20070413 at 1716 0100 phil jones wrote some more thoughts keep in on the loop in case i get chance to respond from vienna or next thursday phil at 1632 13042007 davidsextonmetofficegovuk wrote hi on fri 20070413 at 1600 0100 c g kilsby wrote phil david briefly and can respond fully next week when i have some more time some crucial points here 1 the one re 90ile of one variable not same as for other variables some simple restrictions need considering before diving off into full joint pdfs etc also another dimension emerges with seasons eg 90ile winter rainfall or 90ile summer rainfall joint pdfs are just an issue for in that i am giving you several inputs to wg and they have to be consistent for example we are finding we only get wetter summers for lower end of temperature increases plus we already intend to provide sets of sampled values for lots of variables that are consistent for any given point in model parameter space the joint pdfs are an issue for the wg as well not so much for chris but for us we have to reproduce the statistics for the other variables colin has solved the double counting issue for the means for t etc but weve yet to look at the variance colin should be able to show some of the results on the 24th as to how well the wg works this fits the wg with our rainfall component to hadrm3 and then applies our modification technique to an a2 future for comparison with the true rcm future for the 2070s sunshine is the only real problem i dont think we need to repeat this with the ns rainfall but discuss that once youve seen some preliminary results on the 24tjh 2 bit concerned to hear david talking of some precip stats being secondary or optional i would say mean var and pdry days are all essential from our experience autocorrelation and skewness are also pretty well behaved and we would rather have them if at all possible good this discussion is throwing up few discrepancies which need clarifying that some precip stats are of secondary importance is an impression i was getting from phils earlier emails last month i think there is some misunderstanding here what i said earlier confirms what chris has said if they are available then chris would like them chris will need to consider is they may be fully relevant due to the scale issue 25km squares vs points could be an issue for skew and r1 checking this out fitting directly to hadrcm3 control data might be useful here see colins plots though before deciding i look forward to the fuller response next week i will be mainly away then which is why i raise these issues now it would be good to have good chat about them on the 24th cheers david cheers chris original message from phil jones mailtopjonesueaacuk sent 13 april 2007 1546

think we have clarified or converged on most of my points i have some comments on points 2 and 4 cheers david on fri 20070413 at 1442 0100 phil jones wrote 2 wg will produce 100 versions of 30yr sequences for all or just one wg variables for all months for given combination of 30yr period emissions scenario and location i am still not clear how to generate the 100 percentiles of pdfs is confusing i think ag needs clear procedure outlined by us for 24th i think the easiest way to make wg consistent with mohc pdfs is the following assuming i am correct so far user selects wg 30yr period emissions scenario and location up to 1000km2 b work out which 25km x 25km box over uk is closest to this multi site location c for the 30yr period emissions scenario and location in b ddp internally produces table of changes in mean t changes in mean p and changes in variance of p for each month for 100 randomly sampled different model variants ddp already needs this capability d so we have an internal matrix with 31236 columns and 100 rows wg loops through 100 rows using each set of 36 numbers to drive wg user gets 100 wgs does what they like with it sort of the 100 versions of the wg i was talking about will all have the same statistics i thought these 100 would be from one point within the pdf or the joint pdf say the 10 50 or 90th percentile we could make this percentile selectable the 100 or 1 or whatever are representative of some future 30year period your and b are fine another option is like yours there is pdf or joint pdf the 100 could be from each of the 100 percentiles does this make sense or the 100 could come from sampling the percentile space assuming normal distribution your 2 is an important aspect to sort out on the 24th i agree that we need to discuss this but it would be good to thrash it out bit more before 24th ukcip08 needs the wg pdf to be consistent with the mohc pdf your solution tries to do this but problem with selecting percentile is that model variant that is the 90th percentile for temperature is not 90th percentile for other variables there is also related issue about how you chose model variant near given percentile the solution i propose means these are not issues so we could sample m model variants and run n wgs for each model variant m has to be good size to make sample representative of mohc pdf but n does not have to be large as internal variability is already generated by using different set of parameters and different seed for each wg i think this solution is simpler than the percentilebased solution do you agree sounds ok lets see what chris thinks 4 phil has mentioned in the past that earwig produces some diagnostics eg consecutive dry days frost days etc from wg will this be done for ukcip08 the plan is yes for this colin has the software for this it just needs to be set up carefully as the base for all the diagnostics for the future runs has to be based on median run of the wg for the present 6190 we shouldnt allow users to change the 6190 base period or the choice of the median good i would like your opinion on problem i am having with some of the variables we are providing pdfs for some quantities are indices derived from daily model data eg frost days but i think there are two problems with this 1 model bias eg model that is too warm may have very few frost days and therefore the change looks small effect will be nonlinear function of bias based on shape of distribution of daily data 2 wg and pdfs could provide two alternative routes to same answer and they will obviously conflict for reasons we understand eg model bias but the users wont understand to avoid confusing user and potentially reducing their confidence in ukcip products i think it makes sense for wgs to be the sole route towards prediction of derived indices btw i have handful of derived indices to do hot days wet days gale days heating and cooling degree days and frost days and i think you cover some of these already what do you think geoff wants to discuss issues connected to the three strands of output pdfs wg rcm on the 24th model biases will only be problem with their data used directly so this could be problem with the larger regions where the wg wont work well the wg wont have biases as it is based on 6190 as the base period we will be perturbing these with the rcmbased pdfs maybe we need to show that the following willshouldmust be the same modelbased scenario for 2070s minus model present 6190 equals wg scenarios for the 2070s minus wg present 6190 geoff will need to get this across as this is how the three strands will produce the same answers the wg and the extremes software will do all the tempprecip indices but wont do gale days cheers david
