accidently discovered the skull while sw imming below the surface in lake wallula section of the columbia river pooled be hind the mcnary dam law enforcement authorities were notif ied and took charge of the remains35 at the time of the discovery of the remains their age and ethnic origin were uncertain the land upon which kennewick man was f ound was under the jurisdiction of the us army corps of engineers coe36httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33031crs9 37 the factual background is summarized from the courts opinion in bonnichsen v us 367 f3d 864 9th cir 2004 38 id 39 357 f3d at 869 40 idthe kennewick man became the focus of debates and exte nsive litigation about the relationship between native american cultural and religious rights and science and archaeology almost immediately controversy developed concerning who was responsible for determining what would be done with the remains claims were placed by indian tribes local officials and some members of the scientific community the coe ultimately took possessi on of the remains but its actions to resolve the situation in accordance with nagp ra were challenged in federal court the remains were initially given to forensic anthropologists for study and dating they concluded that kennewick man lived approximately 9000 years ago meanwhile indian tribes from the region of the columbia river opposed the study of the remains on religious grounds and manded that the remains be turned over to them for immediate burial their cl aim was based on nagpra the coe agreed with the tribal claimants and seized the remains before further testing could be completed in 1998 the coe and the secret ary of the interior entered into an agreement whereby the secretary was given the responsibility to decide whether the remains were native american under nagpra and to determine their appropriate disposition extensive study had indicated that the remains were unlike those of any known present day population american indian or otherwise still based upon the age of the remains and the fact that the remain s were found within the united states the secretary determined that the kennewick mans remains were native american within the meaning of nagpra later th secretary further concluded that the kennewick remains were culturally affiliated with present day indian tribes for this reason the secretary awarded kennewick mans remains to coalition of tribal claimants37 pursuant to this decision and in compliance with nagpra the coe published notice of intent to repatria human remains in local newspaper various scientists objected to the repatria tion decision and requested that scientists be allowed to study the remains further the coe did not agree to allow additional study and the scientists began the litigation38 judicial review bonnichsen v us the plaintiffsa group of scientists and otherschallenged the secretarys decisions in district court during the c ourse of this litigation the scientistplaintiffs viewed the skeleton as an irreplaceable source of in formation about early new world populations that warrants careful sc ientific inquiry to advance knowledge of distant times39 by contrast the position of the native american tribes was that the skeleton is that of an ancestor who acco rding to the tribes religious and social traditions should be buried immediat ely without further testing40httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33031crs10 41 bonnichsen v united states 217 fsupp 2d at 113839 42 367 f3d 864 9th cir 2004 43 the district court has issued three published opinions in this

the amended opinion is at 367 f3d 864 9th cir 2004 45 see note 11 46 id at 87273the district court ruled in plaintiffs favor and vacated the secretarys decision on the ground that the secretary

defendants and the tribal claimants appealed and the court of appeals stayed the district courts order granting the scientists opportunity to study of the remains pending the decision of the court of appeals in bonnichsen v us42 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed the decision of the district court43 determining that the scientists had standing to bring this action that for nagpra to apply the human remains must bear some relationship to presently existing tribe people or culture to be considered native american within the meaning of nagpra and the evidence did not support the department of interiors decision that the remains were native american within this meaning44 standing following detailed factual summary of the events leading up to the litigation and summary of the decisions of the district court the court turned to the issue of jurisdiction the tribal claimants argued that the court lacked jurisdiction because the plaintiffs alleged inju ries are not redressable by court action and that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring claims alleging violations of nagpra because they did not seek to invoke interests within th zone of interest protected by nagpra examining the issue of standing the court concluded that if nagpra does not apply then the archaeological resources protection act arpa45 would apply and arpa would give the plaintiffs the oppor tunity to study the kennewick mans remains the court conclude d that the plaintiffs injury would be redressed by favorable decision on the nagpra issu and hence the plaintiffs have constitutional standing46 in finding for the plaintiffs the court rejected the argument of the tribal coalition the tribal coalition had argued that the plaintiff scientists lacked standinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33031crs11 47 id at 87374 48 id at 875 49 id at 879 50 id at 882to bring claims alleging vi olations of nagpra the tribal claimants argued that congress enacted nagpra with the interest s of american indians in mind and only american indians or tribes could file suit alleging violations of nagpra the court scrutinized 3013 of nagpra and determined that it did not limit jurisdiction to suits brought by american indians or indian tribes47 concept of native american within the context of nagpra the court then reviewed the secretarys decision to transfer the kennewick man to the tribal coalition the court examined nagpra and conducted twopart analysis the first question is whether the human remains are native american within the statutes meaning if the remains are not native american then nagpra does not apply if the remains are native american then nagpra applies triggering the second question of deter mining which persons or tribes are most closely affiliated with the remains48 the court focused on the definition of native american at 25 usc 30019 and noted that the rele vant statutory clause is wr itten in the present tense and that the statute unambiguously requires that human remains bear some relationship to presently existing tribe people or culture for them to be considered native american the court concluded that c ongress enacted nagpra to give american indians control over the remains of their ge netic and cultural forebears not over the remains of people bearing special and si gnificant genetic or cultural relationship to some presently existing indigenous tribe people or culture49 review of the secretarys decision that the kennewick mans remains are native american the court reviewed the department of the interiors records to determine whether there is substantial evidence that supports the agency decision that the kennewick man is native american within the context of the nagpra definition after reviewing the record th court concluded that the record did not contain substantial evidence that the kennewick mans remains were native american within the context of the nagpra meaning after reviewing all of the records the court concluded that because the kennewick mans remains are so old and that the information about this era is limited the record did not permit the secretary to reasonably conclude that the kennewick man shares special and significant genetic or cultural features with presently existing indigenous tribes peopl or cultures the court therefore concluded that the kennewick mans remains are not native american remains within the context of nagpra and th at nagpra does not apply to them50httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33031crs12 51 id 52 see the website for the

aftermath of the decision following the decision in bonnichsen studies continue on the remains of the kennewick man nevert heless the scientific community is still concerned about the future application of nagpra to ancient human remains as well as about proposed amendments to nagpra the umatilla tribe of native american s had been leader of the tribal defendants in the case the position of the native americans is that they wish to have the remains reburied as re quired by traditional tribal law52 although the native americans were unhappy with the determinations of the ninth circuit discussed above they decided not to appeal the case to the us supreme court this decision was based upon the availability of financial resources the uncertainty of whether the court would hear the case nd the risk of an unfavorable decision53 the position of the tribe expressed on their we bsite appears to be that nagpra needs to be strengthened so that it fulfills congress intent which was to protect tribal burials and to return sacred items to the tribes54 in fact congress has considered legisla tion to modify the definition of native american within the context of nagpra legislation was

american refers to member of tribe people or culture that is or was indigenous to the united states enactment of this amendment may significantly broaden the scope of nagpra as discussed above the bonnichsen court held that for nagpra in its present form to be applicable there needed to be connection between the cultural object and current day people or culture the amendm ent would remove such distinction and would have the possibility of including an indigenous person within the context of nagpra whether or not there is connecti on to current tribal group or culture while it cannot be predicted what effect this amendm ent if enacted may have on the ultimate disposition of the remains of the kennewick man it is conceivable that if the amendment to nagpra is enacted there may be further judicial consideration of the applicability of nagp ra to the kennewick mans remains and whether they would fall within the purview of the amended definition of native american the senate
