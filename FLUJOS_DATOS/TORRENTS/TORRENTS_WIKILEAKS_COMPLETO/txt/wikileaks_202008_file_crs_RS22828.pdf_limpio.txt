108th congress then department of homeland security dhs deputy inspector general richard l skinner noted fema historically has not had to implement the mortgage and rental assistance mra program on large scal because previous disasters did not coincide with nor result in widespread unemployment and national economic losses from the inception of mra until september 11 2001 only 181 million had been awarded under the program for 68 declared disasters compared to approximately 76 million as result of the new york disaster alone4 the total of 181 million is small component of the disaster relief program that has received appropriations in excess of 200 billion over the last 18 years5 when the amount expended for mra is averaged for 68 disasters the average amount provided per disaster was approx imately 265000 per event not only was the amount spent on mrahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22828crs3 6 us department of homeland security federal emergency management agency major disaster

counsel may 2003relatively small but it was used in few di sasters only 6 out of the 1400 declarations during the three decades it was in existence6 mra did provide significant assistance after december 1998 freeze in california this event had direct effect on workers who were employed in the agricultural sector in need of short term help to retain their homes and apartments during the following year more than 6000 individua ls registered for mra assistance with an estimated program cost of nearly 7 million7 the most expensive or costly use of mra as referenced in mr skinners testimony was the 911 terrorist attack in new york city fema distributed 76 million for mortgage and rental assistance more th an four times the amount of total spending in the programs history the 911 event came after the passage of pl 106390 which had deleted the mra program from the stafford act however the changes did not take effect until the corresponding regulatory changes had been implemented on may 1 2002 as result program funds we re available to those sufferi ng economic losses in new york city following the september 11 2001 attacks mra retenti ondeletion fema had rarely used its mra authority when congress considered dma2k while some fema staff had understood and valued the utility of the program for events such as the california freeze declaration previously discussed the staff also considered the program an administrative burden the administrative problems associ ated with the mra program discussed by fema staff included 1 defining the victim ie distinguishi ng between disaster victim and victim of general economic downturns 2 determining the extent of an applicants inability to pay rent or mortgage percentage of loss of income does not take into account assets that an applicant might have independent of reduction in ones salary 3 administrative difficulty of documenting case files verifying loss of income and lateness in paying mortgage or rent is timeconsuming and applicants subsisting in cash economy often have little documentation to support their mra applications and 4 determining the appropriate period for the provision of mra assistance8 while some observers considered elimination of the program justified by its infrequent use and difficulty in administration others such as the regional staff that had managed mra in the field considered the program practical option for meeting certain needs created by some disasters httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22828crs4 9 for more information see crs report rl34087 fema disaster h

release 1391122 june 18 2002 at httpwwwfemagovnewsnewsreleasefemaid5570the minimal use of the previous mra program after most disasters is difficult to ascribe to any one explanation while some have posited femas reluctant stewardship of the program to its infrequent use others point to the rare incidence of the type of disaster that would have such devasta ting economic impact over prolonged period of time that would require mra assistance the decision to eliminate the program was influenced by cost considerations since its removal did reduce estimated spending under the stafford act the administration and congress were in accord that savings were needed since dma2k would potentially increase mitigation spending within the stafford act since its authority expired in 2002 the mra program was not available in the aftermath of the gulf coast hurricanes of 2005 the absence of the program at that time did not evoke controversy ar guably due to the initiative taken by many lenders and mortgage holding institutions to alleviate the pressure on mortgagors following the hurricane events this was accomplished through suspended payment schedules and other initiatives undertaken to lessen the imp act on those affected by the hurricanes9 these were special steps taken in reacti on to the massive impact of the 2005 hurricane season mortgage holders do not routinely take such actions following disaster events mra and the 911 disaster as noted earlier expenditures for the mra program following the world trade center attacks were the largest in the history of the program given the unique nature of the di saster it also posed many problems for the administration of the mra program the sheer nature of the attack and its reverberations in the national economy meant that fema had to decide how to define the area of eligibility and the connection to the disaster event since 911 was considered an event of national scope it wa s argued by some that the national economy was affected and therefore eligibility for mra assistance s hould be determined on nationwide basis later under congressional pressu re fema expanded the ligibility guidelines but only for residents in new york city10 fema initially determined that applicants were eligible for mra assistance if they lived in certain areas near the world trade center site and had lost 25 percent or more of their income as result of the disaster but the actual guidelines for eligibility changed during the recovery period11 as the general accounting office noted in report on 911 federal activities fema as directed by the congress ex tended assistance to those who lost 25 percent or more of their income workin g anywhere in manhattan to those whose employers were not located in manhatta n but were economically dependent onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22828crs5 12 us general accounting office september 11 overview of fe deral disaster assistance to the new york city area gao0472 october 2003 at httpwwwgaogovnewitemsd0472pdf 13 ibid hirscha manhattan firm and to anyone living in manhattan who commuted off the island and who suffered financially because of the postseptember 11 travel restrictions in december 2002 report that examined this program femas office of inspector general ig noted that the unique nature of the disaster and its economic impact required fema official s to expand eligibility guidelines more broadly than ever before this resulted in fema having to reevaluate applications reverse previous determinations to deny benefits and attempt to contact applicants initially denied but now eligible under the expanded guidelines12 the administrative challenges of the 911 program in new york identified in the ig report appeared to confirm the reluctance among fema leadership to revive the mra program within femas authorizing legislation or even to suggest such an action in the wake of the hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005 fema staff reportedly did consider options for the revival of the program including further delineation of eligibility for the program transfer of the program to other fe deral entities and transfer of administrative responsibility to private sector agency or organization13 however these options were never presented as legislative proposal to the authorizing committees of congress analysis of legislative proposal the mortgage and rental disaster relief act of 2007 s 2386 builds on the previous mra program while ddressing several of the concerns of fema mentioned above nd would take new steps to further define components of the mra program first the bill provides several defining elements of the term financial hardship used to determine eligibility but would still leave room for regulatory definitions second the bill would set an income threshold to qualify applicants for participation cu rrently stafford act provisions have an actual household income threshold for eligibility the setting of an income threshold arguably helps target assistance to those with the most acute need third the proposed bill would maintain the same 18 month timeframe for potential assistance that was part of the previous mra program that time period also conforms to femas temporary housing assistance program while addressing those key elements of the mra program the bill does not identify the agency or department that w ould be charged with implementation instead providing the authority like almost all of the stafford act to the discretion of the president recurring fema concern as ddressed by staff in conversation regarding the mra program was that it fema was not the appropriate agency to administer this program among other questions has been the ability of fema to manage program that is based on individual economic distress however those sa concerns could arguablyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22828crs6 14 42 usc 5174 15 see crs report rl33738 gulf coast hurricanes addressi ng survivors mental health and substance

housing assistance and other forms of financ ial aid provided through the other needs assistance program14 further though s 2386 does not direct fema to obtain professional expertise from other departments this collaboration already occurs in other stafford act programs that fema administers for example while dhs and fema coordinate disaster relief on behalf of the president fema receives assistance from two other federal departments in the delivery of federal stafford act assistance the department of health and human services provides program guidan ce and monitoring of the stafford acts crisis counseling program15 and the department of labor assists in the administration of the disaster unemployment assistance dua program16 the bill as introduced applies to any disaster declared

already be available for federal housing authority fhainsured mortgages17 however forbearance following ka trina for mortgages not under the fha program was ad hoc another source of current relief is in the agricultural sector the us department of agricultures usda rural housing service has issued request for proposal to assist low income farm work ers during emergencies nd disasters one of the eligible categories for assistance liste d under this special program is assistance in meeting rent or mortgage payments18 public law 11028 ppropriated 16 million for emergency services for migrant workers19 in sum s 2386 would restore the mra after hiatus dating to may 2002 but modify it to add income caps for eligibility and thereby among other things limit the overall amount of assistance that otherwise might be provided however possible opponents may on the one hand question th need for additional expense and administrative burdens at this time or on the other hand question why mortgage and rental assistance within hardhit community should be subject to income caps at all if basic program eligibility sta ndards demonstrating economic distress have been met
