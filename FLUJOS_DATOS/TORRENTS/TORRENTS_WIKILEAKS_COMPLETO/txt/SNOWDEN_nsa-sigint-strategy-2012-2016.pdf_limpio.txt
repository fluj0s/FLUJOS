security interests u mission u defend the nation through sigintderived advantage with skilled work force trained equipped and empowered to access and unlock the secrets of our adversaries u values u we will constantly strive to improve our knowledge our people our technology and our products through innovation and personalization we will advance the sigint system our customers and stakeholders can rely on us to provide timely high quality products and services because we never stop innovating and improving and we never give up u the environment ufouo for decades signals intelligence has sustained deep and persistent access to all manner of adversaries to inform and guide the actions and decisions of presidents military commanders policy makers and clandestine service officers as the world has changed and global interdependence and the advent of the information age have transformed the nature of our target space we have adapted in innovative and creative ways that have led some to describe the current day as the golden age of sigint ufouo that reputation was hardwon but will only endure if we keep sight of the dynamic and increasingly market driven forces that continue to shape the sigint battle space we must proactively position ourselves to dominate that environment across discovery access exploitation analysis collaboration and in the products and services we provide the sigint system and our interaction therein must be as agile and dynamic as the information space we confront ufouo the mission space for sigint in the years ahead will continue to grow at rapid pace amidst dramatically new set of challenges ufouo the interpretation and guidelines for applying our authorities and in some cases the authorities themselves have not kept pace with the complexity of the technology and target environments or the operational expectations levied on nsas mission u digital information created since 2006 grew tenfold reaching 18 exabytes in 2011 trend projected to continue ubiquitous computing is fundamentally changing how people interact as individuals become untethered from information sources and their communications tools and the traces individuals leave when they interact with the global network will define the capacity to locate characterize and understand entities1 1 u center for the study of intelligence 2010 where tomorrow will take us the new environment for intelligence august 201 0 top secretsirel to usa aus can gbr nzl 3 top secretsirel to usa aus can gbr nzl u cyberattacks offer means for potential adversaries to overcome overwhelming us advantages in conventional military power and to do so in ways that are instantaneously and exceedingly hard to trace such attacks may not cause the mass casualties of nuclear strike but they could paralyze us society all the same2 u the international system as constructed following the second world war will be almost unrecognizable by 2025 owing to the rise of emerging powers globalizing economy an historic transfer of relative wealth and economic power from west to east and the growing influence of non state actors3 u expectations ufouo the power of information its short shelf life in the information age and the speed at which it moves will set the conditions for how nsa interacts with customers transactional passive or linear relationships will be replaced by embedded deeply interactive engagements existing investments in cyber security will by necessity expand across the enterprise to meet the demand and speed of action required to thwart our adversaries to remain value for the warfighter our information must be imm ediately available at the lowest classification level the nation will continue to depend upon nsa to be the lead for the application of the science of cryptography sustaining access and understanding of data even as encryption becomes automatic transparent and prolific products and services from nsa will evolve into forms and across boundaries that mirror the networked and agile manner in which people interact in the information age and we will share information responsibly and securely with external partners and customers ufouo for sigint to be optimally effective legal policy and process authorities must be as adaptive and dynamic as the technological and operational advances we seek to exploit nevertheless the culture of compliance which has allowed the american people to entrust nsa with extraordinary authorities will not be compromised in the face of so many demands even as we aggressively pursue legal authorities and policy framework mapped more fully to the information age ufouo to sustain current mission relevance and to meet the challenges the signals intelligence directorate must undertake profound and revolutionary shift from the mission approach which has served us so well in the decades preceding the onset of the information age to sigint system that is as agile and dynamic as the information space we confront the environment demands it the capability of the sigint system can achieve it and the work force has the creativity and the skill base to make it possible ufouo what follow are the five challenge goals the sigint leadership has established to close gaps between the environment and expectations over the next five years 2u lynn william j iii 2010 defending new domain the pentagons cyberstrategy

gbr nzl 4 top secretsirel to usa aus can gbr nzl sigint goals for 2012 2016 1 ufouo revolutionize analysis fundamentally shift our analytic approach from production to discovery bias enriched by innovative customerpartner engagement radically increasing operational impact across all mission domains 11 ufouo through advanced tradecraft and automation dramatically increase mastery of the global network 12 ufouo conduct original analysis in collaborative information space that mirrors how people interact in the information age 13 ufouo disseminate data at its first point of relevance share bulk data and enable customers to address niche requirements 14 ufouo drive an agile technology base mapped to the cognitive processes that underpin large scale analysis discovery compliance and collaboration 2 ufouo fully leverage internal and external nsa partnerships to collaboratively discover targets find their vulnerabilities and overcome their networkcommunication defenses 21 ufouo bolster our arsenal of capabilities against the most critical cryptanalytic challenges 211 ssirel employ multidisciplinary approaches to cryptanalytic problems leveraging and integrating midpoint and endpoint capabilities to enable cryptanalysis 212 srel counter the challenge of ubiquitous strong commercial network encryption 213 tssirel counter indigenous cryptographic programs by targeting their industrial bases with all available sigint and humint capabilities 214 tssirel influence the global commercial encryption market through commercial relationships humint and second and third party partners 215 ssirel continue to invest in the industrial base and drive the state of the art for high performance computing to maintain preeminent cryptanalytic capability for the nation 22 tssirel defeat adversary cybersecurity practices in order to acquire the sigint data we need from anyone anytime anywhere 23 ssi enable discovery capabilities and advanced tradecraft in the collection architecture to enable the discovery of missioncritical persona networks accesses signals and technologies 24 ssi integrate capabilities into the mission architecture deepen workforce skill base in advanced network and signals analysis and optimize processes and policies for the benefit of discovery 3 ssirel dynamically integrate endpoint midpoint industrialenabled and cryptanalytic capabilities to reach previously inaccessible targets in support of exploitation cyber defense and cyber operations 31 crel drive the sigint mission architecture to underpin synchronized integrated multicapability operations extending it to mission partners 32 tssirel integrate the sigint system into national network of sensors which interactively sense respond and alert one another at machine speed 33 ufouo continuously rebalance our portfolio of accesses and access capabilities based on current and projected contributions to key sigint missions 34 ssirel identify new access collection and exploitation methods by leveraging global business trends in data and communications services top secretsirel to usa aus can gbr nzl 5 top secretsirel to usa aus can gbr nzl u in order to achieve these three mission goals we must collectively liberate the innovation and creativity of our workforce through technology policies and business processes hence the following two goals have been set 4 u collectively foster an environment that encourages and rewards diversity empowerment innovation risktaking and agility 41 u empower employees to make decisions and drive change invest in and reward innovation risk taking and teaming 42 ufouo build compliance into systems and tools to ensure the workforce operates within the law and without worry 43 u work together to detail implement and evolve the strategy 44 u provide everyone with the training and experiences necessary to lead the worlds most capable sigint service and be competitive for intelligence community leadership positions 5 u enable better more efficient management of the mission and business by establishing new modifying current and eliminating inefficient business processes by strengthening customer relationships and by building necessary internal and external partnerships 51 ufouo pursue develop and implement policy consistent with the pace and scope of operations 52 ufouo build into systems and tools features that enable and automate end toend valuebased assessment of sigint products and services 53 ufouo create and sustain mission management environment that is autonomic and agile 54 ufouo synchronize mission
