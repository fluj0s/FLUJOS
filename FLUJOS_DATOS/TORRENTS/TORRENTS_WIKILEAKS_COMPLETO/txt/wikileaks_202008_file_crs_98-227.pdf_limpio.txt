98227 updated may 19 2008 voting in the senate forms and requirements walter j oleszek government and finance division voting is among the most important public acts of individual senators for example senators recognize that their decisions often need to be explained to constituents who are interested in knowing why lawmakers voted as they did on various measures or matters party leaders too understand th importance of voting for they often try to schedule votes during time when they believe they can win senatorial support for their objectives that senators try never to miss votes is reflected in the high percentage of rollcall votes that they cast on all recorded votes take n in the chamber senators on average cast votes around 95 of the time there are three ways of voting in the nate voice division and yea and nay also called rollcall or recorded votes neither voice nor division votes are recognized in the rules of the senate instead they are per mitted by precedent nate rule xii outlines voting procedure in the chamber and explicitly identifies the yeas and nays voice vote on voice vote the presiding officer will first ask those in favor to shout aye and then those opposed to say the chair may th say the ayes noes appear to have it this announcement by the chair is not conclusive until the chair declares that the ayes noes have it senators may ask for division or rollcall vote before the final result is announced by the presiding officer commonly the presiding officer will stat without objection the amendment bill resolution motion etc is agreed to or not agr eed to this is simply another variation of voice vote it does not imply that si ngle objection will defeat the proposition any senator may object and the vote on the proposition will occur by one of the other methods permitted by the senate division vote division or standing vote is seldom used in the senate however any senator including the chair may request division if senator is in doubt about voice vote division vote does not provide record of how each senator voted it simply demonstrates whether proposition on which division is requested has been approved or disapproved as in the case of voice vote before th chair announces the result of division vote senato r may ask for the yeas and nayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98227crs2 the results of either voice or division vot are considered valid matter how many or how few senators actually participated in the vote to be sure the constitution requires majority quorum 51 of 100 senators if there are v acancies to be present for the senate to conduct business as official precedents state the senate operates on the presumption that quor um is present at all times under all circumstances unless the question to the cont rary is raised or the absence of quorum is officially shown or until point of quorum is made even though voice or division vote is taken and announced in the meantime yea and nay vote article i section 5 of the constitution states that the yeas and nays of the members of either house on an question shall at the desire of one fifth of those present be entered on the journa l which is the official record of the proceedings of the senate thus any senator who obtains the floor may ask for the yeas and nays i ask for the yeas and nays on the question then pending before the senate immediately the presiding officer will say is there sufficient second sufficient second consists of minimum of 11 senators who raise their hands or onefifth the constitutional standard of the presumptive quorum of 51 sometimes senator will suggest the absence of quorum to get sufficient senators to the floor to second his or her rollcall request mr or mada m president i suggest the absence of quorum once enough sena tors reach the floor the quorum call will be dispensed with by unanimous consent and the request for yea and nay vote will be renewed in practice senators who wa nt roll call vote on proposition will almost always receive sufficient support from their colleagues quite often senators will re quest and receive support for the yeas and nays on proposition in advance of the time that the vot actually occurs senator for example may offer an amendment and immediately ask for the yeas and nays what this means is that if the senators amendment is subject to vote and not rejected on procedural motion for instance the vote will be by roll call ordering the yeas and nays on proposition does not imply that vote on it is imminent debate on it may continue for hours or days or weeks before the proposition is subject to rollcall vote under senate precedents ordering the yeas and nays may be rescinded by unanimous consent conducting rollcall votes when it is time to c onduct rollcall vote the presiding officer will direct the clerk to call th names of all senators in alphabetical order and each member as specified in rule xii shall without debate declare his assent or dissent to the question following the call of senators the clerk will then recapitulate the vote by first identifying those who voted in the affirmative and then those who voted in the negative other senators who may wi sh to vote go to the rostrum and respond yea or nay when the clerk calls their name s 15minute period which is established by unanimous consent at the start of congress is the time limitation for rollcall votes for instance when the 110th congress began the senate agreed by unanimous consent that for the duration of the 110th congress there be limitation of 15 minutes each upon any rollcall vote sometimes votes are kept open bey ond this period to accommodate senators who are hurrying to the chamber to cast their vote if there are senators waiting on the floor to vote the presiding offi cer announces the result of the vote worth noting is that the senate unlike the house does not permit electronic voting
