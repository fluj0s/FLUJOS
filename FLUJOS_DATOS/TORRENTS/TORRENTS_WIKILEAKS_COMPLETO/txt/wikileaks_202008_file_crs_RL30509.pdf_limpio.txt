appropriations act unless it included provisions related to providing late amnesty advancing the registry date from 1972 to 1986 reinstating section 245i and allowing salvadorans guatemalans hondurans and haitians to adjust status to permanent residency as cubans and nicaraguans are allowed to do currently nacara parity for further information on these provisions see crs report rl30780 immigration legalization and status adjustment legislatio n by ruth ellen wasemmillion over last years appropriation and 40 million less than the administrations request it also includes program increases of 101 million for border control and management and 121 million for interior enforcement and the removal of deportable aliens while it would authorize new expedited service fee for employers petitioning for skilled h1b visa nonimmigrant workers it does not establish or raise user fees for inspections furthermore the fy2001 cjs appropriations act includes set of substantive immigration provisions known as the legal immigration family equity act life act15 which were amended by langua ge included in the fy2001 laborhhs appropriations act pl 106554 hr 4577 these provisions provide for 1 the temporary

technical amendments to the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act nacara and the haitian refugee immigration fairness act hrifa that waive certain grounds of admissibility these provisions however are not nearly as expansive as those originally sought by the white house16 nonetheless these provisions along with other enacted legislation that expands the h1b program are likely to increase ins adjudications workloads significantly the housepassed bill by contrast included 467 billion for ins 323 billion in direct funding and 144 billion in offsetting receipts this amount was 392 million over last years appropriation and 178 million less than the administrations request while the housepassed bill included provision to authorize an h1b premium service fee it did not include

senate recommendation however also included 414 million in emergency funding for the southwest border initiative of which 322 million was earmarked for ins the senatereported bill would have reinstated section 245i but it was silent on the proposed h1b premium service fee and the proposals to establishraise user fees for inspections the bill also included provisions to repeal sections 110 and 641 of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 division c pl 104208httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30509crs22 regarding section 110 this provision as originally enacted would have required the development of system that would record the entry and exit of every alien arriving and departing from the united states many congressional delegations from northern border states strongly opposed the implementation of section 110 at the northern land border since it would have represented significant departure from the status quo canadians who enter the united states through land border ports were and are not required to present passport and are usually not required to obtain visa similarly us citizens who enter canada through land border ports are not required to present passport or visa in most cases some feared that if section 110 were implemented at northern land border ports of entry additional documents would be required the immigrat ion and naturalization service data management improvement act of 2000 pl 106215 enacted on june 15 2000 amended and rewrote section 110 to require the development of system that would use available data to record alien arrivals and departur without establishing additional documentary requirements the law was viewed by many as compromise nevertheless the senatereported bill would repeal section 110 as amended the conference report however does not include the provision to repeal section 110 for further information see crs report rs 20627 immigration integra ted entry and exit data system by william j krouse in addition the senate reported measure would have repealed section 641 of pl 104208 this provision required ins to implement foreign student data collection reporting program by january 1 1998 academic administrators have lobbied for this provisions repeal principally because it requires them to collect fees from foreign students for ins the conference report does not include provision to repeal section 641 but this provision was significantly amended by the house and senatepassed hr 3767 bill that makes the visa waiver pilot program permanent this bill was recently presented to the president for signature major ins budgetrelated issues for fy2000 and fy2001 have included 1 reducing pending caseloads in immigrationrelated claims particularly green card and naturalization applications 2 meeting the statutory mandate that the border patrol be increased by 1000 agents in fy2001 and accounting for the shortfall in hiring in fy1999 3 determining the level of detention capacity necessary to comply with the statutor mandate that certain criminal aliens be detained until deported and 4 restructuring ins internally as proposed by the administration or dismantling or restructuring the agency by legislation large pending caseloads continue to plague ins despite increased funding from fy1992 to fy2000 funding for the adjudications and nationality program increased from 137 to 496 million in fy1999 ins processed more than 12 million naturalization applications however as of the end of the first quarter of fy2000 the pending caseload for naturalization

earmarked in both the house and senate reports for fy1999 congress provided ins with 94 million to hire 1000 additional agents but the agency was unable to achieve net increase of 1000 agents citing lack of qualified applicants in strong labor market and high attrition rate among candidates according to the border patrol in fy1999 ins hired 1119 agents but 749 agents left or were separated from ins employment attrited resulting in net increase of only 370 agents in fy2000 ins hired 1691 agents but 869 left the service resulting in net increase of 822 agents leaving 9096 agents on board at the end of fy2000 for fy2001 the administration requested 152 million to improve service reduce pending caseloads and prevent fraud this funding would have been derived from several sources 1 25 million from the voluntary h1b visa premium service fee to be deposited into the examinations fee account 2 another 55 million from the h1b premium service fee 3 375 million from section 245i fees and 4 348 million in direct appropriation while the senatereported bill would have reinstated section 245i the house appropriations committee strongly reject ed the administrations proposal to reinstate provision conversely the house accepted the h1b premium service fee proposal but the senatereported bill did not include such provision the house committee also noted that over the past 3 years ins has been provided with 463 million to reduce pending caseloads and improve the integrity of the naturalization process indeed except for the detention and deportation program the adjudicati ons and nationality programs budget increased at greater rate 262 than any other ins program budget from fy1993 to fy2000 for fy2001 house report language earmarks an increase of 87 million including 44

operate as independent agencies or be transferred to other federal agencies those in congress who have favored the abolition of the department argued that it is an unwieldy conglomeration of marginally related programs nearly all of which duplicat those performed elsewhere in the federal government the clinton administration on the other hand has strongly opposed abolishing the commer ce department arguing that it would result in the needless shuffling of governmental functions while eliminating successful activities that clearly benefit the american people especially in areas that promote economic growth increase the international competitiveness of us firms in global markets and advance us technology none of these proposals passed 104th congress there continued to be some

same amount as recommended by the senate appropriations committee and slightly more than the appropriation of 333 billion passed earlier by the house the judiciary in its official newsletter the third branch expressed appreciation for the level ultimately approved by congress for this account noting that it funded 1559 new court support staff26 significant increase in this account was urgentl needed the judiciary had maintained largely because of increased workload in judicial districts on the nations southwestern border27 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30509crs39 28 in his 1999 yearend report on the federal judiciary chief justice william h rehnquist asserted that the rate of pay for panel attorneys was seriously hampering the ability of the courts to recruit and retain qualified panel attorneys to provide effective representation the chief justice urged congress to provide funding for all panel attorneys up to the maximum authorized by congress in 1986namely 75 per hour for both incourt and outofcourt time prior to fy2000 congress had appropriated funds to pay the 75 per hour maximum in portions of 16 of the nations 94 judicial districts congress then approved panel attorney rates of 7050 for inout ofcourt time effective january 2000 for all judicial districts representing 5 per hour increase over fy1999 rates the judiciarys fy2001 request for defender services included funds sufficient to pay all panel attorneys at the 75 per hour rate effective april 2001 the cost of this increase was put at 113 million 29 earlier the appropriations committees had differed in their response to the judiciarys request for an increase in panel attorney pay rates for fy2001 in its report on hr 4690 the house appropriations committee said it was generally supportive of an increase in panel attorney rates and proposed an increase to 7555 for inoutofcourt time by contrast the senate appropriations committee in its report explicitly stated funding is provided to increase panel attorney rates of compensation beyond what was provided in fiscal year 2000 30these initiatives the judiciary said included the establishment of case budgets at the onset of cases training programs to improve case manag ement and improved procedures for reviewing attorney payment vouchers according to the judiciary as result of these initiatives the average cost per petitioner in capital habeas corpus cases in the us court of continuedas it had been in previous years one of the more sensitive parts of the judiciarys fy2001 budget was defender services this account funds the operations of the federal public defender and community defender organizations and the compensation reimbursement and expenses of panel attorneys the latter are private practice attorneys appointed by the courts under the criminal justice act to serve as defense counsel to indigent individual s accused of federal crimes for fy2001 congress approved 4350 million for defender services instead of 4204 million as provided in the house bill and 4164 million as recommended by the senate appropriations committee the judiciary had requested an appropriation of 4404 million for defend er services 143 increase over fy2000 budget authority of 3851 million matter of increasing concern to the judicia ry in recent years has been the relatively low rate of pay panel attorneys receive relativ to compensation paid to private counsel by other government agencies28 in response to that concern house senate conferees directed that portion of the judiciarys defender services funding for fy2001 be used for an increase to 75 an hour for panel attorneys incourt time and 55 an hour for their outofcourt time29 during consideration of the judiciarys fy1999 and fy2000 budgets congressional appropriators also had expressed concerns about rising overall defender services costs particular concern both years had been the costs of compensating attorneys who represent indigents in federal death penalty and death row appeal cases often referred to as capital cases in its fy2001 budget submission to congress the judiciary noted various ongoing initiatives on its part to contain costs for federal capital habeas

other being 23 increase in january continuedcontinuing to pursue implementation of recommendations included in its january 1998 report to congress on controlling costs associated with the defender services program in its june 14 2000 report on hr 4690 the house appropriations committee noted that it had received report regarding measures undertaken by the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit to reduce costs for capital habeas corpus representations in the circuits district courts particularly the district courts in california those measures the committee noted appeared to be working as evidenced by the 40 percent reduction in the average annual cost per petitioner in the ninth circuit while commending the ninth circuit for its efforts to reduce costs the committee observed that the average cost per petitioner in california was still almost twice that of the national average accordingly the committee urged the ninth circuit to continue its costcutting efforts and to include results in its optimal utilization of judicial resources report the house committee language subsequently was adopted by reference in the cjs fy2001 appropriations conference report congress also approved provision authorizing costofliving increase in judges and justices salaries for fy200131 and appropriating 88 million for this purpose the provision cleared the way for judges and justices to receive 27 pay adjustment along with members of congress and executive schedule employees on january 1 2001 the adjustment rate of 27 was based on formula set by law involving the employment cost index eci while at the same time being limited by the general schedule gs salary adjustment rate32 in early 2000 the judiciary had requested funding for costofliving increase in judges and justices salaries for fy2001 consistent with the expect ed fy2001 salary increase for the federal governments general schedule employees the judiciary contended that this requested adjustment and subsequent adjustments on an annual basis were essential if the judiciary is to maintain its high standards33httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30509crs41 33continued 1998 the judiciary noted that until the

judicial conference to promulgate regulations under section 503 of the ethics in government act of 1978 to carry out the amendments made by this section including any regulation relating to any limitation on amounts of honoraria or payments made to charitable organizations in lieu of honoraria by way of explanation the senate appropriations committee report on hr 4690 stated simply that section 305 amends section 501 of 5 usc app the house however declin ed to include an appropriation for increased judicial salaries in fy2001 in the cjs bill that it passed hr 4690 the house appropriations committee in its report on hr 4690 stated that it had deferred without prejudice the judiciarys request for pay adjustment by contrast the senate appropriations committee approved pay adjustment for the judiciary and it was the senate committee recommendation which ultimately prevailed in conference34 housesenate confer ees dropped from the judiciarys fy2001 appropriations title provision approved by the senate appropriations committee concerning honoraria received by justices and judges specifically section 305a in the general provisions of title iii of the senate bill had provided that statutory prohibition against members of congres s or government officers or employees receiving honoraria shall not apply to any individual while that individual is justice or judge of the united states35 at the same time section 305 authorized the judicial conference if it so chose to set its own honoraria limits for justices and lower federal court judges36 section 305 also excluded honoraria received by judges from the definition of outside earned income in 5 usc app sec 501a making judicial honoraria longer subject to the statutory curb in effect since 1989 which has limited the outside earned income of judges and of officers and employees in the legislative and executive branches to 15 of level ii in the executive schedule the most prominent suppor ter of lifting the ban on honoraria for judges was chief justice william h rehnquist who defended it as means of improving compensation for lifetime federal judges however the senate committee language to lift the ban generated controversy with various news media editorials and some senators and house members speaking out in opposition their criticisms included the view that allowing honoraria for judges could lessen public confidence in judges particularly if they were perceived as accepting money from special interests that it would raise another controversial issueof whether congress should lift the ban which also had been in place since 1989 on its own members receiving honoraria and that more appropriate means of increasing judicial income if called for wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30509crs42 37 8

to offer local network television to their customerscalled localintolocal service major factor in congress decision to allow satellites to offer local stations was to increase competition to cable because of consumer complaints about cable rate increases the two existing satellite tv companies echostar and directv planned to offer localintolocal only to the top markets in the country however
