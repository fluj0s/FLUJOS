american national government government and finance division federal sunset commission review of proposals and current status summary the sunset concept provides for programs and agencies to terminate automatically on periodic basis unless explicitly renewed by law in the last decade bills to create federal sunset commission modeled on the sunset review process in texas have been introduced in each congress including hr 5794 in the 110th president bush called for creation of federal sunset commission in his fy2006 budget submission bills reflecting an office of management and budget omb draft proposal were introduced in the 109th congress s 1399 hr 3276 hr 3277 on july 20 2006 the committee on government reform voted to report hr 3282 favorably to the house along with related program review bill hr 5766 as amended floor action had been scheduled for june 27 2006 but was postponed and further action occurred on the bills in the 110th congress with the budget submissions for fy2008 and fy2009 president george w bush reaffirmed his support for passage of the administrations proposal to create federal sunset commission in addition to the brady bill hr 5794 new sunset measure s 1731 was introduced on june 28 2007 by senator john cornyn this report examines the three bills and assesses their similarities and differences with respect to selected factors supporters of sunset commission measures suggest that there are too many overlapping and ineffective federal programs that contribute to the growing federal deficit and that the existing structure of congressional committees does not encourage systematic review of similar agencies and programs according to sunset proponents congressional reviews of many programs are sporadic and inadequate as evidenced by the number of unauthorized appropriations an actionforcing mechanism such as threat of termination is necessary sunset commission would assist congress in performing its oversight function thereby reducing fraud waste and abuse critics of the sunset commission measures counter that such bills would burden congress with tremendous workload for mandatory reauthorization of agencies and programs consequently such measures may prove infeasible to carry out or alternatively result in perfunctory reviews sunset commissions might increase congressional personnel costs since additional staff would be needed to assist the commission in its review activities opponents further contend that the review and reauthorization process would pose special threat to certain kinds of programs such as those which provide safety net for the most vulnerable in society this report will be updated as events warrant contents background 1 sunset commission proposals prior to the 109th congress 3 developments

sunset commission 13 federal sunset commission review of proposals and actions background the sunset concept provides for programs and agencies to terminate automatically according to predetermined schedule unless explicitly renewed by law sunset measures usually contain two elements an actionforcing mechanism carrying the ultimate threat of elimination and framework or guidelines for the systematic review and evaluation of past performance1 in 1976 colorado became the first state to enact sunset law by 1982 sunset measures had been considered in all 50 state legislatures and 36 states had enacted some version of the sunset review process representing remarkably rapid diffusion of state innovation2 however state experiences proved to be mixed by 1990 12 of the 36 states with sunset laws had ceased the use of this legislative oversight mechanism because of high monetary and temporal costs of sunset review intensive lobbying by vested interests unfulfilled expectations of agency termination low levels of citizen participation and other perceived problems still the study stated results indicate that sunset has resulted in some agency terminations and more importantly numerous substantive procedural and crosscutting modifications aimed at increasing accountability efficiency and effectiveness in state agencies3 since 1978 most editions of the book of the states compiled by the council of state governments cosg have included table titled summary of sunset legislation states having sunset review process are identified by scope of the framework c for comprehensive r for regulatory s for selective and d for discretionary4 careful review of the table included in the 2007 edition derived from december 2006 cosg survey suggests that 24 states have an active sunset 1 for

experience public administration review vol 50 janfeb 1990 p 49 3 ibid 4 discretionary sunset review might be viewed as an oxymoron since an actionforcing mechanism is generally considered as crucial component of the process there are also 20 footnotes in the scope column of the table one of which applies to several states footnote d reads while they have not enacted sunset legislation in the same sense of the other states with detailed information in this table the legislatures in eight stateshave included sunset clauses in selected programs or legislation see council of state governments the book of the states 2007 edition vol 39 lexington ky 2007 pp 142144 crs2 review process5 the cosg table further indicates that seven states have terminated or suspended their sunset procedures while in two of those states sunsetlike reviews continue three states have never established sunset review process6 the record of the sunset process in texas is of special interest both because it is generally recognized as one of the more active state efforts and because recent federal legislative proposals borrow from that model the website of the texas advisory commission offers 70page guide to the texas sunset process noting that the sunset process in texas is guided by 12member body appointed by the lieutenant governor and the speaker of the house of representatives assisting the commission is staff whose reports provide an assessment of an agencys programs giving the legislature the information needed to draw conclusions about program necessity and workability7 according to the guide since the texas sunset process began in 1978 54 agencies have been abolished and another 12 agencies have been consolidated for an estimated savings of nearly 7845 million8 when reviewing the accomplishments of sunset in texas however it is well to recall that the texas sunset advisory commission while ultimately saved by its supporters in the texas legislature was nearly abolished in 19939 at the federal level over 70 bills were introduced in the 94th congress 1975 1976 proposing various sunset arrangements and sunset measures have continued to be introduced in each subsequent congress many hearings have been held on sunset measures and several bills have been reported but the only floor action occurred in the 95th congress on october 11 1978 the senate passed s 2 the program reauthorization and

proposals see crs report rl31455 crs3 sunset commission proposals prior to the 109th congress unlike some of the earlier frameworks proposed for federal sunset process some bills introduced in the last decade have incorporated commission approach in 1997 hr 2939 105th congress was introduced by representative kevin brady of texas modeled on the texas sunset process the bill called for establishment of 12member federal agency sunset commission to review and make recommendations at least every 12 years regarding the reorganization or abolishment of each federal agency with the schedule for review to be determined by the commission the speaker of the house and the majority leader of the senate were to appoint the members each naming four congressional members and two private citizens with experience in the operation and administration of government programs each agency was to be abolished within year of completion of the commissions review unless congress acted to continue the agency in september 1998 the house subcommittee on government management information and technology held hearing on the bill representative brady and four other members provided testimony in favor of the bill11 arguably the most serious criticism of the bill raised at the 1998 hearing concerned potential constitutional problems with the commission framework an advisory opinion from the department of justice provided for the record referenced the ins v chada decision by the supreme court in 1983 462 us 919 and concluded the following because this bill hr 2939 would allow the abolishment of statutorily created executive agency not through legislation passed in conformity with article i but at the discretion and in accordance with timetable imposed by twelvemember commission composed of eight members of congress and four persons selected by the speaker of the house and the majority leader unless congress affirmatively decides to adopt legislation preserving the agency it violates the constitutionally required separation of powers12 in 1999 congressman brady along with 92 cosponsors introduced revised bill hr 2128 106th congress modified version of the sunset commission legislation containing two noteworthy additions first new subsection was added under review and abolishment of federal agencies relating to extensions that would have allowed the deadline for abolishment of the agency absent congressional action to reauthorize it to be extended for an additional two years if approved by supermajority of the house and the senate second new section was added providing for compilation by the three congressional support agencies of program inventory in language reminiscent of federal sunset measures dating back to the 1970s including s 2 in the 93rd congress the section would have directed the 11 us congress house committee on government reform and oversight subcommittee on government management information and technology hr 2939 federal sunset

pp 5354 for further discussion of the hearing see crs report rl31455 crs4 comptroller general of the general accounting office now designated the government accountability office and the director of the congressional budget office in cooperation with the director of the congressional research service to prepare an inventory of federal programs within each agency for the purpose of advising and assisting congress and the commission in carrying out the requirements of the act on june 28 2001 representative brady reintroduced virtually the same bill now called the abolishment of obsolete agencies and federal sunset act in the 107th congress as hr 2373 on april 23 2002 the house government reform subcommittee on civil service census and agency organization held hearing on hr 2373 at which texas representatives brady and jim turner who had both served in the texas legislature testified in favor of the bill the witness from the office of management and budget omb testified in general support of sunset review process for the federal government while acknowledging possible constitutional issues to be resolved subsequently detailed in letter from the justice department13 the omb spokesman noted that the sunset commission as outlined in the legislation was similar to the proposal for sunset review board that president bush endorsed during the 2000 campaign in final days of the 107th congress substitute amendment to hr 2373 was circulated for comment but formal consideration of it occurred before adjournment congressman brady introduced measure virtually identical to hr 2373 as hr 1227 in the 108th congress but the bill received further action developments during the 109th congress proposals in the fy2006 budget in the analytical perspectives volume of the presidents budget submission for fy2006 sent to congress on february 7 2005 several budget process reform proposals were endorsed by the president among the actions requested the administration called for establishment of federal sunset commission to provide process by which programs undergo the regular scrutiny brought about by having to defend their existence programs would be reviewed according to schedule enacted by congress the commission would consider proposals to retain restructure or terminate programs programs would automatically terminate according to the schedule unless congress took some action to reauthorize them14 13 daniel j bryant assistant attorney general department of justice letter to rep dave weldon chairman of the house subcommittee on civil service census and agency organization apr 23 2002 copy provided to author by subcommittee staff 14 us office of management and budget fiscal year 2006 analytical perspectives washington gpo 2005 p 242 crs5 discussion of reform proposals in the fy2006 budget submission also called for creation of results commissions to consider and revise administration proposals to improve the performance of programs or agencies by restructuring or consolidating them congress would establish results commission to address particular program or policy area where duplicative or overlapping functions are found if the president were to approve commission reform proposal the measure then would be considered by congress under expedited procedures legislative proposals and action in march 2005 during house consideration of hconres 95 the fy2006 budget resolution representative hensarling offered substitute amendment on behalf of the republican study committee rsc section 503 of the hensarling amendment contained sense of the house provision that legislation providing for the orderly abolishment of obsolete agencies and providing federal sunset for government programs should be enacted during this congress15 although the amendment was opposed by the house leadership and defeated by vote of 102320 sense of the senate provision regarding commission to review the performance of programs was included in hconres 95 as reported from conference and agreed to by both chambers16 the senate language appeared to reflect the results commission idea more than sunset although neither type of commission was explicitly referenced provisions for commission to eliminate waste fraud and abuse commission arguably similar to that envisaged in the sense of the senate language were included in an omnibus budget reform bill hr 2290 the family budget protection act of 2005 introduced on may 11 2005 on june 30 2005 omb released legislative proposal titled the government reorganization and program performance improvement act of 2005 to create the framework for the two types of commissions sunset and results mentioned in the fy2006 budget submission bills incorporating the draft language were introduced in both chambers on july 14 2005 senator craig thomas introduced s 1399 in most respects mirroring the language in the omb proposal in the house two bills were introduced the government reorganization and improvement of performance act hr 3276 introduced by representative jon porter with representative tom davis and representative kevin brady as cosponsors would have authorized the establishment of results commissions the federal agency performance review and sunset act hr 3277 introduced by representative brady for himself and representatives davis and porter would have established sunset 15 see congressional record vol 151 mar 17 2005 daily ed p h1639 16 for further background on the budget resolution see crs report rl32791 congressional budget actions in 2005 by bill heniff jr sec 502 reads it is the sense of the senate that commission should be established to review federal agencies and programs within such agencies including an assessment of programs on an accrual basis and legislation to implement those recommendations with the express purpose of providing congress with recommendations to realign or eliminate government agencies and programs that are wasteful duplicative inefficient outdated irrelevant or have failed to accomplish their intended purpose crs6 commission sc and review process for the federal government on july 14 representative brady also reintroduced his sunset commission bill as hr 3282 hr 3277 unlike hr 3282 would have required that the schedule for review and termination of agencies and programs be enacted into statute arguably key factor in concerns of constitutionality provisions relating to the establishment and functioning of the sunset commission in hr 3277 and in section 4 of s 1399 were very similar but the structure and language in the two bills were not identical both would have established federal sunset commission consisting of seven members to be appointed by the president in consultation with congressional leaders programs and agencies were to be reviewed by the commission at least once every 10 years according to the schedule for review proposed by the president and enacted into law the commission was to be empowered to obtain information from federal agencies to hold hearings and to consider any publicly available evaluations and assessments including those by omb the bills would have required the commission to use six stipulated criteria in conducting the reviews including cost effectiveness and extent of duplication or conflict with other agencies and programs the commission would have provided the president with an annual report containing its assessment of each agency and program reviewed during the preceding year along with its recommendations on how to improve the results achieved and whether to abolish any agency or program the president would have then submitted his recommendations to congress on the respective agencies and programs along with the report of the sunset commission and any draft legislation needed to implement the recommendations program or agency was to be abolished two years after the date of submission of the presidents recommendation regarding its future unless the agency or program was reauthorized or received up to twoyear deadline extension pursuant to law the senate bill differed from the omb draft and hr 3277 with respect to at least one significant feature both the omb draft and hr 3277 contained noteworthy exemption with regard to certain regulations and their enforcement regulations to protect the environment health safety or civil rights shall sunset under this act nor shall any program relating to enforcing said regulations sunset unless provision is made for the continued enforcement of those regulations provisions for exemptions from sunset termination were not found in s 1399 on september 27 2005 the house subcommittee on federal workforce and agency organization held hearing on hr 3276 and hr 3277 testimony was received from an omb official and from five witnesses from the private sector17 in may 2006 the house leadership announced plans to bring sunset legislation quickly to the house floor

tiarht which was to create commission on the accountability and review of federal agencies carfa modeled on the base realignment and closure commission brac approach18 although it addressed similar concerns to those of sunset measure the carfa approach did not contain an actionforcing mechanism whereby agencies and programs would terminate absent congressional action whereas hr 3282 and hr 3277 did have such provisions on july 14 2006 representative tiahrt introduced revised version of hr 2470 as hr 5766 on july 19 the house government reform committee held hearing on hr 3282 and hr 5766 receiving testimony in support from representatives brady and tiahrt and from two private sector witnesses who opposed the bills19 markup of both bills followed the next day on july 20 2006 hr 5766 as amended was reported favorably by vote of 1512 and hr 3282 by vote of 1514 both largely along straight party lines20 floor action on both bills had been scheduled for june 27 but house leaders apparently concerned with growing opposition decided to postpone action further action occurred in the 109th congress developments in the 110th congress on february 5 2007 president bush in his budget submission for fy2008 again endorsed creation of federal sunset commission and called for enactment of bill incorporating provisions of the administrations proposal sent to congress in 2005 the sunset commission would consider presidential proposals to retain restructure or terminate agencies and programs according to schedule set by congress agencies and programs would automatically terminate

analytical perspectives continued crs8 support for results commissions rc was also reiterated results commissions would consider and revise administration proposals to restructure or consolidate programs or agencies to improve their performance22 in the budget submission for fy2009 transmitted on february 4 2008 president bush reaffirmed his support for federal sunset commission in reviewing the need for such structure the discussion in one of the budget documents stated the following the federal governments ability to serve the american people is often hampered by poorly designed programs or uncoordinated overlapping programs trying to achieve the same objective today almost 25 percent of assessed programs on which the government spends almost 150 billion year have been determined to be either ineffective or unable to demonstrate results23 in the 110th congress senator john cornyn introduced new sunset measure s 1731 the united states authorization and sunset commission act on june 28 2007 congressman brady introduced hr 5794 bill virtually identical to hr 3282 109th congress renamed the federal sunset review act of 2008 on april 15 2008 summary of provisions in hr 5794 hr 5794 would create federal agency sunset commission fasc to review the efficiency of and public need for federal agencies and would provide for the abolishment of agencies for which public need does not exist the fasc would consist of 12 members appointed by the speaker of the house and the senate majority leader of the six members appointed by the leaders of the respective chambers four would be members of congress with not more than two from the same political party within one year after its establishment the commission would submit to congress schedule for the review of all federal agencies and advisory committees by the commission at least once every 12 years and for the abolishment of each agency following the review absent congressional reauthorization agencies performing similar or related functions would be scheduled for review at the same time then the commission would commence its annual reviews utilizing the 19 criteria specified in the bill in reviewing and evaluating the efficiency and public need for each agency by september 1 of each subsequent year the commission would report to the president and congress and recommend whether each agency reviewed that year should be abolished or reorganized and whether functions of other agencies should be consolidated transferred or reorganized the fasc would also submit draft legislation to carry out the recommendations 21 continued washington gpo 2007 p 220 22 ibid 23 us office of management and budget fiscal year 2009 analytical perspectives washington gpo 2008 p 225 crs9 under the sunset provisions in the bill an agency would be abolished within one year of the commissions review unless the agency received statutory extension the bill would allow the deadline for abolishing an agency to be extended for an additional two years by legislation enacted by super majority of the house of representatives and the senate the commission also would report to congress on all legislation introduced that would establish new agency or new program to be carried out by an existing agency hr 5794 would direct the comptroller general of the government accountability office and the director of the congressional budget office in cooperation with the director of the congressional research service to prepare an inventory of federal programs within each agency for the purpose of advising and assisting congress and the commission in carrying out the requirements of the act summary of provisions in s 1731 s 1731 would create the united states authorization and sunset commission usasc with membership consisting of four representatives and four senators appointed by the speaker of the house and the senate majority leader respectively with more than two from each chamber of the same political party the bill would require the usasc to submit to congress not later than 18 months after this acts enactment and at least once every 10 years thereafter legislative proposal referred to as the commission schedule and review bill that would include schedule of review and abolishment of agencies and programs the bill would require that the schedule contain time line for review by the usasc and proposed abolishment of 1 at least 25 as measured in dollars of unauthorized agencies or programs and 2 if applicable at least 25 of the programs identified by the office of management and budget omb through its program assessment rating tool program or similar review program as ineffective or results not demonstrated the bill would require that agencies performing similar or related functions be reviewed concurrently s 1731 sets forth criteria that would be used by the usasc in conducting its reviews the bill would require the usasc to submit to congress and the president every two years report that analyzes and includes as appropriate proposals and legislative provisions to reauthorize reorganize consolidate expand or transfer any agency or program having undergone its scheduled review both the schedule and review bill and legislative proposals accompanying reports from the usasc would be subject to expedited procedures during their consideration by congress comparing provisions in sunset commission bills table 1 provides an overview of selected features in the two sunset commission bills which have been introduced in the 110th congress s 1731 and hr 5794 and in the legislative proposal in 2005 from the bush administration for federal sunset commissions introduced as hr 3277 in the 109th congress the following discussion highlights some similarities and differences among the measures crs10 the bills are similar with respect to scope of coverage the two bills in the 110th congress refer to the definition of federal agency in 5 usc 105 in all three bills however the actual coverage would be dependent upon decisions taken subsequent to enactment hr 3277 109th congress provides that all programs and agencies would be reviewed at least once every 10 years but the president would propose the coverage contingent on approval by congress in hr 5794 and s 1731 the sunset commission would submit to congress the schedule for review with respect to membership under the administration proposal the president would appoint the seven members four in consultation with congressional leaders hr 5794 provides for 12member bipartisan commission with six named respectively by the speaker of the house and the senate majority leader eight members concurrently would be serving in congress to be joined by four from outside eight members of congress would make up the entire membership of the bipartisan commission to be established pursuant to s 1731 all three bills call for the commission chair to appoint staff director s 1731 would have the chair appoint other personnel as needed whereas the other two bills would delegate appointment of other staff to the director with regard to administrative support the two house bills would have the general services administration gsa provide such services to the commission on reimbursable basis in contrast s 1731 would authorize the commission to receive administrative support services from gsa or gao on nonreimbursable basis all three bills contain actionforcing mechanisms to terminate programs and agencies following the sunset reviews unless reauthorized in law hr 3277 would terminate programs and agencies two years after the date of submission to congress by the president of recommendations along with the report of the commission while provisions in hr 5794 would abolish an agency within one year of the commissions review absent statutory extension both house bills would allow for enactment of legislation extending the deadline for abolishing an agency for an additional two years s 1731 would abolish any agency or program two years after the commission completes its review absent reauthorization the three bills each specify criteria to utilize in carrying out the program reviews hr 5794 arguably contains the strongest provisions for transparency and public involvement in the sunset reviews with respect to information gathering hr 5794 requires that the fasc shall conduct public hearings and provide an opportunity for public comment on the abolishment of the agency the fasc also shall also consult with the chairman and ranking minority member of the congressional oversight committees as well as gao and omb the administration bill provides that the sunset commission sc should hold public hearings and meetings to the extent appropriate and consult with gao relevant inspectors general and the relevant committees in congress there is reference to public hearings or public comment in s 1731 the bill simply provides that the usasc in carrying out the provisions of the act may hold hearings take testimony and receive evidence table 1 shows two other instances where certain features are found in two of the bills but not the third hr 3277 109th congress and s 1731 provide crs11 expedited procedures for congressional action on the review schedule and in s 1731 the expedited procedures would apply as well to the commission schedule and review bill and other legislative proposals submitted to congress by the usasc expedited procedures are included in hr 5794 on the other hand hr 3277 and hr 5794 both contain provisions for compilation of program inventory by the legislative support agencies whereas s 1731 does not call for program inventory all of the bills authorize appropriation of funds to carry out the duties of the respective commissions hr 3277 109th congress and s 1731 contain typical such sums as may be necessary language for authorizations while hr 5794 would require that amounts appropriated for commission operations be offset by reductions in spending for other programs finally all three bills include sunset provisions for the commission itself under hr 3277 109th congress the commission would terminate on december 31 2026 under hr 5794 on december 31 2033 and under s 1731 on december 31 2037 brief overview of arguments for and against sunset commissions supporters of sunset commission measures suggest that there are too many overlapping and ineffective federal programs that contribute to the growing federal deficit and that the existing structure of congressional committees does not encourage systematic review of similar agencies and programs according to sunset proponents congressional reviews of many programs are sporadic and inadequate as evidenced by the number of unauthorized appropriations an actionforcing mechanism such as threat of termination is necessary sunset commission would assist congress in performing its oversight function thereby reducing fraud waste and abuse president bush has alluded to some of these factors in support of sunset commission in his recent budget submissions advocates of federal sunset commission sometimes contend that the viability and usefulness of sunset commissions has been demonstrated in states such as texas in his remarks accompanying the introduction of s 1731 senator cornyn stated the following the bill is modeled after the sunset process that the state of texas instituted in 1977 to identify and eliminate waste duplication and inefficiency in government agencies this process has led to the elimination of dozens of agencies that have outlived their usefulness and has saved texas taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars24 some figures regarding the outcome of sunset reviews in texas have already been noted with respect to the fiscal impact of commission recommendations the texas sunset advisory commission has reported estimates from reviews conducted between 1982 and 2007 indicate potential 25year savings of 24 sen john cornyn remarks accompanying the introduction of s 1731 congressional record daily edition vol 154 june 28 2007 p s8703 crs12 approximately 7845 million compared with expenditures of 249 million for the sunset commission from these estimates one may infer that texas has earned more than 31 in return for each dollar spent on the sunset process25 critics of the sunset commission measures counter that such bills would burden congress with tremendous workload for mandatory reauthorization of agencies and programs and might prove infeasible to carry out or alternatively result in perfunctory reviews sunset commission might increase congressional personnel costs since additional staff would be needed to assist the commission in its review activities opponents of sunset commissions also contend that the review and reauthorization process would pose special threat to programs serving diffuse and unorganized constituencies federal programs providing safety net for the most vulnerable in society might be especially endangered some disapproving of federal sunset commission further note that key feature of the sunset process is that programs and agencies would terminate after the submission of the commissions report and recommendations to congress unless they receive statutory extensions this means that following congressional approval of reauthorization bill the measure would have to go to the president in order to be signed into law if the president were to veto the bill twothirds majority in both chambers would be necessary to override the veto and extend the life of the program or agency the possibility of popular program or agency being eliminated by president with the support of one third of the house and senate arguably would represent significant transfer of power from congress to the executive branch 25 sunset advisory commission guide to the texas sunset process jan 2008 p 11 crs13 table 1 selected features in three measures to
