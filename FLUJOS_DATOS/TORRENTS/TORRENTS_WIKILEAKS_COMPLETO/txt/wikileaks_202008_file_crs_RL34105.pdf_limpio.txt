enforcement cse program was enacted in 1975 as federalstatelocal partnership to help strengthen families by securing financial support from noncustodial parents fa milies receiving cash welfare from the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant must assign turn over rights to child support received fro m noncustodial parents to the state to reimburse it and the federal government for their welfare costs states decide whether to pay any of the child support co llected for tanf families to the family the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 provides incentives for states to allow more of the child support collected on behalf of tanf families to go to the family without reduction in welf are benefits under dra beginning in october 2008 the federal govern ment will share in the cost of passing through up to 100 per month for family with one ch ild and up to 200 per month for family of two or more children of collected ch ild support to tanf families this report illustrates the potential impact of the dra policy on families and governments in six states ca il md ok and wv chosen because of their diversity in both tanf and predra child support passthrough policies it shows the direct effects of what if the states fully adopted the dra policy the dra policies can increase the incomes of tanf cash welfare family consisting of mother and two children by up to 200 per month this can be substantial supplement to tanf cash benef its actual income increases depend on how much child support is paid by the nonc ustodial parent pr edra state policies the amount of other income including earnings of the family and tanf benefit rules the dra has its greatest impact on families with income other than child support it mainly affects families who receive tanf it does not directly affect families with incomes too high to receive t anf in some states family of three with minimum wage earner the new fully phasedin federal minimum wage of 725 per hour pl 11028 at 20 hours per week is ine ligible for tanf in most states family with fulltime minimum wage earner is ineligible for tanf the increased passthrough and disreg ard of child support for tanf families also has its costs disregarding add itional child support when determining tanf financial eligibility can make additional families eligible for tanf the cost of increasing family income through dras enhanced passthrough and disregard is often borne by reductions in child support collections kept by the state and federal governments however sometimes the cost could be borne through increased tanf spending the dra rules reduce the cost of the passthrough and disregard more for poorer states than fo r higherincome states this report provides limited discussion of dras effect on former tanf families the report addre sses only the direct effects of adopting the dra child support passthrough and disr egard adoption of dra child support policies might have other indirect be

selected states introduction on average child support constitutes 17 of family income for households who receive it among poor households that r eceive it child support constitutes about 30 of family income1 during the last several years the importance of child support payments as an income source for singleparent families has garnered national attention the 7th annual report on the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant program indicates that 23 of adult tanf recipients have jobs2 although this is good news relative to earlier years welfare studies have found that many of these recipients and exrecipients end up with lowwage jobs thus child support is critical factor in helping lowincome families become self supporting in 2003 the average yearly child support payment received by custodial parents with payments was 4647 for mothers about 20 more than the average amount received by fathers 3906 these full or partial payments repr esented 17 of the custodial mothers total yearly income nd 8 of the custodial fathers in 2003 child support represented 19 of the inco of the 33 million custodial parents who received all of the child support that they were owed3 however most child support received on behalf of families receiving tanf cash welfare is kept by the federal govern ment and the states rather than paid to families this is because t anf families must assign rn over legal rights to child support paid by noncustodial parents on their behalf to the state to reimburse governments for welfare costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34105crs2 4 this report only examines earnings child support income and tanf cash benefits it does not discuss how higher amounts of child support distributed to family might result in benefit reductions in other programs such as food stamps for an analysis of the effect of more generous child support passthrough and disregard policy on various programs and income streams see the urban institute benefits and costs of increased child support distribution to current and former welfare recipients final report by laura wheaton and elaine sorensen with victoria russell and jeff versteeg october 16 2005 available at httpaspehhsgovhsp05csdisttanfindexhtmthe deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 enacted february 8 2006 provides incentives for states to allow more of the child support collected on behalf of tanf families to go to the family and most if not all of the child support collected on behalf of former tanf families to go to the family this is referred to as child support passthrough see page 7 adoption of this family first policy is intended to help former tanf families stay selfsufficient and to encourage cooperation with child support enforcemen t efforts by custodial and noncustodial parents by allowing the family to keep mo re or all of the child support paid on its behalf under dra effective octobe r 1 2008 if state passes through child support payment and disregards it as countab income the fede ral government will waive its share of the child support coll ections up to 100 per month for one child or up to 200 per month for two or more ch ildren see page 12 this is referred to as disregard this report illustrates what if scenarios if six states california illinois maine maryland oklahoma and west vi rginia were to adopt the dra child support passthrough and disr egard policies for tanf families the states were selected because of their diversity of both current child support passthrough and disregard policies and tanf benefit amounts it is not known whether any of these states are currently contemplating adopting the dra rules the analysis shows the financial impact4 on mother with two children in specified earnings categorie s under current child support distribution rules and under the dra rules it also provides an analysis of the change in the distribution of child support among the state federal governme nt and the family under current rules and under dra rules this repor t includes three appendices appendix discusses and presents detailed tables showing the imp act of predra and dra policy on mother with two children in each of the six states appendix b discusses and presents detailed tables showing the impact of pr edra and dra policy on the distribution of child support collections among families the state and the federal government in each of the six states appendix c provides background information on the dra provisions that affect former tanf familieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34105crs3 key findings this report examines the financial impact of adoption of the deficit reduction act dra provisions related to the child support passthrough and disregard policy on tanf families state governments particularly california illinois maine maryland oklahoma and west virginia and the federal gove rnment the major findings are described below the dra provides an incentive for st ates to have passthrough and disregard policy by requiring the fe deral government to share in the cost by foregoing the federal share of the child support collected from the noncustodial parent on beha lf of tanf family the dra requires the federal government to share in the cost of passing through and disregarding up to 200 per month for tanf family with two or more children if state that currently has pass through and disregard policy conti nues with its existing disregard amounts the state would fina ncially benefit from the dra provisions for the state would l onger have to fund the policy at its own expense if state opts for the full 200 passthrough and disregard in mostcases there would be cost to the state the cost would depend on whether the state had predra passthrough and disregard policy the amount of the disregard whethe r the family becomes eligible for tanf because of the passthrough and disregard the custodial parents earnings and other income tanf benefit rules regarding treatment of income and the federal medical assistance percentage fmap which determines the federal and state share of child support collections the dra provisions would reduce the cost of the passthrough and disregard policy more for poorer states than for higherincome states poorer states must currently send back to the federal government greater share of ch ild support collections than higher income states for example west virginia sends back 7282 of its child support collections to th federal government whereas maryland sends back 5000 of its collections under the dra passthrough and disregard policy the poorer state west virginia would not have to send back th federal governments share 7282 of child support collec tions instead the federal government would be required to forego its share of child support collections the cost of passthrough and di sregard policy generally would be higher for the federal government than for the states however in the case in which family becomes eligible for tanf payments because of the dra child support passthrough and disregard given the assumptions of this report st ate governments would incur higher costs than the federal governme nt this report considers tanf expenditures to be state expenditures in most cases individual families would benefit from the draprovisions the dra passthrough and disregard provisions couldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34105crs4 5 for more information see crs report rs22380 child support enforcement program basics by carmen solomonfearsincrease the income of tanf parent with two children by as much as 200 per month family ineligible for tanf because its counted earnings arehigher than its states income eligibility threshold would see increase in income from implementing the dra passthrough and disregard provisions under the po licies in effect in january 2007 and under the new fully phase din minimum wage of 725 per hour families in many states are in eligible for tanf even at 20 hours of work per week among th six states closely examined in this report only in california would mother of two working 40 hours per week at 725 per hour be eligible for tanf based on january 2007 rules the interests of the child suppor t enforcement cse program and cse families are not always compatible the interests of family are usually entirely financial it is in the best interest of family to get the highest amount of income available to it thus the higher the child support passthrough and disr egard amount the more family would potentially benefit however from cse program perspective the more dollars that the program has to invest in cse activities eg parent location paternity establishment support order establishment collection of child support payments the better the program can serve its entire clientele thus for many states the ability to retain child support coll ections outweighs the value of passthrough and disregard policy particularly since the pass through and disregard does not be nefit persons who never received cash tanf benefits such persons represented 39 of the cse caseload in fy2006 background the cse program title ivd of the soci security act was enacted in 1975 as federalstatelocal partnership to help strengthen families by securing financial support from noncustodial parents it also was enacted to lower the government costs of providing cash welfare to families with ab sent parents by collecting child support from noncustodial parents that could help keep families off welfare or by using those collections to reimburse states and the fe deral government for the cost of making welfare payments all 50 states the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands operate cse programs and are entitled to fede ral matching funds in addition native american tribes can ope rate cse programs w ith federal funding5 all families with children who live apart from one of their parents are eligible for cse services families receiving tanf benefits title iva of the social security act title ive foster care payments or medicaid title xix coveragehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34105crs5 6 federal law requires that families who receive tanf benefits andor medicaid benefits must assign their rights to child support paym ents to the state in order to receive the respective program benefits the title ive foster care program requires the assignment of child support rights in appropriate cases 7 pl 109171 effective october 1 2006 requires families that have never been on tanf to pay 25 annual user fee when child suppor t enforcement efforts on their behalf are successful ie at least 500 annually is collect ed on their behalf according to section 4546bii of the social secu rity act the annual 25 fee may be 1 retained by the state from child support collected on behalf of the custodial parent but not from the first 500 collected in given federal fiscal year or 2 paid by the custodial parent who is applying for cse services or 3 recovered ie colle cted from the noncustodial parent or 4 paid by the state out of state fundsautomatically qualify for cse services free of charge6 other families must apply for cse services and states must charge an application fee that cannot exceed 25 the application fee may be paid by the state the noncustodial parent or the custodial parent7 child support collected through the cse sy stem on behalf of families who never received cash welfare goes to the family us ually through the state disbursement unit however most collections on behalf of families currently receiving cash welfare from tanf are used to reimburse state nd federal governments for tanf payments made to the family the fact that cash we lfare families directly receive only small fraction of child support paid to them s been an ongoing policy concern as the program has increasingly emphasized its role in adding to the income of families with children and deemphasized its welfare costrecovery role reinforcing this shift in emphasis has been the large declines in the cash welfare rolls themselves cash welfare paym ents fell from 25 billion in fy1995 to about 10 billion in fy2005 meaning that there are far fewer costs to recoup the number of families receiving cash welfar fell during this period from bout 5 million to 2 million thus the rules affecting those cu rrently on the rolls reach fewer families and affect fewer dollars than they did in the mid1990s the decline in the cash welfare caseload is also reflected in the changing composition of the cse caseload the com ponent of the caseload that is comprised of tanf families is shrinking in fy2006 only 15 of the cse caseload was comprised of tanf familie s compared to 21 in fy1999 and 38 in fy1996 even though overall child support collections increased by 51 over the sevenyear period fy1999fy2006 child support collections made on behalf of tanf families decreased by 33 thus the policy shif t from using the cse program to recover welfare costs to using it as mechanism to consistently and re liably get child support income to families is not surprising in fy2006 only 4 of cse collections 985 million was made on be half of tanf families about 14 of that amount went to the families pursuant to state ch ild support pass through provisions and the rest was divided between the state and federal governments to reimburse them for tanf benefits paid to the families in fy2006 91 of cse collections 218 billion went to the families on the cse rolls the comparable figure in fy1999 was 85 135 billion and the comparable figure in fy1996 was 80 96 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34105crs6 8 the aid to families with dependent children afdc program was tanfs predecessor program replaced by tanf in 1996 by pl 104193 the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996in fy2006 the largest group of fa milies who were participating in the cse program were families who had left the tanf rolls ie former tanf families 46 families who had never been on tanf represented 39 of the cse caseload and families who were currently receiving tanf benefits compri sed 15 of the cse caseload thus although the majority of the cse caseload is composed of non tanf families 85 most of them at some point in their lives received tanfafdc8 61 this is consistent w ith the expanded mission of the cse program the expectation is that as ch ild support becomes more consistent and stable income sourcesupport these former tanf families will ne ver have to return to the tanf rolls and families that had not resorted to the tanf program will never have to do so rules that apply to families receiving tanf cash welfare tanf cash welfare is available to families that meet test of financial need with the test determined by the states familys income including child support must be below specified income threshold determined by the state to qualify for tanf cash welfare if child support coll ections exceed the tanf benefit the family may lose tanf eligibility as its countable income would be too high to qualify for tanf and instead it would receive the child support tanf cash welf are family is required to coope rate with the cse system tanf recipients must help in establishing the paternity of the familys children further recipients must turn over rights to any child support paid on behalf of the children while the family is on welfare to the state the state then decides whether to pay any received child support to the family the rules governing division of child support collected on behalf of families comprise 1 assignment 2 distribution 3 passthrough and 4 disr egard rules special rules also apply in certain states called gap states based on their historical treatment of child support in determining cash welfare benefits note that some different rules apply for payment of support that is currently due compared with pastdue support arrearag the current child support pass through and disregard rules are only appli cable to tanf families and only pertain to current child support payments if tanf family receives child support payments that are considered arrearages those arrearage payments are kept by the state and federal government this report focuses on collections of current support however one purpose of the dra is to increase the economic independence of former tanf families by giving states the option of providing such families with all of the child support collected on their behalf appendix c briefly discusses dra provisions that affect former tanf families assignment as noted above when family applies for tanf cash welfare the custodial parent must assign that is legally turn over the right to the state for child support collected on her or his be half while the family receives tanfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34105crs7 9 for an explanation of the medicaid matching rate see crs report rl32950 medicaid the federal medical assistance percentage fmap by april gradybenefits the state reta ins support collections up to the cumulative amount of tanf benefits which have been paid to the family if child support collections are less than the tanf benefit the collections remain legally with the state and are then subject to the distribution passthrough nd disregard rules discussed below distribution as already discussed when the cse program was first enacted in 1975 one of its primary goals was to r ecover the costs of providing cash welfare to families with children to accomplish this costrecovery goal child support collected on behalf of families receiving cash welfare was used to offset benefit costs and was shared between the federal and stat governments the sharing arrangement was based on how the federal g overnment and states shared the cost of paying cash welfare benefits under the pre1996 progra m of aid to families with dependent children afdc under old afdc law th rate at which stat were reimbursed by the federal government for the costs of cash welfare was the medicaid matching rate which is now usually referred to as the federal medical assistance percentage fmap which varies inversely with st ate per capita income ie poor states have higher federal matching rate wealthy stat have lower fede ral matching rate consequently the share of child support coll ections to be distributed to the federal government and states also was ba sed on the medicaid matching rate the afdc program required that the fi rst 50 in child support collected had to be distributed to the family passedthrough see below and remaining collections be split between the federal and state g overnments according the medicaid matching rate if state had 50 matching rate the federal gove rnment was reimbursed 50 for each 100 in remaining child support co llections if state had 70 federal matching rate the federal govern ment was reimbursed 70 for each 100 in remaining collections in the first exam ple the state kept 50 and in the second example the state kept 30 thus states with larger fmap kept smaller portion of the child support collections the ma tch ranged from minimum of 50 to statutory maximum of 839 although afdc was replaced by the tanf block grant under the welfare reform law of 1996 the same matching ra procedure for cse collections is still used however the mandatory 50 passthr ough was eliminated except for families in states that allow child support to fill the gap between the cash welfare benefit and need discussed below the full amount of current child support collected on behalf of cash welfare families is divided between the federal and state governments based on the medicaid matching rate the federal government thus is still reimbursed for its share of tanf welfare costs even though tanf is block grant program rather than an openended entitlement program passthrough though states are required to pay to the federal government the federal share of child support collections they have full discretion over the state share of collections made on behalf of welfare families they decide whether to keep the collections or passthrough ch ild support to families if state does not passthrough any child support collections and the child support collected ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34105crs8 10 in these states the afdc need standard which was the amount the state deemed needed for family of certain size to subsist in that state was larger than the states afdc maximum benefit amount which was the maximu m amount of money that the state paid family of given size in monthly afdc benefits 11 federal register vol 51 158 department of health and human services office of family assistance aid to families with dependent children and child support continuedinsufficient to lift the familys income bove the states tanf eligibility limit the family receives its full tanf grant ie not reduced by the child support payment passing through child support means that family receives an identifiable amount ie separate check parate from the welfare bene fit based upon child support collected from the noncustodial parent whether the welf are benefit is then reduced by the amount of the child support passed through depends on the states disregard policy discussed below disregard states decide whether to treat child support payments as income to the family in determining tanf eligibility and benefits if state does pass through some child support but does not disregard it when determining tanf eligibility and benefits the familys tanf grant is reduced by 1 for each 1 in child support collections though the family recei ves some of the child support collected on its behalf its total income is not increased disregard of child support income means that family can keep certain amount of child support without reducti on in its tanf benefits or potentially losing tanf eligibility therefore 50 disregard of child support means that up to 50 of child support collections does not affect familys tanf eligibility or benefits 200 disregard of child suppor t means that up to 200 of child support does not affect familys tanf eligibility or benefits fillthegap states before the cse program was enacted child support was paid directly to the custodial parent when child support was paid to family receiving afdc the child support was c ounted as income in determining the familys afdc eligibility and the amount of afdc benefits paid to the family in most states it resulted in correspondi ng dollarfordollar decrease in the afdc benefit paid to the family however some states used afdc benefit calculation methods that did not result in full do llar reduction for each dollar received as income these states paid less money than their full need standard10 and some permitted afdc recipients to use their own income to make up all or some of the difference between the afdc payment and th standard of need this

of pl 93647 families were able to receive child support bonus ie up to 20 per month in addition to the maximum afdc benefit available to them but they longer had access to the child support income which they previously were able to use to fillthegap between the maximum afdc benefit payment and the states need standard this meant that some families were made worse off by the new cse program 13 although the cse program was enacted by pl 93647 on january 4 1975 most of the provisions of the program did not go into effect until july 1 1975 14 the number and names of these jurisdictions are based on unpublished information from the former us department of health education and welfare 15 the remaining eight jurisdictions that had fillthegap policies in july 1975 but that longer have such

afdc families in states referred to as fillthegap states in essence before the cse program was implemented in some states afdc families were permitted to fill all or part of the gap between the states

income and the fillthegap procedure was nullified12 pl 9488 enacted august 9 1975 addre ssed these concerns by requiring that monthly supplemental payments often referred to as gap payments be made to afdc recipients who would receive less disposable income because of the new rules than they would have received pr ior to july 1975 when the new child support rules took effect section 402a28 of the

collected on tanf familys behalf to be passe d through to the family without negatively impacting the familys tanf payment ie with concurrent disregard of the passthrough amount other states have child support passthrough policies but do not disregard the income when determining tanf eligib ility or payment amounts thus while the state may send all or portion of current child support collections to tanf families the state simultaneously reduces the fa milys tanf grant by the amount passed through as of april 2007 27 states have pass through or disregard policy 12 states pass

enacted february 8 2006 seeks to provide stable source of income for all single parent families with noncus todial parent it simp lifies cse assignment and distribution rules and strengthens the familyfirst policie s started in the 1996 welfare reform law17 the dra provides incentives to states in the form of federal cost sharing to direct more of the child support on beha lf of tanf cash welfare families to the families themselves often referred to as family first policy as opposed to using such collections to reimburse state and federal treasuries for welfare benefits paid to families or to finance their child support programs pl 109171 will allow states to pay up to 100 per month or 200 per month for family with two or more children in child support collected on behalf of tanf or foster care family to the family and will not require the state to pay the federal government the federal share of those collections in order for the fede ral government to forgo its share of these child support collections the state is requi red to disregard ie not count the child support collection paid to the family in determining tanf cas h welfare eligibility and benefits18 the next two sections illustrate the eff ects of the dra changes in child support passthrough and disregard policies on both family budget s and federal and state budgets the impact is fairly complex depending on number of factors including the states current tanf policies regardin g eligibility rules benefit amounts and current child support passthrough and disreg ard rules and familys circumstances such as earned income and the amount of child support paid by the noncustodial parent the impact of dra policy is examined in six states california illinois maine maryland oklahoma and west virg inia for mother with two children for this hypothetical family the current tanf and child support policies were simulated using varying assumptions of child support receipt and earnings of family members19 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34105crs14 19 continued simulates the impact of program rules on families and governments for hypothetical families the hypothetical family used in th is report is family with one adult and two children the average welfare family the program allows the simulations of total income tanf benefits and federal and state child support shares for this family when both child support payments of the noncustodial parent and earnings of the custodial parent are varied the simulations are best used to illu strate how policy changes affect specific types of families however the simulations are sp ecific to the assumed characteristics of the hypothetical family and might not reflect the predominate or distributional effects of policy change on the population as wholethe states were chosen based on their child support passthrough and disregard policy and their maximum tanf cash benefit amounts california and illinois both pass through and disregard up to 50 monthly in child support payments california is relatively high tanf benefit state and illinois is relatively low tanf benefit state maryland relatively high benefit state and oklahoma relatively low benefit state do not have child support passthrough and disregard policy west virginia and maine were chosen because they have special rules for treating families with ch ild support maine is gap payment described above state west virginia does not provide child support passthrough nd disregard but gives 25 incentive payment added to the tanf grant for those families with some any amount child support collected on their behalf the next section examines the impact of the dra provisions on family income it is followed by section on how the dra provisions could affect government budgets through tanf the federal share of child support collections and the states share of child support collections impact of dra provisions on family income the dra policies aim to increase the incomes of tanf cash welfare families this is particular policy concern since in all states the maximum tanf cash welfare benefit is only fraction of povertylevel income californias maximum benefit for family of three in ja nuary 2007 was 723 the highest maximum benefit of the six states closely examined in this report but benefit that represents only about half of the 2007 fe deral poverty guideline for family of three allowing family to keep 200 per month in child support increases family income by 14 of the poverty threshold the increase in family income that would result from state implementing dras full passthrough and disregard pr ovisions depends on number of factorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34105crs15 20 the zero per month amount is represented in the table as the tanf grant only columnfor families eligible and receiving tanf welfare before dra rules are implemented the family can see an increase in income for family composed of parent with two children the maximum increase in income would be 200 the increase in income would be less if the noncustodial parent paid less than 200 in child support and less in states that already paid some of the collected child support to tanf cash welfare family implementing the dra passthroug h and disregard rules can make some families newly eligible for tanf cash welfare families with child support income greater than the tanf benefit are ineligible for tanf they receive the co llected child support instead however some such families might be made eligible for tanf if up to 200 in child support were disregarded when determining eligibility for tanf if the family actually receives tanf many eligible families do not its income would increase by some amount family ineligible for tanf b ecause its counted earnings are higher than its states income eligibility threshold would see increase in income from implementing dras passthrough and disregard under the policies in effect in january 2007 and under the new fully phasedin minimum wa ge of 725 per hour families in many states are ineligible for tanf even at 20 hours of work per week among the six states closely examined in this report only in california would mother of two working 40 hours per week at 725 per hour be eligible for t anf based on january 2007 rules the next four tables illustrate the effects of implementing the new dra pass through and disregard rules on family incomes table 2 presents the combined tanf and child support income mother of two would receive under states current passthrough and di sregard policies compared with the amount she would receive if the state implemented the max imum allowed under dra the table shows the combined income for family with zero earnings with child support paid by the noncustodial parent ranging from 0 per month20 to 500 per month shown in 100 increments the tables top panel s hows the combined income under predra policies the middle panel shows combin ed income under dra policies and the bottom panel displays the difference in combined tanf and child support income generally table 2 shows that dra policies would increase this familys combined monthly income by as much as 200 in the two states that currently do not passthrough and disregard child support for tanf welfare families maryland and oklahoma and by up to 150 in states that currently passthrough and disregard the first 50 in child support california and i llinois the simulation assumes that west virginia would end its 25 child support in centive payment and instead adopt dras maximum child support passthr ough and disregard policies this would result in maximum increase in combined child suppor t and tanf welfare income of as much as 175 for this family in west virginia the maximum increase in maine is 150httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34105crs16 it has passthrough and disreg ard of 50 but is also gap state that results in an increase in the income of the hypothetical family by as much as 135 per month the simulation assumes that maine would conti nue to provide this gap payment the amounts discussed above are the maximum increase in combined tanf payments and child support income resu lting from the adoption of dra policies the increase would be less if the noncustodi parent paid less than 200 per month in child support it also would be less in some cases in maine because up to 185 in child support is already paid to the family it also would be less than 200 for some cases in other states those families who would be newly eligible for tanf because of the greater disregard of child support when determin ing tanf eligibility the

21 this roughly corresponds to the average monthly amount of child support received by custodial parents who received child suppor t in 2003 the united states census bureau periodically collects

household census bureau data indicated that among custodial parents with income below the poverty level who received child support the average am ount of child support received in 2003 latest available data was 3713 see us bureau of the census cust odial mothers and fathers and their child support 2003 by timothy s grail current population reports p60230 july 2006table 3 provides more detail on the impact of dra policies on the combined child support and tanf income of hypothe tical mother with zero earnings and two children the table separately shows tanf and child support income under both predra and dra policies assuming that the noncustodial parent makes child support payment of 300 per mont h on behalf of the family21 it also shows the income as percent of the fy2007 federal poverty guidelines dra policies would increase income fo r this family by the maximum 200 per month in maryland and by 150 in calif ornia and illinois in fy2007 200 per month represents 14 of the federal pove rty threshold and 150 represents almost 11 of the poverty threshold thus the additional child suppor t passedthrough and disregarded would significantly supplemen t the familys income the largest tanf benefit in the table is californias 723 per month representing about half the poverty level combined income for the hy pothetical family in california as shown in table 3 would rise to 923 per month or 65 of the poverty threshold under dra policies other states pay lower benefits and thus income from tanf represents smaller percentage of the pove rty threshold so that child support plays an even greater role in lifting family income relative to the poverty level the hypothetical family of three in west virginia would net that states maximum increase of 175 passthrough and disregard of 200 offset by elimination of the 25 child support incentive payment the increase in income in maine is only 115 the 200 disregard plus the gap payment would result in all 300 in child support going to the family in maine compared with 185 in child support going to the family under its predra 50 passthroug h and disregard plus the gap payment in oklahoma the increase in total income from adopting 200 passthrough and disregard would be 192 per month for the hypothetical family of three with earnings this example illustrates how the interaction of the child support disregard and tanf eligibility thresholds can result in reduced impact under predra policies the hypothetical family of thr ee with 300 in child support income per month would be ineligible for tanf cash welfare the 300 in child support is higher than the maximum tanf grant of 292 per month in oklahoma thus under predra rules the family would receive 300 in child support but tanf benefit however if oklahoma adopted 200 child support passthrough and disregard the family would become eligible for tanf cas h welfare its countable child support income would be 100 300 minus the 200 disregarded so the family would receive the 292 tanf cash grant plus 200 in child support the state and federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34105crs18 government would keep the other 100 in ch ild support the net gain to the family would be 192 292 tanf cash grant minus the 100 in child support kept by the state the oklahoma example also illustrates how an increased child support pass through and disregard expands eligibility for cash welfare that is the hypothetical family of three with child support of 300 is ineligible for tanf if child support is disregarded but becomes eligible if 200 of child support is

families and disregarded by the state in determining tanf eligibility may be counted by the state toward meeting its moe requirement for this analysis any costs of child support passthrough or disregard financed via tanf is considered to be borne by the state federal tanf grants to the state are generally fixed and do not change based on how much state pays in cash welfare or its child support passthrough and disregard po licies the moe amount for state is also fixed in order to finance child support passthrough and disregard through tanf the state must forgo using tanf or moe funds for other purposes 23 in other words the cost of the dra pass through and disregard policies could come from increased tanf expenditures examples show n in the previous section of this report show that some families ineligible for tanf without the passthrough and disregard would become eligible for tanf cash welfare because of the passthrough and disregard if they actually receive tanf cash welfare many eligible families do not in fact takeup receipt of tanf cash welfare the cost of the change to dra policies could be borne by tanf continuedimpact of dra provisions on the states and the federal government increasing the child support passthroug h and disregard could increase the income of some tanf welfare families but at cost to both federal and state governments under predra law the cost of passingthrough and disregarding child support collected for welfare families is borne by states they finance child support paid to welfare families from the stat share of child support collections and through tanf22 the dra provides financial incentive to states to passthrough and disregard more child support collected on behalf of tanf cash welfare families by reducing its cost to the state and shifting some of these costs to the federal government however the way costs are shifted is fairly complex for many families the cost to the state would be lowered by shifting it to the federal governme nt which would see reduced federal share of child support co llections flowing to the federal treasury for other families however the costs of switching to the dra policies would actually be borne by the state through increasing tanf cash welfare expenditures this would occur in cases when disregarding additiona l child support makes families newly eligible for tanf and they actually receive the tanf cash for which they become eligible table 6 shows how the cost of increasin g family income under dra provisions through the child support passthrough and di sregard would be borne by the federal government and the states for family whose noncustodial parent pays 300 per month in child support for many hypothe tical families shown on the table greater share of the cost

arrangements for the states vary depending on their fmap poorer states must send back to the federal government greater share of child support collections than higher income st ates for example west virginia sends back 7282 of its child support collec tions maryland sends back 5000 of its collections under predra policies poor er state has relatively small share of child support collections to pa ss through to cash welfare fa milies for example if noncustodial parent pays 300 in ch ild support collections west virginia only retains 82 200 passthrough cannot be paid for through west virginias share of child support collections under dra policies the federal govern ment generally would bear greater share of the higher passthrough and disregar d in poorer states compared to better off states for west virginia the federal government would pick up ie forego 7282 of the 200 passthr ough under dra policies 146 for family with earnings on the other hand for maryla nd the federal government would pick up 5000 or 100 of the 200 passthrough fo r family with zero earnings however the relationship between state income and costsharing of the dra passthrough and disregard is different when tanf picks up the cost the higher the tanf benefit the higher the cost to the state of adopting the dra passthrough and disregard also the lower the states percapita income the higher the fmap and the lower the state share is to offset higher welfare costs that might result from the dra passthrough and disregard policy table 6 illustrates the complexity of how the states and federal government would share the cost of the dra passthr ough and disregard with regard to the custodial parent with earnings for the first four states shown the increased pass through and disregard would be paid for by reduction in the federal share of child support collections reduction in the state share of child support collections or reduction in both the federal and state shares of child support collections however in oklahoma the impleme ntation of dra passthrough and disregard policy would result in the hypothetical family with earnings and child support income of 300 per month gaining 192 in extra income each month through the tanf program before dra the family kept the entire 300 of child support and was ineligible for tanf pursuant to dra the family would keep 200 per month in child support income and become eligible for 292 in tanf payments for total monthly income of 492 this add itional income to the family would be paid for by the state with tanf dollars in this report tanf benefit expenditures are considered state cost the other 100 in child support from the noncustodial parent would be divided between the federal government and the state in accordance with the states fmap thus the federal governments share of the child support collection would be 68 and the states shar would be 32 one way of interpreting this information would be to say that dra would result in the state paying 292 in added tanf expenditures whic h could be partially offset with the states share of child support collections for total state cost 260 given that tanf is considered state cost in this analysis the federal government would not incur any cost instead it would keep its 68 share of the child support collectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34105crs24 24 the halftime minimum wage earnings rate is 750 per hour in california state minimum wage rate and 725 per hour in maine new fully phasedin federal minimum wage rateanother anomaly occurs in west virgin ia in west virginia the table shows the state saving 25 in tanf expenditures because the analysis assumes that west virginia would eliminate its 25 incentive paym ent which currently is added to the tanf benefit payment if the noncustodial parent pays any amount of child support once the dra passthrough and di sregard policy takes effect at halftime minimum wage earnings24 mother with two children in california and maine would both receive 150 per month in additional income after implementation of dra pass through and disregard provi sions the federal share of child support collections would be high er in maine than in california partly because maine has higher fmap 6327 versus 5000 and partly because maine has 135 gap payment in i llinois and maryland th 200 passthrough and disregard policy together with the states earnings disregard rules would enable mother with two children to remain on the tanf rolls at halftime earnings which means that the state via the tanf program would pay the cost of providing the families with the additional monthly income see table 6 i t i s l s noteworthy that maine is the only state in which family working at the halftime minimum wage level benefits more than the family with earnings this is more consistent with public policy that seek s to encourage both work among welfare recipients and their cooperati on in attaining child support although this situation reflects effective use of cse resources it is also result of maines fillthegap policy as mentioned earlier maine is one of only five states that have fillthegap policy at fulltime state minimum wage earning s 750 per hour mother with two children in california would receive 86 per month in additional income after implementation of dra pass through and disregard polic in california the 200 passthrough and disregard po licy together with the states earnings disregard rules would enable mother with two children to remain on the tanf rolls at fulltime earnings which means that the state via the tanf program would pay the cost of providing the family with the additional monthly income again one interpretation of this information is that dra would re sult in the state paying 186 in added tanf expenditures which could be pa rtially offset with the states share of child support collections for total state cost of 136 gi ven that tanf is considered state cost in this analysis the federal government would not incur any cost and it would keep its 50 share of the child support collectionsee table 6 with respect to the cse program it is noteworthy that the interests and perspective of an individual family and the interests and perspective of the state cse program are not always in sync the interests of family are usually entirely financial it is in the best interest of family to get the highest amount of income available to it thus the higher the child support passthrough and disregard amount the more family will potentially benefit however from cse program perspective the more dollars that the program has to invest in cse activities eg parent location paternity establishment support order establishment collection of child support payments the better the progra m can serve

child support they owe the costs of implementing dra policies in the form of reduced child support collections reta ined by the federal and state governments and higher tanf benefits could poten tially be offset by greater child support collections and quicker exits from tanf since its inception the rationale for the child support passthr ough and disregard policy has been that it would encourage cust odial parents to coope rate with the cse program and further that it would encour age noncustodial parents to comply with their child support orders if they know that some of the payment would increase the amount of financial support for their ch ildren several ethnographicfocus group studies indicate that once th ey start paying child suppor t noncustodial parents want to see that their money actually helps their children explanations that welfare benefits are in effect child support paid by taxpayers have not satisfied them25 moreover child support analysts contend th at the noncustodial parents compliance with his or her child support order may also lead to the noncustodial parent becoming more involved in his or her childs life eg providing emotional support parental guidance etc on the other hand during the late 1980s and early 1990s the general perception regarding the passthrough and disregard policy was that it was administratively burdensome and that it failed to improve cu stodial parent coope ration or noncustodial parent compliance these negative per ceptions were thought to outweigh the financial benefits to the family and in part led to the elimination of the mandatory 50 passthrough and disregard policy in 1996 it was also recognized that eliminating the passthrough and disregard allowed states to recover larger portion of cash welfare

is some evidence that government s retention of child support payments affects noncustodial parents attitudes toward child support in study of program to provide services to lowincome noncus todial parents who were behind on their child support parents fair share noncustodial parents we re asked whether certain situations constituted good reasons for not paying child support almost onethird of the parents said that the child support m oney goes to welfare or the state not the children was good reason not to pay child support however this situation ranked below others that respondent s more frequently said provi ded good reasons not to pay support for example that the noncustodial parent is unemployed the child support order is too high and there are disa greements over how the money is spent27 the effectiveness of various child s upport passthrough and disregard policies was examined as part of welfare reform experiments conducted in the 1990s these studies however focused on custodial parents receipt of child support income rather than the noncustodial parents payment of child support number of these evaluations for example th evaluation of connecticuts job first program reported increased receipt of child support income28 this could result from the direct effects of the passthrough and disr egard policies as illustrated in this report higher reported child support income coul d also result from other welfare reform features that could have shortened welf are spells and reduced the amount of child support assigned to and re tained by governments the wisconsin child support dem onstration evaluation based on an experimental design provides the most direct evidence of whether larger child support passthrough and disregards change parental behavior under the wisconsin program all child support was passedthrough nd disregarded as long as the custodial parent remained eligible for cash assistance had income below 115 of poverty the full passthrough and di

parents with incomes below the poverty level who had legal child support order wa s 3713 per year or about 300 per month32 but not all of the parents who had custody of their children wh ile the other parent lived elsewhere had child support orders if paternity for child has not been established or child support obligation has not been legally estab lished the custodial parent is not entitled to child support payments some research suggests that child support passthrough and disregard policy can help increase th number of paternitie s and child support orders established by increasing the willingness of custodial parents to c ooperate with the child support enforcement cse agenci and by increasing the willingness of noncustodial parents to comply w ith their child support obligations there are both advantages and disadvant ages associated with child support passthrough and disregard po licy some of the advantages include the following an increase in income available to families who receive temporary assistance for needy families tanf cash benefit payments as illustrated in this report child support can be significant contribution to family income for the families that receive tanf payments when combined with earnings child support may lift some families out of poverty preparation for life without the regularity of monthly public assistance grant because the child support passthrough and disregard are applied only when th noncustodial parent pays current monthly child support payments the family may experience some of the upsanddowns of irregular or partial

simplification passthrough and disregard policy could increase the transparency of the cse system by making it easier for customers child support personnel and public officials to understand the cse program33 some of the disadvantages of child support passthrough nd disregard policy include the following the revenue state would forego ie state share of child support collections made on behalf of tanf families that otherwise could be used to fund cse activities the costs of making changes to the states automated system to reflect passthrough and disreg ard policy there is some disagreement over the potential size of these costs the revenue the federal government would forego by having to share with the states the costs of passth rough and disregard policies the federal government would thereby receive reduced federal share of child support collections in the federal treasury httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34105crs29 additionally some would say that child support disregard po licies raise equity concerns they contend that passth rough and disregard policies can result in different treatment of families with the same basic financial position in determining tanf eligibility and benefits for exampl consider family with 200 in unearned income one with 200 in child support of which all is disr egarded and another receiving social security survivor bene fits of 200 none of wh ich is disregarded the family with disregarded child support w ould receive higher total income as it could keep the 200 of child support without reduction in tanf benefits while the full 200 in social security survivor bene fits would in most states reduce tanf benefits dollar for dollar others contend that such concerns are not justified because child support is income that generally is earned by the noncustodial parent and that such income should be treated differen tly than income from public benefits it also is argued that the premise of the passthrough and disregard policy promoting cooperation by cust odial parents may not be as important today as it was in the past although cash welfare fa milies have always been required to cooperate in establishing pa ternity or obtaining support pa yments in order to receive afdctanf the 1996 welfare reform w instituted hefty penalty for noncooperation if it is determined that cu stodial parent is not cooperating and the individual does not qualify for any good cause or other exception then the state must reduce the familys tanf benefit by at least 25 and may remove the family from the tanf program also some analysts say that the increasing colocation of cse offices with welfare offices together with outreach efforts directed at educating families on the benefits of pa ternity and child support orde r establishment enhance cooperation policies thus these analysts ar gue that the state longer has to forego its share of child support collections to garner cooperation of custodial parents in cse program functions other analysts poi nt out that passthrough and disregard policy may be more important as t ool for encouraging cooperation from the noncustodial parent which could lead to lower enforcement costs the analysis in this report of six select ed states found that implementation of deficit reduction act dra passthrough and disregar d policy would financially benefit all 3person families in which the mother had earnings for those with earnings mothers in relatively high tanf benefit states would be more likely to experience an increase in monthly income than mothers in low tanf benefit states moreover the analysis indicates that mother with two children and earnings would benefit more in state that curre ntly does not have child support pass through and disregard policy but that dopts such policy under the new dra rules many of the states currently without passthrough and disregard policy are high fmap states which means that the money that they give back to the federal government as the federal share of child support payments is higher than in other states pursuant to dra the federal government would waive its share of child support collections thus many analysts and family advocates argue that it may be to the states advantage to pass these dollars to the tanf families instead of to the federal government it has been suggested that states that currently have child support passthrough and disregard policy could increase the amount of the passthrough and disregard to 200 per month and use what would have been paid out of state funds as the federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34105crs30 34 if predra state with 50 fmap pa ssed through and disregarded 100 per month in child support collections to tanf families it ant that the state did not

the state and the federal government states must adhere to state and federal child support assignment and distribution rules nd calculate the federal and state share of child support collections based on the stat federal medical assistance percentage fmap this appendix discusses the impact of deficit reduction act dra policy on the distribution of child support collections among families the state and the federal government based on family income status in six states california illinois maine maryland oklahoma and west virginia the impact of dra policy is based on the assumption that each of the states would opt to passthrough and disregard up to 200 per month of child support payments made by noncustodial parent s with the federal government sharing in the cost in each of the six states the situation of mother with two children and earnings with parttime minimum wage earnings and with fulltime minimum wage earnings is examined also the analysis only examines child support payments between 0 and 500 pe r month the tables show this range in 100 dollar increments assignment and distribution rules for tanf families child support collections are either dist ributed to families or retained by the state and federal governments as reimbursement for welfare costs current child support payments63 collected on behalf of nonwelfa re families go to the family via the state disbursement unit current child support payments collected on behalf of temporary assistance for needy families tanf families are split between the federal and state governments and at state option some all or none of the states share of the child support collecti ons can be paid to tanf families under pl 104193 the 1996 welfare reform law the rules governing how child support collections are distri buted changed substantially pursuant to pl 109171 effective october 1 2008 at state option the child support distribution rules will change again since the child support enforcement cse programs inception the rules determining who actually gets the child support arrearage payments have been complex it is helpful to think of the rules in two categories first there are rules in both federal and state law th at stipulate who has legal claim on the payments owed by the noncustodial parent these are called assignment rules second there are rules that determine the order in which child support collections are paid in accordance with the assignment rules these are calle d distribution rules the order of paymenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34105crs51 64 in other words states only have the rights to preassistance arrearages while the family is on tanf once the family longer receives tanf benefits the rights to preassistance arrearages revert back to the familyof the child support collection is very impor tant because in many cases child support obligations are never fully paid current tanf recipients as condition of tanf eligibility when family applies for tanf the custodial parent must assign to the state the right to collect both current child support payments nd pastdue child support obligations that accrue while the family is on the t anf rolls these are called permanently assigned arrearages the assignment requi rement for tanf applicants also includes arrearage payments that accumulated before the family enrolled in tanf these are called preassistance arrearages while the family receives tanf benefits the state is per mitted to retain any current support and any assigned arrearag it collects up to the cumulative amount of tanf benefits that have been paid to the family64 pl 104193 repealed the 50 required passthrough and gave states the c hoice to decide how much if any of the state share some all none of child s upport payments collected on behalf of tanf families to send the family states also decide whether to treat child support payments as income to the family pl 104193 required states to pay the federal government the federal governments shar of child support payments collected on behalf of tanf families pl 109171 stipulates that the assign ment covers child support that accrues only during the period that the family r eceives tanf thus child support owed before family enrolls in tanf and after the family leaves tanf belongs to the family and child support owed during the time the family is on tanf belongs to the state and federal governments this pr ovision takes effect on october 1 2009 or october 1 2008 at state option for families who receive tanf cash be nefit payments pl 109171 requires the federal government to waive its shar of the child support collections passed through to tanf families by the state and disregarded by the state up to an amount equal to 100 per month in the cas of family with one child and up to 200 per month in the case of family with two or more children this provision takes effect on october 1 2008 federal medical assistance percentage fmap key component in determining the fede ral and state share of child support collected on behalf of tanf families is the federal medical assistance percentage or fmap under old afdc law the rate at which states reimbursed the federal government for child support payments coll ected on behalf of cash welfare recipients was the federal matching rate ie the federal medical assistance percentage or fmap or medicaid matching rate fo r the afdc program the fmap offered federal matching dollars for all afdc be nefits payments matter how high they were in the aggregate or per recipient the federal share was determined by applyinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34105crs52 the fmap to the total amount spent by st ate for afdc benefits under the fmap the federal funding share of afdc payments was higher for states with low per capita incomes and lower for states with high per capita incomes in other words the fmap varied inversely w ith state per capita income i poor states have high federal matching rate wealthy states have lower federal matching rate in state that had 50 matching rate the federal govern ment was reimbursed 50 for each 100 collected in child support on behalf of an af dc family while in state that had 70 federal matching ra the federal govern ment was reimbursed 70 for each 100 collecte d in the first example the state kept 50 and in the second example the state kept 30 thus states with larger federal medical assistance matching rate ke pt smaller portion of the child support collections the match ranged from minimum of 50 to statutory maximum of 83 although afdc was replaced by the tanf block gr ant under the welfare reform law of 1996 the same matching rate procedure is still used the fmap currently is used to determine the amount of federal matching for the

continue to collect child support on behalf of families that leave the tanf rolls these form er tanf families do not have to reapply for cse services nor do they have to pay an application fee for cse services section 454a25 of the social security act 73 predra rules required that if child s upport arrearage payment was collected by the federal income tax refund offset program it had to be paid to the state rather than to the family child support arrearages collected thr ough any other method were to be paid to the family first under the federal income ta x refund offset program the internal revenue service operating on request from the state cse agency through the secretary of hhs intercepts income tax refunds of noncustodial parents who owe pastdue child s upport payments amounting to at least 150 in the case of tanf family amounting to at least 500 in the case of nonwelfare family and deducts the amount of certified child support arrearages from the income tax refund amount the money is then sent to the stateappendix c dra provisions that affect former tanf families although this report focuses on current tanf families and current child support payments one of the goals of th 1996 welfare reform law with regard to cse distribution provisions was to create distribution priority that favored families once they leave the tanf rolls once family leaves the tanf rolls72 arrearages ie pastdue child support that is owed to the family become important under predra rules the custodial parent that applies for tanf must assign to the state the right to collect both current child support payments and pastdue child support obligations which accrue while the family is on the tanf rolls these are called permanentlyassigned arrearages the child support assignment for tanf families also includes arrearage payments that accumulated before the family enrolled in tanf these are called preassistance arrearages these preassistance arrearages are temporarily assigned to the state while the family r eceives tanf assistance after the family is longer on the tanf program it regains its cl aim on preassistance arrearages the dra stipulates that the child suppor t assignment only covers child support that accrues while the family receives tanf benefits this means that any child support arrearages that accrued before the fa mily started r eceiving tanf benefits would longer have to be assigned to the state even temporarily the dra also gives states the option of distributing to former tanf families the full amount of child support collected on their behalf ie both current support and all child support arrearages including assigned arrearages that accrued while the family was on tanf pl 109171 allows states to simplify the cse distribution process by eliminating the special treatme nt of child support arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset program73 this option allows states to pay child support collected through the federal income tax refund offset procedure to former tanf families before repaying the state its share of child support collections if state adopts the option to eliminate the special federal tax offset collection rules the federal govern ment will waive its share of child support arrearages collected via that method unlike the limits ie up to 100 per monthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34105crs71 74 center for law

for two or more children imposed on support passed through to current tanf families the full federal share of federal tax offset collections will be waived if the money is paid to former tanf families according to one report nearly all of the arrearage payments collected on behalf of former tanf families was via the federal in come tax refund offset program74 in 2005 56 1148 billion of the child support retained by the state for state and federal reimbur sement 2040 billion was collected on behalf of former tanf families in 2005 15 billion in child support payment was collected via the federal income tax re fund offset program the result of the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 distribution provisions is that states are required to pay high er fraction of child support collections on arrearages to families that have left welfare by making these payments to families first before the state and the federal governme nt if adopted by the states the result of the deficit reduction ac t pl 109171 will be to fully implement family first policy for former tanf families under which most if not all child support received on their behalf will go to the familie s first before the state and the federal government this additional income is expected to reduce dependence on welfare by both promoting exit from tanf and pr eventing entry and reentry to tanf custodial parents welcome this provisi on that requires the federal government to share with the states the costs of payi ng child support arrearages to former tanf families if the state chooses to implement that option custodial parents have been frustrated because they have always viewed child support arrearages as belonging to them they argue that they had to rely on family and friends for financial assistance during periods when the noncustodial parent failed to pay child support that occurred before they went on welfare they contend that they and not the state are entitled to any prewelfare arrearages that are collected on their behalf75 much of the complexity of the distri bution rules stemmed from their gradual implementation and fe deralstate receipt of child support arrearage payments collected through the federal income tax re fund offset program thus some of the complexity of the rules ended when the rules were completely implemented on october 1 2000 many observers contend that if states choose to implement the family first approach authorized by pl 109171 the distribution of child support will be much easier to expl ain understand and carry outhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34105crs72 former tanf families before 1996 once family went off afdc child support arrearage payments generally were divided between the state and federal government s to reimburse them for afdc if any money remained it was gi ven to the family in contrast under pl 104193 payments to families that leave tanf are more generous under pl 104 193 child support arrearages ar to be paid to the family first unless they are collected from the federal income tax ref und in which case reimbursing the federal and state governments is to be given first priority for collections made on or since october 1 2000 if custodial parent assigns her or his child support righ ts to the state on or after october 1 2000 the parent has to assign ll support rights that accrue while the family is receiving tanf benefits in addition the tanf appli cant must temporarily assign to the state all rights to support that accrued to the family before it began receiving tanf benefits this temporary assignment lasts until the family stops receiving tanf benefits this means that since october 1 2000 stat have been required to distribute to former tanf families the following child support collections first before the state and the federal government ar reimbursed 1 all current child support 2 any child support arrearages that accrue after the family leaves tanf these arrearages are called neverassigned arrearages plus 3 any arrearages that accrued before the family began receiving tanf benefits these are called temporarily assigned arrearages as mentioned above th rules do not apply to child support collections obtained by intercepting federa l income tax refunds if child support arrearages are collected vi the federal income tax re fund offset program the 1996 law stipulates that the state and federal government are to retain such collections moreover if after satisfying the distributi on rules specified above there are still child support funds left over ie available then states ma retain them to satisfy arrearages they are owed states are llowed to distribute any child support monies still available at this point in the process to the custodial parent however regardless of how states choose to dist ribute the money they must pay the federal government its share finally any remaining funds are distributed to the family for collections made on or after october 1 2009 or october 1 2008 at state option pl 109171 simplifies child support distribution rules by giving states the option of providing familie s that have left tanf the full amount of the child support collected on their behalf ie current child support payments non assigned child support arrearages and child support arrearages collected via the federal income tax re fund offset program with regard to former tanf families pl 109171 stipulates that the state must pay all current child support payments to the family if the child support collection exceeds the amount of current s upport the state must first pay to the family any nonassigned child support arrearages it there is still some money left the state has the option to retain the states share of the money or pay it to the family if the state decides to pay it to the family the state does not have to pay the federal government the federal share of the leftove r collection if any of the child support collection still remains available the state is required to
