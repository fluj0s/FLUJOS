significantly from that of the 50 states and the district of columbia prior to 1970 most of the road cons truction and mainte nance activity was financed and carried out by the terr itorial governments in 1970 congress established the territorial highway program thp in the federalaid highway act of 1970 pl 91605 the act authorized th department of transportation dot to assist each of the three territories the virgin islands guam and american samoa the northern mariana islands were adde d to the program in 1978 in program for the construction and improvement of system of arterial highways to be designated by each territorys governor dot was also directed to provide technical assistance to each territory to assist in the creation of an appropriate agency to administer the program during the more than 30 years the program has existed the thps enacting language 23 usc 215 has basically rema ined the same but the level of financing varied with each reauthorization prog ram funding varied from low of 45 million annually in fy1970fy1973 to high f 362 million in fy2003 some funding from other program sources has also gone to th territories the emergency relief program the high priority project prog ram and certain safety programs have provided funding for territorial highways over the years the arguments generally made in support of federal aid to the territories including highway aid are usually fra med in terms of the transportation and development needs of the territories and the benefits the territories provide to the united states the arguments against expa nded territorial eligibility under federal aid highway programs are framed by the territories exemption from the taxes that support the highway account of the highway trust fund htf the implications of the territories limited land ar ea and their nonstate status as reauthorization of the transportation equity act for the 21stcentury tea21 pl 105178 congress may ddress number of options concerning federal highway funding for the territories t he overall issue for the territories is the appropriate extent of their participa tion in the fahp the options range from elimination of the thp to expanding territorial participation in fahp programs to equal that of the states elimination of the thp appears unlikely given the federal commitments to economic development of the territories on the other hand the fact that the territories do not pay the taxes tha t provide revenue to the htf will probably preclude them from full participation in htf programs the bush

finally the report reviews the overa ll arguments for and against federal assistance and sets forth related issues and options which may emerge during the upcoming reauthorization of the surface transportation programs2 background prior to 1970 most road construction and maintenance was financed and carried out by the territorial governments locally levied fuel taxes supported road projects the most significant federal involvement in road construction in the territories was limited to the construction of military roads especially significant for guam and provision of disaster relief during the 1960s rapid growth in population and motor vehicle use led to increasing traffic cong estion which in turn led to interest in establishing federally financed territorial road program the federal aid highway act of 1968 pl 90495 directed the dep artment of transportation dot to carry out highway study of guam american samoa and the virgin islands the report territorial highway study guam american samoa virgin islands released january 7 1970 revealed that centrations of people and motor vehicles within the compact areas of these island rritories produce large volumes of traffic compelled to move over substandard highways at slower speeds and at greater hazard than drivers ordinarily encounter in the sta tes traffic growth is currently several times more rapid than the national average the study however recommended against any new federal highway grant progra ms for the three territories instead the report recommended that the territorial g overnments should

trust fund htf that supports spe nding on highways in the united states the htf is supported by excise tax revenues mostly from excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel paid by highway users in the

fy1977 and fy1978 surface transportation assistance act of 1978 staa78 pl 95 599 staa78 made two significant changes to thp first the bill added the northern mariana islands to the thp and provided the islands with 1 million annually for the life of the authoriza tion fy1979fy1982 second the act raised the federal contribution under thp from 70 to 100 the virgin islands guam and american samoa annual authorizati ons were continued for the life of the authorization at the 5 million 5 million and 1 million levels respectively surface transportation assistance act of 1982 staa82 pl 97 424 staa82 made major change in the funding for thp the act authorized that the four territories be treated together as state for federalaid primary fap funds this mean t that the territories got at least ½ of fap funds in contract authority from the highway trust fund each year of the authorization this also made thp funds subject to reductio n under the obligation limitation7 the formula controversy the apportionment for the territories was allocated to the individual territories unde r formula that was based 13 on urban population greater than 5000 13 on rural population 16 on public road milage and 16 on area according to fhwa several territories contested the figures based on population in september 1983 fhwa decide d to infer congressional intent from the funding set forth in staa78 ie 1 million for american samoa 5 million for guam 5 million for the virgin islands and 1 million for the northern marianas and derive ratios based on this division of funds consequently from fy1984 through fy1992 thp funds were divided among the territories as follows 112 to american samoa 512 to the virgin islands 512 to guam and 112 to the northern mariana islands surface transportation and uniform relocation assistance act of 1987 sturaa pl 10017 sturaa extended the authorizations set forth in staa82 the thp continued to receive ½ of each years federalaid primary funding under contract authority and the federal share continued at 100 intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 istea pl 102240 istea made changes to statutory language of the thp 23httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31431crs4 8according to tea21 section 1102 f the remai ning contract authority is distributed to the statesusc 215 but did change the source of funding the act defined the four territories as state under the national h ighway system nhs program and set aside 1 of nhs funds for the territories formula controversy the second round according to fhwa in 1992 the agency reviewed the 1551 allocation at the request of one of the territories the agency concluded that american samoa and the northern mariana islands were not getting their fair share based on road mileage area population or any combination of these factors fhwa developed and analyzed over twenty possible formulas based on census inf ormation and 1990 highway statistics beginning in 1993 the administrative allocation was changed to new 1441 formula this raised the ratio received by american samoa and the northern mariana islands to 110 and reduced the ratio received by the virgin islands and guam to 410 istea required each territory to classify their highways since then the territories have each established with fhwa approval combination of arterial and collector highways and interisland connectors called the federalaid territorial highway system these routes are elig ible for federalaid funds under thp transportation equity act for the twenty first century tea 21pl 105178 tea21 changed the setaside for thp from 1 of nhs funds to set amount of 364 million per fiscal year during the debate on tea21 the house voted to continue the 1 setaside from nhs but the senate voted not to fund the thp the 364 million setaside was agr eed to in conference h rept105550 because the funds are subject to the annual obligation limitation only the amount of the 364 million for which obligation author ity is made available may be distributed to the territories8tea21 also expanded project eligibility to include any project eligible for assistance under the surface transportation program as well as any airport or seaport in the four territories fhwa continues to divide these funds according to the 1441 administrative formula thp funding history federal funding of transportation projects under the thp has changed over the years in accordance with the relevant provisions of the surface transportation authorization acts discussed in the previous section table 1 sets forth the actual amounts distributed to the territories unde r the thp other than the founding year the years which initiated significant thp funding increases were fy1974 fy1977 and fy1992 in fy1974 funding for american samoa doubled and funding for the virgin islands more than doubled guams funding was increased to 5 million for fy1977 which brought guam into parity w ith the virgin islands this rough parity continues to this day the drop in funding in fy1983 reflects the shift to ½ of federal aid primary contract authority an d also the impact of thp being made subject to obligation limitation the next major increase in funding occurred during fy1992fy1993 under istea by fy1993 the funding for american samoa andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31431crs5 the northern marianas had more than tripled due in part to the change in the distribution formula in 1993 mentioned earlier funding for guam and the virgin islands more than doubled under tea21 funding for thp has remained

the arguments for and against federalaid highway assistance to the territories have changed little since the debate of the 1960s that culminated in the founding of the thp with the approaching reauthorization of tea21 the overall arguments are worth reviewing11 pro the arguments generally made in support of federal aid to the territories including highway aid are usually fra med in terms of the transportation and development needs of the territories the bene fits the territories provide to the united states and their limited enfranchisement in general population growth and an increase in the number of vehicles on territorial roads has increased traffic congestion in all the territories although signifi cant improvements have been made under the thp some territorial roads continue to be under stress from inadequate capacity while other roads continue to be substanda rd and hazardous because the territories are all islands much of the road construc tion is more expensive than in the 50 us states remoteness from suppliers is especia lly problem for the pacific territories in addition the territories are significantly less well off than the states have lower per capita domestic product and pay higher prices for many basic goods advocates of highway assistance to the territories argue that the territories are not wealthy enough to provide for their road infrast ructure needs without federal assistance supporters also argue that the goal of brin ging the territories into economic parity with the states is an established principle of the federal government12federal highway assistance is seen as falling under t his principle advocates of assistance also point out that all the territories were ac quired for strategic purposes and contend that they continue to be of current or potential strategic value to the united states three of the territories guam american samoa and the virgin islands are each represented in congress by single nonvo ting representative in the us house of representatives13the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands has congressional representative some advocates of assistance to the territories see link between this limited representation and what they see as low levels of federal assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31431crs8 14the tea21 authorization ends with the close of the 2003 fiscal year september 30 2003con the main objection to full or expanded territorial participation in federal aid highway program fahp is that the rritories do not pay the taxes that support the program the fahp is funded from t he highway account of the htf the htf is supported by highway user taxes mostly fuel taxes paid for by highway users in the 50 states in addition under tea 21 each states percentage share of the aggregate spending on the core highway programs is adjusted every fiscal year to ensure that each states share of the apporti onments for these programs is at least 905 return on its estimated contributions to the highway account of the htf the link that this minimum guarantee makes b etween the amount of taxes paid and the federal assistance received according to some strengthens the arguments that most fahp programs should be restricted to the states whose user taxes support the htf opponents of spending htf money on territorial roads argue that the territories should raise their own territorial fuel ta xes to provide for their highway funding needs their small size both in territory and population compared with the smallest of the states also forms the basis of arguments against expanded program participation for the t erritories all four territories populations combined are less than the population of the state with the least population wyoming whose land area is much greater their combined land areas together are only 532 square miles larger than rhode island whose population is more than 2 ½ times as large if the territories were allowed to participate in all or most of fahp programs they would qualify for the various program minimums which because of the territories small size would actually some argue be exce ssively generous the final argument is simply that the fahp is based on the assumption of federalstate partnership that is different than the federal relationship with the territories from this perspective federal highway assistance to the territories should be accomplished outside the existing fahp programs and should not draw from the htf for funding tea21 reauthorization options as the debate over the reauthorization of federal surface transportation programs continues congress may address number f options concerning federal highway funding for the territories14the overall issue for the territories is the appropriate extent of their participation in the fahp options range from elimination of the thp to expanding territorial participation in f ahp programs to equal that of the states elimination of the thp is unlikely since the federal commitments to economic development of the territories woul d probably be strong enough to prevent elimination of the thp on the other hand the fact that the territories do not pay the taxes that provide revenue to the htf will probably preclude them from full participation in the programs that the htf pays for any reauthorization debate concerning federal highway assistance to the territories will probably be over more modest changes in legislative sense it is the territori nonstate status that excludes them from most federal highway programs because the definition of state in title 23 usc section 101 does not include the territories the only programs that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31431crs9 15collector roads collect and disperse traffic between the arterial highways roads which generally handle the long trips and the lower level roads local roads streets and other continuedterritories are eligible for are programs whose legislative language specifically includes them or defines them as state fo r the purposes of the particular program expanding the territories eligibility to other fahp programs as mentioned earlier because of the link the minimum guarantee makes between states federal highway tax revenues and the amount state receives under the core highway programs it is doubtful that the terr itories will be granted participation in the core highway programs beyond their existing participation in nhs however territorial projects could be made eligible for other fahp programs referred to as the allocated or discretionary programs t hat are under the control of the fhwa these programs are much smaller than the main core highway programs and their grants are competed for on project by project basis or are designated by congressional earmarking to make the rritories eligible congress could pass amending language that would define the f our territories collectively as state under one or more of the program sections in title 23 usc even if the territories are made eligible for any of these programs however there is guarantee any grants will be awarded to territorial projects changing the funding of the thp as mentioned earlier tea21 changed the thps funding from 1 of national highwaysystem funding set under istea to fixed annual amount of 364 million through fy2003 this amount is significantly lower than the thp would have received had the program retained the 1 nhs setaside the program had under istea the issue of restoring the 1 set aside could be raised during the reauthorization debate another possibility would be to define the four territories as state for allocation purposes under nhs this would qualify thp for the nhs minimum allocation equal to ½ of nhs and interstate maintenance allocations combined another option would be to argue for continued dollar amount setaside but at higher level perhaps one that would more closely approximate the outcome of 1 nhs setaside since early 2001 the federal revenue outlook has become increasingly constrained this may be the greatest obstacle to increasing federal aid to the territories the bush administration reauthorization proposal the safe accountable flexible and efficient transportation equityact of 2003 safetea hr 2088 safetea which was introduced by request on may 14 2003 would make number of changes to the thp section 1808 proposes number of changes to the various parts of title 23 of the us code that are relevant to the thp some of the changes are technical and can be seen as adding clarity to the statute while other changes have significant program
