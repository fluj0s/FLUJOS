in conference department tradition within the federal government the partments are among the oldest primary units of the executive branch the departments of state war and the treasury all being established within few weeks of each other in 1789 the heads of the departments are the members of the trad itional cabinet since 1792 they have by statutory specification constituted line of succession after the speaker of the house and the president pro tempore of the senate to the presidency in the event of vacancy in both that office and the vice presidency7 the constitution is referring to these officials when it authorizes the president in article ii section 2 to require the opinion in writing of the principal fficer in each of the executive departments upon any subject

administrative management in the government of the united states washington gpo 1937 pp 2930 11ibid p 31 12ibiddepartmentalization when does department alization occur what factors contribute to the creation of new federal department several considerations can be offered in response to these questions departmental ization involves the thematic consolidation of existing programs and entities in single hierarchically organized administrative structure these components may be modified during the transfer process and new programs may be created and assigned to the new partment as well departmentalization also serves to strengthen presidential management of program administration by the new department and em phasizes the importance of these collective programs for the nation finally department alization occurs because it has the political support of relevant interest groups that regard the ch ange as beneficial in terms of proximity to the president and national prestige three years after launching the new deal to realize the economic recovery of the nation president franklin d roosev elt in 1936 organized the presidents committee on administrative management to assess and make recommendations concerning among other matters the role of the president in the managerial direction and control of all executive branch departments and agencies and the streamlining of the executive branch which counted number of temporary experimental and redundant component entities reporting in january 1937 the committee recounted the evolution of the executive branch findi ng that it had grown up without plan or design like the barns shacks silos tool shed s and garages of an old farm this led the panel to conclude that the structure of the government throws an impossible task upon the chief executive with the result that president can possibly give adequate supervision to the multitude of agencies which have been set up to carry on the work of the government nor can he coordinate their activities and policies10 to rectify this situation the committee r ecommended in part increasing the number of cabinet depar tments from 10 to 12 and requiring and authorizing the president to determine the appropriate assignment to the 12 executive departments of all operating administrative agencies and fix upon the executive continuing responsibility and power for the maintenance of the ffective division of duties among the departments11 in brief in the hierarch ical model recommended by the panel as many of the executive administrative agencies as possible would have been transferred to one of the partments and become subject to the supervision of the head of the department th department heads in turn would have been subject to the direction of the president impl ementation of these recommendations said the committee would make effective management possible by restoring the president to his proper place as chief executive12 underlying the work of the committee regarding these matters was theory of organization developed by one of the panels principal members luther gulick proponent of orthodox or classical orga nization doctrine derived largely

new york columbia university press 1941 p 43business administration and the scientific management movement of the early 20th century13 schuyler wallace who had been member of the staff of the presidents committee on administrative management expanded upon many of gulicks views in his 1941 assessment of fe deral departme ntalization14 of particular interest are his proffered considerations wh ich enter into the construc tion of department among the first of these are quantitative considerations beginning with the president he comments that the boundaries of chief ex ecutives span of control cannot be easily ascertained and described in mathemati cal formula of unive rsal applications15 history records that the traditional ca binet has grown from six members in 1789 including three heads of departments to ne members in 1900 including eight heads of departments to 15 members in 2002 including 14 heads of departments since the presidency of john f kennedy ot her officials such as the ambassador to the united nations have been appointed w ith cabinet rank meaning that they attend cabinet meetings and otherwise receive related documents by regulating the number of officials appointed with ca binet rank the president may exert some restraint upon the size of this body fu rthermore he may use other specialized forums such as the national security council and the homela nd security council to exercise managerial control of selected department heads similarly since 1929 when the presiden ts staff was increased from single personal secretary to three such aides and an administrative assistant the white house staff has grown to supplement the chief executives span of control over departmental manageme nt when making plea for ch increased staffing in 1937 the presidents committee on administrative management famously asserted the president needs help his immediate staff assistance is entirely inadequate he should be given small number of ex ecutive assistants who would be his direct aides in dealing with the managerial agencies and administrative departments of the government these assistants probably not exceeding six in number would be in addition to the presen t secretaries who deal with the public with the congress and with the press and radio these aides would have power to make decisions or issue instruc tions in their own right they would not be interposed between the president nd the heads of his departments theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31493crs6 16us presidents committee on administrative management administrative

when decisions have been made to assist him in seeing to it that every administrative department and agency affected is promptly informed their effectiveness in assisting the president w ill we think be directly proportional to their ability to discharge their functions with restraint they would remain in the background issue orders make deci sions emit public statements men for these positions should be carefully c hosen by the president from within and without the government they s hould be men in whom the president has personal confidence and whose character and attitude is sic such that they would not attempt to exercise power on their own account they should be possessed of high competence great physical vigor and passion for anonymity they should be installed in the white h ouse itself directly accessible to the president in the selection of these ai des the president should be free to call on departments from time to time for the assignment of persons who after tour of duty as his aides might be re stored to their old positions16 by 1947 white house office staff numbe red over 200 and would be twice that number by the end of the century along the way the president would appoint chief of staff to help him manage his re tinue of personal aide s who strengthen his span of control over partment management wallace also observes that just as ther are limits to the chief executives span of control so also are there limits to the control which can be exercised by any of his subordinates17 for the head of large department such limits include his or her span of control or how many officials ar routinely reporting directly to him or her it also includes contending with excessi ve layers of middle management or an abundance of management c ontrol positions which can contribute to sluggish administrative system and delayed system outcomes other limits may include lack of administrative feedback arrangements for monitoring subor dinates behavior18 inadequate information t echnology applications to supplement hierarchical communications structures for effective staff ed ification guidance and development19 and insufficient planning capability for forecasting new challenges developing departmental goals and performance measures and instilling sense of mission unity regarding this last cons ideration experience with the early policy planning

and political crises mounting in warravaged europe the staff did so observes one analyst makin g central contribution to what was soon dubbed the marshall plan20 marshalls successor d ean acheson described the intentions of the former army chief of staff when creating this planning entity the general as marshall was often called conceived the function of this group as being to look ahead not into the di stant future but beyond the vision of the operating officers caught in the smoke and crises of current battle far enough ahead to see the emerging form of things to come and outline what should be done to meet or anticipate them in doing this the staff should also do something elseconstantly reappraise what was being done general marshall was acutely aware that policies acquired their own momentum and went on after the reasons that inspired them had ceased21 returning to wallaces observations on departmentaliza tion he comments there is assurance that the creation of large departments will lead to an extension of the career systems upwar d in the opinion of opponents of this method of administrative integration the contrary may well be the case the very size of the department will make the problem of civilian control over the bureaucracy appear to be more difficult one this will undoubtedly be seized upon by advocates of democratic control and by spoilsmen as an excuse to push the system of political appointment downward rather than the merit system upward22 this matter also has implications for the control which can be exercised by the head of large department over his or her organization if middle and upper management positions are largely political appointees the head of the proposed department may have the experience of dea ling with highly transitory strangers of varying competence who were for the most part unilaterally selected by the white house by contrast filling middle and uppe r management positions with career civil servants has somewhat greater potential generally for realizing more enduring knowledgeable and capable partmental leadership ev though cases may result where careerist fails to perform ma nagement responsib ilities adequately turning to the determination of the criteria by which the subordinate administrative units should be grouped together in departmental structure wallace proffers that the process of departmentaliza tion rests upon four major concepts of organization 1 function 2 work processe s 3 clientele and 4 territory he quickly cautions that these several mode s of organization may seem to be self evident yet such is far from the case nd proceeds to demonstrate that these are not clearly understood concepts23 furthermore he admitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31493crs8 24ibid p 97 25ibid pp 94 98 26ibid p 131no one has ever advocated the construction of departments solely upon the basis of function or work processes or clie ntele or territory instead in the very nature of things functional technical c lientele and territorial factors enter into the construction and operation of all nati onal or largearea departments such considerations vary from division of work to division of work and practice and common sense take them into account as existing departmental organizations demonstrate back of all technical c onsiderations however lie large questions of national policy and purpose which have bearing upon present practices and proposed innovations given particul ar set of assumptions respecting public policyeg the desirability of main taining constitutional government the normal judicial processes legislative control over the administration etcthe problem then is the emphasis which should be laid upon one relevancy rather than another ie function clientele etc in given social context and the particular devices which can be adopted to offset any disadvantages to efficiency accruing from given emphasis24 the most widely utilized ba sis of departmental integr ation he continues is that of function or purpose defined as t he grouping of subordi nate administrative units in departmental pattern upon the ba sis of the underlying purpose to which they each have been dedicated reliance upon work processes involves the bringing together in single department thos who have had similar professional training or who make use of the same or similar equipment departmentalization based upon clientele should result in the concentra tion in single department of those subordinate administrative units which are designed to serve some particular segment of the body politic25 finally departmental orga nization may be based upon place or territory and has long been used as basis of interdepartmental organization such as in the regional divisions of the department of state26 although these concepts were offered as bases for departme ntal integration wallace also mentions anot her principle of administrative organization that of devolution of operating autonomy this is best exemplified in the realm of economic organization by the holding company mode of organization instead of concentrating full and final authority in the hands of single executive holding companies usually organize their component parts more or less as independent economic units in many cases directed by independent presidents immediately responsible to independent boards of trustees in all such holding companies some measure of coordination is imposed but the techniques by which it is achieved differ radically in some situations the board of directors of the top holding company constitutes majority of the board of directors of eac h of the operating units in other cases the chief executives of the various operatin g units report directly to the president of the top company but in any case volution rather than integration is the outstanding characteristic of these econom ic units the actual administration and management of the various operating or ganizations is under the direction and supervision of its immediate management such coordination as exists apart from financial and certain technical considerations is confined to

these issues dramatically captured public ttention perhaps more so than in the fall of 1925 during the court martial of colone l billy mitchell congress began exploring these matters in early 194428 subsequently proposals for central intelligence agency nd improved arrangements for th mobilization of war resources were added to the debate nd an elaborate plan embracing all of these considerations in fulfillment of national security was offered by secretary of the navy james forrestal29 this plan was largely enacted w ith the national security act of 1947 which created the national military establishment headed by the secretary of defense and embracing as subunits army navy and air force departments the central intelligence agency the national s ecurity council and the national security resources board30 forrestal became the first secretary of defense in 1949 based upon his experience he proposed amendments to the national security act which congress adopted strengthening the supe

the supervision of the secretary of defense in 1946 the house and senate had collapsed their defenserelated committees into single armed services panels in each chamber and the new department largely fell within their legislative and oversight jurisdiction32 in 1941 wallace had recognized that department of na tional defense might be established on an integrated basis w ith strong head supervising subordinate leaders of the armed services components or alternatively on devolution basis following the holding company model di scussing this latter version he wrote it would certainly embrace two component partsa division of war and division of navy it might also embrace division of military aviation each of these great divisions might be headed by its own secretary and might remain practically autonomous in the conduct of its own internal affairs above the three secretaries might be placed secret ary of national defense his primary function might be first the reception of routine reports from the two or three major divisions as the case might be and the transmission of such segments of these reports as he might think necessary to the chief executive and second the coordination of the overlapping activ ities of the component parts of the department moreover he might undertake certain military activities now carried on by neither the department of war nor that of the navy or certain functions such as propaganda which are in reality not technical part of the fighting service33 this arrangement of course was reject ed in the national security act of 1947 but the matter of which model to adopt would be revisited six years later in the case of another new department department of health education and welfare created in 1953 by reorganization plan the department of health education and welfare was rooted in the social welfare administration of the new deal the social security board and the federal s ecurity agency being primary components34 the presidents

with substantive matters or broad issues of admi nistration only under exceptional circumstances could single department head deal competen tly with so diverse range of technical activities when the president has to c onsider substantive issues it would seem entirely possible that he might get more help from several heads of smaller departments than from the head of one big one because one could

programs from other parts of the govern ment it was initially proposed that the head of the department w ould manage the organization with an under secretary and three assistant secretaries one each for the primary health education and welfare components48 this arrangement had the suppor t of an important congressional figure senator robert taft who repor tedly thought this was logical division of responsibilities and would be conducive to good management for quite different reasons the americ an medical association and the various national education associations also re commended separate assistant secretaries for health education and welfare each interest group thought that if it had an assistant secretary to concern himself with its specific functions he would become an effective spokesman with in the administration for the groups interests49 analysts at the bureau of the budget predecessor to the office of management and budget opposed the assistant secretar trinity concerned that these three appointees might become captives of th pressure groups and the bureaucracy working in league with one another and to ld mrs hobby that she needed some top level assistants to aid her in her job ultimately the plan mandated two assistant secretaries to perform such functions as the secretary may prescribe and an equivalent special assistant to the secretary for health and medical affairs however the secretary nonetheless had tiny staff of her own choosing and an unusually small number of supporting civil servants as well as an unwieldy management structure50 at the time hew officially came into being in 1953 the organization was infant it had over 34000 employees with total expenditures of 54 billion including 20 billion in general funds and 34 billion in social security trust funds it was clear that the social s ecurity program would grow steadily and rapidly for many years assuming the system was preserved in its form at that time what was far less clear was how the other components of the department would change nobody really realized how forces and events during the next twenty years would throw one responsibility after another on the shoulders of the young department straining its capacity to cope with all of its functions51 when the department began operations authority for its programs was not clearly vested in the secretary which led to friction between the head of the organization and subordinate leaders within the hea lth education and welfare components interest groups sometimes ex ploited the situation the secretary seemingly did not have an effective mana gement structure or adequate supporting staff the latter shortcoming contribu ting to the brookings warning about the manageability of department dealing with so many distinct

various times in one way or another for about dozen years and ultimately came to be realized with proposal of little detail as result management arrangements were unwieldy establishment of the new department involved only the components of the federal security agency the 1946 consolidation of congressional committees resulted in senate panels on finance and on labor and public welfare nd in house panels on edu cation and labor and on ways and means which would largely have legi slative and oversight jurisdiction over the programs of the new department howeve r because hew had been

legislation into law on november 2598 legislative issues proposals to create department of home land security raised many issues not the least of which were threshold questions concerning the value of the new entity president bush contended that his proposal did not constitute an expansion of the federal government but merely consolidated existing programs within more efficient and effective management structure however neither the presidents proposal nor the principal cong ressional bills made use of definition of the concept of homeland security to guide the com ponent composition of the new department moreover whole agencies were proposed fo r transfer to the department with very little effort to sort out nonhomeland secu rity functions and programs for more appropriate administration elsewhere other than the new depar tment of course attempts to sort out the homeland security programs of transferred agencies from nonhomeland security programs might have resulted in in creased cost for additional administrative overhead some contended that the crea tion of any new department would result in budget expansion in july 9 2002 cost estimate the congressional budget office proffered that the initial housepassed bill hr 5005 establishing new department of home land security would cost about 3 billion over the 2003 2007 peri od which would be in addition to projected net spending for ongoing activities of the transferred agencies about 20 billion in 2002 growing to 31 billion by 200799 there were as well those who doubted th at merely rearranging programs within new department would tr uly improve the nations fenses against terrorism others maintained that matter how well management and operating arrangements were finetuned legislatively the effectiveness of the department and its leadership could not be guaranteed and still ot hers wondered aloud who will be willing to serve for very long in the leadership of such department additional

cent er 795 employeeswould have been transferred to the new depa rtment under the presidents plan and ultima tely were in the bill that was signed into law the criticism however suggested that those developing the presidents plan had not gi ven adequate consider ation to the prospect of transferring or restructuring fb i and cia counterterro rism responsibilities100 others questioned why the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the drug enforcement administration and the nu clear regulatory commission were not included101 gao among others noted that because the concept of homeland security had not been defined certain organizational mana gement and budgetary decisions cannot currently be made consistently across agencies102 as the house and the senate were giving final approval to gislation establishi ng the department questions about its scope arose anew when the chairman of counterterrorism study commission recommended the creation of national counterterrorism center to improve cooperation among intelligence agen cies and it was reported that senior bush administration officials were seriously discussing the creation of domestic intelligence agency103 inappropriate program transfers during the course of legislatively establishing department of homeland security some noted that the transfer of whole agencies to the new department w ould result in it being responsible for the administration of programs having nothing to do with homeland security and which consequently might not receive adequate resources for their execution104 these included the marine safety responsibilities of the coast guard the drug and child pornography interdiction efforts of the cu stoms service the counterfeiting detection and investigation prog ram of the secret service and

have number of programs not direc tly related to countering rrorism but did not indicate any particular concern about this development sorting out these programs for continued administration by their parent departments wa s an option for congress but little effort was actually made in this regard for various reasons not the least of which was the possibility th at it might result in increased cost for additional administrative overhead the desire to get the department quickly established and to do so before the adjournment of the 107th congress also were factors administrative structure in creating the new department congress had the responsibility for determining the appropr iate administrative structure for the secretary to manage with efficiency econom and effectiveness an organization of some 170000 employees many of whom w ould be working in field facilities composed of diverse units with shared re sponsibility and partnership with state and local governments as well as the private sector key consideration was the secretarys span of control over the opera tions of primary divisions and internal agencies eg the coast guard and secret service together with such broad departmental functions as human and information resources management budget setting and financial management initial versions of both the house and senate bills appeared to support strong verti cal management stru ctures and both were seemingly weak in detailing horizontal wo rking arrangements among headquarters divisions and internal agenci and among field staff under the bill initially adopted by the house the secretary of homeland security might have had as many as 15 senior officials of the department reporting directly to him or her or more if the assistant secretaries actually had this relationship under the senate bill recrafted in committee 17 senior officials seemingly would have been reporting directly to the secretary ultimately the statute mandating the partment of homeland security placed most of the entities and functions transfe rred to the new department within four primary directorates for border and trans portation security em ergency preparedness and response science and t echnology and information an alysis and infrastructure protection the coast guard and the s ecret service were excepted from this arrangement and enjoy independent status w ithin the department the heads of these six components along with upwards of 12 assistant secretarie s and approximately14 other senior officials appear to report directly to the secretary in general the statutory administrative framework establis hed for the department appears to support strong vertical management structures while being somewhat weak in detailing horizontal working arrangements among headquarters divisions and internal agencies general manageme nt requirements during the 20th century congress enacted variety of general management laws prescribing how federal departments and

the senate bill while not exempting the new department from gpra requirements provided some gpralike resultsbased manageme nt obligationsa strategic plan performance plan and performan ce reportfor the department108 ultimately the statute mandating department of homeland security reflects special arrangements in such areas as human resources manage ment and procuremen t but uncertainties regarding the applicability of other general management laws are likely to arise worth mentioning is the innovation of blishing privacy officer within the new department this idea gained ttention when omb controller mark w everson in his july 9 testimony before the house subcommittee on commercial and administrative law commented although th general counsel of an agency often handles privacy issues we recognize the special importance of these issues in the homeland security context and are examining options for establishing specialized privacy officer within the new department109 the department of justice has had such an official since december 1998 the initial hous eapproved bill included privacy officer an addition to the legislation made by the select committee on homeland security and the committeemodified senate bill also provided for privacy officer as did the fina l version of the legislation human resources management although the presidents proposal would have resulted in the
