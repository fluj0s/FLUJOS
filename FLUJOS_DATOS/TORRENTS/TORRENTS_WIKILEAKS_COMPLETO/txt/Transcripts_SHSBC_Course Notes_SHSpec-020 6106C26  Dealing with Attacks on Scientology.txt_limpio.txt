6106c26 shspec20 dealing with attacks on scientology scientology doesnt have an achilles heel so its in good position to defend itself people do get upset when confronted with new idea but new theories get accepted fairly quickly eg harvey on blood circulation socrates on the nature of man proponents of new theories dont necessarily get martyred the ones that do generally are getting motivators for their overts as tyrants also if one continually fails to advance an idea one may get suicidal and die for it eg christ and socrates lrh believes in making an idea effective not to fail at it and make everybody feel guilty because they kill you its not necessary to sacrifice oneself for new idea thats just way to protect old ideas man is great believer in nochange while he obsessively changes everything so new ideas are rejected scientology is over the top but it is still being fought because to the degree that one is right to that degree he is dangerous we threaten to upset lot of beliefs and customs its only safe for us to do it because we can undo what we do for instance we can run out bad auditing the reason there is question on sec checks about overts on lrh is that if one had lot of overts on ron and scientology one could acquire forceful overwhelming valence called scientology so this is the first time anyone has said try it and see in the early days people said we should go big on aesthetics lrh said you can always overwhelm thetan with aesthetics but its not desirable to overwhelm thetan if its true far you its true not because weve overwhelmed you were attacked because we have evil motives people get frantic because they cant figure out whats the ditch if you can make thetan commit overts against you or set him up where he can commit the overts and remove any possibility of running the overts you can overwhelm him and get him so stamped dawn with valence that he cant even wiggle in other words you set person up where he cant receive an overt from you you wont commit one and on the other hand you set him up where he can commit overts on you and cannot get them run out then youve done him in good and proper former efforts at this were entrapments it isnt really an effort towards total freedom either since it allows for games man becomes alarmed at the fact of there being this selfless philosophy that doesnt demand that one become subjugated and enslaved by it and that it doesnt say that the originator of it must be carried on an an imperishable valence that everyone should bow down to that alone is incomprehensible which alarms man and makes him think there must be some when attacked all one needs to do is to take effective actions not get frantic just keep up effective pressure investigate loudly and dont feel rushed about it let it coast when people are in terror they make mistakes so let them make the mistakes for instance man called ettleman had been hired by the ama and the apa to attack scientology in this case which went on for three years when it finally came to trial his attorney didnt show so the case was dismissed all that can be zone to an organization or person is to harass them to the point where theyre too worried to do their job so keep the reaction to attack to the minimal effective actions dont waste time and keep the show on the road the more you worry about the attacks the more motion you waste and the less scientology you get done so all the enemy can do is to get negative gain by reducing your effect see if its your game before playing it nothing wastes as much time as the law because the law has overts against time if one anywhere fought scientology it would be as nothing unimportant think of all the philosophies that must have been developed in the past eleven years none of them have been fought sure sign that we have ignorance and aberration on the run is that there are attacks and fights the process is biting start worrying when there are more attacks also note that our comm lines are far more rapid and effective than the enemys and must be kept up this alone discourages the enemy
