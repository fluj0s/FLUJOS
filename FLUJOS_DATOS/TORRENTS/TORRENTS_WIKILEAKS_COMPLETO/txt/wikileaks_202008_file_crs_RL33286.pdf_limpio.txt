numerous communities across the united states imposed bans on the sounding of train whistles at highwayrail grade crossings beginning in the late 1970s to address complaints and concer ns of nearby residents bout noise from train whistles in 1990 federal railroad administration fra study of train whistle bans in florida showed positive correlation between nighttime whistle bans and the number of accidents at highwayrail crossings in 1994 partially in response to the fra study congress enacted the swift rail development act pl 103440 which directed the fra to issue regula tion on the sounding of train horns at gradecrossings reducing the number of accidents and injuries at rail gradecrossings has been federal concern for decades accidents at highwayrail gradecrossings are one of the leading causes of railroadrelated deat hs and injuries accounting for nearly 40 of railroadrelated deaths in 2006 there were 365 gradecrossing fatalities on june 24 2005 fras rule on the use of locomotive horns at highwayrail grade crossings took effect the rule requires that locomotive horns be sounded at all public highwayrail grad crossings except where there is significant risk to persons where supplem entary safety measures fully compensate for the absence of the warning provided by the horn or where sounding the horn as warning is not practical the train horn rule is intended to promote public safety at grade crossings while giving communities an option to protect individuals and businesses located near grade crossings fro m the sounding of train horns fra has exempted the chicago region from the rule pending reanalysis of grade crossing accident data for that area the new rule preempts all state and local laws dealing with bans on the sounding of locomotiv horns at crossings whistle bans affecting roughly 2000 bans in 260 loca lities communities that qualify under one of the exceptions may create quiet zone s in which the sounding of locomotive horns is banned except in an emergency in some cases these new quiet zones may not require any safety improvements by the community but in other cases communities will have to provide safety improvements in order to establish quiet zone as of march 2008 fra had receive d 302 notifications from communities that had established or intended to establish quiet zone this train horn rule was contentious issue in part because of its preemption of existing whistle bans and because of c oncern on the part of communities over what are viewed as stringent requirements for establishing quiet zones many local governments objected to the rule as crea ting an unfunded mandate federal highway administration grants under section 130 of title 23 of the us code to states to reduce the risks of accidents at grade crossings

whistle bans be eliminated as result of this regulation the rule preempted roughly 2000 exis ting state and local whistle bans5 the rule allows communities to establish quiet zones wh ere the sounding of locomotive horns can be banned provided that the risk of grade crossing collisions is below certain level or that the community provides safety measures that compensate for the absence of the

purposes 7 68 federal register 70587 8 68 federal register 70605 this funding came from the federal highway administration section 130 program although highwayrail grade crossing safety improvements are an eligible expense under several federal highway programs most of the federal money spent for that purpose has come from the section 130 program that is dedicated to that purpose in fact the primary reason that separate gr ade crossing safety improvement program was begun in 1973 was that highway safety and especially crossing safety received limited priority for available highway dollars stat ement of edward r hamberger president and chief executive officer association of american railroads submitted to the us house continuedautomatically qualify as quiet zones communities may still maintain their whistle ban for up to five years while bringing those crossings into compliance with the requirements of the rule6 thus in some cases communities may establish quiet zones without making any sa fety improvements in ot her cases communities will be required to make safety improvements to gr ade crossings in order to establish quiet zone in writing the rule fra attempted to balance safety the reduction in risk of accidents and injuries from having trains sound horns at each grade crossing with the quality of life of the millions of citizens living near train tracks who

at that hearing subcommittee members questioned the effective date of the rule and the effectiv eness of sounding train horns as grade crossing safety measure among other issues background cities grow up around trans portation nodes and for nearly century the most important form of transportation in this nation was the railroad consequently many if not most urban areas in the nation are traversed by railroad tracks with trains rolling through day and night there are approximately 250000 highwa yrail atgrade crossings where motorists drive over railroad tracks more gene rally referred to as grade crossings around 153000 of these involve public highwa ys the rest involve private roads7 collisions at these intersections are respons ible for significant percentage of the injuries and deaths

funding has resulted in the installation of around 30000 active warning devices at grade crossings and the closing of many other crossings since 19749 both the number and rate of incident s and deaths at grade crossings have declined significantly over time be tween 1994 and 2003 the number of annual highwayrail grade crossing incidents fell from 4892 to 2909 41 and the annual number of deaths in these incidents fell from 626 to 325 4810 these decreases have occurred in spite of gr owing rates of both train and auto traffic according to the inspector general of th department of transporta tion the primary sources for the reduction in grade crossing collisions in the past decade have been the permanent closing of about 41000 grade crossings and th installation of active warning signals flashing lights and automatic gate s at about 4000 grade crossings11 in 2004 the trend of decreasing deaths from grade cro ssing collisions stopped in 2004 there were 372 deaths in 2005 358 deaths and in 2006 369 deaths preliminary figures for 2007 indicate there were 339 deat hs an 8 decline from 200612 consolidation of the railroad industry since the 1980s has led to reduction in the size of the national rail network nd heavier use of the remaining network resulting in more train movements through those communities where main lines continue to be operated13 this trend combined with growing sensitivity on the part of communities toward noise levels in the environment resulted in number of communities banning the sounding of train horns at intersections14 the sounding of train horns at grade crossings is an impor tant safety measure the horn provides motorists approaching an intersection with information about the proximity speed and direction of an oncoming train15 studies by the fra and others have found that the sounding of train horns at inters ections reduces the risk of grade crossinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33286crs4 16 68 federal register 70588 as discussed belo w the national transportation safety board has concerns about the audibilit of train horns inside closed vehicles with other active sources of noise but the board supports the use of horns as safety warning

21 68 federal register 70589 the study was updated in 2000 with similar conclusions 22 pl 103440 section 302accidents and that banning the sounding of horns at grade crossings increases the risk of accidents16 in 1984 the state of florida authorized local communities to ban the sounding of horns by intr astate railroads17 at night at intersections equipped with flashing lights and bells crossing gates nd signs warning motorists that trains horns would not be sounded at night by 1989 florida comm unities had banned the nighttime use of train horns at 511 of 600 eligible intersections18 1990 fra study found that there were almost three times as many collisions after the bans were established while the daytime collision rates were virtually unchanged19 fra concluded that banning the sounding of train horns at grade crossings created safety ris k the agency issued an emergency order in 1991 ending train horn bans in florida in the two years after that order nighttime collision rate s dropped to near preban levels20 the florida study led fra to do similar nationwide study that study published in 1995 identified 2122 public grade crossings where train horn bans had been in place some time between 1988 nd 1994 not counting the 511 crossings in the florida study and concluded that cro ssings with train horn bans averaged 84 more collisions than similar crossings with bans21 in response to the evidence of increased risk of injuries and death from bans on the use of train horns at intersections c ongress mandated that fra regulate the use of train horns at intersections requiring thei r use except in certain situations at fras discretion22 fras final rule on the use of locomotive horns at highwayrail grade crossings implemented that congressi onal mandatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33286crs5 23 68 federal register 70658 24 the length of the transition period depends on when the whistle ban was established five years for bans established before

safety rule that implements as well as minimizes the potential negative impacts of congressional mandate to blow train whistles and horns at all public crossings23 it requires that locomotive horns be sounded at public highwayrail grade crossings while providing exceptions to this requirement the regulation preempts any state and local train whistle bans the rule also provides options for communities to establish quiet zones whistle ban areas where the sounding of train horns can be banned at grade crossings the options are intended to balance the risk of removing one safety measure the sounding of the train horn by adding other safety measures however under some circumstances communities can ba n the sounding of train horns at grade crossings without additional sa fety improvements where ade quate safety features are already in place or where the risk of accidents is below one of the thresholds established in the regulation communities with existing whistle bans can continue the bans though the communities may have to make safety improvements to do so transition period is provided to give them time to make improvements that may be needed to qualify for quiet zone status24 during the transition period the community can maintain the existing ban on sounding horns at those crossings fra faced numerous challenges in writin g this rule eleven years elapsed between the time congress mandated the creation of the train horn rule and the publication of the rule in its final fo rm fra received 4800 comments during the rulemaking process this rule has been contentious one in part because it preempts roughly 2000 existing state and cal bans on the sounding of locomotive horns at public highwayrail grade crossings25 and in some cases may require communities to spend tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars or more26 on safety measures in order to maintain thei r whistle bans or to create new ones requirements for establishing quiet zones congress mandated the sounding of train horns at highwayrail grade crossings because communities had begun to establish whistle bans while several studies had shown that the horn is an effective safety measure in preventing accidents and deaths in implementing the law requiring the soundi ng of train horns at crossings whilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33286crs6 27 70 federal register 21871 28 supplementary safety measures as defined in the rule are engineering measures that physically reduce the risk of motorists being in volved in collision with train at grade crossing some of these measures eliminate th risk closing the crossing to highway traffic for the period of the whistle ban if the ban is 24 hours day this requires permanent closure of the crossing or completely separating the highway from the railway grade separation other measures seek to make it more difficult for motorists to drive around lowered gate blocking the approach lanes to the crossing either conversion of the highway crossing to oneway street with gates that block the approach lanes to the crossing installation of fourquadrant gate system one in which gate blocks both approach and departure lanes from the crossing or installati on of median that prevents motorist from swerving out of the approach lane that is bl ocked by lowered gate the estimated costs for these ssms range from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars 29 additional safety measures may be ssms or alternative safety measures asms alternative safety measures include systema tic and measurable program of monitoring crossing and enforcing traffic laws there public education and awareness campaign about the risks of grade crossings and relevant traffic laws photo enforcement modified ssms ssms that dont fully comply with the ssm requirementsproviding exceptions to that requirement fra sought to ensure that quiet zones while providing for quiet at grade crossing s also continue to provide the level of safety for motorists and rail employees nd passengers that existed before the quiet zones were first established or in the alternative the level of safety provided by the average gated public cro ssing where locomotive horns are routinely sounded27 thus the rule is intended to provide thod to establish national average level of risk at grade crossings and the level of risk at crossing or corridor and to compensate for risk above the national averag that may be created by silencing train horns at grade crossings by providing suppl ementary or additional safety measures as specified in the rule the minimum requirement for quiet zone is that every public highwayrail grade crossing in th proposed quiet zone corridor must have flashing lights and gates that control traffic over the crossing from that basis there are three alternatives available to communities wanting to establish quiet zone 1 the community can institute one or more of the supplementary safety measures ssms28 specified in the rule at each public crossing in the quiet zone or 2 if the accident risk risk index for th quiet zone is less than or equal to the nationwide average risk of accidents at grade crossings equipped with flashing lights and automatic gates where train hor ns are sounded nationwide significant risk threshold the community can blish quiet zone without implementing additional safety measures if the risk index of the proposed quiet zone is above the nationwide significant risk threshold the community may implement additional safety measures29 at crossings sufficient to reduce the risk index for the zone to the threshold level or below or 3 the community can implement safety measures that reduce the risk index for the quiet zone to less than or equal to the level of the risk index with horns ie the risk that would exist if train horns were sounded at every public highwayrail grade crossing in the proposed quiet zonehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33286crs7 30 the first

additional safety measures may be more expensive initially but provide more certainty quiet zone s which are qualified by the second measure comparison to the nationwide significant risk threshold must be reviewed each year the nationwide significant risk threshold will be recalculated each year quiet zone that qualified by having risk less than the nationwide threshold may fall out of compliance if the threshold declines forcing the community to implement additional safety measures30 communities may qualify proposed quiet zone in two ways the quiet zone may automatically qualify if it meets the firs t or third condition lis ted above if the community qualifies quiet zone under the second condition that qualification requires the review nd approval of the fra converting existing whistle bans into quiet zones fra provides special provisions for communities that had whistle bans in place as of the publication of the interim final rule fra created two classes of pre existing

october 9 1996 but before the publication of the interim final rule december 18 2003 communities that had whistle bans in place as of oc tober 9 1996 may keep their whistle bans in place for five years31 after five years the quiet zone must be in compliance with the requirements of the rule the period to bring quiet zone into compliance may be extended to eight years if state agency is involved in the creation of the quiet zone during this transition period the community can continue to ban the sounding of train horns at grade crossings whistle bans in place as of october 9 1996 may automatically qualify as quiet zones and the community may continue to ban the sounding of train horns without providing additional sa fety improvements if each public crossing in the quiet zone

the community could continue to ban the sounding of train horns under the same conditions as whistle bans tablished as of october 9 1996 except that those communities were allowed to maintain their existing whistle ban for only one year ie only until summer 2006 after th at the community must have provided any safety improvements required to comply with the requirements for quiet zone 32 impacts of the rule estimated monetary costs and benefits fra estimated that the costs to communities of implementing the rule over 20 years excluding the chicago area w ould be 41 million compared to projected benefits excluding the chicago ar ea over 20 years estimated at 57 million33 fra asserts that the costs may be overstated since some communities might have made the same sorts of improvements in the absence of the rule and the benefits may be understated since the estimate d value does not include reduction in freight and passenger train delays due to collisions avoided the chicago area transportation studys council of mayors asserted that fra underes timated the cost of implementing the rule they noted that fras initial estimate of the costs of preserving the existing

the use of locomotive horns at hi ghwayrail grade crossings pp 23safety impact fra estimated that the rule requiring th sounding of train horns at all public grade crossings with some exceptions would prevent 95 accidents 8 deaths and 45 injuries over 20year period41 to put those numbers in context in 2004 the year before the rule took effect there we re total of 3075 grade crossing accidents resulting in 372 deaths and 1090 injuries of that total 2527 accidents involved motor vehicles at public crossings resulting in 257 deaths and 918 injuries42 fra asserted that the safety benefit could increase if more communities than estimated chose to adopt supplementary or alternative safety measur in order to create quiet zones in the context of perhaps 6000 7000 deaths from grade crossing accidents over the next twenty years reduction of 8 deaths may appear small to some however the thrust of this rule is not primarily to establish new safety standard fra noted that prior to the publication of the rule train horns were already being sounded at more than 98 of public grade crossings thus the rule formalized an already pr evailing industry standard43 the majority of the text of the rule deals with allowing exceptions to th requirement that train horns be sounded at all public grade crossings particularly with the establishment of quiet zones and limiting the risk created by those exceptions fra has noted that the purpose of requiring additional safety measures for quiet zones was to compensate for the increased accident risk caused by not soundi ng locomotive horns and that the result might be neutral in its impact on th risk level of those crossings44 on the other hand the association of am erican railroads aar asserted that the exceptions allowed by the rule could increase the risk of grade crossing accidents in some locations if the risk of an accide nt in proposed quiet zone is greater than the risk when horns are sounded at that crossing but less than the nationwide significant risk threshold the quiet zone can be approved even through its creation would increase the risk of accidents at that crossing aar also noted that risks at some crossings may be increased because communities are allowed to create quiet zone corridors encompassing multiple grade cr ossings as long as the overall risk level for all the crossings are below the nationwide significant risk threshold even though the risk of grade crossing accidents at an individual crossing or crossings in the corridor may increase further aar argued that risk is increased because communities are given three years to implement safety improvements in quiet zone should it become apparent that the ri sk level in the zone is too high45httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33286crs11 46 68 federal register 70600 47 fra train horn rule final envi ronmental impact statement p 43 48 ibid p 49 to 410fra responded that individuals and orga nizations in whistle ban areas have made choices based on the existence of th at ban and congress directed the agency to consider the interests of communities with whistle bans the agency noted that the rule attempts to balance the competin g concerns of safety from sounding train horns at crossings and communitys desi re for quiet from silencing train horns at crossings and noted the grace periods pr ovided under the rule five and eight years maintain community quiet well ahead of community actions that would otherwise warrant that result46 noise impact fra estimated that prior to the issu ance of the regulation 94 million people were affected by train horn noise and the agency estimated that the rule would eliminate the existing noise impact on 34 million of these people by reducing the loudness of train horns reducing the amount of time they are sounded and by leading to the establishment of quiet zones47 on the other hand assuming worstcase situation in which quiet z ones were established after th rule took effect ie all existing whistle bans were eliminated fra estimated that 445611 persons would experience increased noise levels due to train horns sounding at all public highway rail grade crossings of that number 46 of those people live in one state illinois and 34 of the total live in si ngle county cook county illinois48 fra asserts that the rule will reduce existing train horn noise levels over time through limiting the maximum sound level fo r train horns to 110 decibels and limiting the duration of sounding horns at grade crossings to more than 1520 seconds prior to the rule locomotive hor ns did not have maximum noise level many operated at 111 decibels also prior to the rule the sta ndard industry practice was for locomotive engineers to begin s ounding the train horn onequarter mile from the intersection if train was going ss than 45 miles per hour as trains often do in heavilypopulated areas with numerous gr ade crossings the train horn would have been sounded for longer than 20 seconds issues several issues contributed to the protracted rulemaking process for this regulation some of which may continue to be of interest to congress effectiveness of train horn s in alerting

nationwid excluding chicago and intermediate quiet zonespassenger and emergency vehicles of various types located 100 feet from locomotive horn the sound level of the hor n outside the vehicles was 96 decibels inside the vehicles with windows closed and engines idling ntsb found that the sound of the train horn was less than 10 d ecibels above the ambient sound level not loud enough to alert the drivers to the presence of the horn when the fans in the vehicles were turned on the horn was not audi ble at all in seven of the vehicles and the sound of the horn was less than 10 decibe ls above the ambient sound level in all the remaining vehicles nevertheless ntsb noted sounding train horns is an important element of grade crossing sa fety and should be done unless effective substitutes are in place49 in the rule fra set the permissible s ound level of train horns at distance 100 feet ahead of the horn at range of 96 110 decibels fra asserted that analysis indicated 95 likelihood that train horn set to emit 108 decibels at range of 100 feet would be heard by motori st approaching grade crossing50 preemption of local decisionmaking many local governments assert that the rule is an unfair preemption of their authority51 many claim that the basic re sponsibility for deciding under what circumstances to establish whistle ban s hould reside with local government fra acknowledged that whistle bans established prior to the rule reflected policy choice made by the local community in weighing the risks of grade crossing accidents with the quality of life of residents fra observed that it was mandated by congress to require the sounding of train horns at inte rsections to promote public safety and that the regulations minimize the potential negative impacts of that mandate costs of preservingestablishing quiet zones fra estimated the costs to preexisting whistle ban crossings excluding the chicago area of converting to quiet zones at around 20 million over 20 years this is subset of the 40 million total cost estimate discussed above52 fras cost estimate for whistle ban crossings in the chi cago area as noted above is in the range of 2226 million local governments

does not require communities to establish quiet zones the association of american railroads aar asserts that reducing risk at public highwayrail grade crossings is considered benefit primarily to the highway user and thus is the responsibility of the highway user though aar also asserts that railroads invest considerab sums to maintain and inspect grade crossings54 federal funding for grade crossing safety improvements federal funding is available to reduce the risk of grade crossing accidents the primary source of this funding is fede ral highway administration fhwa grant programs some programs are intended sp ecifically to reduce hazards at railway highway grade crossings in other progra ms reducing grade crossing hazards is one of the eligible uses of funding see table 1 for list of potential federal funding sources however fra asserts that federal fundi ng is not likely to be available for improvements to establish quiet zones because it is unlikely that most improvements undertaken under this rule would withstand the priority ranking requirement for safety projects unde r federalaid highway programs55 federal grade crossing risk reduction funding is subject to strict re quirements for ranking the priority of projects on statewide basis56 this ranking requirement recommends crossing safety improvements that yield the greatest accident reduction benefits based on cons ideration of predicted accidents and casualties at crossings the cost and effectiveness of warnin g device options and the budget limit57 the agency notes that establishing quiet zone may produce

transportation r eauthorization legislation safetealu pl 10959 passed in 2005 there were dozens of earmarks for safety improvements to railway highway grade crossings totaling tens of milli ons of dollars in the high priority projects section section 1702 64 68 federal register 70605fra noted that the automatic warning gates which are required for new quiet zones under this rule were in most cases installed with prima rily federal funds59 thus prior federal funding has already assi sted local governments to some extent in establishing quiet zones60 fra also noted that in fy2000 in addition to the 155 million in federal funding dedicated to sec tion 130 grade crossing safety there was an additional 368 million in fe deral highway safety fundi ng that could have been used for grade crossing improvements of that amount states used 21 million 661 clearly this is an area where states can be encouraged to change the mix of safety projects advanced using this f unding to accommodate more grade crossing safety improvements62 as noted in table 1 states can also use their federal surface transportation program stp funds for engineering improve ments to improve the safety of grade crossings and if the crossings are on ro ads in the national highway system the states can use their national highway syst em program funds als since states can also transfer funds into their stp from veral other federalai d highway programs as noted in the table the stp could be significant source of funding for these improvements but states typically have many highway projects competing for stp funds stp projects are prioritized by tropolitan planning orga nizations and state departments of trans portation and projects have to be in the states statewide transportation improvement program or metropolitan planning organizations transportation improveme nt program to be eligible fo r federal funding these plans typically include far more projects than can be funded with current resources thus to receive funding grade crossing improve ment project would have to be high on the states prioritized list of transportation projects in its transportation improvement plan or on metropolitan planning organi zations transportation improvement plan otherwise the project could be in the tr ansportation improvement plan but so far down the list of projects that it might not receive funding for years if ever members of congress can also direct f unds to specific transportation projects63 but those projects must be in transportation improvement plan before they receive federal funding some parties argue that fe deral funding should not be provided for establishing quiet zones because establishing quiet zone is quality of life improvement not safety improvement64 some observers have critic ized fras rule on the grounds that it would reduce safety overall they fear the rule will lead states to divert funding for mitigating risk at grade crossing s away from higherrisk crossings to fundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33286crs16 65 letter from john kravcik vicechicago area transportation study council of mayors executive committee op cit 66 while allowing communities to ban the sounding of locomotive horns in established quiet zones the rule allows railroad engineers to sound locomotive horns even in quiet zones in case of emergency the rule exempts railr oad engineers from liability for failing to sound locomotive horn in an emergency situation 67 70 federal register 21846improvements required to maintain existing whistle bans at lowerrisk crossings65 they assert that this process would tend to divert resources from improving those crossings in rural areas where active safety technologies such as warning lights and gates have not yet been installed to cr ossings in urban areas which already have warning lights and gates but which may have to implement additional safety measures to preserve whistle bans as noted above fra asserts that the requirements of the federal grade crossi ng safety grant program should limit that diversion however it is possible that individual members of congress may respond to the demands of their constituents by s eeking legislation to direct funds to the creation of quiet zones liability several railroad indus try participants commented that if community insisted that railroads stop sounding locomotive horns at grade crossings long established industry safety measure then the community should be liable for any accidents that may result due to the prohi bition of that safety practice many community representatives noting that the interim final rule provided liability exemption for railroads66 expressed concern about th at exemption leading to an increase in liability on the part of communities establishing quiet zones and argued that fra should also exempt communitie s from liability or at least include statement that the existing liability struct ure for grade crossing accidents would not be changed by the regulation fra asserted that the rule would establish federal standard of care displacing variety of state and local standards of care that have been applied in grade crossing accident cases and would benefit both co mmunities and railroads by providing clear standard fra noted that the standa rd of care applied to the issue of sounding locomotive horns at grade crossings in duly established quiet zones and that there could be factors other than the presence or absence of an audible warning signal that contribute to collisions at grade crossings fra asserted its reluctance to interfere with the existing liability structure fra noted that states have the power to exempt their local communities from lawsuits throug h the application of sovereign immunity and that some states have chosen to do so67 another liabilityrelated issue raised by many communities was concern that railroads would require communities to transfer liability entirely to the community as prerequisite for improvements required to establish quiet zone communities urged fra to include language in the rule that would expressly forbid this tactic conversely as noted above

that railroads would require indemnification agreements as prerequisite to establishing quiet zones fra asserted that state and local governments would in many cases be able to make the safety improvements needed to establish quiet zones with little or cooperation from the railroads69 the role of motorists in grade crossi ng accidents dot ig office analysis of public highwayrail grade crossing incident reports indicated that 94 of the accidents and 87 of the resulting fatalities during the period 19942003 were due to risky behavi or or poor judgement on the part of motorists ie motorists failed to stop at grade crossings or drove around activated automatic gates70 more than half 51 of the public grade crossing accidents occurred at crossings equipped with auto matic or active warning devices ie flashing lights andor and gates71 in light of this fra received many comments arguing that residents of communities shoul d not be subject to the noise of train horns in an effort to protect irresponsib people from the consequences of their actions fra asserted that it is appropriate to protect even the unwise from the consequences of their misdeeds where thos consequences are especially severe and where society as whole may bear the burden of those consequences72 the agency also noted that grad crossing accidents caused by irresponsible drivers often harm innocent victims passengers in those drivers cars railroad employees and passengers other drivers and people living nearby
