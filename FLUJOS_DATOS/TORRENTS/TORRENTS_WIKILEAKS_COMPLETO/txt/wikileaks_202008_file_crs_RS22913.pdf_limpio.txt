concerned that other lowcost lifesaving interventions are overlooked and underfunded particularly those related to child survival and maternal health critics of how us global health funds are apportioned point out that child and maternal mortality rates remain dangerously high in subsaharan africa and that the continent is the only region in the world where those rates continue to rise in addition to these concerns some global health analysts point out that despite significant foreign investments in hivaids many developing countries are illequipped to treat the majority of patients suffering from noninfectious diseases and address basic health care global health advocates urge congress to provide more for health system strengthening which would enable governments to address any disease that might afflict its population supporters of this idea assert that much of usaids activities that are not related to pepfar operate in an integrative fashion and simultaneously address wide range of health challenges throughout the first term of pepfar fy2004 fy2008 aggregated appropriati ons to usaids global health programs changed little figure 2 if fy2008 appropriations are excluded
