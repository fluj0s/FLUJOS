part of the library along with the core library services documents processing and archiving national archives and libraries in the world usually included cultural activities in their functions cultural activities would brin g to light institutional memory values work and objectives of the united nations through the li brary and archives activities the cac chairperson felt that the normal cultural activitie s programmes carried out at the request of the member states did not require change to the stsgb20004 while oios does not question the usefulness of the cultural activities programme such activities are an additional assignment to the library which absorbs part of th librarys resources and should therefore be reflected in the document 3 recommendation head2right unog should include management of cultural activiti as one of the unog library functions in the revision of sts gb2004 on the organization of unog rec 01 unog did not accept the recommendation oios maintains its view that revision of the stsgb on the organization of unog would be appropr iate the revised stsgb should include cultural activities under unog library to r eflect the present arrangement and reporting line for cultural activities programme at unog oio s will close the recommendation when it receives revised stsgb20004 that includes the cultural activities responsibilities of unog library b contract for holding cultural events 10 the programme uses copy of the guidelines of the cultural activities committee of the united nations office at geneva signed by the mber state or sponsoring organizations representative and the cultural activities coordina tor as contract to hold cultural event oios review of this document shows need for clea rer more consistent and updated terms and references to documents in order to avoid m isinterpretation and ensure that the interest of the organization is fully protected s ome examples of provisions that need clarification are outdated reference to information circular icgene va3991 of 5111993 replaced by icgeneva200514 on the use of the premises of g reference to the required advance payment of at least 80 per cent of reimbursable costs one week before the event article ii 9 says that all costs shall be borne by the organizing entity whereas article iii 4 states that as from 1 february 2003 porti on of the costs relating to the organization and promotion of cultural activities t unog will be invoiced article ii10 referral to financial responsibility only in the installation of exhibitions or presentations thus excluding other activities of t hese events and other types of cultural events article iv clause prohibiting commercial exploita tion refers only to organizersartists rather narrow scope thus the guidelines should be revised and sta ndard agreement drafted both should be cleared by the unog senior legal officer and the ch ief financial resources management service frms the authority of the ca coordinato r or another staff member to sign on behalf of unog should also be formalized in writing recommendation head2right the chief librarian unog in consultation with the unogs senior legal officer and the chief financial resources ma nagement service should draft standard agreement and revise the g uidelines for holding cultural events both should ensure that t he terms and conditions of the contract for cultural events cont ract are clear and that 4 the interests of the organization are fully protect ed when actual contracts deviate from this model clearance from t he senior legal officer andor chief financial resources managemen t service should be obtained rec 02 unog accepted the recommendation the guidelines f the cultural activities committee of the united nations office at geneva april 2004 w ill be redrafted accordingly estimated target date december 2006 may be changed subject to discussion with unogs senior legal officer and chief financial resources management rvice oios will record the recommendation as implemented upon receipt the new standard agreement and the revised guidelines c post event feedback and evaluation 11 systematic feedback from missions or persons attending the cultural activities has been solicited to date feedback has been observed in sp eeches of ambassadors during opening sessions of cultural activities or thank you lette rs from ambassadors after the event gathering and analysis of feedback and information however need to be made more systematic to help meet expectations of missions and other target grou ps surveys using questionnaire could be useful tool to gather information summary report after cultural events describing the efficiency or the level of satisfaction by particip ants or observers of cultural activities should also give useful information to the cac for more ef fective planning and decisionmaking recommendation head2right the chief librarian unog should establish procedur to obtain regular feedback on cultural events from missions sponsoring organizations and target audiences and report its r esults to the cac rec 03 unog accepted the recommendation mechanisms to rec eive feedback on the management of cultural events from organizing entities missions sponsoring organizations and on the perception of cultural events from target audiences would be studied estimated target for implementation june 2006 oios will consider the recommendation as implemente d when it receives copy of the procedures to obtain regular feedback d press releases and website 12 there were occasional press releases and hardly any local press coverage of unogs cultural events guidelines for the cultural events online presentations and annual reports from 2001 to 2003 are posted on the website but there i s mechanism to send feedback and only in recent months has the websites calendar of even ts been updated ensuring regular press releases about the events and updated information n the website would contribute to disseminating the achievements of the programme and generate more interest among funding missions and other sponsoring organizations repor ting of results of recently concluded events and request for feedback or comments on the website would give useful information to the cac 5 recommendation head2right the chief librarian unog in cooperation with unog information service should issue regular press releases and reg ularly update the website to inform on cultural activities planned an d undertaken rec 04 unog accepted the recommendation the library will identify the professional qualifications required to accomplish the task the manpower requ ired to implement and maintain recommendation 4 on longterm perspective will be assessed estimated target date for implementation june 2006 may be changed subject to discussion with unog information service oios will consider this recommendation as implement ed when it receives copies of regular press releases and verifies the programmes updated website oios is not convinced however that press information and information on the website on events planned and events undertaken require additional manpower the library should make efforts to include enhanced public information into the normal workflow of orga nizing cultural events b financial management reimbursable costs 13 depending on the type of event and services ne eded starting 2003 member states or other events sponsors are invoiced for certain direct co sts such as those for extra security hire overtime sound technician recording operator ele ctrician inhouse and outsourced installation costs film operator and invitation ca rds andor posters the total reimbursable costs in 2003 amounted to some 27000 and between 2004 to july 2005 to some 77000 the reimbursable costs do not include costs for adm inistration such as for services rendered by central support service css and financial resourc management service frms and for costs of electricity cleaning use of space 14 the bulk of the costs of the cultural activit ies programme are staff costs of at least 400000 per biennium consisting of the partial of the chief librariancac chairperson 25 the ca assistant 85 and full time ca co ordinator these costs are not charged back to the activities but are borne by the librar regular budget using the total number of events of 157 in 2003 and 2004 the average cost pe r event would be around 2500 the cac chairperson indicated that charging an extra 2500 per event would kill cultural activities and could have political implications as permanent missions who do not have enough means would be prevented from participating in the cultur activities the cac chairperson further mentioned that the division of administration agree d to charge only direct incremental costs before unog sent the note verbale indicating the ra tes and nature of reimbursable costs to be charged the permanent missions and other sponsoring organizations he also said that it was agreed with the frms unog to use the library staff to implement the ca programme and that the job description of the cultural activities coordinator clearly describes his functions as falling under cultural activities 15 stsgbppbme of 2000 under rule 1052 states t hat activity or output shall be included in the proposed programme budget unless it is clearly in implementation of the mediumterm plan strategy and likely to help to ach ieve the plan objectives or it is in implementation of legislation passed subsequent to the approval or revision of the plan underscoring ours the ca programme is not menti oned in the 20022005 medium term 6 plan mtp but the cac chairperson cited the afore mentioned ga resolutions as basis of the cultural activities programme for inclusion in the unog library programme budget which lists the programmes outputs but not the achievem ent indicators unog stated that it is consistent with the general financial policy to cha rge only the direct incremental costs resulting from the cultural activities 16 while oios does not question the financial pol icy not to charge administrative costs which have been absorbed within existing resources and drawn upon voluntary contributions oios maintains that unog should clearly disclose in the programme budget the use of regular budget resources for the cultural activities progra mme in addition the programme budget should clearly indicate not only the required resou rces and outputs but also achievement indicators of expected accomplishments which are p rescribed under the results based budgeting recommendation head2right unog should disclose the use of regularly funded po sts for implementing the cultural activities programme and the required achievement indicators and expected accomplishments in his proposed programme budget as required under the results based budgeting rec 05 in the chief librarians comments the strategic pl an replacing mtp should reflect the use of regularly funded posts for implementing cultural activities programme and the required achievement indicators for expected accomplishments oios will consider this recommendation as implemented when it receives co py of the next budget submission that includes the use of regular budget resources for cu ltural activities and their achievement indicators b special account for cultural activities proje ct code z171 17 to enhance the cultural activities programme nd support the organization of cultural activities unog solicits voluntary contributions u sing the special account for cultural activities project code z171 created in october 2002 income of this fund was approximately 40000 for 20022003 and some 1500 0 for 2004 to 31 july 2005 unog should consider charging programme support costs to this special account for cultural activities as unog also incurs administrative suppo rt costs for these activities c reimbursable costs charged under project code z 188 and receivables 18 reimbursable costs are charged using project c ode z188 with invoiced amount of some 27000 in 2003 56000 in 2004 and 21000 as of 31 july 2005 as of that date 4500 5300 and 6600 were receivables from 2003 2004 and 2005 or total of 16400 this meant an average collection rate of 84 per cent of the total invoiced amount of 104000 with yearly collection rate of 83 and 92 per cent respec tively for 2003 and 2004 the collection rate as of 31 july 2005 rate or after six months was 69 per cent 19 unog sends the invoice to collect actual reimb ursable costs and follows up on the collection of these receivables as provided for i n icgeneva200014 of 1 march 2005 permanent missions and other sponsoring organizatio ns have been required to advance at least 80 per cent of the estimated reimbursable costs one week before the date of the event rather 7 short period of time to cancel an event in case of nonpayment of the advance this requirement remains to be implemented the cac chai rperson needs to establish with frms the best way to proceed to recover long outstanding receivables for more accurate disclosure of accounts if the receivables prove to be irre coverable unog should obtain approval from the controller for their writeoff in acco rdance with in accordance with stai20041 of 8 march 2004 and financial rule 1068 unog commented that the collection of long outstanding accounts for cultura l activities is evaluated as part of the continuing evaluation of all the accounts receivabl recommendation head2right the financial resources management service unog w ith the chief librarian unog should examine the effectiveness of requiring payment of an advance of at least 80 per cent one w eek before the date of the event and establish mechanism to impl ement it rec 06 unog frms commented that the suitability of the one week deadline to pay the advance can be further examined but they could not yet draw pe rtinent conclusions considering the short time since the policy had been adopted to avoid dministrative overhead and to facilitate administrative procedures the chief librarian sugg ested rules governing expenditures for cultural activities depending on the amount per eve nt including the manner to treat the cases of organizingsponsoring entities that have negativ payment performance oios will consider the recommendation closed upon receipt of the resul ts of the discussion of the policy or rules governing expenditures and required advances for cu ltural activities d cost estimates approval 20 currently the ca coordinator prepares the cos t estimates using standard costs of pertinent services and estimates of manhours submitted by cs s sections involved in providing the services clearance of cost estimates from ppbs is required only for costs that do not fall within the standard costs for services of security sound technician and installation as well as for printing of invitations andor posters the co st estimates are annexed to the guidelines sent to the member states permanent mission or to the sponsoring organization as part of the agreement in holding cultural events the present c ost estimation procedure was departure from the workflow in 2003 which as agreed before am ong css frms and the ca programme required prior clearance of all cost est imates from ppbsfrms before being annexed to the guidelines agreement ppbs indica ted that they agreed to this present practice with css and cac since this procedure wou ld not delay the process and ppbs still approves the final reimbursable costs for billing facto the css has the authority to send cost estimates using standard costs as the revise d procedure needs to be formalized oios suggests that the ca coordinator have the current p rocedures for cost estimation of reimbursable costs be put in writing for mutual agr eement by the css frms and ca programme 8 c donations of works of art authority to accept donations 21 the controller has delegated the authority to accept voluntary contributions gifts and donations to the united nations to the director of administration who further delegated it to the chief of frms unog artists from time to time through the permanent missions donate works of art to unog there is formal procedure for acceptance of such donations in kind by officials as required by financial rule 1034 while oios agrees that gifts in connection with the cultural events are not to be ssimilated with inkind contributions there acceptance needs nevertheless to be formally appro ved given there potential cost implications for instance the maintenance cost of sculptures to be displayed outside the buildings is an issue unog should therefore blish procedures to ensure that all donations are received in accordance with the relevant fin ancial rule and instructions frms commented that the cebfb task force on accounting standards envisages preparing guide on the best practices for dealing with voluntary co ntributions of this nature pending the finalization of such study and formalization of p rocedure the chief frms asked the chief librarian to refer the acceptance of these gifts an d donations to the controller in line with financial rule 1034 recommendation head2right the chief librarian unog should establish procedur to ensure that donations of art works are only accepted after obtaining clearance from official with delegated authority to rece ive donations in accordance with financial rule 1034 rec 07 unog accepted the recommendation and stated that th designated official should take into account the recommendation of the cultural activiti committee in each case oios will close the recommendation upon receipt of procedures for the acceptance of gifts and donations from cultural activities b receipt recording and reporting of donations 22 the system to account for donations of works f art needs improvement there has been systematic log of donations as soon as the ca co ordinator receives them nonetheless donations received are reported to the unog invento ry subunit which records them in its register but the subunits june 2005 inventory li st that the ca programme provided to the audit team showed donations received only up to 20 02 and one received in 2003 testing of items listed in the annual report of 2002 to the its inventory list nonetheless proved satisfactory the values of these donated works of art are unknown according to system accounting standards only significant voluntary co ntributions in kind which can be used in the normal course of an organizations programme an d provided that fair value can be reasonably estimated should be reported in the fina ncial statements the accounts division according to frms unog is currently loo king into the valuation and treatment of these donations in the financial statements 23 the donations are reported as part of the ca nnual report donations from exhibitors reported in the annual report were 2001 20 2002 19 2003 24 and 2004 13 or total of 76 donations from 20012004 however in the stora ge room the audit team counted only 71 donated paintings and 2 sculptures of which 19 wer not marked or tagged by the subunit 9 of the works of art found in the storage room the team was able to match only 10 paintings and 1 sculpture that were listed in the annual repo rts for 2001 2002 and 2003 certain donated pieces of artwork have been borrowed by senior staf f members to decorate their office and they were required to sign handover receipts but the re has been proof of regular inventory taking of all the donations the cac chairperson sa id that his predecessor asked for an inventory taking but this had not been carried out to strengthen accountability the donated works of art should be recorded as soon as they are received by the ca programme and all of them be properly tagged located inventoried and f ully accounted for and reported to frms unog c storage and security of donations and artwork f or exhibition 24 storage room for donations is not adequate pa intings are stackedpiled up one on top of the other the storage room is overheated oios r ecommends that the cac find an appropriate room that meets acceptable standards to store works of art such as paintings sculptures etc security measures in the storage r oom also need to be improved to prevent theft of donations in addition to ensure that artwor k is lost during the exhibition the ca coordinator should establish with the organizer list of the works of art that will be exhibited or ask the organizer to provide complete list and doublecheck that everything is accounted for before and after the event recommendations head2right the cac chairperson should arrange for maintenance of log of donations of works of art and ask the unog inventor subunit to locate all donated works of art of the cultural act ivities programme conduct regular inventory and tag them submit an accurate inventory list for reporting to frms unog and keep the inventory list regularly updated rec 08 head2right the cac chairperson should also arrange for proper and secure storage room for the donations of works of art to ensure that all works of art for exhibition are accounted for li st should be required from the organizer and checked for accuracy before and after the cultural event rec 09 unog accepted recommendations 8 and 9 the unog in ventory subunit is currently locating all donated works of art with the purpose to submit an accurate inventory list for reporting to frms unog and keep the inventory list regularly updated the buildings and engineering section unog will be contacted for adv ice on proper and secure storage room upon receipt of an exhibit at the palais des nation s the cultural activities
