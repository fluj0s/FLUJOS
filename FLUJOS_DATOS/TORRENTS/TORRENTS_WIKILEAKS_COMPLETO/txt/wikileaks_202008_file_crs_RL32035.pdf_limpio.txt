theft and expropriation act of 2004 s 1932 and s 2237 passed the senate because digital transmission poses the greatest distribution risk to entertainment content owners these bills attempt to thwart

background digital technology has radi cally altered the landscape of copyright law the potential for unauthorized but near perfect replication of digital media poses new challenges to copyright owners copyright law gives copyright holder the exclusive right to reproduce adapt distribute perform publicly and display protected material for limited term1 historically technology or lack thereof presented an obstacle to widespread piracy for example repeated copying of analog video or audio tapes could result in degradation of the quality of the reproduction packaging and transportation for distribution could be cumbersome there are comparable impediments to copying and distributing media in digital format the legal basis for protecting copyright has traditionally been through the initiation of civil proceeding by the c opyright holder against the infringer for injunctive relief andor mone damages although there are criminal sanctions for willful infringement as well2 the efficacy of this remedy is diminished in digital environment where distribution may be decentralized instantaneous and global unauthorized peertopeer p2p file sh aring of music illustrates this problem instituting civil suit against t housands of individuals for each unauthorized download has traditionally been presumed to be infeasible recently however the recording industry association of american riaa has embarked on an aggressive litigation enforcement effort against college students and others who upload or download copyrighted sound recordin gs on p2p filesharing sites3 the efficacy of this effort remains to be seen ne vertheless copyright owners believe that prevention of piracy is preferable th technologybased approaches and mechanisms that copyright owners utilize to protect digital media are referred to as digital rights management drm congress has enacted two laws to date which facilitate drm to enhance copyright protection the audio home recording act ahra of

musical recordings4 it requires manufacturer s and distributors of audio recording devices to employ copy contro l technology however digital musical recording is defined as material object that does not include one or more computer programs5 hence the ahra does not cover songs fixed on computer hard drives and extends only to recordings from the material objects in which songs are otherwise normally fixed such as recorded compact discs cds digital audio tapes audio cassettes longplaying albums digital compact cassettes and mini discs6 the act requires consumer goods manuf acturers to incorporate the serial copyright management system scms into digital audio recording devices scms is technology that sends receives and acts upon information about the generation and copyright status of the files that it plays it allows copies to be made from an authorized recording but prevents th scmsequipped machine from making copies of copies the ahra prohibits circumventi on of the scms system as well in consideration for permission to facilitate consumer copying of music recordings manufacturers are required to pay music royalties based on sales of the devices and as consequence of and in considera tion for the technologylimited copying and royalty payments program manufacturers importers and distributors of audio recording devices and consumers who use them for noncommercial use are protected from suit for copyright infringement more controversial drm law is the digital millennium copyright act dmca of 1998 this law added new chapter 12 to the copyright act entitled copyright protection and management systems7 subject to relatively narrow exceptions this law makes it illegal to circ umvent technological copyrightcontrol measure this includes activity to descramble scrambled work to decrypt an encrypted work or to avoid bypass rem ove deactivate or impair technological measure without the authority of the copyright owner8 in contrast to copyright infringement which prohibits unauthorized or unexcused use of copyrighted material the anticircumvention provisions of the dmca prohibit the design manufacture import offer to the public or trafficking in technology produced to circumvent copyright encryption programs regardless of the actual existence or absence of copyright infringement ev though the anticircumvention provisions of the dmca have to date been upheld by the courts critics argue that they have chilling effect on rights of free speech and that their implementation will thwart the publics ability to access copyrighted works which is ultimately necessary in order to exercise fair use9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32035crs3 9 continued law by robin jeweler march 24 2003 10 17 usc 107 11 see sony corp v universal studios

limited purposes such as criticism comment news reportin g teaching scholarship or research10 and although the concept of personal use ie copying lawfully acquired copyrighted materials for ones personal use is not expr essly protected by statute it is widely accepted and judicially sanctioned11 fair use protects the public interest in free exchange of ideas and discourse the everchanging state of technology nd drm laws raise many issues several of which paradoxically conf ound one another to the exte nt that copyrighted digital material is not encrypted it may be subject to piracy on massive scale but as digital material is increasingly encrypted to protect against piracy the public is in jeopardy of restricted access which may imped the exercise of fair use and some observers assert that prot ection controls give copyri ght holders more exclusive control over their creations than the copyright law intends12 content owners however argue that allowing limited circumvention only to facilitate fair use including personal use is impracticable once the circumvention technology becomes publicly available its protective value is compromised members of 107th congress responded by introduc ing bills which address two sides of the issue piracy prevention and fair use access legislative pr oposals would have mandated gove rnmentsponsored encryption technology and enhanced content owners abilities to fight p2p piracy over the internet other bills were intended to clarify and expand content users fair use including personal use access to digital media while none of these bills were enacted during the 107th congress the underlying policy issues have not been resolved and the ma tter continues to be the subject of interest in the 108th congress this report rveys several

authorize any interdiction actions to stop fair or authorized uses of copyrighted works or any interdiction of public domain workscopyright office would do so with respect to prospective encoding rules the bill stipulated that the rules shall take into account the limitations on the exclusive rights of copyright owners including the fair use doctrine it further provided that person may apply security measure that uses standard security technology to prevent lawful recipient from making personal copy for lawful use 13 the bill would have implemented the standards by requiring interactive computer services to incorporate security measures associated with standard security technologies and by requiring manufacturers importers nd sellers of digital media devices to include the security

alter delete or otherwise impair the integrity of any computer file or data residing on the computer of file trader15 the bill included exceptions to the safe harbor for copyright owners and required them to notify the department of jus tice before employin g specific blocking technologies it created new cause of action in addition to existing ones for file traders to deter harassment or abuse of p2p networks by copyright owners because the bill aimed to allow the prev ention of unauthorized file trading over decentralized p2p networks its sponsors suggested that it would not adversely impact

the artists rights and theft prevention act in title i and the family m ovie act of 2004in title ii40 as explained in colloquy between senators cornyn and hatch the senates version of the family movie act differs slightly from the house version in hr 4077 the housepassed version specified that the exemption from copyright infringement for filtering technology does not apply to ad skipping the senate version omits this express exclusion from the exemption b ecause the permissibility of adskipping devices and technology is gene rally unsettled and it is not the intention of the senate to resolve the question41 sectionbysection analysis of the family movie act explains the housepassed bill included an explicit exclusion to the new section 17 usc 11011 exemption in cases involving the making imperceptible of commercial advertisements or network or station promotional announcements this provision was added on the house fl oor to respond to concerns expressed by members during the house judiciary committee markup that the bill might be read somehow to exempt from copy right infringement liability devices that allow for skipping of advertisements in the playback of recorded television so called adskipping devices such reading is not consistent with the language of the bill or its intent httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32035crs16 42 id at s118534the phrase limited portions of audio or video content of motion picture applies only to the skipping and muting of scenes or dialog that are part of the motion picture itself and not to the skipping of commercial advertisements which are themselves considered motions pictures under the copyright act it also should be noted that the phrase limited portions is intended to refer to portions that are both quantitatively and qualitatively insubstantial in relation to the work as whole where any substan tial part of complete work including commercial advertisement is made imperceptible the section 11011 exemption would not apply the housepassed bill adopted belt and suspenders approach to this question by adding exclusionary language in the statute itself ultimately that provision raised concerns in the senate that such exclusionary language would result in an inference that the bill somehow expresses an opinion or even decides the unresolved legal questions underlying recent litigation related to these socalled adskipping devices in the meantime the copyright office also made clear that such exclusionary language is not necessary in other words the exclusionary language created unnecessa ry controversy without adding any needed clarity to the statute thus the senate amendment omits the exclusionary language while leaving the scope and application of the bill exactly as it was when it passed the house the legislation does not provide defense in cases involving socalled adskipping devices and it also does not affect the legal issues underlying such litigation one way or another consistent with the inte nt of the legislation to fix narrow and specific copyright issue this bill seeks very clearly to avoid unnecessarily interfering with current business models especially with respect to advertising promotional announcements and the like simply put the bill as amended in the senate is narrowly targeted to the use of technologies and services that filter out content in movies that viewer finds objectionable and it in way relates to or affects the legality of socalled adskipping technologies42 the copyright status of adskipping t echnology and devices utilized for private inhome use is unresolved and like all copyright matters the question and any answer will be highly context specific while the sony decision does not address ad skipping at length the ability of tv viewer to do so is implicit in the courts decision that use of betamax to time shif t inhome viewing of broadcast tv is fair use nevertheless the permissibility of ad skipping is not resolved with regard to the wide variety of digital media reco rding devices technology and services in some cases the anticircumvention provisions of the digital millennium copyright act may implicated given the presumed impracticability of monitoring personal viewing in any given household it seems likel that copyright owners as they did in sony would attempt to preclude consumer access to adskipping devices andor services through suits against vendors th ereof based on principles of secondary copyright infringement liability rather than direct suits against consumers
