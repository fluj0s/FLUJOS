and hr 759 larry parker and brent yacobucci resources science and industry division july 18 2005 abstract the climate stewardship act s 342 s 1151 and hr 759 would reduce emissions of six greenhouse gases from anticipated levels beginning in 2010 using ﬂexible marketbased implementation strategy the bills would require economywide reductions but permit participation in precertiﬁed international trading systems and in carbon sequestration programs to achieve part of the reduction requirement the bills exclude residential and agricultural sources of greenhouse gases along with entities that do not own single facility that emits more than 10000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents annually as introduced s 342 s 1151 and hr 759 would require that greenhouse gas emissions from covered entities be limited to year 2000 levels by restricting the reduction regime to single phase with 2000 level target s 342 s 1151 and hr 759 are projected to have substantially reduced costs compared with proposals to further reduce emissions to 1990 levels in june 2005 s 1151 was debated on the senate ﬂoor as samdt 826 and defeated on 3860 votehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22076congressional research

vote this report will be updated as warranted overview of s 342 s 1151 and hr 759 in february 2005 senators mccain and lieberman in troduced s 342 the climate stewardship act of 2005 at the same time representatives gilchrest and olver introduced hr 759 which is very similar to s 342 the primary focus of the proposed legislation is to reduce us emissions of si x greenhouse gases through the use of flexible marketbased mechanisms the six gases are carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o hydrofluorocarbons hfc pe rfluorocarbons pfc and sulfur hexafluoride sf6 they are the six gases covered by the united nations framework convention on climate change ra tified by the united states and by the kyoto protocol not ratified by the united states in may 2005 senators mc cain and lieberman introduced s 1151 an expanded version of s 342 that includes new title designed to encourage innovation and deployment of ss carbonintensive tec hnologies sequester carbon emissions or mitigate the effects of climate change httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22076crs2 as summarized in table 1 the bills would require mandatory and economywide emission reductions the focus is on domestic reductions however the bills do permit participation in precertified internationa l trading systems and allow use of carbon sequestration to achieve part of the reduction requirement table 1 summary of the climate stewardship act issue provision emissions cap six greenhouse gas emissions co2 n2o ch4 sf6 hfc pfc from covered entities are capped at their 2000 levels beginning in 2010 covered entities in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents any electric power industrial or commercial entity th at emits from any single facility owned by the entity over 10000 metric tons annually any refiner or importer of petroleum products fo r transportation use that when combusted will emit over 10000 metric tons annually and any importer or producer of hfcs pfcs or sf6 that when used will emit over 10000 metric tons general allocating and implementing strategya tradeable allowance system is established epa shall determine allocations based on several economic and equity criteria including efficiency and impact on consumers allowances are to be allocated upstream to refiners and importers of transportation fuel along with producers of hfcs pfcs and sf6 and downstream to electric generation industrial and commercial entities other market trading system featuresup to 15 of required reductions may be achieved through pre certified international emissions trading programs carbon sequestration reductions from noncovered entities and borrowing against future reductions bonus credits entities that reduce emissions to their 1990 levels by 2010 receive bonus allowances for six years entities are also allowed to achieve 20 of their reduction requirement during these six years through international emissions trading sequestration or reductions by non covered entities under s 1151 reductions achieved under more stringent mandatory state programs are eligible for bonus allowances banking banking of allowances is permittedrevenue recyclingrevenue recycling to reduce consumer costs and to assist dislocated workers and affected communities along with assistance with deploying new technology is pr ovided through climate change credit corporation however the methodology and amount is unspecified s 342 and s 1151 but not hr 759 include assistance to lowincome persons and communities under s 1151 at least 50 of revenue received must be used for technology deployment scope the provisions cover the 50 stat and the district of columbia penalty for non compliancethe bills establish an excess emissi on penalty equal to three times the market

smaller under s 342s 1151hr 759 than under s 139 of the 108th congress as introduced thus using these analyses may overstate the reductions achieved by s 342s 1151hr 759 and overstate the compliance

during the senates debate on the energy policy act of 2005 samdt 826 was defeated on 3860 vote emissions projections the flexibility provided in the bills along with definitions that rely on future regulatory proceedings make quantifying the bills effects difficult the legislation is economywide and its marketb ased implementation strategy very flexible including bonus reduction credits banking interna tional trading within limits and carbon sequestration within limits alt hough criteria are given for allocating allowances specific allocations are not provided likewise wh ile revenuerecycling is provided for most details are left for regulatory action these variables are in addition to the general difficulty in estimating future effects and costs the emission limits do not take effect until 2010 projec ting emission trends technology development economic growth nd other factors into the future is an inherently uncertain business the legisl ations economywide sc ope and flexibility add to that uncertainty current analyses of the climate stewar dship act were conducted on the version introduced in the 108th congress s 139 that bill contained several provisions not included in s 342 s 1151 and hr 759 mo st importantly the current bills do not include second reduction phase phase that had significant impacts on projected costs1 as introduced s 342 s 1151 and hr 759 are similar to phase 1 of s 139 and even more similar to samdt 2028 as debated on the senate floor in 2003 thus this discussion uses the analyses of phase 1 of s 139 as well as analyses of samdt 2028 to provide insight into the projected effects of s 342 s 1151 and hr 7592 most attempts to project the emissions ffects of the proposed climate stewardship act focus on covered entities only

by charle s river associates cra for the tech central science foundation however its cost analysis and results are driven in large part by assumptions about future tax policy not direct compliance costs as with the analyses presented here as stated by cra we find that the real world tax considerations in our model cras assumption that congress would raise income ta xes as result of revenue losses under s 139 cause the full costs of carbon policy to be about 60 higher than woul d be projected without accounting for these effects see charles river associates the full costs of s 139 with

the number of covered entities may be less under s 342s 1151hr 759 than assumed here so the estimate may overstate reductions that would be achieved under s 342s 1151hr 759 mindful of the uncer tainties noted above table 2 suggests that s 342 s 1151 and hr 759 would reduce greenhouse gas emissi ons 67 below business as usual reference case however it is equally cl ear that s 342 s 1151 and hr 759 would not achieve the voluntary reduction goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels that the united states agreed to at the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change likewise it would not meet the even more stringent 7 reduction below 19901995 baseline levels ma ndated by the kyoto protoc ol that has entered into force but is unratified by the united states cost estimates the same uncertainties surroundi ng emission projections aff ect cost estimates the legislations flexibility offers opportunities to achieve emissi on reductions at leastcost which also makes estimating those costs very difficult once again using phase 1 of s 139 and samdt 2028 as surrogates for s 342 s 1151 and hr 759 four relevant analyses of the climate stewardship act have been

economic areas where two or more of the studies have provided estimates all of these studies provide broad macro economic perspective on the potential impacts of either phase 1 of s 139 or samdt 2028 however it should be noted that the eia studys cost estimates for samdt 2028 are substantially higher than those of the ot her studies listed above for critique of eias cost estimates see the assessment by the pew center5 indeed in contrast to the eia study the tellus institute studies project household savings not costs resulting from phase 1 of s 139 and samdt 2028 in the out years 2015 2020 major sources of these differing conclusions are differing assumptions about the availability of 1 costeffective energy efficiency improveme nts 2 costeffective nonco2 greenhouse gas reductions 3 costeffective carbon sequestra tion and international credits and 4 future natural gas supply with program designed to achieve leastcost solution through marketbased allowance trading system restricting options increases costs one factor not accounted for in these analyses is the kyot protocol with the kyoto protocol entering into force in february 2005 for those countries who have ratified it regional trading programs and projects w ithin developing countries are being implemented the prime example of these is the european unions emission trading scheme euets major component of the eus kyoto protocol implementation plan the euets has traded carbon in the 918 tonne co2 range for the period june 2003 to january 2005 in preparation for its full implementation in 20056 this range of prices is similar to the range of allowances projected by the studies reviewed here for the year 2010 and later for all studies except ei as the emergence of the euets has several implications for the s 342s 1151 hr 759 trading program including 1 potentially increasing the availability of cost effective carbon credits subject to the bills 15 limitation and 2 providing the united states with useful information on the operation of carbon trading scheme indee d the existence of the euets and the entering into force of the kyoto protocol may cause some to r eassess s 342s
