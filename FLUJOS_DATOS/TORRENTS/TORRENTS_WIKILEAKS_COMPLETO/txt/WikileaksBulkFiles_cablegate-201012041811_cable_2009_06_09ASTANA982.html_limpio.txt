june 5 chinese ambassador cheng guoping hosted the ambassador for dinner at the restaurant on the 23rd floor of striking new hotel built in astana and owned by the chinese national petroleum company during fascinating wideranging threehour tour dhorizon the chinese ambassador discussed his governments policy and occasionally made personal comments on human rights smart power president obama afghanistans reconstruction russias policy in central asia georgian president saakashvili irans upcoming presidential elections north koreas nuclear tests central asias energy resources the manas air base and the proposed international nuclear fuel bank the chinese ambassador clearly enjoyed the free and easy openended conversation and invited the ambassador to meet again at the restaurant in the near future guoping was joined by an unidentified policy advisor and an interpreter to whom he addressed his remarks in soft whispers throughout the evening end summary chinas mfa scared by pelosis visit 2 sbu guoping was relaxed wearing short sleeves and jacket and clearly eager to engage and entertain his american guests he began the evening by referring to the recent visit to beijing of house speaker nancy pelosi without openly acknowledging or discussing the twentieth anniversary of the june 4 1989 tiananmen square protests guoping said the government was prepared and also fearful for the speaker to raise human rights and democracy issues during her visit she had the ministry of foreign affairs mfa scared to death on the eve of her visit guoping said halfjokingly praise for smart power 3 sbu without prompting guoping praised president obamas leadership style and approach to foreign affairs he singled out the presidents effective management of the financial crisis for example calling his decisions to stimulate the us economy bold and courageous he called the presidents june 4 speech in cairo which guoping was able to download in mandarin from the departments website milestone for the use of smart power guoping said the presidents willingness to employ both military and cultural assets would prove to be very effective approach to foreign affairs he observed that statesmen require both in order to achieve their policy objectives and said the administrations use of smart power is very good idea iranian elections 4 sbu guoping perceptively connected the cairo speech to upcoming elections in iran this speech is very timely he said i predict that it will influence irans presidential elections and will be particularly beneficial for reformers in iran he said that president obama has already played positive role in rebuilding us relations with iran and again stressed the importance of the upcoming elections the reformists have chance he said guoping suggested that it would be impossible for iran to ignore president obamas overtures for long they cannot remain in the background of these global changes in foreign policy if they do they will become even more isolated than they already are and ultimately if iran doesnt respond president obama will have to change his policy iran might be the last country standing for extremism in the muslim world he said focus on the taliban 5 sbu about afghanistan guoping said the taliban is the real enemy of the united states and the basis for terrorism in south asia he argued that the united states must first eradicate the taliban in order to defeat terror in iraq and said the administrations emphasis on afghanistan was shrewd policy you have enlisted the help of all governments in the region to assist astana 00000982 002 of 004 with the rebuilding of afghanistan saying that to do so is to play part in the war against terrorism one is able to say openly that they do not want to combat terrorism so you have made it very difficult to refuse to help northern distribution network 6 c in particular guoping said that the northern distribution network to transport nonlethal supplies to us troops in afghanistan has enabled many countries to participate in afghanistans reconstruction he said that the chinese government is aware of the us governments request to transit nonlethal supplies via china and said we are actively researching this suggestion in essence it would mean that the peoples republic of china would be supporting nato military operation which would be an interesting development guoping confided that chinas mfa and its ministry of defense have different opinions on the subject although he said he expected decision soon my own personal opinion he said is that we will do the right thing and cooperate with nato and the us government in afghanistan guoping said this would be an appropriate issue to raise in the context of the presidents visit to beijing in july russias policy in central asia 7 c guoping said that russia is experiencing severe difficulty now because of the global financial crisis he suggested that the government of russia is eager to improve relations with the united states now because moscow is concerned that the economic downturn will begin to affect the political stability of the country even the stability of the kremlin guoping said that russia does not want or need any foreign policy problems right now they need to focus on their domestic economic affairs guoping also said that russia would like more support from the united states for its insistence on privileged sphere of influence in central asia in exchange for greater cooperation in afghanistan russia is convinced that they must dominate central asia and the caucasus they believe they have vital strategic historical interests in the region guoping said when pressed by the ambassador to express his own opinion guoping said i personally do not agree that russia should be granted special sphere of influence in the region but that is their view on georgia 8 c on georgia guoping said he expects russia to use military force to overthrow georgian president saakashvili he did not elaborate or offer any specifics but merely observed that russia has already established military bases in abkhazia and south ossetia and is likely to remain there for the foreseeable future guoping worked in georgia for four years and understands well the history and culture of its people he observed that south ossetia has strong cultural ties to russia but said it is likely that the ossetians will ultimately press for greater independence from russian influence 9 c in unusually blunt language guoping said saakashvili is not mature statesman he overreacted to russian provocations and gave russia the opportunity to take abkhazia and south ossetia guoping suggested that secretary rices july 2008 visit to georgia before the war in august 2008 might have indirectly encouraged saakashvili to take military action he said his understanding was that saakashvili briefed secretary rice on his plans to mobilize georgian armed forces and when she did not directly object saakashvili mistook that as sign of us support guoping said clearly russia baited and cheated georgia but saakashvili was impressed with his earlier success in batumi adjara and he thought he could involve the united states in the war guoping said he expects former parliament speaker nino burjanadze to become georgias next president she is much more mature than saakashvili he wont stay long he said north koreas nuclear tests domestic politics 10 c guoping seemed genuinely concerned by north koreas recent astana 00000982 003 of 004 nuclear missile tests we need to solve this problem it is very troublesome he said calling koreas nuclear activity threat to the whole worlds security china opposes north koreas nuclear testing and is working to achieve peace and stability on the korean peninsula according to guoping when asked about the reunification of korea guoping said china hopes for peaceful reunification in the longterm but he expects the two countries to remain separate in the shortterm guoping said the domestic political situation in north korea is very complex and suggested that kim jongils reported decision to anoint his youngest as his successor was driven more by kims deteriorating health than any carefully planned strategy they had time to plan for this he said guoping said the military really governs north korea and controls domestic politics and foreign policy he suggested that kim jongils announcement was designed to send message to the military and the great powers that he is really in charge and in control guoping said chinas objectives in north korea were to ensure they honor their commitments on nonproliferation maintain stability and dont drive kim jongil mad central asian energy 11 sbu turning to discussion of energy resources and energy security in central asia guoping said that russia owns and controls most of central asias pipelines but it cannot prevent the ultimate diversification of export routes he said that kazakhstan uzbekistan and turkmenistan are close to russia but they nevertheless understand that they must seek and develop alternatives he predicted that they will soon break the russian monopoly on the export of hydrocarbons from the region and said the oil and gas pipelines to china now under construction will be very important in that regard guoping said that kazakhstans oil pipeline from atasu to alashankou would be completed in july and will initially carry 200000 barrels per day bbld but will soon be expanded to 400000 bbld he said china would encourage western oil companies to ship their production eastward he was aware of plans to ship kazakhstani oil across the caspian sea by tanker and said china had objections to the project which they considered strictly commercial when asked about chinas recent 10 billion loan to kazakhstan guoping confirmed that 5 billion was earmarked for investments in the energy sector including the purchase of 50 of mangistaumunaigas while the remaining 5 billion would be delivered to the development bank of kazakhstan as soft loan that the government would be free to use as it likes potential partnership with us oil companies 12 sbu guoping said china sees great potential for an energy partnership with us companies in central asia including the development of onshore resources in turkmenistan he said that the chinese mfa is very interested in pursuing these opportunities and suggested that this would be worth including in the chinaus strategic economic dialogue this is very reasonable he said adding our government would actively support such proposal the ambassador noted that chevron is already working with chinese companies in western china on nazarbayev 13 sbu commenting on president nazarbayev guoping called him wise and mature statesman who has presided over period of remarkable stability and economic growth he praised president nazarbayevs foreign policy skills and added that chinas mfa has great respect for president nazarbayev and holds him in high regard manas air base 14 c referring to the manas air base guoping said that the government of kyrgyzstan has tried to show similar sophistication in balancing the interests of the great powers in the neighborhood but has been much less successful he said that according to his information the united states is prepared to pay an additional 50 million year to the government of kyrgyzstan to make them think astana 00000982 004 of 004 about keeping the base open he said he has seen subtle shift in us policy in the region adding youve also made important progress in uzbekistan we ourselves have noticed change in uzbekistans foreign policy over the last year especially toward russia nuclear fuel bank 15 c guoping did not appear to be well briefed on the subject of the iaeaadministered international nuclear fuel bank proposed by the nuclear threat initiative he was aware of russias earlier proposal to host fuel bank but he seemed surprised when told that kazakhstan has announced its intention to host an iaeaadministered fuel bank on its territory indeed he went so far as to question the accuracy of the ambassadors information that iranian president ahmadinejad supported kazakhstans proposal during his state visit to astana in april we are still conducting research on this idea guoping said subtly indicating his unwillingness or inability to discuss the subject further 16 c comment in the past six months the ambassador and guoping have established relaxed open and even frank relationship guoping prefers to meet the ambassador in the us embassy or in public place having explained previously that he believes his own embassys temporary quarters are thoroughly bugged by whom he doesnt say cnpc built the highrise pagodaroofed beijing hotel as gift to astana the marble lobby is impressive if bit too totalitarianaustere the hotel was supposed to have opened in january and we are not convinced that it is now fully open for business we were the only guests in the restaurant although an untouched full buffet was laid out the revolving restaurant provides spectacular panorama of astana and the empty steppe beyond but it seems to revolve at varying speeds and sometimes can be bit too fast on full stomach and after few glasses of wine end comment hoagland
