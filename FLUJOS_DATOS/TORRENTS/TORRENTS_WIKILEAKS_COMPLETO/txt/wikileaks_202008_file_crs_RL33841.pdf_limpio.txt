distributional effects of 12 social security solvency options on social security beneficiaries in 2035 compared with current law the 12 options presented fall into 6 categories of reform proposals for some reform options we present two or more variations on how they could be approached they include the most commonly discussed or introduced proposals to improve cash flow and achieve social security solvency reducing the annual cost of living adjustment cola increasing the number of computation years in the benefit formula increasing the full retirement age fra longevity indexing initial social security benefits progressive price indexing initial social security benefits increasing earnings subject to social security payroll taxes by raising or eliminating the taxable earnings base these tables provide the modeling results used to produce the full analysis of these options contained in companion report crs report rl33840 options to address social security solvency and their impact on beneficiaries resu lts from the dynasim microsimulation model that report presents the distributional effects of these reform options in terms of social security beneficiaries median payroll tax increase or benefit reduction and shows the varied effect of these reforms on beneficiaries along certain socioeconomic lines ie age type of benefit received and income quintile those readers interested in complete explanation of these results are encouraged to read that report the tables contained in this report provide some additional detail not included in the previously mentioned report the first table for each option summarizes the effect of the policy change on beneficiaries in 2035 across socioeconomic groups ie by gender ethnicity educational attainment age marital status benefit type and income quintile these tables show the number in the population the mean percent change in benefits or taxes between current law and the policy option and the median percent change in benefits or taxes between current law and the policy option subsequent tables show the varied effects of these reforms on beneficiaries in 2035 overall and then within each socioeconomic group ie gender ethnicity educational attainment age marital status benefit type and income quintile crs analysts used the dynasim microsimulation model to project the effects of these reforms on social security beneficiaries in 2035 assuming the reforms first take effect in 2013 this report will not be updated

in terms of social security beneficiaries median payroll tax increase or benefit reduction and shows the varied effect of these reforms on beneficiaries along certain socioeconomic lines ie age type of benefit received and income quintile those readers interested in complete explanation of these results are encouraged to read that report the tables contained in this report provide some additional detail not included in the previously mentioned report the first table for each option summarizes the effect of the policy change on beneficiaries in 2035 across socioeconomic groups ie by gender ethnicity educational attainment age marital status benefit type and income quintile these tables show the number of people in the population the mean percent change in benefits or taxes between current law and the policy option and the median percent change in benefits or taxes between current law and the policy option subsequent tables show the varied effects of these reforms on beneficiaries in 2035 overall and then within each socioeconomic group ie gender ethnicity educational attainment age marital status benefit type and income quintile the options presented below include the most commonly discussed or introduced proposals to improve cash flow and achieve social security solvency crs takes position for or against any of the options presented in this report 2 the presentation of options in the report moves from least complex to most complex the ordering of the 12 options and the assumptions used in their analysis reflect policy recommendations or preferences on the part of crs for some reform options we present two or more variations on how they could be approached each option would affect beneficiaries differently this report assumes that all of the options take effect in 2013 and shows the distributional impact of each option in 2035 using results from the dynasim microsimulation model 3 the dynasim model is not an actuarial model and so cannot produce solvency estimates for these options g11g151g157g142g155g153g155g142g157g146g151g144g561g157g145g142g561g20g142g156g158g149g157g156g561

the options would enhance longrange solvency by either cutting benefits or increasing payroll taxes there are also secondary rationales behind most of the optionsfor example some would reward longer working careers or account for increases in longevity the options in this report include the most commonly discussed or introduced proposals to improve cash flow and achieve social security solven cy each option in this report is analyzed in isolation but it is important to note that the options are typically proposed in combination with one another andor with other social security reform features such as individual accounts or 2 some solvency options such as increasing the social security coverage of state and local government workers altering the taxation of social security benefits or investing portion of the so cial security surplus in equities cannot currently be modeled in this version of dynasim therefore these options are not included among the options analyzed in this report

report can be viewed as set of building blocks for comprehensive social security reform

year 2013 was chosen since many policymakers have indicated desire to leave the benefits of individuals who are currently age 55 or older unchanged since they would have little time to alter their savings work or retirement plans with the exception of the option to increase the full retirement age none of the options presented in this report are phased in gradually over time any of the options could be implemented before or after 2013 or could be phased in gradually this analysis aims to compare all of the reform options using consistent assumptions and under identical circumstances however for some options all beneficiaries would be affected starting in 2013 including those who became eligible for benefits before 2013 eg reducing the cola for other options only new beneficiariesthose who become eligible for benefits in 2013 or laterwould be affected eg progressive price indexing initial social security benefits these differences are dictated by the nature of the reform options themselves and the particular social security program rules affected by these reform options

focuses on the effects of policy changes on beneficiaries in 2035 the tables presented are essentially snapshot of the projected beneficiary population in this single year focusing on different year would lead to different results the year 2035 was selected for this analysis because it balances two competing goals the first goal is to allow sufficient amount of time to pass for the differing effects of the policy options to become clear once the new policies are implemented since all of the options are assumed to begin in 2013 by 2035 most beneficiaries would be affected an earlier date may not capture the disparate effects of the options particularly for those options with relatively small annual changes the second goal is to provide the most reliable information possible since it is impossible to accurately predict the future all projection models contain some level of uncertainty the further into the future one projects the greater the estimates may ultimately deviate from reality the most accurate data are the actual observations that exist when the projection period began the youngest individuals eligible to receive retirement benefits in 2035 would have been born in the early 1970s and so actual data would be included in the models projection of their retirement benefits extending the analysis to periods much later than 2035 would rely more heavily on the models assumptions about future trends under some of the options not all beneficiaries in 2035 would be affected this is because some of the options apply only to beneficiaries who become eligible for benefits in 2013 or later eg progressive price indexing for these options th analysis in 2035 will show sizable group of beneficiaries who are not subject to the change since they became eligible for benefits before 2013 because the proportion of beneficiaries who become eligible for benefits before 2013 4 combining any of the options with one another or with other features could significantly alter their distributional impacts thus it is not possible to sum the results of any combination of options shown in this report since the options could interact in unexpected ways

implementation drives many of the results in 2035 particularly the results by age results shown for 2035 also do not reflect the full impact of the options over time the effect of some options increases over time eg longevity indexing under these options each successive cohort of beneficiaries would be affected more than the last so that beneficiary who becomes eligible 50 years after implementation would be affected much more than beneficiary who becomes eligible in the first year all other things being equal for other options the magnitude of the benefit change does not increase over time eg increasing the number of computation years under these options each successive cohort of be neficiaries would be subject to the same rules so that beneficiary who becomes eligible 50 years after implementation would experience the same magnitude of change as beneficiary who becomes eligible in the first year all other things being equal since the tables in this report focus on single year these distinctions are not shown g25g145g138g157g561g6g152g561g157g145g142g561g22g138g139g149g142g156g561g21g145g152g160g501g561 the first table for each option breaks down the effect of the policy change on beneficiaries in 2035 by gender ethnicity educational attainment age marital status benefit type and income quintile for more information on income quintiles please see the subsection below called breakdowns by income quintile these tables show the number of people in the population 5 the mean percent change and the median percent change in benefits between current law and the policy option6 since dynasim projects representative subsample of the population the number of observations in the model must be weighted in this case multiplied by constant so that the numbers total the entire population population numbers in the tables are presented in thousands the mean or average is determined by adding all the values in data set and dividing the sum by the number of values in the data set the median is the midpoint in group of values such that half the values are above the median and half are below unlike mean median will not be skewed by small number of extremely large or extremely small values for example consider five beneficiaries affected by policy option one loses her entire benefit under the option meaning she has change of 100 the other four beneficiaries have benefit changes of 3 2 2 and 1 compared with current law the median percentage change for this group would be 2 because 2 is the third value of the five values arranged from least to greatest the mean percentage change would be 22 because it is the sum of all five values divided by five since policy changes sometimes result in very large benefit changes such as beneficiaries gaining or losing benefit for few beneficiaries the median is good measure of how policy would affect typical beneficiary for both the mean and median percent change in benefits numbers have been rounded to the nearest full percentage point the results for each option include tables that show the overall distribution of the estimated benefit change for all beneficiaries as well as for beneficiaries broken down by gender ethnicity educational attainment age marital status benefit type and income quintile for example the 5 in this version of dynasim each observation had weight of 25173811 thus 10 raw observations would be shown as about 25000 individuals in the tables presented all projected population numbers are rounded to the nearest thousand 6 the report compares benefits under each option to scheduled benefits under current law some other analyses compare benefits under policy options to payable benefits or the level of benefits that could be funded with current funding levels however the 2005 trustees report on which this analysis is based projects that the trust funds will remain solvent until 2041 since the analysis in this report focuses on 2035 scheduled benefits and payable benefits would be the same amount httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33841g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g561g157g152g561g3g141g141g155g142g156g156g561g21g152g140g146g138g149g561g21g142g140

quintiles have benefit reductions of up to 10 reductions from 10 to 19 etc every attempt has been made to be consistent in the presentation of the results of the analysis the same benefit reduction categories have been used in all tables across the various reform options so as not to skew the results furthermore the tables for all of the options include the entire dynasim population with one exception for the options to raise or eliminate the taxable earnings base the report contains additional separate tables describing the mean and median impact for only those beneficiaries who would be affected by the option and for only those beneficiaries who would pay additional taxes these additional breakdowns are presented since relatively small share of beneficiaries would be affected by the options to raise or eliminate the taxable earnings base tables that include the entire dynasim population for these options show that the median beneficiary in each subgroup is not affected

their own earnings disabled worker beneficiaries who receive social security disability benefit based on their own earnings spouse beneficiaries who receive social security retirement benefit based on their working spouses earnings and survivor beneficiaries who receive social security survivor benefits based on their deceased spouses earnings some individuals may qualify for more than one type of benefit in the tables that follow the retired worker only category and the disability only category are made up of beneficiaries who receive solely retired or disabled worker benefit not spouse or survivor benefit the survivor category and the spouse category include both beneficiaries who receive solely spouse or survivor benefits as well as those who receive both spouse or survivor benefit and retired or disabled worker benefit ie dually entitled beneficiaries the disability benefit only category includes both beneficiaries receiving disability benefits in 2035 and those who originally received disability benefits but automatically converted to retirement benefits at the full retirement age as required by law g4g155g142g138g148g141g152g160g151g156g561g139g162g561g3g144g142g561 all of the policy options include tables in the report that break down the beneficiary population by age group these categories reflect beneficiaries ages as of 2035 it is important to note that beneficiaries in the age 61 and younger category are primarily disability beneficiaries but also include some aged survivor beneficiaries who be gan to receive benefits at age 60 or 61 other social security beneficiaries who are eligible to receive benefits before age 60such as children of retired disabled or deceased workersare not included in the analysis in this report for retirement beneficiaries the earliest age of eligibility is age 62 thus retirement beneficiaries are included in the age 61 and younger category

secondhighest incomes etc down to the onefifth with the lowest income for the pu rposes of this analysis income includes social security benefits supplemental security income ssi benefits pension payments earnings and the annuitized value of financial assets income is calculated on per capita basis which means that for married couples the income of both spouses is averaged together it is important to note the distinction between income levels and social security benefit amounts some beneficiaries with relatively low social security benefit amounts may be included in one of the higher income quintiles and vice versa for example beneficiary married to person with high income may be in one of the higher income quintiles despite receiving small social security benefit similarly beneficiary with relatively large social security benefit but with other income may be in one of the lower income quintiles

option summarizes the effect of the policy change on beneficiaries in 2035 across socioeconomic groups ie by gender ethnicity educational attainment age marital status benefit type and income quintile these tables show the number in the population the mean percent change in benefits or taxes between current law and the policy option and the median percent change in benefits or taxes between current law and the policy option for example if reader is interested in the average benefit reduction caused by reducing the cola by half percentage point he or she should turn to table 1 the first row labeled all shows the total number in the population in thousands eg the total population for table 1 is 80362000 the first row also shows the mean change in benefits overall 6 and median change in benefits overall 6 in other words it shows that among the 80 million beneficiaries in the dynasim population reducing the cola by half percentage point would result in mean benefit reduction of 6 and also median benefi t reduction of 6 the mean and the median may vary for other options table 1 also shows the mean and median change in benefits for each socioeconomic group ie by gender ethnicity educational attainment age marital status benefit type and income quintile for example the second and third rows of table 1 show breakdown by gender females make up the majority of the population ie there are 43566000 females wompared with 36766000 males females and males have the same mean benefit reduction 6 males have smaller median benefit reduction 5 than do females 6

number and percent of beneficiaries whose benefits would be reduced by 10 to 19 and so forth for example if reader is interested in knowing whether the cuts caused by reducing the cola by half percentage point are spread equally across the entire sample he or she should turn to table 2 table 2 shows that small number of beneficiaries 103000 people or less than 05 would have benefit reductions of 20 or mo re larger number 14973000 people or about 19 have benefit reductions of 10 to 19 most beneficiaries 63232000 people or about 79 would have benefit reductions of up to 10 the

effects of these reforms on beneficiaries in 2035 within each socioeconomic group ie gender ethnicity educational attainment age marital status benefit type and income quintile for example if reader is interested in know ing how the cuts caused by reducing the cola by half percentage point are distributed by gender he or she should turn to table 3 there the reader could see that the majority of both females and males would have benefit cut of up to 10 ie 75 of females and 83 of males the reader could also see that females are more likely than males to receive cut that is greater than 10 ie 23 of females and 14 of males the percentages in each horizontal row add up to 100

sometimes the results shown in this report may be unexpected for example an option to cut social security benefits could result in small number of beneficiaries receiving an increase in their benefits such counterintuitive results are not errors but interactions between the option and the current law social security rules for example the interaction between the current law retirement earnings test ret and certain options to reduce benefits leads to benefit increases for some beneficiaries who were subject to the ret before reaching the full retirement age but are currently older than the full retirement age for full explanation of how this interaction works please see appendix c one of the advantages of microsimulation model such as dynasim is that it brings unexpected interactions between policy options and program rules to light social security is complex program and changes to its structure could result in unintended consequences

payable to an individual upon entitlement to retirement benefits at the normal retirement age ie the pia does not reflect any adjustments for early or delayed retirement or disability benefits in addition the pia is the base amount used to determine monthly benefits payable to family members on the workers record such as spouse or surviving spouse under current law the pia is determined by applying benefit formula to the workers average lifetime covered earnings in the first step of the benefit computation the workers nominal earnings up to 2 calendar years prior to the year of eligibilityfor example earnings prior to age 60 in the case of retirement benefit are indexed to wage growth to reflect the change in average wages over time earnings in subsequent years are counted at nominal value for purposes of computing basic retirement benefit the 35 highest years of indexed earnings are then averaged and monthly amount is computed to determine the workers average indexed monthly earnings aime if worker has fewer than 35 years of covered earnings years of zero earnings are counted in the computation of the aime 7 the benefit formula is then applied to the workers aime the benefit formula that applies to individu als who first become eligible for retirement or disability benefits in 2006 or who die in 2006 before becoming eligible for benefits is as follows 90 of the first 656 of aime plus 32 of aime over 656 through 3955 plus 15 of aime over 3955 for example the pia for worker who reaches age 62 in 2006 based on an aime of 4500 would be 172780 the pia would be computed as follows 90 x 656 59040 plus 32x3299 105568 plus 15 x 545 8175 pia 172780 rounded to the next lower 10 cents the workers pia is based on the benefit formula that applies in the year the worker first becomes eligible for benefits age 62 for retiredworker benefits the year of disability for disabledworker benefits or the year of the workers death for survivor benefits rather than the first year of 7 the number of computation years used to determine the aime varies depending on the type of benefit retirement survivor or disability the number of computation years is based on the number of elapsed years ie the number of calendar years after 1950 or if later attainment of age 21 up to the year the worker attains age 62 for retirement benefits the year of death or if earlier attainment of ag 62 for survivor benefits or the year of disability for disability benefits minus any dropout years the number of dropout years also varies depending on the type of benefit for purposes of retirement and survivor benefits up to 5 dropout years apply for purposes of disability benefits for workers disabled before age 47 1 to 4 dropout years apply depending on the workers age and the number of dropout years however fewer than 2 computation years may be used for disability benefit calculations

the pia is increased by the annual social security costofliving adjustment cola for any intervening years between eligibility and benefit receipt for example if an individual who first becomes eligible for retiredworker benefits at age 62 in 2006 elects to receive benefits at the normal retirement age age 66 in 2010 the pia effective at the normal retirement age would be the pia calculated using the benefit formula for 2006 shown above adjusted annually according to the cola effective in december 2006 december 2007 december 2008 and december 2009 the dollar amounts that separate the three brackets of aime in the benefit formula 656 and 3955 are referred to as bend points under current law the bend points are indexed to wage growth on an annual basis to provide stable replacement rates over time for workers with similar earnings patterns the replacement rate is based on social security benefits in the first year of retirement divided by final earnings for example under current law the benefit formula is designed to provide replacement rate of approximately 40 for averagewage earners regardless of the year of retirement the percentages that apply to each of the three brackets of aime in the benefit formula 90 32 and 15 are referred to as formula factors or replacement factors the formula factors which are fixed under current law are structured such that social

type changes under the option or 2 if the spouse on whose work record his or her the benefit is based changes under the option some individuals could change benefit types under policy option because of the spouse and survivor rules thus mitigating the effect of the options benefit reduction for example consider couple in which the wife receives 600 retired worker benefit and the husband receives 1100 retired worker benefit under current law the woman would not qualify for spouse benefit under current law since her worker benefit 600 is greater than 50 of her husbands primary insurance amount assuming he is not subject to any reductions or credits this amount would be 550 if the wife is younger than the husband she would be subject to greater benefit reduction in 2035 under most of the policy options analyzed in this report continuing the example above lets assume under policy option that the wifes benefit were reduced by 100 making her retired worker benefit 500 and the husbands benefit is reduced by 50 making his retired worker benefit 1050 as result the wife would become dually entitled to receive partial spouse benefit in addition to her full worker benefit her total benefit amount under the option would be equal to 50 of her husbands pia or 525 in this case ie 500 in worker benefits and 25 in spouse benefits thus the dual entitlement rule leads the wife to receive 75 benefit reduction rather than 100 reduction some individuals could receive spouse or survivor benefit based on different marriage than under current law as result of policy change thus mitigating the effect of benefit reduction that would otherwise result from the policy option for example consider woman who divorced after 15 years of marriage then remarried under current law she receives spouse benefit of 600 her spouse benefit is based on her current husbands pia of 1200 her former husbands pia is 1180 under the policy option her current husbands pia is reduced by 100 to 1100 and her former husbands pia remains at 1180 since he retired before the policy option was implemented under the policy option she would receive divorced spouse benefit based on her former husbands work recordrather than her current husbands work recordsince the benefit she would receive based on her former husbands record 590 would be greater than the benefit she would receive based on her current husbands record 550 thus the rule that allows beneficiaries to receive the highest spouse or survivor benefit to which they are entitled means that the wife in this example receives 10 benefit reduction rather than 50 benefit reduction it is important to note that in either scenariochanging benefit type or changing the spouse on which the benefit is basedthe affected beneficiary would receive higherthanexpected benefit under the option due to social securitys spouse and survivor rules the reason for this effect is that the social security rules always allow beneficiaries to receive total benefit that is equal to the highest of the various benefits to which they may be entitled

paid to some individuals who work before their full retirement age fra specifically the ret applies to nondi beneficiaries below the fra who have earnings from employment in excess of certain thresholds11 generally for workers who fall under the full retirement age for the entire year the threshold is 12480 in 2006 for every two dollars in earnings over this threshold the workers social security benefit is reduced by one dollar in the year that the worker attains the full retirement age higher threshold of 33240 applies in 2006 for those months worked prior to the full retirement age

joe has excess earnings of 17520 in 2006 30000 12480 thus the reduction to his social security benefit is 8760 17520 x 05 in 2006 joes currentlaw social security benefit is 1500 per month 18000 per year before the ret is applied therefore joe would lose his social security benefit payments for 5 full months and would lose portion of his benefit for 6 th month 87601500 because of his excess

increased at the full retirement age under current law workers are only subject to the ret if they have excess earnings receive nondi benefits and have not yet reached the full retirement age when individuals receive nondi benefits prior to the full retirement age they are subject to an actuarial benefit reduction the size of which is dependent on the number of months of benefits the individual is projected to receive benefits before the full retirement age the greater the number of months of benefit receipt prior to the full retirement age the greater the actuarial reduction those retiring at the earliest eligibility age 60 for survivors benefits 62 for retirement benefits face the largest reduction for every month that an individuals early retirement or early survivor benefit is eliminated as result of the ret the actuarial reduction that he or she is subject to goes down as compensation for these lost benefits when the individual reaches the full retirement age the actuarial reduction is lowered and the retirement or survivor benefit is adjusted upward to account for the lost months of benefits under the ret following on the previous example if joe takes social security benefits at the earliest eligibility age 62 his benefits will be 25 lower than if he retired at his fra of 66 12 if joes full retirement benefit pia was 2000 per month his monthly benefit after the early retirement reduction would be 1500 2000 x 075 however if joe continues working as described in the previous example he would lose benefits for ov er five months out of the year due to the ret if joe worked intermittently between age 62 and 66 and the ret ultimately eliminated joes benefit for total of 12 months over this period essentially joe delayed taking up social security benefits for an additional year therefore his actuarial reduction for early retirement should be adjusted to reflect his receipt of social security benefits for only 36 months prior to his full retirement age instead of 48 joes actuarial reduction would be reduced from 25 to 20 at the full retirement age of 66 thus at age 66 the ret would increase joes monthly benefit from 1500 to 1600 2000 x 80 under currentlaw about 7 increase on an annual basis the ret would increase joes benefit from 18000 per year to 19200 per year

options that reduce benefits relative to current law those affected by the ret appear to receive larger benefit reductions than what could be attributed to the policy change alone the ret calculation is based on workers excess earnings since earnings are not affected by the policy option the ret reduction is the same dollar amount under both current law and the policy option if policy option reduces social security benefits this smaller social security benefit is being reduced by the same dollar amount under the ret as under current law therefore the ret creates larger percent reduction in benefits than is expected under the policy change 12 the benefit reduction of 25 is calculated based on the number of months joe retires before his full retirement age by retiring at age 62 joe will collect social security bene fits for 48 months before his full retirement age of 66 for information on how the actuarial reduction is determined see table 2a171 in the social security

joes initial benefit by 10 prior to the application of the ret thus his annual benefit prior to the ret is 18000 and the policy option reduces his benefit by 10 1800 to 16200 since joes earnings dont change and he still has excess earnings of 17520 in 2006 the ret still reduces his annual social security benefit by 8760 so joes final annual benefit after the policy option and the ret is 7440 16200 8760 which is approxi mately 20 decrease 74409240 from the current law annual benefit of 9240 after the ret thus the interaction of the policy option with the ret program rules is res ponsible for the larger than expected reduction in joes benefit

benefit to size where the fixed dollar amount of the ret fully eliminates the social security benefit for greater number of months than under current law because of the interaction of the policy option with the ret and the actuarial benefit reduction the ultimate consequence of this benefit elimination is later increase in benefits relative to current law when policy option reduces the size of the social security benefit the unchanging dollar amount of the ret requires more months of benefits to be eliminated than under current law thus at the full retirement age when the benefits are adjusted upward for this loss they are increased relative to current law making some individuals receive benefit increases that would seem to be counterintuitive under policy change that reduces benefits for example if joes benefit were reduced relative to current law lets say that the ret would eliminate his now smaller social security benefit for 16 months instead of 12 months during the period he worked between age 62 and 66 joes actuarial reduction would be adjusted to reflect his receipt of social security benefits for only 32 months prior to his full retirement age instead of 36 months under current law after the ret joes actuarial reduction would be reduced from 20 to approximately 167 thus under the policy option at age 66 joes benefit increases from 1600 pia of 2000 x 080

for future retirees by using combination of wage indexing and price indexing in the benefit formula to apply differing degrees of benefit reduction based on the workers careeraverage level of earnings the following section explains the mechanics of the progressive price indexing option examined in this report 13 the basic steps used to calculate initial benefits for future retirees under the progressive price indexing option include

the benefits of lowwage workers would be pres erved by establishing new bend point in the pia formula below which initial benefits would continue to be fully wageindexed for the option analyzed in this report the new bend point would be established at the 30th percentile of earnings this means that workers with careeraverage earnings in the lowest 30 of the earnings distribution would experience change in benefits relative to current law the new bend point would fall between the first and second bend points under current law the replacement factors for the now four brackets of average indexed monthly earnings in the benefit formula would be set initially at 90 32 32 and 15 the new bend point would increase each year after 2013 by the rate of growth of the national average wage just as the two current bend points are wageindexed all workers with careeraverage earnings below this new bend point would continue to have their initial benefits fully wageindexed workers with careeraverage earnings above the new bend point would have their initial benefits reduced because the third and fourth replacement factors 32 and 15 would be adjusted downward each year described in step 3 below

for those who become eligible for retiredworker benefits in 2013 and each year thereafter calculate hypothetical fully priceindexed pia for worker who had maximum earnings over hisher career and the percentage reduction in benefits between this hypothetical pia and the current law pia ssa would compute the percentage benefit reduction that would apply for career highwage earner 14 if all three of the currentlaw pia factors 90 32 and 15 were fully priceindexed for example if the benefit for career highwage earner retiring at the full retirement age in future year were determined to be say 2800 per month and the percentage changes in prices 13 these steps follow those described in memorandum from stephen goss chief actuary of the social security administration to robert pozen dated feb 10 2005 see httpwwwssagovoactsolvencyrpozen_20050210pdf 14 career highwage earner is someone who earned at or above the taxable wage base for at least 35 years in their entire career

for highwage earner would be recalculated with each of the three pia factors multiplied by the ratio 10281039 or 98915 thus in this example the benefit of highwage earner under full price indexing would be reduced by 11 in 2013 the first year that price indexing would be in effect after ten yearsassuming that prices and wages continue d to grow annually by 28 and 39the pia factors would be multiplied by 102810103910 899 representing benefit reduction of 101

the new bend point 32 and 15 that would result in the same benefit reduction for careerlong maximumwage earners those always at or above the annual maximum taxable wage as would have applied to these earners if price indexing had been applied to all workers this would reduce benefits for careerlong maximumwage earners by the same percentage as they would have been reduced if the benefit formula were fully priceindexed for workers at all earnings levels benefits would be reduced by smaller percentage for workers with careerlong average wages and not at all for workers with average wages that fall in the lowest 30 of the earnings distribution 15 earnings are indexed to the average wage level two years pr ior to the workers first year of eligibility because there is twoyear lag time associated with the release of official wage data for given year thus if the first year the policy applies is 2013 it would be necessary to obtain the official wage data from 2011

institutes dynamic simulation of income model dynasim is computer model that uses survey data to project demographic changes retirement income and social security benefits it was created by the urban institute and was purchased by the congressional research service dynasim can be used to analyze the consequences of retirement and aging policy issues on individual and family income and benefits one of the major advantages of using the dynasim model is the ability to analyze the distributional effects of social security proposals for example dynasim can be used 1 to analyze the difference in benefit levels between particular social security reform proposal and current law 2 to model the combined effects of multiple and complex policy changes on individual and family benefits and total income 3 to model the effect of change in social security policy on an individuals eligibility for other meanstested federal programs eg ssi the effect on individuals and families can be broken down along multiple demographic and economic lines such as gender educational attainment marital status race and wealth

income starting with representative sample of individuals and nuclear families the model ages the data year by year from 1993 to 2050 characteristics such as an individuals year of birth educational attainment marital status and race are used to predict future values of variables such as earnings marital changes and wealth for each year dynasim simulates such demographic events as births deaths marriages and divorces and such economic events as labor force participation earnings hours of work disability onset and retirement the large amount of demographic and income information makes dynasim particularly suitable to analyze the distributional effects of various social security reform proposals and other issues relating to the aged population for example retired worker social security benefits are based on 35 years of workers earning history having tool such as dynasim that contains an individuals earning history as well as the individuals traits over hisher entire career is essential to modeling social security reforms one such policy option that requires 40 years of workers earning history is to increase the number of computation years from 35 to 40 in addition to modeling provisions that require long work histor ies we can analyze how benefits change due to changes in life events such as marital status change or the death of spouse over the span of the individuals lifetime at the end of the simulation process we have detailed information on the lifetimes of multiple individuals with all of the information needed to calculate social security benefits and total incomes in addition to workers earning histories the dynasim model includes additional retirement income projections useful for analyzing policy options these projections include but are not limited to social security coverage eligibility and benefit levels pension coverage and participation income from assets and supplemental security income ssi

data resources the base population is comprised of households from the 1990 through 1993 panels of the survey of income and program participation sipp this sample consists of over 100000 people and 44000 families and is limited to individuals who answered questions regarding assets and pensions16 annual earnings are created from mixture of historical and projected data earnings histories are calculated for sipp respondents by matching individuals from the sipp to individuals interviewed in the panel study of income dynamics psid and to individuals interviewed in the 1972 current population survey cps the 1972 current population survey is unique dataset because it is matched to social security administrative records the 1972 cps is matched to the social security administrations summary of earnings records and is used to provide sipp respondents with earnings between the years 1951 and 1967 the psid also collects annual earnings information and provides sipp respondents with earnings between the years 1968 and 1992 once earnings are imputed for the years 1968 through 1992 earnings are then projected for the years 1993 through 2050 dynasim uses information from the panel study of income dynamics and the national longitudinal survey of youth to project individual earnings from 1993 through 2050 using series of statistical regression equations the earnings are projected in 5 steps first hourly wages are estimated using randomeffects model second results from the hourly wage model are used to calculate predicted wages for all individuals in the psid third the number of annual hours worked is predicted using tobit model that includes the predicted wage results from the previous regression in the fourth step labor force participation is estimated using randomeffect probit model finally the labor force participation rates are adjusted to reflect projected employment rates from the oasdi trustees report by age and gender the model utilizes survey data to estimate population growth family formation education and health earnings employee benefits asset accumulation pension and social security benefits and payroll taxes some of the survey data used to estimate these processes include the survey of income and program participation the panel study of income dynamics the current population survey the health and retirement survey the national longitudinal mortality study the national longitudinal survey of youth estimates from the social security administrations office of the chief actuary vital statistics the pension simulation model from the policy simulation group and the pension insurance modeling system from the pension benefit guaranty corporation all of these data sources are used to validate and readjust

despite the many advantages of using microsimul ation model such as dynasim one must keep in mind the caveats that are common to the use of microsimulation models in general such caveats include but are not limited to 1 microsimulation models require the use of large number of assumptions for example dynasim utilizes assumptions from the social security administrations office of the chief actuary ocact to determine future fertility and mortality patterns and to project 16 the questions regarding assets and pensions can be found in the sipp long assetpension topical module wave

that ocacts fertility and mortality assumptions are too optimistic or pess imistic will also have the same views of dynasims fertility and mortality assumptions in addition dynasim models mortality using an individuals age raceethnicity marital status education disability status and work history there may be other variables that affect mortality that are not used in this model 2 like all projections historical information is used to calculate future information for individuals such as future earnings future marital status changes future pensions etc there may be historical information however that will not provide good estimates of future values for example 40 years ago it could not have be foreseen how technological advancements would have altered mortality and earnings similarly future technology and medical advancements will have an effect on the population that can not currently be predicted model such as dynasim would not be able to factor in these kinds of advancements unless they are already somehow accounted for in historical information put another way the model assumes that the future will resemble the past the model often uses variety of techniques eg cohort effects to place heavier weight on more recent experience than on less recent experience the model projects social and economic change mainly through change in the composition of the population 3 microsimulation models require many assumptions and utilize many specific mathematical equations therefore care should be taken when interpreting results for example because of their detailed assumptions microsimulation models better represent relative changes in benefits rather than exact benefit levels all microsimulation models are estimates of what given population will look like in the future because they are estimates all microsimulation models contain some level of error by analyzing relative differences rather than point estimates such as average benefits some of the error is controlled for because the underlying error will be the same under both options thus microsimulation models will be more accurate in stating that plan is estimated to result in 23 increase in benefits over current law than stating that individuals under plan receive monthly benefit of 900 because the error found in microsimulation models is difficult to quantify but can be mitigated by comparing plans across the same population and in essence holding the error constant in addition to the caveats associated with microsimulation models there are caveats that are specific to the dynasim model for example 1 dynasim does not model the old law social security benefit rules in place prior to 1979 therefore the benefits for the oldest individuals may not precisely reflect the level of benefits that they actually received 2 dynasim does not include behavioral changes resulting from the modification of the social security benefit and tax structures thus changes to social securitys tax or benefit structure will not automatically alter an individuals work patterns or retirement decision 3 dynasim does not include macroeconomic feedbacks change in the social security program can affect other segments of the economy for example benefit cut could have effects on the labor force participation and the savings rate these kinds of macroeconomic effects cannot automatically be modeled using the dynasim model thus second order microeconomic effects such as the effect of the savings rate on the interest rate earned by individual accounts cannot be modeled

income tax module because social security benefits may be subject to income taxation reform options that alter the level of social security benefits can also alter the amount of income tax paid by individuals although income taxes cannot be modeled the amount of social security payroll taxes paid can easily be calculated from an individuals earnings 5 dynasim is not social security actuarial model and thus cannot estimate the solvency effect of proposed policy change the dynasim model does not contain all of the information required to produce solvency estimates for ex ample dynasim does not calculate childrens benefits and so complete account of benefit payments cannot be calculated in addition dynasim simulates the population between the years 1993 and 2050 the benefits received by individuals outside of this yearly range would not be included in the calculations for these same reasons longterm cost estimates cannot be calculated 6 dynasim incorporates differences in processes on the basis of raceethnicity where the data suggest that such differences are significant the literature is not always definitive on the magnitude of differences by race and measurement issues can complicate estimation of such effects we thus suggest conservative interpretation of differences by race and hispanicity despite the caveats related to microeconomic models and specifically to dynasim the urban institutes dynamic simulation model is an extremely useful tool for analyzing the effects of social security reform proposals and other topics related to the aged the wealth of demographic
