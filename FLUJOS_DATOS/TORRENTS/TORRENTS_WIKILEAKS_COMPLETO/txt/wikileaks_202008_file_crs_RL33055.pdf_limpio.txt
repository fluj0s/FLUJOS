chinese firms are engaged in large infrastructure projects in several countries china is significant supplier of military equipment to africa as well analysts agree that chinas voracious appetite for resources particularly petroleum is the principal motive for its expanding outreach to africa nearly thirty percent of chinas oil impor ts are estimated to come from africa and the proportion is expected to grow in the years ahead chinas continuing drives to demonstrate its importance as global actor and to isolate taiwan which maintains official relations with seven subsahara n countries are also motivating factors china is deeply involved in sudan where the chinese na tional petroleum company cnpc has developed an oil field in the southern pa rt of the country nd constructed 900mile pipeline to the red sea so that the oil can be sent to china angola is chinas largest subsaharan oil supplier nd china has extended 2 billion line of credit to the angolan government while expanding

united states should mount challenge to chinas growing role in africa is subject of debate in the policyoriented community but the prevailing view appears to be that chinas involve ment does not at present endanger us interests and influence in the region it may even offer certain benefits for africa and for the united states if dealt with through cooperation and diplomacy some believe us official testifying in july 2005 advocated cooperation and consultation with china in africa as well as dialogue over issues such as sudan and zimbabwe on which the two countries disagr ee nonetheless

in recent years has sought out and cultivated stronger relations with countries over much of the globe its d eepening involvement in subsaharan africa part of this global pattern has drawn attention because this region is expected to play steadily expanding role as petroleum and natural gas supplier in the years ahead consequently chinas interest in africa is source of concern to those who see china as threatening rival to the united states for access to the worlds petroleum resources other concerns ar ise from chinas refusal to impose human rights or governance conditions on its ai d trade and foreign investment on grounds that doing so would constitute interference in the internal affairs of its partners many worry that african countries such as sudan angola and zimbabwe which face pressure for reforms from wester n aid donors and intern ational financial institutions will turn to china as an alternative source of funds as well as diplomatic backing others doubt that china will pose major challenge to the interests of the united states and its western allies in africa and some suggest that there are areas of common interest nd possible cooperation in congressional testimony

southern africa forging ties with the african elites that eventually took pow er in the region chinas perception of itself as third world leader and its rivalry with taiwan help to explain its role in africa in these decades but another key factor was chinas rivalry with the soviet union with the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 this factor disappeared and china seemed for time to be less prominent as an actor in africa chinas recent rise as global indus trial power however has given it new reasons to pursue its involvement in sub saharan africa more comprehensive chinese outreach to the region has been evident at least since october 2000 when leaders of the prc and 45afri can countries met in beijing to form the chinaafrica cooperation forum cacf they agreed that the cacf would meet every three years to further mutual economic deve lopment and cooperation the chinese government sweetened the pot for coopera tion by using the first cacf meeting to pledge forgiveness of 12

has won official diplomatic recognition from the vast majority of african states but 7 of the 25 countries worldwide that still maintain relations with taiwan are in africa17 finally chinas activism in africa may also be motivated by its desire to be acknowledged as major power in world affairs in africa china has become an important actor in regi on once regarded as european sphere of influence

rural areas despite these signs of warm relations however mugabe returned from beijing without the 1 billion loan he had reportedly sought leading to speculation that china may have doubts about

as fuel are operating in china itself implications for the united states whether and to what extent the ited states should mount re sponse to chinas involvement in africa is the subject of some debate in the policyoriented community the prevailing view among analysts and policymakers appears to be that chinas growing role in africa does not at present significantly endanger us interests and influence it may even ffer certain benefits for africa and for the united states if dealt with th rough cooperation and dialogue33 others see chinas role in africa as an important challenge as representative chris smith stated in the july 2005 house hearing on china and africa there is concern that the chinese intend to aid and abet african dictator s gain stranglehold on precious african natural resources and undo much of the pr ogress that has been made on democracy and governance in the last 15 years in african nations34 those who see chinas role in africa as threat to us interests often argue that chinese policy may undercut efforts by the united states and other western countries to promote transparency respect for human rights and democracy in the region jeff krilla of the internationa l republican institute argues that the chinese governments seenoevil approach is dangerous to the regions stability in their quest to find markets for their goods and to extract natural resources from the region the chinese appear willing to overlook ghastly human rights abuses and support authoritarian regimes in exchange for profitable contracts35 pointing to chinas support for the g overnments of sudan and zimbabwe as examples some analysts argue that western diplomatic and economic pressures for reform including sanctions will have reduced effect if regimes can turn to china as an alternative source of aid trade and investment chinas willingness to export arms to african governments without appa rent regard for their records in human rights and governance is seen as particular problem since it may tend to entrench authoritarian regimes from this perspective sone analysts note it is important forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33055crs10 36 apparel trade data available

part because these sectors have proven highly vulnerable to corruption many of the resourcerich countries with li nks to china such as nigeria and angola are among the least transparent in the world and high levels of public sector corruption are suspected growing chinese gagement in their oil industries may only worsen the problem some fear moreover competition from china for africas petroleum and other resources may drive up world prices potentially damaging the us economy finally some worry that the success of chinese petroleum companies in controlling production facilitie s in sudan may be the leading edge of wave of acquisitions that will deny usbased firms access to impor tant african oil resources african crude oil is highly valued by oil refiners because it is lowsulfur petroleum often used to dilute heavy crude s from other suppliers such as venezuela and saudi arabia be fore processing there is also concern that chinese trade and investment outside the petroleum sector could also deprive us firms of opportunities in the region moreover chinas booming domestic export sector ma be undermining us efforts to help africa by boosting africas exports to the ited states there had been particular hope that the united states could strength africas apparel sector through the african growth and opportunity act pr ogram agoa which allows dutyfree access to the united states for wide ra nge of african products however the global textile quota system expired on ja nuary 1 2005 allowing sharp increase in chinese textile exports to the united st ates as result by may 2005 apparel imports from the 38 agoa beneficiary countri were 6 lower than in may 200436 and larger decrease is seen as possi ble despite limited safeguard quotas imposed by the united states on chinese textile imports in may 2005 finally some fear that chinas soft power in africa is increasing to the detriment of the longterm interests of the united states and western countries generally as african leaders business pe ople students and others visit china in increasing numbers admiration for chinas economic miracle may grow and come to be seen as model for africa africans may increasingly appreciate the willingness of chinese firms to invest in africa as well as the assistance china is offering by sending instructors and medical personnel to the region chinas refusal to impose conditions on economic assistance or to criticize african governments with respect to human rights and democracy may be interpreted by many africans as genuine respect on chinas part for th sovereignty of african countries those who do not see us interests in africa as threatened at present by chinas involvement in the region tend to see its growing role as an inevitable but manageable aspect of chin as industrialization and emergence as great power it would be an error from their point of view to directly challenge chinas influence in africa at this point since doing so coul d harm

positive development for africa that may have have contributed to positive economic growth rates in the region in recent years economic growth in africa in turn could strengthen the global economy and offer new opportun ities for increasing us trade and investment similarly chinese support for rehabilitating africas infrastructure as well as chinese contributions to african peacekeepin g may also be contributing to greater development and stability in the region creating an environment favorable to us interests over the long term from this pe rspective the most effective us response to chinas growing role in africa would be to seek opportunities to partner with china to further mutual interests similarly there may be opportunities for us businesses to cooperate w ith chinese firms in joint ventures in the region number of observers argue that afri cas growing ties to china cannot serve as an alternative to ties with western c ountries because of the advantages the west enjoys in wealth and technology from their point of view african countries have little choice but to continue to seek western aid trade and investment as well as western tourists and access to advanced we stern products if they are to overcome poverty fight the aids pandemic and pr osper in the years ahead africas ties to the west they note are rooted in long history of shared nguages educational exchange and diverse longterm economic and political relationships while africas ties to china are not nearly as broad nd deep moreover western pop culture including teen fashions and music has much appeal to africas large population of young people contributing to wests own s oft power in africa countries that cut themselves off from the west such as zimbabwe will find themselves economically marginalized despite whatever assistance china might offer nor can oilrich african countries fully develop their petroleu m resources without access to western technology much of africas oil lies in deposits under deep ocean waters and us firms are uniquely capable of tapping such deposits some analysts doubt that chinas influen ce in africa will increase indefinitely chinas role in the decline of the textile industry in several c ountries could prove an irritant in chinaafrica relations rese ntment of china could also emerge if inexpensive chinese imports drive out of business small to mediumscale african

of cooperation and dialogue in responding to chinas involvement in africa according to am bassador ranneberger that involvement is the natural result of chinas emergence as the sixthlargest economy in
