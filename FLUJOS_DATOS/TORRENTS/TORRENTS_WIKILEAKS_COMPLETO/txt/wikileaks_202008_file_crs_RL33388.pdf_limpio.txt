cfius is comprised of 9 members two ex officio members and other members as appointed by the president representing major depar tments and agencies within the federal executive branch while the group generally has operated in re lative obscurity the proposed acquisition of comme rcial operations at six u s ports by dubai ports world in 2006 placed the groups operations under intense scrutiny by members of congress and the public prompted by this case some members of the 109th and 110th congresses questioned the ability of congress to exercise its oversight responsib ilities given the general view that cfiuss operations lack transparency other members revisited cerns about the linkage betw een national security and the role of foreign investment in the u s economy some members of congress and others argued that the nations security and economic concerns have changed since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks nd that these concerns are not being reflected sufficiently in the committees deliberations in addition anecdotal evidence seems to indicate that the cfius process is not market neutral instead cfius investigation of an i nvestment transaction may be perceived by some firms and by some in the financial markets as negative factor that adds to uncertainty and may spur firms to engage in behavior th at is not optimal for the economy as whole in the first session

americathe committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius background the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius is an interagency committee that serves the president in overseeing the national security implications of foreign investment in th economy originally established by an executive order of president ford in 1975 the committee has operated until recently in relative obscurity1 according to treasury department memorandum the committee originally was established in or der to placate congress which had grown concerned over the rapid increase in or ganization of the petroleum exporting countries opec investment s in american portfolio ssets treasury securities corporate stocks and bonds and to respond to concerns of some that much of the opec investments were being driven by political rather than by ec onomic motives2 thirty years later public and cong ressional concerns about th proposed purchase of commercial port operations of the britishowned peninsular and oriental steam navigation company po3 in six us ports by dubai ports world dp world4 sparked firestorm of criticism and congressional activity during the 109th congress concerning cfius and the manner in which it operates some members of congress and the public argued that the nations economic and national security concerns have fundamentally changed as result of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states and that these changes require reassessment of the role of foreign investment in the economy and in the nations security as result of the

ous aspects of foreign investment since the proposed dp world transaction in the 1st session of the 110th congress members approved and the pres ident signed measure that is now designated as pl 11049 that alters the cfius process to provide greater oversight by congress and increased reporting by the committee on its decisions in addition pl 11049 broadens the definition of national security and require s greater scrutiny by cfius of certain types of foreign direct investments the law demonstrates the concern some members have with the way cfius operates and with the lack of transparency in the cfius review process that some members believe has hampered congresss ability to exercise its oversight responsib ilities not all member s are satisfied with the law some members argue that the law is still deficient in reviewing investment by foreign governments through sovereign wealth funds swfs an issue that was just beginning to attract atte ntion when the law was adopted establishment of cfius president fords 1975 executive order established the basic structure of cfius and directed that the representative7 of the secretary of the treasury be the chairman of the committee the executive order also stipulated that the committee would have the primary c ontinuing responsibility within the executive branch for monitoring the impact of foreign investme nt in the united states both direct and portfolio and for coordinatin g the implementation of united states policy on such investment in particular cfius was directed to 1 arrange for the preparation of analyses of trends and significant developments in foreign investments in the united states 2 provide guidance on arrangements with foreign governments for advance consultations on prospective major foreign governmental investments in the united states 3 review investments in the united states which in the judgement of the committee might have major implications for united states national interests and 4 consider

activities including 1 obtaining consolidating and analyz ing information on foreign investment in the united states 2 improving the procedures for the co llection and dissemination of information on such foreign investment 3 the close observing of foreign investment in the united states4 preparing reports and analyses of tr ends and of significant developments in appropriate categories of such investment 5 compiling data and preparing evalua tion of significant transactions and 6 submitting to the committee on foreign investment in the united states appropriate reports analyses data and recommendations as to how information on foreign investment can be kept current the executive order however raised stions among various observers and government officials who doubted that fede ral agencies had the legal authority to collect the types of data that were require d by the order as result congress and the president sought to clarify this issue and in the following year president ford signed the international i nvestment survey act of 19769 the act gave the president clear and unambiguous authority to co llect information on international investment in addition the act authoriz ed the collection and use of information on direct investments owned or controlled directly or indirectly by foreign governments or persons and to provide anal yses of such information to the congress the executive agencies and the general public10 by 1980 some members of congress had come to believe that cfius was not fulfilling its mandate between 1975 and 1980 for instance the committee had met only ten times and seemed unable to decide whether it should respond to the political or the economic aspects of foreign dir ect investment in the united states11 one critic of the committee argued in c ongressional hearing in 1979 that the committee has been reduced over the last f our years to body that only responds to the political aspects or the political questions that foreign

good for the economy12 from 1980 to 1987 cfius investigated number of foreign investments mostly at the request of th department of defense in 1983 for instance japanese firm sought to acquire us specialty steel producer the department of defense subsequently classified the metals produced by the firm because they were used in the production of military aircraft which cau sed the japanese firm to withdraw its offer another japanese company attemp ted to acquire us firm in 1985 that manufactured specialized ball bearings for the military the acquisition was completed after the japanese firm agreed that production would be maintained in the united states in similar case in 1987 th defense department objected to proposed acquisition of the computer divi sion of us multinational company by french firm because of cl assified work engaged in by the computer division the acquisition proceeded after the classified contracts were reassigned to the us parent company13 the exonflorio provision in 1988 amid concerns over foreign acquis ition of certain types of us firms particularly by japanese firms congress approved the exonflorio provision14 this statute grants the president the authority to block proposed or pending foreign mergers acquisitions or takeovers of p ersons engaged in interstate commerce in the united states that threaten to impair the national security congress directed however that before this authority can be invoked the president must conclude that other us laws are inadequa or inappropriate to protect the national security and that he must have credible evidence th at the foreign investment will impair the national security this same sta ndard was maintained in pl 11049 by the late 1980s congress and the pub lic had grown increasingly concerned about the sharp increase in foreign investme nt in the united states and the potential impact such investment might have on the us economy in particular the proposed sale in 1987 of fairchild semiconductor c by schlumberger ltd of france to fujitsu ltd of japan touched off strong opposition in congress and provided much of the impetus behind the passage of the exonflorio provision the proposed fairchild acquisition generated intense c oncern in congress in part because of general difficulties in trade relations w ith japan at that time and because some americans felt that the united states was declining as an international economic power as well as world power the fense department opposed the acquisition because some officials believed that the deal would give japan control over

negotiations between congress and the reagan administration congress pa ssed and president reagan signed the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 198819 the exonflorio provision which was included as section 5021 of that act fundamentally transformed cfius the provision originated in bills reporte d by the commerce committee in the senate and the energy and commerce committee in the house but the measure was transferred to the banking committee as result of dispute over jurisdictional responsibilities20 part of congresss motiva tion in adopting the exonfl orio provision apparently arose from concerns that foreign takeovers of us firms could not be stopped unless the president declared national emergenc or regulators i nvoked federal antitrust environmental or securities laws through the exonflorio provision congress attempted to strengthen the presidents hand in conducting foreign investment policy while limiting its own role as means of emphasizing that as much as possible the commercial nature of i nvestment transactions should be free from political considerations congress so attempted to balance public concerns about the economic impact of certain types of foreign investment with the nations long standing international commitment to maintaining an open and receptive environment for foreign investment furthermore congress did not intend to have the exonflorio

purposes through executive order 12661 president reagan implemented provisions of the omnibus trade act in the executive order president reagan delegated his authority to administer the exonflorio provision to cfius22 particularly to conduct reviews to undertake investigations nd to make recommenda tions although the statute itself does not specifically mention cfius as result of president reagans action cfius was transformed from purely administrative body with limited authority to review and analyze data on foreign investment to one with broad mandate and significant authority to advise the president on foreign investment transactions and to recommend that some transactions be blocked treasury department regulations after extensive public comment the treasury department issued its final regulations in november 1991 imple menting the exonflorio provision23 although these procedures were ame nded through pl 11049 they continue to serve as the basis for the exonflorio review and inve stigation these regulations created an essentially voluntary system of notification by the partie s to an acquisition and they allowed for notices of acquisitions by agencies that are members of cfius despite the voluntary nature of the notification firms largely comply with the provision because the regulations stipulate that foreign acquisitions that are governed by the exonflorio review process that do not notify the committee remain subject indefinitely to divestment or other appropriate actions by the president under most circumstances notice of pr oposed acquisition that is given to the committee by third party including shareholders is not considered by the committee to constitute an official notification the regulations also indicate that tifications provided to the

or takeovers in cases where two criterion are met 1 the acquirer is controlled by or acting on behalf of foreign government and 2 the acquisition results in control of person engaged in interstate commerce in the united states that could affect the national security of the united states24 this amendment came under intense scrutiny by the 109th congress as result of the dp world transaction many memb ers of congress and others believed that this amendment required cfius to undertak full 45day investigation of the transaction because dp world was controlled by or acting on behalf of foreign government the dp world acquisiti on however exposed sharp rift between what some members apparently believed the amendment directed cfius to do and how the members of cfius were interpreting the amendment in particular some members of congress apparently interpreted the amendment to direct cfius to conduct mandatory 45day inves tigation if the foreign firm involved in transaction is owned or controlled by foreign gove rnment representatives of cfius argued that they interpreted the amendment to mean that 45day investigation was discretionary and not mandatory in th case of the dp world acquisition cfius representatives argued that they had concluded as result of an extensive review of the proposed acquisition prior to the case be ing formally filed w ith cfius and during the 30day review that the dp world case did not warrant full 45day investigation they conceded that the case met the first criterion under the byrd amendment because dp world was controlled by foreign government but that it did not meet the second part of the requirement becau cfius had concl uded during the 30day review that the transaction could not affect the national security25 the intense public and congressional reaction that arose from the proposed dubai ports world acquisition spurred the bush administration in late 2006 to make an important administrative change in the way cfius reviews foreign investment transactions cfius and president bu sh approved the acquisition of lucent technologies inc by the frenchbas ed alcatel sa which was completed on december 1 2006 before the transacti on was approved by cfius however alcatellucent was required to agree to national security arrangement known as special security arrangement or ssa that restricts alcatels access to sensitive

arrangement is that it allows cfius to reopen review of the deal and to overturn its approval at any time if cfius believes the companies materially fail to comply with the terms of the arrangement this marks significant change in the cfius pr ocess prior to this transaction cfius reviews and investigations d been portrayed and had been considered to be final as result firms were willing to subject themselves voluntarily to cfius review because they believed that once an investment transaction was scrutinized and approved by the members of cfius the firm s could be assured that the investment transaction would be exempt from any future reviews or actions this administrative change however means that cfius termination may l onger be final decision and it adds new leve l of uncertainty to foreign investors seeking to acquire us firms broad range of us and international business groups are objecting to this change in the administrations policy26 the amended cfius process in the first session of the 110th congress congresswoman maloney introduced hr 556 the national security foreign i nvestment reform and strengthened transparency act of 2007 on january 18 2007 the

2007 the house accepted the senates version of h r 556 by vote of 37045 and sent the measure to the president who signed it on july 26 2007 it is designated as pl 11049 on january 23 2008 president bush issued executive order 13456 implementing the law the executive order makes number of substantive changes to the law this report incorporates the changes made by this statute and by the executive order pl 11049 establishes cfius by statut ory authority and has the secretary of the treasury serve as the chairman of cfiu s the measure follows the same pattern that was set by executive order by llotting the committee 30 days to conduct review 45 days to conduct an investigation and 15 days for the president to make his determination the presid ent retains his authority as the only officer with the authority to suspend or prohibit merger s acquisitions and takeovers and the measure places additional requirements on firms that resubmitted filing after previously withdrawing filing before full review is completed over time the three step exonflorio process apparently has evolved to include an informal stage of unspecified length of time that consists of an unofficial cfius determination prior to the formal filing with cfius this type of informal review has developed because it likely serves the interests of both cfius and the firms thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33388crs9 27 testimony of robert kimmett briefing on the dubai ports world deal before the senate armed services committee february 23 2006are involved in an investment transac tion according to treasury department officials this informal contact enables cfius staff to identify potential issues before the review process formally begins27 this informal process is likely to continue under the provisions of pl 11049 firms that are party to an investment transaction apparently have benefitted from this informal review in number of ways for one it allo wed firms additional time to work out any national security concerns privately with individual cfius members secondly and perhaps more im portantly it provided process for firms to avoid risking potential negative publicity that could arise if transaction were to be blocked or otherwise labeled as impairi ng us national security interests for some firms public knowledge of cfius i nvestigation has had negative effect on the value of the firms stock price after lengthy review by cfius in 2000 of verio inc us firm that operates websites for businesse s and provides internet serv ices was acquired by ntt communications of japan verios stoc k price reportedly fell during the cfius investigation as result of uncertainty in the market about prospects for the transaction the cfius review was instig ated by the fbi which had expressed concerns during the initial review stage that the majority interest of the japanese government in ntt could give it access to information regarding wiretaps that were being conducted on ema il and other webbased traffi c crossing verios computer system after completing its investiga tion however cfius did not recommend that president clinton block the transaction the potentially negative publicity that can be associated with cfius investigation of transac tion apparently has had ma jor impact on the transactions cfius has investigated since 1990 near ly half of the transactions cfius investigated were terminated by the fi rms involved because the firms decided to withdraw from the transactions rather than face negative determination by cfius in 2006 for instance the prospects of cfius investigation apparently was the major reason the israeli firm check point software technologies decided to call off its proposed 225 million acquisition of sour cefire us firm specializing in security appliances for protecting corpor ations internal computer networks in addition the decision by the china na tional offshore oil company cnooc to drop its proposed acquisition of unocal oil company in 2005 was partly due to concerns by cnooc about an impending cfius investigation of the transaction for cfius members the informal process has been beneficial because it has given them as much time as they have fe lt was necessary to review transaction without facing the time constraints that ar ise under the formal cfius review process this informal review likely has also given the cfius members added time to negotiate with the firms involved in tran saction to restructure the transaction in ways that have addressed any potential secu rity concerns or to develop other types of conditions that members feel are appropriate in order to remove security concernshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33388crs10 28 the united states trade representative and the director of the office of science

essential to the us defense industrial base this tice is not intended for firms that produce goods or services with special relation to national security especially toys and games food products hotels nd restaurants or legal services cfius has indicated that in order to assure an unimpeded inflow of foreign investment it would implement the statute only insofar as necessary to protect the national security and in manner fully consistent with the international obligations of the united states32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33388crs12 33 senate armed services committee briefing on the dubai ports world ports deal february 23 2006neither congress nor the administration have attempted to define the term national security treasury department offi cials have indicated however that during review or investigation each cfius member is expected to apply that definition of national security that is consistent with the representative agencys specific legislative mandate33 the concept of national secu rity was broadened by pl 110 49 to include those issues relating to hom eland security including its application to critical infrastructure and critical technologies procedures according to the amended exonflorio provision the president or any member of cfius can initiate review of an investment transaction in addition to review that is initiated by the parties to tran saction providing formal notification as amended cfius has 30 days to review transaction to decide after it receives the initial formal notification by the partie s to merger acqui sition or takeover whether to investigate case as result of its determination that the investment threatens to impair the national security of the united states national security also includes those issues relating to homeland security including its application to critical infrastructure and critical technologies in addition cfius is required to conduct an investigation of transac tion if the committee determines that the transaction would result in foreign cont rol of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the united states during such review the members of cfius are also required to consider the twelve factor s that congress has authored as basis for assessing the impact of the investment if during this 30 day period all of the members of cfius conclude that the inve stment does not threaten to impair the national security the review is terminated if however at least one member of the committee determines that the investment does threaten to impair the national security cfius can proceed to 45day investigation during the 30day review stage the di rector of national intelligence although not member of cfius is required to ca rry out thorough analysis of any threat to the national security of the united stat of any merger acquisition or takeover this analysis is required to be completed within 20 days of the receipt of notification by cfius but the statute dir ects that the dni must be given adequate time presumably if this national security review cannot be completed with the 20 day requirement this analysis would in clude request for information from the department of the treasurys director of the office of foreign assets control and the director of the financial crimes enfo rcement network in addition the director of national intelligence is required to seek and to incorporate the views of all affected or appropriate intelligence agencies cfius is also required to review covere d investment transactions in which the foreign entity is owned or controlled by foreign government but the law provides an exception to this requirement review is exempted if the secretary of the treasury and certain other specified officials determine that the transaction in question will not impair the national security it is somewhat unclear however howhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33388crs13 this requirement will mesh with the established process the measure does not amend or alter the current statute in the area that has been the source of differences between cfius and congress in particular the current statute states that the president and through him cfius can use the exonflorio process only if he finds that there is credible evidence that foreign investment will impair national security as result if cfius determines as was the case in the dubai ports transaction that it does not ve credible evidence that an investment will impair the national security then it argues that it is not required to undertake full 45day investigation even if the foreign entity is owned or controlled by foreign government as result of cfius review the president acting through cfius is also required to conduct national security i nvestigation and to take any necessary actions as part of the 45day investigation if the review indicates that at least one of three conditions exists these three conditions are 1 as result of review of the transaction cfius determines that the tran sactions threaten to impair the national security of the united states and that the threat had not been mitigated during or prior to review of the transaction or 2 th foreign person is controlled by foreign government 3 the transactions would result in the control of any critical infrastructure by foreign person the trans actions could impair the national security and that such impairment had not been mitigated at the conclusion of the investigation or the 45da review period whichever comes first the committee can decide to offer recommendation or it can recommend that the president suspend or prohibit the investment the presid ent is under obligation to follow the recommendation of the committee to suspend or prohibit an investment during review or an investigation cf ius and designated lead agency have the authority to negotiate impose or force any agreement or condition with the parties to transaction in order to mitigate any threat to the national security of the united states such agreements are to be based on riskbased analysis of the threat posed by the transaction also if notification of transaction is withdrawn before any review or investigation by cfius can be completed the amended law grants the committee the authority to take number of actions in particular the committee could develop 1 in terim protections to addr ess specific concerns about the transaction pending resubmission of notice by the parties 2 specific time frames for resubmitting the notice and 3 process for tracking any actions taken by any parties to the transaction factors for consideration the exonflorio provision includes list of twelve factors the president must consider in deciding to block foreign ac quisition these factor s are also considered by the individual members of cfius as part of their own review process to determine if particular transaction threatens to imp air the national security this list includes the following elements 1 domestic production needed for projected national defense requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33388crs14 34 the last requirement under factor 4 nd factors 612 were added by pl 11049 2 the capability and capacity of domestic industries to meet national defense requirements including the availability of human resources products technology materials and other supplies and services 3 the control of domestic industries nd commercial activity by foreign citizens as it affects the capability and capacity of the us to meet the requirements of national security 4 the potential effects of the transactions on the sales of military goods equipment or technology to country that supports terrorism or proliferates missile technology or chemical and bi ological weapons and transactions identified by the secretary of defense as posing regional military threat to the interests of the united states 5 the potential effects of the transac tion on us technological leadership in areas affecting us national security 6 whether the transaction has security related impact on critical infrastructure in the united states 7 the potential effects on united states critical infrastructure including major energy assets 8 the potential effects on united states critical technologies9 whether the transaction is foreign governmentcontrolled transaction10 in those cases involving governmentcontrolled transaction review of the adherence of the foreign country to nonproliferation control regimes b the foreign countrys record on cooperating in counter0terrorism efforts c the potential for transshipment or diversion of technologies with military applications 11 the longterm projection of the ited states requirements for sources of energy and other critical resources and materials and 12 such other factors as the president or the committee determine to be appropriate 34 factors 612 that were added thr ough pl11049 potentially broaden significantly the scope of cfius reviews and investigations previously cfius had been directed by treasury department re gulations to focus its activities primarily around investments that had an impact on us national defense security the additional factors however incorporate economic considerations into the exon florio process in way that was specifically rejected when the measure initially was adopted and refocuses cfius s reviews and investigations to consider the broader rubric of economic security in particular cfius is now required to consider the impact of an investment on critical infrastructure as factor for consideringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33388crs15 35 50 usc app sec 2401 as amended 36 22 usc app 2778 et seq 37 50 usc appendix sec 2170c 38 50 usc appendix sec 2170grecommending that the president bloc

degradation or destruction of such systems or assets would have debilitating impact on national security including national ec onomic security and national public health or safety as originally drafted the exonflorio pr ovision also would have applied to joint ventures and licensing agreements in add ition to mergers acqui sitions and takeovers joint ventures and licensing agreemen ts subsequently were dropped from the proposal because the reagan administrati on and various industry groups argued at the time that such business practices were deemed to be beneficial arrangements for us companies in addition they argued that any potential threat to national security could be addressed by th export administration act35 and the arms control export act36 confidentiality requirements the exonflorio provision also codified confidentiality requirements that are similar to those that appeared in executive order 11858 by stating that any information or documentary material filed under the provisi on may not be made public except as may be relevant to an administrative or judicial action or proceeding37 the provision does state however that this confidentiality provision shall not be construed to pr event disclosure to either house of congress or to any duly authorized committee or subcommittee of the congress the provision provides for the release of proprietary info rmation which can be associated with particular party to committees only with assurances that the information will remain confidential members of congress and their staff members will be accountable under current provisions of law governing the release of certain types of information the exonflorio provision requires the presid ent to provide written report to the secretary of the senate and the clerk of the house detailing his decision and his actions relevant to any transaction that was subject to 45day investigation38 mitigation and tracking since the implementation of the exonfl orio provision in the 1980s cfius had developed several informal pr actices that likely were not envisioned when the statute was drafted in particular members of cfius on occas ion had negotiated conditions with firms to mitigate or to remove business arrangement that raised national security concerns among the members of cfius such agreements often were informal arrangements that had an uncertain basis in statute and had not been tested in court these arrangements often were negotiate d during the formal 30day review periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33388crs16 39 us insiders point to bain errors over

required to develop met hod for evaluating the compliance of firms that have entered into mitigation agreem ent or condition that was imposed as requirement for approval of th investment transaction such measures however are required to be developed in such way that they allow cfius to determine that compliance is taking place without also 1 unnecessarily diverting cfius resources from assessing

material intere st in such modification such reports are required to be filed with the attorney general congressional oversight pl 11049 significantly increases the ty pes and number of reports that cfius is required to send to certain specified mbers of congress in particular cfius is required to brief certain congressional leaders if they request such briefing and to report annually to congress

information is accurate and complete this written notification would also include any mitigation agreement or conditi on that was part of cfius approvalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33388crs18 cfius since exonflorio recent information indicates that the number of cases reviewed by cfius declined between 1999 and 2006 in part the decline reflects the slowdown in foreign investment activity in the united states generally that occurred between 1998 and 2003 as indicated in table 1 based on the number of transactions per year acquisitions of us firms by other us firms has accounted for the largest share of all merger and acquisition ma transactions over the past ten years this share fell from 76 of all us ma transacti ons in 1996 to 717 in 2006 but that was up from low of 68 recorded in 2001 the share of ma activity attributed to foreign firms acquiring us firms in 2006 accounts for 146 of all such transactions up from 9 in 1996 review s reportedly have increased since the dubai ports world case in 2006 as result of greater uncertainty among foreign investors about us po licies and attitude s toward foreign investment table 1 merger and acquisition activity in the united states 19962006

6343 1343 1481 source mergers acquisitions february 2008 in addition to lower overall level of investment activity the lower case load experienced by cfius may reflect the impact of the informal cfius review process that developed over time this process gave firms the opportunity to reconsider their investments if they believed they could face difficult cfius review or if they believed the transaction could be subjected to formal 45day investigation with its potentially negative connotations regarding na tional security concerns in addition some observers argue that the case load diminished following the september 11 2001 terrorists attacks on the united states due to the organization of the department of homeland security dhs which has participated actively in the cfius process and has raised security concerns thes concerns may have caused some firms tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33388crs19 40 marchick david testimony before the house financial services committee march

investment transactions be fore they had progressed very far in the formal cfius process in order to avoid long and involved investigation by dhs40 as consequence of the confidential nature of the cfius review of any proposed transaction there ar few official sources of information concerning the committees work to date for the most part information concerning individual transactions that have been reviewed by cfius or any final recommendations that have been issued by cfius have co from announcements released by the companies involved in transaction and not by cfius according to one source41 cfius has received more than 1500 notifi cations since 1988 of which it conducted full investigation of 25 cases of th 25 cases thirteen transactions were withdrawn upon notice that cfius would c onduct full review and twelve of the remaining transactions cases were sent to the president of these twelve transactions one was prohibited42 impact of the exonflorio process on cfius the dp world case exposed number of important aspects of cfius operations that apparently were not well known or understood by the public in general many of these concerns were addressed in pl 11049 as already indicated the exonflorio provision stipul ates threestep process the formal notification to cfius and 30day review 45day investigation for those transactions that raised national security concerns during the 30day review and for those in which the concerns were not reso lved during the review period and 15day presidential determination stage for those transactions that were determined after the 45day review to pose an impairment to national security over time however this process apparently evol ved to include an informal four th stage of unspecified length of time that consists of an unofficial cfiu s determination prior to the formal filing with cfius this type of informal review developed because it likely has served the interests of both cfius and the firms i nvolved in an investment transaction according to treasury department officials this informal contact enables cfius staff to identify potential issues before the review process formally begins43 this informal process is likely to continue under the provisions of pl 11049 an important difference however is that cf ius gained legislative authority under pl 11049 to negotiate and enforce agreements with foreign investors to mitigate the effects of an investment tr ansaction on national securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33388crs20 firms that are party to transaction apparently have benefitted from this informal review in number of ways for one it has allowed firms additional time to work out any national security concerns privately with individual cfius members secondly and perhaps more importantly it has provided process for firms to avoid risking the potentially negative publicity that could arise if transaction were to be blocked or otherwise beled as impairing us national security interests for some firms public knowledge of cfius inves tigation has had negative effect on the value of the firms stock price after lengthy review by cfius in 2000 of verio inc us firm that operates websites for businesse s and provides internet services was acquired by ntt communications of japan verios stoc k price reportedly fell during the cfius investigation as result of uncertainty in the market about prospects for the transaction the cfius review was instig ated by the fbi which had expressed concerns during the initial review stage that the majority interest of the japanese government in ntt could give it access to information regarding wiretaps that were being conducted on ema il and other webbased traffic crossing verios computer system after completing its investiga tion however cfius did not recommend that president clinton block the transaction the potentially negative publicity that can be associated with cfius investigation of transac tion apparently has had ma jor impact on the transactions cfius has investigated since 1990 near ly half of the transactions cfius investigated were terminated by the fi rms involved because the firms decided to withdraw from the transaction rather than face negative determination by cfius in 2006 for instance the prospects of cfius investigation apparently was the major reason the israeli firm check point software technologies decided to call off its proposed 225 million acquisition of sour cefire us firm specializing in security appliances for protecting corporations internal computer networks in addition the decision by the china na tional offshore oil company cnooc to drop its proposed acquisition of unocal oil company in 2005 was partly due to concerns by cnooc about an impending cfius investigation of the transaction for cfius members the informal process has been beneficial because it has given them as much time as they have felt was necessary to review transaction without facing the time constraints that ar ise under the formal cfius review process this informal review likely has also given the cfius members added time to negotiate with the firms involved in tran saction to restructure the transaction in ways that have addressed an potential security concerns or to develop other types of conditions that members of cfius feel ar appropriate in orde r to remove security concerns the dp world acquisition demonstrated how this informal cfius process operates in reviewing proposed foreign investment transaction according to officials involved in the review dp world officials contacted the treasury department in early october 2005 to inform ally discuss their proposed transaction treasury officials directed dp world to consult with the department of homeland security and in november the treasury officials requested an intelligence assessment from the director of national intelligence staff representatives from all of the cfius members met on december 6 2005 to di scuss the transaction apparently tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33388crs21 44 ibiddetermine if there were any security c oncerns that had not been addressed and resolved during the twomonth long inform review of the proposed transaction ten days after that meeting dp world filed its official notification with cfius which distributed the notification to all of the cfius members and to the departments of energy and tr ansportation during this process the department of homeland security apparently negotiated letter of assurances with dp world that addressed some outstanding c oncerns about port security on the basis of this letter and the lack of any remaining concerns ex pressed by any member of cfius or other agencies that were consulted cfius completed its review of the transaction on january 17 2006 and concluded that the tran saction did not threaten to impair the national security and therefore that it did not warrant 45day investigation44 conclusions on july 26 2007 president bush signed pl 11049 the foreign investment and national security act of 2007 lthough the treasury department has not released its regulations implementing this law there is evident dissatisfaction among some in congress and elsewhere that the legislation in its present form is failing to address broad range of issu concerning foreign investment when the measure was debated and approve d the extent and nature of sovereign wealth funds swfs in which entities controlled by foreign governments invest in us firms was relatively unknown in addition the subprime mortgage crisis was just emerging and foreign investors had not yet taken substantial stakes in prominent us financial firms these investments are challenging some established notions of the role of foreign investment in the economy and the c oncept of what role economic issues play within the rubric of national security these and other concerns about foreign investment underscore the significant differences that remain between congress and the administration over the operations of cfius and over the economic and s ecurity objectives the committee should be pursuing the proposed acquisition of po by dubai ports world sparked broader set of concerns and wideranging discussion between congress and the administration over working set of parameters that establishes functional definition of the national ec onomic security implications of foreign direct investment in part this issue reflects differing assessments of the economic impact of foreign investment on the us economy and differi ng political and philosophical convictions among members and between the c ongress and the administration the incident also focused attention on the informal process firms use to have their investment transactions reviewed by cfius prior to formal review according to anecdotal evidence some firms apparently believe that the cfius process is not market neutral but that it adds to market uncertainty that can negatively affect firms stock price and lead to economic behavior by some firms that is not optimal for the economy as whol such behavior might involve firmshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33388crs22 expending considerable amount of res ources to avoid cfius investigation or deciding to terminate transaction that would improve the optimal performance of the economy in order to avoid cfius inve stigation while such anecdotal evidence does not provide enough evidence to serve as the basis for developing public policy it does raise number of concerns about the possible impact of the cfius process on the market and the potential costs of re defining the concept of national security relative to foreign investment the focus by congress on the committee has also shown that the dp world transaction in combination with other r ecent unpopular foreign investment transactions has exacerbated dissatisfacti on among some members of congress over the operations of cfius in particular some mbers have been displeased with the discretionary authority the committee us under the exonflorio provision to investigate certain foreign investment transactions as result congress changed the current process to require more frequent contacts between the committee which generally operates w ithout much public or congressi onal attention and the congress congress also expanded its oversight role over the committee the dp world transaction also revealed that th september 11 2001 terrorist attacks have fundame ntally altered the viewpoint of some members of congress regarding the role of foreign investment in the economy and over the impact of such investment on the national security frame work these observers argue that this change in perspective requires reassessment of the role of foreign investment in the economy and of the implications of corpor ate ownership of ac tivities that fall under the rubric of critical infrastructure as result congress amended the cfius process to enhance congresss oversight role while it reduced somewhat the discretion of cfius to revi ew and investigate foreign investment transactions in order to have cfius investigate larger number of foreign investment cases in addition the dp world transaction focu sed attention on longunresolved issues concerning the role of foreign investment in the nations overall security framework and the methods that are being used to ssess the impact of foreign investment on the nations defense industrial ba critical infrastructure and homeland security most economists agree that there is little economic evidence to conclude that foreign ownership whether by private entity or by an entity that is owned or controlled by foreign government has measurable impact on the us economy others may argue that such firms pose risk to national security or to homeland security but such concerns are not within the purview of this report similar issues concerning corporate ownership were ra ised during the late 1980s and early 1990s when foreign investment in the us econom increased rapidly there ar little new data however to alter the c onclusion reached at that time that there is definitive way to assess the economic impact of foreig n ownership or of fo reign investment on the economy although some observers ve expressed concerns about foreign investors who are owned or controlled by foreign govern ments acquiring us firms there is little confirmed evidence that such distinction in corporate ownership has any effect on the economy as whole for most economists the distinction between domestic and foreignowned firms whether the foreign firms are priv ately owned or controlled by foreign government is sufficiently small that they would argue that it does not warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33388crs23 placing restrictions on the inflow of foreig n investment nevert heless foreign direct investment does entail various economic costs and benefits on the benefit side such investments bring added capital into the economy and potentially could add to productivity growth and innovation such investment also represents one repercussion of the us trade deficit th deficit transfers dollardenominated assets to foreign investors who then decide how to hold those assets by choosing among various investment vehicles including direct investment foreign investment also removes stream of monetary benefits from the economy in the form of repatriated capital and profits that reduces the tota l amount of capital in the economy such costs and benefits likely occur whether the foreign owner is private entity or foreign government
