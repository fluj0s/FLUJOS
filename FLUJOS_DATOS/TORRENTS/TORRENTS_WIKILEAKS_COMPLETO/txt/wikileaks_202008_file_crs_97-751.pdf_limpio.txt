act subcontractor protection in federal projects alane r allman law clerk american law division john r luckey legislative attorney american law division summary the miller act act protects persons who have furnished labor or materials to contractors engaged in the construction alteration or repair of any public building or public work of the united states the measure was enacted in 1935 in response to protests by subcontractors and suppliers about their inability to collect their debts from contractors the act requires government contractor to post two surety bonds performance bond and payment bond in any federal construction contract in excess of 1000001 the performance bond guarantees the united states that the construction work will be performed to completion the payment bond assures payment to subcontractors and suppliers supplying labor and materials in the course of performance of the contract any subcontractor or supplier who has so furnished labor or material under contractual relationship with the contractor and who has not been paid in full within 90 days after the last labor was performed or material supplied may bring suit on the payment bond for the unpaid balance subcontractors and suppliers to second or lowertiered subcontractors are not protected by the miller act the remedy under the miller act is exclusive the miller act is designed to protect those persons who cannot take advantage of state lien laws because of united states government involvement in the transaction2 consequently the payment bond required by the miller act is in lieu of state mechanics lienshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97751crs2 340 usca 270af 440 usca 270d1 540 usca 270aa1 6see 48 cfr 281022a 740 usca 270aa2 8id 9id 1040 usca 270ba 11see jw bateson co v united states ex

separate payment bond which protects and assures payment to subcontractors and suppliers supplying labor and materials in the course of performance of the contract7 the sum of the payment bond is equal to 50 percent of the contract price when the contract is less than 1 million and 40 percent when the contract is from 1 5 million8 contracts in excess of 5 million require payment bond in the amount of 25 million9 the miller act payment bond covers firsttiered subcontr actors and suppliers of material who have direct contacts with the prime contractor10 these are called firsttier claimants11 subcontractors and material suppliers who have contracts with subcontractor12 are also covered and are called secondtier claimants13 anyone further down the contract chain is considered too remote and cannot assert claim against miller act payment bond posted by the contractor14httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97751crs3 1540 usca 270ba 16id 1740 usca 270bb 18id 1940 usca 270e 2040 usca 270f

collect their debts congress passed the heard act in 189421 before the passage of the heard act subcontractor or supplier of government contractor had little recourse against the government contractor since the subcontractor or supplier could not assert lien against property owned by the united states government contracts awarded during that period only rarely had clauses requiring the prime contractor to pay its debts to subcontractors and suppliers or permitting the government to withhold payments to the contractor if it did not22 the heard act granted right of action in the name of the united states against prime contractor and its surety for unpaid labor and materials used in the prosecution of contract work in 1905 congress amended the heard act by adding the phrase labor or materials used in the construction of any public building or public work23 this expression placed heavy burden of proof on subcontractors and suppliers seeking to recover from surety as condition to establishing liability on the bond thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97751crs4 24brogan v national surety co 246 us 257 1918 25miller act 49 stat 793 1935 current version at 40 usc 270af 26miller act 49 stat

show that the supplies or labor furnished were necessary to and wholly consumed in the prosecution of the contract work24 occasionally it was difficult for the courts to determine whether particular labor or materials had relation to the object of the contract so as to fall within the coverage of the heard act under the heard act as amended subcontractor or supplier was required to bring its suit within one year after final settlement of the contract the subcontractor or supplier could not at the time of delivery determine whether particular transaction was covered by the act because conceivably the supplies might not be used in the prosecution of the work coverage could only be determined after the work was completed and the right of action did not arise until six months afterwards noting these deficiencies congress repealed the heard act and replaced it with what is popularly referred to as the miller act in 193525 as originally enacted the miller act applied to all construction contracts exceeding 2000 awarded by the united states government the threshold amount was subsequently raised to 2500026 and finally to 10000027 congress also amended the miller act to delete references to final settlement and establishe d oneyear statute of limitations for the filing of miller act suits by subcontractors and suppliers28 the passage of the miller act resulted in the simplification of the burden of proof for recovery for subcontractors and suppliers while it covers the same subject matter as the heard act the miller act eliminated the term used thus subcontractors and suppliers now have less onerous burden of proof since the consumed in prosecution of the work test has been replaced by the reasonable expectation of consumption29 surety cannot expect the subcontractor or supplier to always be in position to prove that all the material and equipment supplied by the subcontractor and supplier was used by the prime contractor in the particular project protected by the bond therefore the subcontractor or supplier must prove only that the material or equipment was furnished by it with reference to the particular contract and was accepted by the prime contractor for use in the fulfillment of the government contract30 recent legal and legislative developments legal precedent establishing the miller act is quite settled legal disputes centering around the act are largely fact specifichttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97751crs5 31the small business administration reauthorization and amendment act of 1988 pl 100590 102 stat 2989 32hr rep 100694 1988 reprinted in 1988 usccan 3999 401011 33id at 4010 34id at 4011 358 cfr 11568the latest legislative development under the miller act has come in response to small contractors and subcontractors who were unable to obtain surety bonding due to industry underwriting standards congress passed the small business administration reauthorization and amendment act of 198831 which established preferred surety bond guarantee program this program assists small business contractors and subcontractors by extending payment and performance bond guarantees to surety against losses in order to make bonding more easily available32 in establishing the program congress intended to encourage major surety companies to participate in the program by delegating the small business administrations sba authority to approve surety companies to issue bonds without prior sba approval33 specifically the act allows the sba to authorize any surety without further sba approval to issue monitor and service surety bonds subject to the sba guarantee provided the sba determines that such surety has underwriting expertise and the capability to approve issue monitor and service such bonds34 ordinarily contractor or subcontractor would apply for bonding through its surety the surety will either deny or approve the application based upon the information contained in the application in the case of small businesses which might not meet industry standards the surety has the option to forward the application to the sba for bonding guarantee in this case the surety would provide the bonding if the sba guarantees the issued bond against losses if the small business breached the contract if the sba denies the application the surety would not provide the bonding the preferred surety bond guarantee program operates as third option for the small business contractor or subcontractor preferred surety bond insurer has already been approved by the sba for the authority to issue sba guaranteed bonding without the sbas approval therefore when the small business concern applies for bonding preferred surety bond insurer can approve the application immediately the benefit to the surety is that it can approve the application without sba approval and can still get reimbursed for up to 70 of any loss incurred in the breach of the contract35 the benefit to the small business concern is that it may receive bonding when it did not qualify for sba approval or when surety would not provide the bonding unless it was reimbursed by the sba for the loss
