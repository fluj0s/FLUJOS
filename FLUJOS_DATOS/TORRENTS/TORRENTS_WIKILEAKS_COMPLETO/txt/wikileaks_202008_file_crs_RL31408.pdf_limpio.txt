collection of personally identifiable information pii by website operators from visitors to government and commercial websites or by software that is surreptitiously installed on users computer spyware and transmits the information to someone else another is the monitoring of elect ronic mail and web usage by the government or law enforcement officials employers or email service providers the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks intensified debate over the issue of monitoring by the government and law enforcement officials with some advocating increased tools to help them track dow n terrorists and others cautioning that fundamental tenets of democracy such as privacy not be endangered in that pursuit congress passed the 2001 usa patr iot act pl 10756 that inter alia makes it easier for law enforcement officials to monitor internet activities that act was amended by the homeland security act p l 107296 loosening restrictions as to when and to whom internet service provi ders may voluntarily release the content of communications if they believe there is danger of death or injury some provisions of the usa patriot act including two that relate to internet use would

congress the clinton administration and the federal trade commission ftc initially focused their atten tion on protecting the privacy of children under 13 as they visit commercial websites not only are there concerns about information children might divulge about themselves but also about their parents the result was the childrens online privacy protection act coppa title x iii of division c of the fy1999 omnibus consolidated and emerge ncy supplemental ppropriations act pl 1052771 the ftcs final rule implementing the law became effective april 21 2000 http wwwftcgovos1999 1064fr59888htm commercial websites and online services directed to children under 13 or that knowingly collect information from them must inform parents of their information practices and obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting using or disclosing personal information from children the commission adopted sliding scale for complying with the verifiable consent requirement depending on how the data would be used that is if the information was for internal use only the verifiable consent could be obtained from the parent by email plus an additiona l step to ensure the person giving consent is in fact the parent if the website ope rator planned to disclose the information publicly or to third parties higher standard was set this sliding scale was set to expire in 2002 with the expectation that better verification technologies would become available however in 2002 the ftc determined that such technologies still were not available and the slidin g scale was extended to april 12 2005 in 2005 the commission extended it again and is seeking public comment on how to proceed as part of its overa ll review of the coppa rule2 the law also provides for industry groups or others to deve lop selfregulatory safe harbor guidelines that if approved by the ftc can be used by websites to comply with the law the ftc approved lfregulatory guidelines proposed by the better business bureau on

collection of information relating to children childrens ability to access information of their choice online and the availability of websites directed to children ftc activities and fair information practices the ftc conducted or sponsored veral surveys between 1997 and 2000 to determine the extent to which commercial website operators abided by four fair information practices providing notice to users of their information practices before collecting personal in formation allowing users choice as to whether and how personal information is used allowing users access to data collected and the ability to contest its accuracy and ensuring security of the information from unauthorized use some include enforcement as fifth fair information practice regarding choice the term optin refers to requirement that consumer give affirmative consent to an information practice while optout means that permission is assumed unless the consumer indicates otherwise see archived crs report rl30784

available on its website httpwwwftcgov briefly the first two ftc surveys december 1997 and june 1998 created concern about the information practices of websites directed at children and led to the enactment of coppa see above th ftc continued monitoring websites to determine if legislation was needed for those not covered by coppa in 1999 the ftc concluded that more legislation was not needed at that time because of indications of progress by industry at lfregulation including creation of seal programs see below and by two survey s conducted by georgetown university however in may 2000 the ftc changed its mind following another survey that found only 20 of randomly visited we bsites and 42 of the 100 most popular websites had implemented all four fair information practices the ftc voted to recommend that congress pass legislation re quiring websites to adhere to the four fair information practices but the 32 vote indicated division within the commission on october 4 2001 timothy muris who had r ecently become ftc chairman stated that he did not see need for additional legislation at that time mr muris was succeeded as ftc chairman on august 16 2004 by deborah platt majoras

regarding what is collected and how it is shared how the information will be secured and the rights of individuals under the 1974 privacy act and ot her relevant laws it so requires federal agencies to translate their website privacy policies into standardized machinereadable format enabling p3p to work see bove discussion of p3p for example monitoring of email and web usage by government and law enforcement officials another concern is the extent to which electronic mail email exchanges or visits to websites may be monitored by law enforcement agencies or employers in the wake of the september 11 terrorist ttacks the debate over law enforcement monitoring has intensified previously th issue had focused on the extent to which the federal bureau of investigation fbi with legal authorization used software program called carnivore l ater renamed dcs 1000 to in tercept email and monitor web activities of certain suspects the fbi would install the software on the equipment of internet service providers isps privacy advocates were concerned about whether carnivorelike systems can differentiate between email and internet usage by subject of an investigation and similar usage by other people technical details of the system were not publicly av ailable meaning that privacy groups were unable to independently dete rmine exactly what the system could or could not dohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31408crs7 9 see httpwwwepicorgprivacycarnivore2002_reportpdf and httpwwwepicorgprivacycarnivore2003_reportpdfleading to their concerns section 305 of the 21st century

system epic obtained the reports in january 2005 under the freedom of information act and placed them on its website9 the reports indicate that the justice department longer uses carnivoredcs 1000

fy2003 the usa patriot act following the terrorist attacks congress passed the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools to intercept and obstruct terrorism usa patriot act pl 10756 which expands law enforcements ability to monitor internet activities inter alia the law modifies the definitions of pen registers and trap and trace devices to include devices that monitor addressing and rou ting information for internet communications carnivore like programs may now fit within the new definitions the internet privacyrelated provisions of the usa patriot act included as part of title ii are as follows section 210 which expands the sc ope of subpoenas for records of electronic communications to include records commonly associated with internet usage such as session times and duration section 212 which allows isps to divulge records or other information but not the contents of communications pertaining to subscriber if they believe there is immediate danger of death or serious physical injury or as othe rwise authorized and requires them to divulge such records or info rmation excluding contents of communications to governmental entity under certain conditions it also allows an isp to divulge the contents of communications to law enforcement agency if it reasonably believes that an emergency involving immediate dang er of death or serious physical injury requires disclosure of th information without delay this section was amended by the cyber security enhancement act see below section 216 which adds routing nd addressing information used in internet communications to di aling information expanding what information government agency may capture using pen registers and trap and trace devices as au thorized by court order while excluding the content of any wire or electronic communications the section also requires law enforcement officials to keep certain records when they use their own pen registers or trap and trace devices and to provide those record s to the court that issued the order within 30 days of expiration of the order to the extent that carnivorelike systems fall with th new definition of pen registershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31408crs8 10 httpwwwepicorgalertepic_alert_923html see entry under 3 homeland security bill limits open government and click on hyperlink to epics february 26 2002

under color of law to intercept the wire or electronic communications of computer trespasser transmitted to through or from protected computer under certain circumstances and section 224 which sets fouryear sunset period for many of the title ii provisions sections 210 and 216 are excluded from the sunset sections 212 and 217 are not and therefore w ill expire on december 31 2005 as discussed be low congress is considering legislation that would amend this sunset clause making either more or fewer sections subject to it the cyber security enhancement ac t section 225 of the 2002 homeland security act pl 107296 amends secti on 212 of the usa patriot act it lowers the threshold for when isps may voluntarily divulge the content of communications now isps need only good faith instead of reasonable belief that there is an emergency involving danger instead of immediate danger of death or serious physical injury the cont ents can be disclosed to federal state or local governmental entity instead of law enforcement agency privacy advocates are especially concer ned about the language added by the cyber security enhancement act epic notes for example that allowing the contents of internet communications to be disclosed voluntarily to any governmental entity not only poses increased risk to personal privacy but also is poor security strategy another concern is that the w does not provide for judicial oversight of the use of these procedures10 senate judiciary committee hearing on september 23 2004 explored some of these concerns several house and senate committees held hearings in the first session of the 109th congress on various provisions of th usa patriot act and more are expected in the second session as congre ss debates whether to extend the sunset date or expiration date of several provisions of that act under section 224 number of sections would have expi red on december 31 2005 including section 212 and 217 section 210 and section 216 are not subject to the s unset clause ie they are permanent several bills were introduced to modify the sunset clause by making temporary provisions permanent by making permanen t provisions temporary or by modifying reporting requirements or othe rwise enhancing oversight of how the provisions are implemented as december 31 2005 pproached the issue became very contentious the house passed permanen t extension ie

terrorist attacks11 the commission concl uded pp 3 94395 that many of the usa patriot act provisions appear beneficial but that because of concerns regarding the shifting balance of power to the government we think that full and informed debate on the patriot act would be healthy the commission recommended that the burde n of proof for retaining particular governmental power should be on the executive to explai n that the power actually materially enhances security and b that there is ad equate supervision of the executives use of the powers to ensure protection of civil liberties if the power is granted there must be adequate guidelines nd oversight to properly confine its use the commission also called for creation of board within the executive branch to oversee adherence to the guidelines we recommend and the commitment the government makes to defend our civil liberties the commissioners went on to say that we must find ways of reconciling security with liberty since the success of one helps protect the other the choice between security and liberty is false choice as nothing is more likely to endanger americas liberties than the success of terrorist attack at home our history has shown us that insecurity th reatens liberty yet if our liberties are curtailed we lose the values th at we are struggling to defend the 108th congress passed legislation implementing many

whether they should notify their employees of that monitoring 2005 survey of 526 companies by the american management association and the epolicy institute found that 76 monitor web usage and 55 retain and review email messages19 the survey found that 26 of the companies had fired employees for misusing the internet and 25 had fired workers for email misuse regarding notice the survey

lower court to dismiss the case the case involved an email service provide r interloc inc that sold outof print books according to press accounts21 and the text of the courts ruling22 interloc used

declan email wiretap case can proceed court says cnet newscom continuedopinion noted that the parties stipulated that at all times that the interloc software was performing operations on the emails they existed in the random access memory or in hard drives within interlocs computer system the case turned on the distinction between the email being in transit or in storage and therefore governed by different law24 the government argued that the emails were copied contemporaneously with their transmission and therefore were intercepted under the meaning of the wiretap act judges torruella and cyr concluded however that they were in temporary storage in interlocs computer system and therefore were not subject to the provisions of the wiretap act they further stated that we believe that the language of the statute makes clear that congress meant to give lesse r protection to electronic communications than wire and oral communication moreover at this j uncture much of the protection may have been eviscerated by the realities of modern tec hnology however it is not the province of this court to graft meaning onto the statute where congress has spoken plainly p 1415 in his dissent judge lipez stated conversely that he did not believe congress intended for email that is temporarily stored as part of the transmission process to have less privacy than messages as they are in transit he agreed with the governments contention that an intercept occurs between the time the author hits the send button and the message arrives in the recipients inbox he concluded that councilma ns approach to the wiretap act would undo decades of practice and precedent nd would essentially render th act irrelevant since i find it inconceivable that congress coul d have intended such result merely by omitting the term electronic storage from its definition of electronic communication i respectfully dissent25 privacy advocates expressed deep concern about the ruling electronic frontier foundation eff attorney kevin bankston st ated that the court had effectively given internet communications providers free rein to invade the privacy of their users for any reason and at any time26

detail in crs report rl32706 spyware background and policy issues for congress by marcia smith the term spyware is not well defined one example of spyw are is software products that include as part of the software itself method by wh ich information is collected about the use of the computer on which the software is installed some products may collect personally identifiable information pii when the computer is connected to the internet the software peri odically relays the information back to the software manufacturer or marketing company some software traces users web activity and causes advertisements to suddenly ppear on the users monitor called pop up ads in response such software is called adware and one aspect of the spyware debate is whether adware should be included in the definition of spyware software programs that include spyware can be sold or provided for free on disk or other media or downloaded from th internet typically users have knowledge that spyware is on their computers central point of the debate is whether new laws are needed or if industry self regulation coupled with enforcement actions under existing laws such as the federal trade commission act is sufficient the lack of precise definition for spyware is cited as fundamental problem in attempting to write ne w laws ftc representatives and others caution that new legislation c ould have unintended consequences barring current or future technologies that might in fact have beneficial uses they further insist that if legal action is necessary existing laws provide sufficient authority consumer concern about control of thei r computers being taken over by spyware leads others to conclude that legislative action is needed utah and california have passed spyware laws but there is specific federal law regarding spyware in the 108th congress the house passed two bills hr 2929 and hr 4661 and the senate commerce committee re ported s 2145 there was further action two bills passed

for more information see crs report rl32706 spyware background and policy issues for congress by marcia smith identity theft including phishing and pharming identity theft is not an internet privacy issue but the perception that the internet makes identity theft easier means that it is often discussed in the internet privacy context the concern is that the widespread use of computers for storing and transmitting information is contributing to the rising rate of identity theft over the past several years where one individual assumes the identity of another using personal information such as credit card nd social security numbers ssns the ftc has toll free number 877 idtheft to help victims30 the extent to which the internet is responsible for the increase in cases is debatable some attribute the rise instead to carelessness by businesses in handling personally identifiable information and by credit issuers that grant credit without proper checks more traditional met hods of acquiring someones personal information from lost or stolen wallets or dumpster diving also are used by identity thieves three high profile inci dents that became public in early 2005 where the
