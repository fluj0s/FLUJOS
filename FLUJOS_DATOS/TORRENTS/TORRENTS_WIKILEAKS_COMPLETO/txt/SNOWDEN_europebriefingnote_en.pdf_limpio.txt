_______________________________________________________________________________ _____________ the us surveillance programmes and their impact on eu citizens fundamental rights executive summary this briefing note provides the libe committee with background and contextual information on prismfisansa activities and us surveillance programmes and their specific impact on eu citizens fundamental rights including privacy and data protection prior to the prism scandal european media underestimated this aspect apparently oblivious to the fact that the surveillance activity was primarily directed at the restofthe world and was not targeted at us citizens the note argues that t he scope of surveillance under the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 amendments act of 2008 faa has very strong implications on eu data sovereignty and the protect ion of its citizens rights the first section provides historical account of us surveillance programmes showing that the us authorities have continuously disregarded the human right to privacy of non americans the analysis of various surveillance programmes echelon prism and us national security legislation fisa patriot and faa clearly indicates that surveillance activities by the us authorities are conducted without taking into account the rights of non us citizens and residents in particul ar the scope of faa creates power of mass surveillance specifically targeted at the data of non us persons located outside the us including data processed by cloud computing which eludes eu data protection regulation the second section gives an ov erview of the main legal gaps loopholes and controversies of these programmes and their differing consequences for the rights of american and eu citizens the section unravels the legal provisions governing us surveillance programmes and further uncertain ties in their application such as serious limitations to the fourth amendment for us citizens specific powers over communications and pe rsonal data of non us persons absence of any cognizable privacy rights for non us persons under fisa the section also shows that the accelerating and already widespread use of cloud computing further undermines data protection for eu citizens and that review of some of the existing and proposed mechanisms that have been put in place to protect eu citi zens rights after data export actually function as loopholes finally some strategic options for the european parliament are developed and related recommendations are suggested in order to improve future eu regulation and to provide effective safegu ards for protection for eu citizens rights 5 policy department c citizens rights and constitutional affairs ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 6introduction background this briefing note aims at providing the libe committee with background and contextual information on prismfisansa activities and us surveillance programmes and their impact on eu citizens fundamental rights including privacy and data protection on june 5ththewashington post andthe guardian published secret order made under s215 of the patriot act requiring the verizon telephone company to give the nsa details of all us domestic and international phone calls and on an ongoing basis on june 6ththe two newspapers revealed the existence of an nsa programme codenamed prism that accessed data from leading brands of us internet companies by the end of the day statement from adm clapper director of nsa officially acknowledged the prism progra mme and that it relied on powers under the fisa amendments act faa 2008 s702 aka 1881a on june 9thedward snowden voluntarily disclosed his identity and film interview with him was released in the european parliament resolution of 4 july 2013 on the us national security agency surveillance programme meps expressed serious concern over prism and other surveillance programmes and strongly condemned spying on eu official representatives and called on the us authorities to provide them with full inf ormation on these allegations without further delay inquiries by the commission1 art29 working party2 and few ms parliaments are also in progress the problem of transnational mass surveillance and democracy3 snowdens revelations about prism show that cyber mass surveillance at the transnational level induces systemic breaches of fundamental rights these breaches lead us to question the scale of transnational mass surveillance and its implications for our democracies our government in its very nature and our open society in all its instinct under the constitution and the bill of rights automatically outlaws intelligence organizations of the kind that have developed in police states allen dulles 19634 theres been spying for years theres been surveillance for years and so forth im not going to pass judgement on that its the nature of our society eric schmidt exec utive chairman of google 2013 these two quotations are distinct in time by 50 years they differ in the answe rs but address the same central question how far can democratic societies continue to exist in their very nature if intelligence activities include massive surveillance of populations for eric schmidt and according to most of the media reports in the wo rld the nature of society 1european commissioner reding viviane 2013 letter to the attorney general ref ares 20131935546 10062013 brussels 10 june 2013 2article 29

p257the us surveillance programmes and their impact on eu citizens fundamental rights _______________________________________________________________________________ _____________ 7has changed technologies of telecommunication including mobile phones internet satellites and more generally all data which can be digitalised and integrated into platforms have given the possibilities of gathering unprecede nted amount of data to keep them to organise them to search them if the technologies exist then they have to be used it is not possible to go against the flow therefore it is not surprise to discover that programmes run by intelligence services use these techniques at their maximum possibilities and in secrecy the assumption is that if everyone else with these technical capabilities uses them then we should too if not it would be naivety or even worse defeat endangering the national securi ty of country by letting another country benefit from the possibilities opened by these technologies however should we have to live with this extension of espionage to massive surveillance of populations and accept it as fact fortunately totalit arian regimes have more or less disappeared before the full development of theses capacities today in democratic regimes when these technologies are used they are limited on purpose and are mainly centred on antiterrorism collaboration in order to pre vent attempts of attacks according to intelligence services worldwide these technologies are not endangering civil liberties they are the best way to protect the citizen from global terrorism intelligence services screen suspicious behaviours and excha nge of information occurs at the international level only real suspects are in principle under surveillance from this perspective far from being shame the revelations of programmes like prism could be seen as proof of good level of collabor ation which has eventually to be enhanced in the future against numerous forms of violence in front of this recital given by the most important authorities of the different intelligence services and the antiterro rismagencies in the us in the uk in f rance and at the eu level it is critical to discuss the supposedly new nature of our societies the impact of technological transformations in democratic societies how to use these technologies as resources for both information exchange and competition over information key element of globalised world what are the rights of the different governments in processing them these are the core questions as stated by allen dulles above justifications given by intelligence services work in favour of p olice state and against the very nature of an open society living in democratic regimes proponents of an open society insist that against the previous trend technologies ought not to drive human actions they have to be used in reasonable ways and under the rule of law the mass scaling has to be contained constitutional provisions have to be applied and the presumption of innocence is applicable for all human beings not only citizens if suspicions exist they have to be related to certain forms of crime and not marginal behaviours or life styles hence what is at stake here is not the mechanisms by which antiterrorism laws and activities have to be regulated at the transatlantic level even if it is subset of the question it is noteven the stion of espionage activities between different governments it is the question of the nature the scale and the depth of surveillance that can be tolerated in and between democracies snowdens revelations highlight numerous breaches of fundamental righ ts this affects in priority all the persons whose data have been extracted via surveillance of communications digital cables or cloud computing technologies as soon as they are under category of suspicion or of some interest for foreign intelligence purposes however all these persons are not protected in the same way especially if they are not us citizens the eu citizen is therefore particularly fragile in this configuration connecting us intelligence services private companies that provide servi ces at the global level and the ownership they can exercise over their data it is clear that if eu citizens do not have the same level of protections as the us citizens because of the practices of the us intelligence services and the lack of effective pr otections they will become the first victims of these systems freedom of thought opinion expression and of the press are cardinal values that have to be preserved any citizen of the eu has the right to have private lifepolicy department c citizens rights and constitutional affairs ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 8ie life which is not ful ly under the surveillance of any state apparatus the investigative eyes of any government have to be strongly reminded of distinctions between private and public activities between what is crime and what is simply different life style by gathering m assive data on life styles in order to elaborate patterns and profiles concerning political attitudes and economic choices prism seems to have allowed an unprecedented scale and depth in intelligence gathering which goes beyond counter terrorism and beyo nd espionage activities carried out by liberal regimes in the past this may lead towards an illegal form of total information awareness where data of millions of people are subject to collection and manipulation by the nsa this note wants to assess this question of the craft of intelligence and its necessary limits in democracy and between them as we will see through the documents delivered by snowden the scale of the prism programme is global its depth reaches the digital data of large groups of pop ulations and breaches the fundamental rights of large groups of populations especially eu citizens the eu institutions have therefore the right and duty to examine this emergence of cyber mass surveillance and how it affects the fundamental rights of the eu citizen abroad and at home privacy governance euus competing models careful analysis of us privacy laws compared to the eu data protection framework shows that the former allows few practical options for the individual to live their lives with self determination over their personal data however core effect of data protection law is that if data is copied from one computer to another then providing the right legal conditions for transfer exist the individual cannot object on the grounds that their privacy risk increases through every such proliferation of their data5 this holds true if the data is copied onto thousand machines in one organization or spread onward to thousand organisations or to different legal regime in third cou ntry the individual cannot stop this once they lose possession of their data whereas for example if the data was intellectual property then license to reproduce the data would be necessary by permission we are all the authors of our lives and it s eems increasingly anomalous that internet companies lay claim to property rights in the patterns of data minutely recording our thoughts and behaviour yet ask the people who produce this data to sacrifice their autonomy and take privacy on trust the eu data protection framework in theory is categorically better than the us for privacy but in practice it is hard to find any real world internet services that implement dp principles by design conveniently and securely privacy governance around the world has evolved around two competing models europe made some rights of individuals inalienable and assigned responsibilities to data controller organizations whereas in the united states companies inserted waivers of rights into terms and conditions6contra cts allowing exploitation of data in exhaustive ways known as the notice andchoice principle the prism crisis arose directly from the emerging dominance over the last decade of free services operated from remote warehouses full of computer servers by companies predominantly based in us jurisdiction that has become known as cloud computing to explain this relationship we must explore details of the us framework of national security law 5hondius frits w 1975 emerging data protection in europe north holland pub co 6cf the documentary terms and conditions may apply 2013 usa dir cullen holbackthe us surveillance programmes

first r eports of warrantless wiretapping in the last decade and until quite recently in the prism related revelations european media have covered us surveillance controversies as if these were purely parochial arguments about us civil liberties apparently ob livious that the surveillance activity was directed at the rest of theworld this note aims to document this under appreciated aspect it will show that t he scope of surveillance conducted under change in the fisa law in 2008 extended its scope beyond interception of communications to include any data in public cloud computing as well this has very strong implications for the eus continued sovereignty over data and the protection of its citizens rights the aim is here to provide guide to how surveillance of internet communications by the us government developed and how this affects the human right to privacy integrating historical technical and policy analysis from the perspective of the individual eu citizen7 the note will therefore cove r the following i an account of us foreign surveillance history and current known state ii an overview of the main legal controversies both in us terms and the effects and consequences for eu citizens rights iii strategic options for the european parliament and recommendations 7new stories based on snowdens material were breaking throughout the drafting of this note and whilst every effort has been made to ensure accuracy it is possible th at further revelations could change the interpretations givenpolicy department c citizens rights and constitutional affairs ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 101historical backgroun d of us surveillance key findings historical account of us various surveillance programmes precursors to echelon prism etc and us gislation in the field of surveillance fisa and faa shows that the us has continuously disregarded the fundamental rights of non us citizens in particular the scope of faa coupled with expressly political definitions of what constitutes foreign intelligence information creates power of mass surveillance specifically targeted at the data of non us persons located outside the us which eludes effective control by current and proposed eu data protection regulation historical account of us rveillance programmes provides the context for their interpretation as the latest phase of system of us exceptionalism with origins in world war ii these programmes constitute the greatest contemporary challenge to data protection because they incorpo rated arbitrary discriminatory standards of treatment strictly according to nationality and geopolitical alliances which are secret and incompatible with the rule of law under eu structures 11 world war ii and the origins of the ukusa treaties in the 1970s there were the first disclosures of the extent of allied success in wwii cryptanalysis the world discovered the secret history of bletchley park aka station x churchills signals intelligence headquarters the story of post war secret inte lligence partnerships at the international level is intertwined with the personal trajectory of alan turing great mathematician and co founder of computer science who was critical to the effort to design automated machines which could feasibly solve ci phers generated by machine such as enigma used for many nazi germany communications alan turing travelled to the us in 1942 to supervise us navy mass production of the decryption machines called bombes for the atlantic war and to review work on new scrambler telephone at bell laboratories to be used for communications between heads of government unfortunately turing was not equipped with any letters of authority so he was detained by us immigration as suspicious until rescued by uk officials in new york what was initially supposed to be two week trip turned into months as precedent existed to grant even foreign ally security clearance to the laboratories he was supposed to visit there followed several months of fraught uk diplomacy and turf wars between the us navy and army since the latter had need toknow about ultra the name given to intelligence produced from decryption at bletchley the uk wanted as few people as possible in on the secret and the disharmony thus experience d inside the us military security hierarchies became known as the turing affair these were the origins of the post war secret intelligence partnership between the us and uk as first parties canadaaustralianew zealand as second parties and other na tions with lesser access as third parties the treaty is named ukusa and we know the details above about its genesis because in 2010 the us national security agency declassified the unredacted text of ukusa treaties8up until the 1950s with related corres pondence the 8ukusa agreement release 1940 1956 early papers concerning us uk agreement 19401944 nsa cssthe us surveillance programmes and their impact on eu citizens fundamental rights _______________________________________________________________________________ _____________ 11current text is secret gchq9did not declassify much in comparison although the occasion was billed as joint exercise the purpose of the ukusa treaties was to establish defined areas of technical co operation and avoid conflicts however general spy clause appears in the versions published up until the 1950s but expressions of amity comparable to public treaties it is not known whether any comprehensive secret spy agreement exists today between the uk and us and ne ither has ever given legislative or executive comment on the matter 12 echelon the ukusa communications surveillance nexus from the founding of the us national security agency nsa in 1952 throughout the cold war both the uk and us vastly expanded their signal intelligence capacities collecting from undersea cables at landing points10 satellites intercepting terrestrial microwave relays and arrays of antennae usually sited in military bases and embassies the evolution and nature of these capabilities were documented from open source research in two reports11to the european institutions culminating in the parliaments inquiry into echelon in 2000 echelon was in fact codeword for one particular surveillance system but became in common usage synecdo che for the entire ukusa communications surveillance nexus the last meeting the ep inquiry committee was on september 10 2001 the committee recommended to the european parliament that citizens of eu member states use cryptography in their communications to protect their privacy because economic espionage with echelon had obviously been conducted by the us intelligence agencies 13 1975 1978 watergate and the church committee after the us was convulsed by the watergate scandal culminating in the resignat ion of richard nixon senator frank church led congressional committee of inquiry into abuses of power by law enforcement and intelligence agencies which had conducted illegal domestic wire tapping of political and civic leaders under presidential author ity and contrary to the fourth amendment of the us constitution which protects privacy against unreasonable searches without particular warrant issued on probable cause meaning evidence of 50 likelihood of criminality the church inquiry reported on the question of whether the fourth amendment restricts the mass trawling and collection of international communications which they discovered had been secretly conducted since the 1940s on telegrams12 the inquiry canvassed that inadvertent col lection of americans data transmitted internationally was tolerable if procedures were made for minimization of erroneous unwarranted access and mistakes not used prejudicially against americans 9government communications head quarters the uk national cryptologic and information national security surveillance organisation the

intellig ence surveillance act of 1978 fisa which regulated the interception of international and domestic foreign intelligence information from telecommunications carriers collection of data by any nation from outside its territory is literally lawless and not restricted by any explicit international agreements 14 the post 911 context extension of intelligence powers after the terrorist attacks of septembe r 11th2001privacy and data protection has been deeply challenged by exceptional measures taken in the name of security and the fight against terrorism theusa patriot act of 2001 wasenacted by the us congress on october 26 2001 and its primary effect was to gre atly extend law enforcement agencies powers for gathering domestic intelligence inside the us the revised foreign intelligence surveillance amendment act of 2008 faa13created power of mass surveillance specifically targeted at the data of non us pers ons located outside the us these aspects and their implications for eu citizens will be analysed in the following section section 2 numerous new surveillance programmes and modalities were further suggested to president bush by nsa director gen hayde n without explicit authorization under statute and approval was nevertheless given those programmes were retroactively deemed lawful in secret memoranda prepared by relatively junior legal14official under the authorisation to use military force aumf for the war in afghanistan and associated war on terror operations amongst these programmes was one codenamed stellar wind which involved placing fibre optic cable splitters in major internet switching centres and triaging the enormous volumes of traffic in real time with small high performance scanning computer known as deep packet inspection box which would send data filtered by this means back to the nsa an att technical supervisor in the san francisco office was asked to assist in constructing such facility room 641a and was concerned that this activity manifestly broke us constitutional protections because the cable carried domestic as well as international traffic he took his story with documentation to the new york times which did not publish15the story for year until 2005 after the re election of president bush other whistle blowers from the nsa cia and fbi emerged with tales of illegal mass surveillance via mobile phones the internet and satellites and even revea led that phone calls of barack obama16he was then senator and supreme court judges had been tapped the controversy was exacerbated because two years before former national security adviser17had proposed research programme for total information awar eness tia massive system of surveillance of all digital data processed with advanced artificial

distinctive advantage of the system is that it enables an analyst to discover strong selectors search parameters which identify or can be used to extract data precisely about target and to look for anomalous events suc h as someone using encryption or searching for suspicious stuff the analyst can use the result of these index searches to simply pull content from the site as required this system of unified search allows retrospective trawling through 3 days as of 2008 of much greater volume of data than is feasible to copy back to the nsa the system can also do persona session collection which means that an anomalous event potentially characteristic of particular target can be used to trigger automatic collection of associated data without knowledge of strong selector it is also possible to find all the exploitable machines in country x by matching the fingerprints of configurations which show up in the data streams captured with nsas database of known software vulnerabilities the slides also say it is possible to find all excel spreadsheets with mac addresses coming out of iraq23 slide 17 is remarkable because it contained the first intimations of systemic compromise of encryption systems24see bullrun below 153 bullrun bullrun25is the codename for nsa programme for the last decade for an aggressive multipronged effort to break into widely used encryption technologies revealed in joint guardian26new york times story on september 1st this programme has caused the greatest shock amongst the internet technical security community of all the snowden material so far and frantic efforts are underway worldwide to assess which systems might be vulnerable and to upgra or change keys ciphers and systems not least because adversaries in hostile countries will now be trying to discover any backdoor mechanisms previously only known by the nsa the programme budget is 250m per annum and may use some of the following m ethods collaboration with vendors of it security products and software mathematical cryptanalysis and side channel attacks forging of public key certificates infiltrating and influencing technical bodies towards adopting insecure standards and likel use of coercive legal orders to compel introduction of backdoors it is important to stress that evidence has emerged yet that the fundamental cipher algorithms in common use have been broken mathematically however over the past few years doubts have grown about vulnerabilities in the complex protocols used to set up and ensure compatibility amongst the software in common use fisa 702 may require service provider to immediately provide the government with all information facilities or assi stance necessary to accomplish the acquisition of foreign intelligence information and thus on its face could compel disclosure of cryptographic keys 23this seems anomalous because ostensibly microsoft stopped incorporating the mac address in the guid global unique identifier way of generating unique document index number with office 2000 and mac addresses are not correlated to particular country unless somehow the nsa s obtained comprehensive database or built one somehow specially for iraq or is able to monitor and collect wifi signals at long range andor systematically 24show all the vpn startups in country x and give the data so i can decrypt and discov

unlawful practices affecting both us citizens and non us citizens the cons equences of this legal uncertainty and lack of fourth amendment protection for non us citizens means that privacy rights for non americans are recognized by the us authorities under fisa the accelerating and already widespread use of cloud computing f urther undermines data protection for eu citizens review of the mechanisms that have been put in place in the eu for data export to protect eu citizens rights shows that they actually function as loopholes when analysing known us surveillance progra mmes and related legislation from fundamental rights perspective the legal grey areas fall into two categories which constantly interact27 lack of legal certainty resulting in privacy invasions and other potential abuses and malpractices inside the us through ostensibly unintended effects on american citizens and legal residents the intent of the us fisa and patriot laws to acquire foreign

under procedure called national security letter s215 is applicable to any kind of tangible data held by great variety of private sector businesses after the first revelations about the prism programme gen alexander director of the nsa confirmed ver two public hearings of congressional intelligence review committees that the nsa collects both domestic and international telephone call metadata from all major carriers and maintains database of all such calls for five years30 by the nsas own account it uses this data for the sole purpose of deciding whether there is reasonable articulable suspicion of connection to terrorist investigation the database is searched for whether candidate target telephone number is within three hops ie when there exists chain of calls sometime over 5 year period to nexus of numbers previously associated with terrorism 212 cdrs and the relevance test so far the greatest legislative controversy in the us about snowdens revelations is t in fact about prism but about the indiscriminate blanket collection of all telephone metadata cdrs calldetail records which appears to exceed the terms of the patriot statute data can only be acquired under s215 in the first place if it meets th standard that it must be relevant to an authorised investigation the patriot act was amended in 2006 to include the relevance standard with the intention of limiting the collection of data31 but it appears to have been interpreted as justification for massive data collection the rationale behind this collection is therefore questionable how is it possible to justify collection of the entire database in the first place on the basis of establishing that particular suspects number has 3 hop co nnection to terrorism as expressed succinctly 28agarwal rambow bhardwaj n

required to conduct searches32 problems that emerged from fisa were left to the interpretation in secret proceedings of theforeign intelligence surveillance court fisc and the higher review court fiscr whose judges are appointed solely by the chief justice of the supreme court it appears that the fisa courts agree with the governments argument that it i s common in investigations for some indefinitely large corpus of records to be considered relevant in order to discover the actual evidence some official declassifications of the secret fiscr opinions are in progress but have not so far explained th is logical anomaly 213 direct access to data centres granted for surveillance purposes the companies named in the prism slides issued prompt denials of direct access to their datacentres mentioned in the marketing slides that revealed prisms existence their position was that they were simply complying with mandatory court order and they had never heard of the prism codename which is not surprising since this was an nsa codeword for top secret programme microsoft asserted that they onl responded to requests referencing specific account identifiers and google and facebook denied they had black boxes stationed in their networks giving direct access the companies are constrained by the secrecy provisions of s702 on pain of contemp t or even espionage charges33 google and microsoft are now suing the government for permission to publish breakdown of the number of persons affected by fisa orders however there is substantive inconsistency between the carefully wordsmithed and apparently co ordinated34 company denials and the reports of prism the phrase direct access was likely intended to distinguish this modality from upstream collection see above not necessarily implying literal capability to extract data without the c ompanys knowledge however such literal direct access is not precluded by the 702 statute and it may be that this has already occurred with some other companies or may in future be permitted by the fisc critical further development resulted from keen observation by the new york times35 on august 8ththat in the targeting procedures published on june 20th the selectors used to specify the information to be accessed under 702 could include arbitrary search terms this ought not to be surprising f rom plain reading of the statute but it emphasized that americans and of course non americans privacy could be implicated in arbitrary trawls through mass of data rather than access being confined to account identifiers judged 50 likely to be namerican further story disclosed36that at the governments request in 2011 the fisa court reversed an earlier ruling and thenceforth permitted arbitrary search terms even if these included targeting factors characteristic of americans 32httpswwwefforgdeeplinks201309government releases nsasurveillance docsandpreviously secret fisa court

located outside the territory of the us ie the 95 of the rest oftheworld the most heated political dif ficulty was over whether telecommunications companies had broken statute law regulating the privacy of their subscribers by co operating depending on the contested legitimacy of the use of the authorization for use of military force aumf to effect surve illance which had impinged on americans the companies were potentially liable for billions of dollars of damages the telecommunications companies and the internet service providers industry were adamant that complete civil immunity was their price for f uture co operation it is here critical to underline that this controversy was about the effects on the privacy of americans and that the surveillance of foreigners outside the us through their communications routed to or via the us was an assumed faitaccompli and national prerogative45 223 the fourth amendment does not apply to non uspers outside the us the connection between the controversy over the s215 patriot act power and the use of the fisa 702 power in the prism programme can now be explain ed the database of 5 years of details of domestic and international calls was used to establish counter terrorist justification according to the three hops principle second database was then checked of directory the nsa maintains of telephone n umbers believed to belong to americans if that check indicated the number was probably notthat of an american then the contents of that telephone call could be listened to with any further authorisation under the fisa 702 law otherwise if the number seemed probably that of an american further particular warrant for the interception woul d have to be obtained under different section of fisa justifying the intrusion to much higher legal standard and with reference to the circumstances of the individual case however close reading of s215 shows that an alternative purpose other t han connection to terrorism is to obtain foreign intelligence information not concerning united states person46 from non us perspective this may be an important point which has not so far featured in any of the analysis made in the us nor is it c lear how this provision would interact with the already tangled skein of contested legality however it is further illustration of us legislation which discriminates between the protections afforded by the constitution to uscitizens and everybody else some remarkable interviews have been given by former nsa director gen hayden in which he stressed that the fourth

article 29 data protection working party wp29 have clarified that this is insufficient intheir recent opinion cloud providers are transn ational companies subject to conflicts of international public law which law they choose to obey will be governed by the penalties applicable and exigencies of the situation and in practice the predominant allegiances of the company management so far almost all the attention on such conflicts has been focussed on the us patriot act but there has been virtually discussion of the implications of the us foreign intelligence surveillance amendment act of 2008 1881a of faa for the first time created power of mass surveillance specifically targeted at the data of non uspersons located outside the us which applies to cloud computing although all of the constituent definitions had been defined in earlier statutes the conjunction of all of these elements was newthe most significant change escaped any comment or public debate altogether the scope of surveillance was extended beyond interception of communications to include any data in public cloud computing as well this change occurred merely b incorporating remote computing services into the definition of an electronic communication service provider very strong implications on eu data sovereignty and the protection of its citizens rights the implications for eu fundamental rights flow from the definition of foreign intelligence information which includes information with respect to foreign based political organization or foreign territory that relates to the conduct of the foreign affairs of the united states in other words it i s lawful in the us to conduct purely political surveillance on foreigners data accessible in us clouds the root problem is that cloud computing breaks the forty year old legal model for international data transfers the primary desideratum would be com prehensive international treaty guaranteeing full reciprocity of rights but otherwise exceptions derogations can be recognized in particular circumstances providing there are safeguards appropriate to the specific situation cloud computing breaks the golden rulethat the exception must not become the rule once data is transferred into cloud sovereignty is surrendered in summary it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the eu is not addressing properly an irrevocable loss of data sovereignty an d allowing errors made during the safe harbour negotiations of 2000 to be consolidated not corrected particular attention should be given to us law that authorizes the surveillance of cloud data of non us residents the ep should ask for further enquirie s into the us fisa amendments act the status of the 4th amendment with respect to nonuspers and the usa patriot act especially s215 the ep should consider amending the dp regulation to require prominent warnings to individual data subjects of vulnerability to political surveillance before eu cloud data is exported to us jurisdiction data subject should be left unaware if sensitive data about them is exposed to 3rd countrys surveillance apparatus the existing derogations must be dis applied for cloud because of the systemic risk of loss of data sovereignty the eu should open new negotiations with the us for recognition of human right to privacy which grants europeans equal protections in us courts the eu needs an industrial policy fo r autonomous capacity in cloud computing the dg infso communication of october 2012 is on this matter not in tune with the challenges analysed in this study target could be that by 2020 50

conducting talks in 2011 with the us authorities on an umbrella agreement intended to cover transfers of data for law enforcement purposes so far the us has been adamant that th iswill not cover access to eu data from us private parties by us authorities and thus would exclude precisely the situation of cloud computing53 225 there are privacy rights recognised by us authorities for non us persons under fisa the acquisition of foreign intelligence information under the prism programme requires adherence to minimization54and targeting55procedures which were revealed unredacted by the guardian on20thjune together these provide strong evidence that there are privacy rights for non americans recognized by the us authorities under prism and related programmes the revealed documents are heavily tautologous and replete with bureaucratic jargon b ut close reading does not discover any acknowledgement of rights for non americans whatsoever one therefore suspects that us operational practice places limitations on exploiting or intruding ona non us persons privacy if the broad definitions of foreign intelligence information are met moreover in may 2012 letter to the congressional

safeguards in order to conclude this section the author would like to draw the parliaments attention to certain difficulties with current derogations andor safeguards proposed as solutions to the implications for eu citizens underlined above this subsection aims to highlight the loopholes and gaps in several mechanisms that have been put in place for data export in the author s view these mechanisms should not be seen as guarantees for the protection of eu citizens rights 231 safe harbour bcrs for processors and cloud computing the euus safe harbour agreement of 2000 implemented process for us companies to comply wit h the eu directive 9546ec on the protection of personal data if us company makes declaration of adherence to the safe harbour principles then an eu controller may export data to that company although written contract is still required sometimes described as simultaneous unilateral declaration the agreement left ambiguous whether it covered the situation of remote processing of data inside the us on instruction from controllers inside the eu especially in the case of cloud computing such remote processors were most unlikely to be capable of giving effect to the safe harbour principles which the us argued thus became void did the deal still apply for unrestricted export of eu data for remote processing under essentially self regulato ry framework in 2000 the eu commission over ruled objections from civil society and some dpas to conclude deal the us negotiators in the department of commerce worked closely with us trade lobbies on series of faqs for us companies to interpret the agreement to marginalize eu privacy rights building in loopholes on such questions as what counted as identifiable data refusing rights of access and avoiding any

discussed above nd stated that the controversial provisions of the usa patriot act are essentially irrelevant for safe harbour data flows much of the legal analysis supporting the theory that safe harbour applies to cloud computing can be traced to the work of dr chri stopher kuner62 for many years the organizer of brussels lobby of privacy officers from predominantly us multinational companies which became influential with the commission and dpas dr kuner also represented the international chamber of commerce in u discussions over data protection and has advised major internet companies as clients kuners textbook of data protection commercial law was cited in microsoft sponsored study63 arguing that safe harbour sufficed for cloud processing the us recently reiterated this view expressly64 against this background working group of dpas began discussions about 2009 with major internet companies on new proposed derogation which could subsume cloud computing this became known as binding corporate rules for data processors the concept was that us or other third country cloud service vendor could obtain security accreditation for an entire software platform from reputable auditor and together with check list of organizational procedures drafted by wp2965 an eu controller could then lawfully export personal data outside the eu into the foreign controlled cloud the checklist imposed and in limited respects strengthened similar conditions and wording to that which had already been created by the commission for model clauses see below perhaps in response to

____________________________________________________________________________________________ 26bcrs forprocessors might sound like variant of the existing bcrs for controllers but in actuality they are vastly more risky for europeans privacy the strategic risk to eu data sovereignty which arises directly from the concept of bcrs forprocessors is that the global cloud industry is dominated by software platforms from microsoft google amazon and few others microsofts goal for its public sector sales force from 2010 was to compete for every contract for data processing by governments68 the cost savings for cloud p rocessing can be massive sometimes one tenth the cost of processing on premise s by the controller according to industry marketing claims the cost savings are from equipment overhead operational staff increasingly expensive for leading cyber securit expertise and the major cloud providers can take advantage of economies of scale and higher average utilization by spreading processing loads across timezones globally therefore there is already and will be further competitive imperative to migr ate european on premise s data to cloud processing and so far the eu has almost significant indigenous software platforms that can compete on cost features or reliability with the leading us providers the exception to this gloomy picture is free and open source software which has produced powerful cloud stacks competitive with proprietary software and services in this light bcr forprocessors can be seen as an expedient strategy both for the commission and for data protection authorities dp as who wish to maintain the semblance of legal control over eu data and for the cloud providers who find the existing eu data protection regime generally inconvenient especially for tax purposes69 the commission promoted the legal status of the bcr forprocessors concept in the text of the new draft regulation70 subsequently national dpas would have alternative but to accept their validity once issued so far only few dozen of the existing controller bcrs have been approved71 and the standard of c ompliance already is not reassuring72 232 model contracts from 2001 the eu commission drafted approved model clauses for inclusion in contracts both for controllers and processors located outside the eu intended to guarantee privacy rights for indiv iduals comparable to those they would have if the data remained inside the eu the conceptual flaw in this general approach is the supposition that computer systems can be audited to guarantee the three essential

situations where an eu controller might want to btain monetary damages from third country processorcontroller the reputation damage they could suffer in the marketplace eg from data breach becoming known would be very unlikely to be recouped in theory this disincentive would be removed by th new draft regulations requirement77to notify dpas of data breaches but dpas have signalled that they will not necessarily require data subjects to be informed and thus effectively make the incident public knowledge partly in order to shield controll ers from disproportionate reputation damage when disputes are settled out of court without publicity it undercuts the function that contract litigation would perform of informing controllers about the reliability of those to whom they might export data data subjects of course have idea when their rights may have been infringed under this approach 74commission decision of 27 december 2001 on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries under directive 9546ec 200216ec 75the notable exception is the chaos computer club of germany 76with promising exceptions such as the short lived international campaign against mass surveillance of 2005 website now defunct but copy preserved here and the generally high level of civil society vigilance in germany which must be taken as read for avoidance of repetition 77the current breach notification requirement under the revised privacy directive only applies to telecommunications companies and internet services providers not to information society services provided through websites like social networks and search engines and general data controllerspolicy department c citizens rights and constitutional affairs ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 283strategic options an d recommendations fo r the european parliam ent 31 reducing exposure and growing european cloud as explained earlier the mechanism of bcrs forprocessors apparently tailor made to ease the flow of eu data into third country cloud computing is not sufficient to safeguard rights it contains loophole that condones unlawful surveillance it is thus quite surprising that at various st ages of development the concept has been endorsed by the rticle 29 data protection working party78wp29 the european data protection supervisor79 edps and the french commission nationale linformatique et des libertés cnil which led their formulation evidence has emerged that these dpas understood the structural shift of data sovereignty80implied by cloud computing rather an unrealistic and legalistic view has allowed the protection of eu citizens to be neglected recommendations prominent notices should be displayed by every us web site offering services in the eu to inform consent to collect data from eu citizens the users should be made aware that the data may be subject to surveillance under fisa 702 by the us government for ny purpose which furthers us foreign policy consent requirement will raise eu citizen awareness and favour growth of services solely within eu jurisdiction this will thus have economic impact on us business and increase pressure on the us government to reach settlement since the other main mechanisms for data export model contracts safe harbour are not protective against fisa or patriot they should be revoked and re negotiated in any case the requirement above for informed consent after prominent warning notice should apply to any data collected in the past or in the future by public or private sector eu controller before it can be exported to the us for cloud processing full industrial policy for development of an autonomous euro pean cloud computing capacity based on freeopen source software should be supported such policy would reduce us control over the high end of the cloud commerce value chain and eu online advertising markets currently european data is exposed to comme rcial manipulation foreign intelligence surveillance and industrial espionage investments in european cloud will bring economic benefits as well as providing the foundation for durable data sovereignty 32 reinstating article 42 the published81new regul ation omitted art42 according to the numbering of draft82 leaked two months before

citizens fundamental rights _______________________________________________________________________________ _____________ 29interests83article 42 prohibits third countries such as the united states and other non eu member state s from accessing eu personal data where required by non eu court or administrative authority without prior authorization by an eu data protection authority the article has been described as the anti fisa clause recommendations the deterrent effect of art42 should be assessed before it is reinstated and in particular the following issues should be addressed even though art42 in principle mitigates controversial aspects of fisa it is doubtful that this measure would be effective because compl iance would expose the leadership of us companies to charges of espionage as the yahoo ceo declared recently we faced jail if we revealed nsa surveillance secrets 84 the efficiency of sanctions as compliance mechanism should also be evaluated from the perspective of net economic gains and losses as an illustration the eu competition authority prosecuted long case against microsoft for its monopoly of localarea networking resulting in fine of 1bn the largest ever applied by the eu the cor porate attorney responsible for that strategy was not fired for incompetence but promoted to deputy general counsel the reason is that microsofts profits over the previous decade from the monopoly were conservatively twenty times the size of the enormo us fine and this was foreseen by microsofts legal strategists if major cloud provider failed to comply with art42 it could result in irreversible but secret violation of the fundamental rights of millions of citizens and the regulation ought to ma ke this serious criminal offence at the moment most ms transpositions of eu 9546 treat dp offences as minor matters and some ms do not implement criminal sanctions at all that is deterrent against calculated strategy to ignore eu law weighed gainst the penalties applicable under us law at general level and beyond the specific scope of art42 the level of fines for infractions of the new data protection regulation also need to be substantially increased they were reduced to 2 fine on th revenue of corporation from higher levels in leaked drafts the example above of the microsoft competition case shows that some companies have enormous resources and deep strategies that anticipate and incorporate even billion dollar fines into their business plans fine level of 20 of global revenue may be needed to persuade such corporations to reckon seriously with art42 compliance even after bullrun cryptography is probably intact in theory85 however it is not known which encryption implementations and products may have been rendered insecure therefore consideration should be given to extending the scope of art42 also to cover vendors of systemsproducts as well as controllersprocessors in eu markets existing encryption security product accreditations especially if influenced by nsa or gchq must be regarded as suspect 83washington pushed eu to dilute data protection financial times 12th june 2013 84the guardian 12th september

protection and incentives recommendation systematic protection and incentives for whistle blowers should be introduced in the new regulation whistle blowers should be given strong guarantees of immunity and asylum and awarded 25 of any fine consequently exacted86 the whistle blower may have to live in fear of retribution from their country for the rest of the lives and take precautions to avoid rendition kidnapping ironically us law already provides rewards of the order of 100m for whistle blowers exposing corruption in the sphere of public procurement and price fixing87 34 institutional reform at very early stage of consultation the eu commission rejected the option of establishing new central pan european data protection authority because this appeared disproportionate to the requirement for member states subsidiarity the option w as chosen for an evolutionary development of wp29 into the new data protection board however an intermediate option could have been considered the creation of new central authority for cases involving major third country data flows recommendation acentral investigative service for cases involving major third country dataflows should be created this service should be given authority and resources to initiate complex prosecutions against transnational companies who often employ large legal teams to delay and appeal decisions over many years national dpas would retain jurisdiction over purely national affairs and according to the principle of subsidiarity could initiate their own national investigations or refer case to the central service 35 data protection authorities and governance the prism scandal and snowdens revelations have not been the first warnings to eu institutions in relation to eu citizens rights privacy activists for instance warned the commission in 2000 that the safe harbour agreement contained dangerous loopholes88 more recently the above mentioned note produced on cloud computing for the european parliaments libe committee clearly highlighted the loopholes of fisa and their consequences on eu citizens rights and protection89 the committee even held hearing90for the presentation of the note following session on the eu cybersecurity strategy on feb 20th2013 afterwards meps asked for immediate proposals to meet the libe amendment deadline91on the data protect ion regulation however from march onwards the level of interest in the note declined and there seemed only remote possibility that parliament would support fundamental revisions of the dp regulation thanks to the prism scandal and snowdens revelati ons such warnings and 86this principle has long history in law under the term qui tam 87httpwwwtheguardiancombusiness2010oct27glaxosmithkline whistleblower wins61m 88the

did not react in one hundred and fifty opinions of wp29 issued since 911 only the first mentions the patriot act in footnote and none fisa or even the term foreign intelligence national dpas92 the edps93 and other institutions94seemed to be unaware of us legislation or that prism was legally possible they failed to sound the alarm for eu citizens despite warnings95 and of course the widely repo rted us scandal before 2008 this may be because dpas enisa96 and the trust and security unit of dg connect97 are ambivalent whether the national security exemption of eu competency means they areor are not required to defend their citizens privacy from third country intelligence agencies in their last state ofplay comments before snowden the edps noted the above mentioned libe proposed amendment for drastic warning to data subjects before giving consent to cloud transfers but rejected98this on the grounds that it was not technology neutral it appears the eu dpa institutions have some structural difficulties that need to be addressed in particular dpas clearly lack capacities in technical expertise only few dozen dpa staff out of about two thousand across europe has an informatics background let alone post graduate degree related to the computer and engineering science of privacy there is deeply rooted view that because in general it is preferable to draft laws in tech nology neutral99way this excuses regulators from understanding technical matters for example wp29 has never conducted any survey of advanced privacy enhancing technologies or issued any opinion mandating their use even in the face of persistent eviden ce of market failure for their voluntary adoption recommendations reform of the eu data protection authorities appointment system should be implemented the new regulation does not address this aspect this is critical in order to prevent inertia and deadlock regarding technology specific questions some options to improve the eu data protection governance and capacities could include inclusion in the data protection board of at least one special commissioner with mandate prioritizing defence of citizens rights with small independent staff

_____________ 33conclusion as noted earlier one of the most extraordinary aspects of the prism affair is that not only have the rights of non americans not been discussed in the us they were not even discussed by the european media until well after th story first broke the rights of non americans were rarely raised and casual reader would not understand that the intended target of surveillance was non americans and that they had rights at all it seems that the only solution which can be trust ed to resolve the prism affair must involve changes to the law of the us and this should be the strategic objective of the eu furthermore the eu must examine with great care103the precise type of treaty instrument proposed in any future settlement with t he us practical104but effective mechanisms are also needed to verify that disclosures of data to the us for justifiable law enforcement investigations are not abused in assessing the impact of the revelations three technical considerations should be borne in mind in the search for effective responses 1 data can only be processed whilst decrypted and thus any cloud processor can be secretly ordered under fisa 702 to hand over key or the information itself in its decrypted state encryption is futileto defend against nsa accessing data processed by us clouds but still useful against external adversaries such as criminal hackers using the cloud as remote disk drive does not provide the competitiveness and scalability benefits of cloud as co mputation engine there is technical solution to the problem105 2exposing data in bulk to remote cloud mass surveillance forfeits data sovereignty so confining data to the eu is preferable pending legal solutions although nsa has extensive capabilit ies to target particular systems inside the eu this is harder and riskier to do however basic reforms to the new regulation are needed otherwise in practice these two situations will be treated as equivalent and cloud business will go to lowest bidder 3 although an eu based company transacting in the us is also subject to conflicts between eu dp and the fisa law in practice it is less likely they will be served with such secret orders because the legal staff and management would be more likely to re sist and as eu nationals are less threatened by us espionage laws clouds canbe confined to location and arguments this would balkanise106the internet confuses issues of censorship with the problem of keeping data private thethoughts prompted in the mind of the public by the revelations of edward snowden cannot be unthought we are already living in different society in consequence everybody now knows that the us intelligence community might know any personal secret in ele ctronic data sent in range of the nsa these developments could be profoundly destabilising for democratic societies precluding exercise of basic political and human rights and creating new form of instantaneous and coercive
