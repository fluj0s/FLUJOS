maintain registration system each of them has done so the walsh act preserves the basis structure of the earlier law expands upon it and makes more specific matters that were previously left to individual choice for purposes of compliance by the states and other jurisdictions the prior law remains in effect until the later of three years after enactment or one year after the necessary software for the new uniform online system has become available for registrants however the new requirements became effective upon enactment

and previously convicted of federal state local tribal military or foreign qualifying offense although strictly speaking violations of the laws of the district of columbia or us territories are not specifically mentioned as qualifying offenses offenders must register in each state or territory in which they live work or attend school there are five classes of qualifying offenses crimes identified as one of the specific offenses against minor crimes in which some sexual act or sexual conduct is an element designated federal sex offenses specified military offenses and attempts or conspiracy to commit any offense in the other four classes of qualifying offenses the inventory of qualifying offenses is subject to exception conviction for an otherwise qualifying foreign offense does not necessitate registration if it was not secured in manner which satisfies minimal due process requirements under guidelines or regulations promulgated by the attorney general nor does conviction of consensual sex offense require registration if the victim is an adult not in the custody of the offender or if the victim is 13 years of age or older and the offender more than four years older finally juvenile delinquency adjudications do not constitute qualifying convictions unless the offender is 14 years of age or older at the time of the misconduct and the misconduct adjudicated is comparable to or more severe than aggravated sexual assault or attempt or conspiracy to commit such an offense there are specific limitations on registration based on convictions that have been overturned sealed or expunged under state or foreign law or on convictions for which the offender has been pardoned there are specific limitations on requirements that flow from past convictions regardless of their vintage instead the attorney general is authorized to promulgate rules of applicability
