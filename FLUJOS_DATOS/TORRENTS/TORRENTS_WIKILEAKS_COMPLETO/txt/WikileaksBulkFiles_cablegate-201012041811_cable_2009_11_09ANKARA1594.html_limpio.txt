mayor of the black sea province of rize halil bakirci had an unpleasant exchange of remarks during meeting with visiting israeli ambassador gaby levy mayor bakirci told the israeli ambassador that the attitude of turkish people toward israel would not change as long as israel continues its expansionist policies the people of rize will defend themselves in the face of such threats but they will not kill babies said bakirci levy responded by saying that israelis did not have any other alternatives for survival he admitted that turkishisraeli relations had entered difficult period but added that
