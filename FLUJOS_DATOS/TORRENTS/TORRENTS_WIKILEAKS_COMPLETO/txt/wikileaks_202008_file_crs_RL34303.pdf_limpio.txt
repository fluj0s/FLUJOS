or corruption or intimidation to prevent the production of evidence 18 usc 1512b destruction or concealment of evidence or attempts to do so 18 usc 1512c and witness harassment to prevent the production of evidence 18 usc 1512d the offenses have similar but not identical objectives and distinctive elements of knowledge and intent section 1512 also contains free standing provisions that

slightly different elements depending upon whether the offense involves killing or attempted killing 18 usc 1512a1 or some other use of physical force or threat 18 usc 1512a26 in essence they condemn the use of violence to prevent witness from testifying or producing evidence for an investigation and set their penalties according to whether the obstructive violence used is homicide an assault or threat in more exact terms they declare 151 2a1 151 2a2 i whoever i whoever ii kills or b attempts to kill ii uses p hysical force b attempts to use p hysical force c uses the thr eat of p hysical

throughout this report the outline of the statut elements uses the language of the statute wherever possible 7 18 usc 1512a unlike most federal crimes subsecti on 1512a does not include imposition of fine among the sanctions that follow as consequence of its provisions with one exception it states that subsection 1512a manslaughter offense shall be punished as provided in 18 usc 1112 in addition to term of imprisonment section 1112 states that offenders may be fined under this title sect ion 3571 of title 18 sets the general fine level for felonies crimes whose maximum term of imprisonment is more than one year at the greater of either not more than 250000 for individuals not more than 500000 for organizations or twice the amount of gain or loss associated with the offense for purposes of brevity and convenience reference hereafter to fine of not more than 250000 should be understood to include the higher limits for organizations or when the gain or loss associated with the offense is greater continued httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34303g17g139g156g157g155g158g140 g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g12g158g156g157g146g140g142g561 g561

subsection 1512a offenses may be increased to match the maximum term of any offense involved in an obstructed criminal trial8 to establish crime under the law enforcement officer section of the act the government must prove that 1 the defendant killed or attempted to kill person 2 the defendant was motivated by desire to prevent the communication between any person and law enforcement authorities concerning the commission or possible commission of an offense 3 the offense was actually federal offense and 4 the defendant believed that the person in 2 above might communicate with the federal authorities 9 there are two statutory defenses to charges under section 1512 one covers legitimate legal advice and related services 18 usc 1515c10 and is intended for use in connection with the corrupt persuasion offenses proscribed elsewhere in section 1512 rather than the violence offenses of subsection 1512a the other stat utory defense is found in subsection 1512e and creates an affirmative defense when an individual engages only in conduct that is lawful in order to induce another to testify truthfully the defense would appear to be of limited use in the face of charge of the obstructing use or threat of physical force in violation of subsection 1512a11 subsections 1512f and 1512g seek to foreclose cramped construction of the various offenses proscribed in section 1512 subsection 1512f declares that the evidence that is the object of the obstruction need not be admissible and that the obstructed proceedings need not be either pending or imminent whether the defendants misconduct must be shown to have been taken in anticipation of such proceedings is more difficult question continued although many federal statutes suggest that offenders may be sentenced to fine rather than term of imprisonment at the discretion of the court other provisions of law and the influence of the sentencing guidelines greatly curtail the number of instances in which simple imposition of fine would be considered an appropriate punishment for the commission of felony 18 usc 3553 imposition of sent ence ussg 2j12 2j13 base offense level for obstruction of justice and perjury is 14 ussg ch5 pt sentencing table sentencing range for first time offenders with an offense level of 14 is 15 to 21 months imprisonment for general discussion of the operation of the federal sentencing guidelines see crs report rl32846 how the federal sentencing guidelines work two examples 8 if the offense under this section occurs in connection with trial of criminal case the maximum term of imprisonment which may be imposed for the offense shall be the higher of that otherwise provided by law or the maximum term that could have been imposed for any offense charged in such case 18 usc 1512j 9 united states v rodriguezmarrero 390 f3d 1 13 1st cir 2004 10 this chapter does not prohibit or punish the providing of lawful bona fide legal representation services in connection with or anticipation of an official proceeding 18 usc 1512c 11 the sarbanesoxley act redesignated section 1512d2000 ed as section 1512e in prosecution for an offense under this section it is an affirmative defense as to which the defendant has the burden of proof by preponderance of the evidence that the conduct consisted solely of lawful conduct and that the defendants sole intention was to encourage induce or cause the other person to testify truthfully 18 usc 1512e see united states v lowery 135 f3d 957 960 5th cir 1998reversing the defendants obstruction of justice conviction for the trial

that found in subsection 1512fmaking section 1512 applicable to obstructions committed before any official proceedings were convened absolved the government of having to prove that the obstruction was committed with an eye to possible official proceedings12 that case however the arthur andersen case involved the construction of subsection 1512b that requires that the defendant be shown to have knowingly engaged in the obstructing conduct subsection 1512a has such explicit knowing element yet the government must still show that the offenders violent act was committed with the intent to prevent testim ony or the disclosure of information to law enforcement authorities by virtue of subsection 1512g the government need not prove that section 1512 offender knew of the federal status of the obstructed proceeding or investigation 13 thus for instance to prove an information obstruction offense it need show more than that the offender intended to prevent the flow of information to law enforcement authorities concerning federal crime it need not demonstrate that the offender intended to prevent the disclosures to federal authorities 14 as consequence of subsection 1512h murder attempted murder or the use or threat of physical force committed overseas to prevent the appearance or testimony of witness or the production of evidence in federal proceedings in this country or to prevent witness from informing authorities of the commission of federal offense or federal parole probation supervised release violation is federal crime outlawed in subsection 1512a that may be prosecuted in this country 15 as general rule the courts will assume that c ongress intends statute to apply only within the united states and to be applied consistent with the principles of international law unless contrary intent is obvious16 subsection 1512h supplies the obvious contrary intent since contrary intent may be shown from the nature of the offense the result would likely be the same in the absence of subsection 1512h in the case of an overseas obstruction of federal proceedings the courts could be expected to discern congressional intent to confer extraterritorial jurisdiction17 and find such an application compatible with the principles of 12 arthur anderson llp v united states 544 us 696 7078 2005 13 18 usc 1512gin prosecution for an offense under this section state of mind need be proved with respect to the circumstance 1 that the official proceeding before judge court magistrate judge grand jury or government agency is before judge or court of the united states united states magistrate judge bankruptcy judge federal grand jury or federal government agency or 2 that the judge is judge of the united states or that the law enforcement officer is an officer or employee of the federal government or person authorized to act for or on behalf of the federal government or serving the federal government as an adviser or consultant 14 united states v harris 498 f3d 278 284287 4th cir 2007fire bombing the home of witness who had complained to local authorities about drug trafficking trafficking is both state and federal offense 15 18 usc 1512hthere is extraterritorial federal jurisdiction over an offense under this section see eg united states v fisher 494 f3d 5 89 1st cir 2007contemplated murder in canada of federal witness 16 eeoc v arabian american oil co 499 us 244 248 1991it is longstanding principle of american law that legislation of congress unless contrary intent appears is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states murray v the schooner charming betsy 2 cranch 64 118 6 us 34 671804an act of congress ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations if any other possible construction remains weinberger v rossi 456 us 25 32 1982 17 united states v bowman 260 us 94 98 1922but the same rule of interpretation of purely domestic application should not be applied to criminal statutes which are as class not logically dependent on their locality for the governments jurisdiction but are enacted because of the right of the government to defend itself against obstruction or fraud

persuasion as persuasion that is motivated by an improper purpose united states v thompson 76 f3d 442 452 2d cir 1996 we have also specifically stated that the obstruction of justice act can be violated by corruptly influencing witness to invoke the fifth amendment privilege in his grand jury testimony see united states v cioffi 493 f2d 111 1118 2d cir 1974 united states v khatami 280 f3d

plain meaning of the root adjective corrupt motivated by an inappropriate or improper purpose to convince another to engage in course of behaviorsuch as impeding an ongoing criminal investigation united states v shotts 145 f3d 1289 11 th cir 1998it is reasonable to attribut to the corruptly persuade language in section 1512b the same wellestablished meaning already attributed by the courts to

nexus62 subsection 1512b3 investigation obstruction offense prosecution however does require proof that the offense in question was actually federal offense and that the defendant believed that the witness toward whom the defendant engage d in intimidating threatening corruptly persuasive or misleading conduct might communicate with federal authorities63 the defendants belief that witness might confer with federal authorities can be inferred from the nature of the offense and additional appropriate evidence64 continued ambiguous term corruptly persuades includes attempting to persuade someone to provide false information to federal investigators united states v farrell 126 f3d 484 488 3d cir 1997 emphasis in the original we agree 61 even though the statute 18 usc 1512f provides that the obstructed proceedings need be neither ongoing nor pending at the time of the obstruction it is one thing to say that proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense and quite another to say proceeding need not even be foreseen knowingly corrupt persuader cannot be someone who persuades others to shred documents under comment retention policy when he does not have in contemplation any particular official proceeding in which those documents might be material arthur andersen llp v united states 544 us 696 7078 2005 united states v vampire nation 451 f3d 189 205 3d cir 2006we read this instruction as requiring the jury to find some connection ie nexus between bankss actions and an official proceeding in that banks could not be convicted unless the

52 69 1 st cir 2007 62 united states v ronda 455 f3d 1273 1288 11th cir 2006 arthur andersen interpreted and applied only 1512b2 which explicitly requires that the acts of obstructio n relate to an official proceeding unlike 1512b2 1512b3 makes mention of an official proceeding and does not require that defendants misleading conduct relate in any way either to an official proceeding or even to particular on going investigation there is simply reason to believe that the supreme courts holding in arthur andersen requires that we graft onto 1512b3 an official proceeding requirement based on statutory language in 1512b2 that does not appear in 1512b3 as we already noted in united states v veal 153 f3d 1233 11 th cir 1998 the federal nexus required under 1512b2 is distinct from that required under 1512b3 unlike the stricter an official proceeding requirement that appears in 1512b2 1512b3 requires only that defendant intended to hinder delay or prevent communication to any law enforcement officer or judge of the united states id at 1248 this distinction was critical to our decision in veal that 1512b3 requires only the possible existence of federal crime and defendants intention to thwart an inquire into that crime veal 153 f3d at 11250 as we explained in veal 1512b3 criminalizes the transfer of misleading information which actually relates to potential federal offense veal 153 f3d at 1252 emphasis in the original cf united states v byrne 435 f3d 16 1 st cir 2006if the defendants contention is that the government must prove the possible existence of federal crime and defendants intention to thwart an inquiry into that crime by officials who happen to be federal we continue to agree if the defendant suggests that arthur andersen requires heightened showing of nexus in 1512b3 prosecution between the intent to hinder communications and particular law enforcement agency we express our doubts but defer any final judgment for future case that requires resolution of that issue 63 united states v serrata 425 f3d 886 898 10th cir 2005 united states v guadalupe 402 f3d 409 412 3d cir 2005to obtain conviction pursuant to 18 usc 1512b3 the government must prove that 1 the defendant attempted to intimidate threaten mislead or corruptly persuade person 2 the defendant was motivated by desire to prevent the communication between that person and w enforcement authorities concerning the commission or possible commission of an offense 3 the offense was actually federal offense and 4 the defendant believed that the person he attempted to intimidate threaten mislead or corruptly persuade might communicate with federal authorities 64 united states v guadalupe 402 f3d 409 412 3d cir 2005this last element may be inferred from the fact the offense was federal in nature plus additional appropriate evidence an example of this additional appropriate evidence is that the defendant had actual knowledge of the federal nature of the offense cf united states v lopez 372 f3d 86 9192 2d cir 2004citing examples of add itional appropriate evidence necessary in law enforcement obstruction element in the context subsection 1512a

examples subsection 1512e removes by way of an affirmative defense good faith encouragements of witness to speak or testify truthfully although it does not excuse urging witness to present

conversely charge of soliciting crime of violence or of using child to commit crime of violence are more likely to be prosecutorial companions of charge under subsection 1512a than under subsection

proscriptions of the omnibus clause of section 1503107 but are more explicitly condemned in the remainder of the section108 on its face the section covers both tampering and retaliation with federal grand jurors petite jurors magistrates and other judicial officials the conduct it outlaws may take the form of threats force threatening letters or other communication corruption eg bribery or in retaliation personal injury or property damage yet the offense is only complete if the misconduct is perpetrated in an endeavor to influence intimidate or impede juror or judicial official or on account of the performance of the duties of such position the section carries general maximum penalty of imprisonment for not more than 10 years and with one unusual exception an escalating penalty structure for more serious violations 109 thus the offense is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years if it involves either an attempted killing or is committed against juror in case involving class or b felony ie felony punishable by death life imprisonment or maximum term of imprisonment of at least twentyfive years 18 usc 3559 if the offense involves murder it is punishable in the same manner as an offense under 18 usc 1111 that is by death or imprisonment for any term of years or for life in something of curiosity if the offense involves manslaughter it is punishable in the same manner as an offense under 18 usc 1112 that is by imprisonment for not more than 10 years in the case of voluntary manslaug hter and not more than 6 years in the case of involuntary

prosecution of either of the two sections was proper in the district of the obstructed proceeding 116 thereafter the supreme court clarified venues constitutional boundaries when it declared that venue is ordinarily only proper where conduct element of the offense occurs 117 but left for another day the question of whether venue might be proper in district where the effect of the offense is felt118 the limited subsequent case law on the question has arisen under other statutes and holds that the effects basis for venue remains valid only when congress had defined the essential conduct

years if the offense involves domestic or international terrorism or both138 prosecutions under section 1505 have been relativel few at least until recently and most of these arise as obstructions of administrative proceedings139 the crime of obstruction of such proceedings has three essential elements first there must be proceeding pending before department or agency of the united states second the defendant must be aware of the pending proceeding third the defendant must have intentionally endeavored corruptly to influence obstruct or impede the pending proceeding 140 perhaps due to the breadth of judicial construction the question of what constitutes pending proceeding has arisen most often taken as whole the cases suggest that proceeding describes virtually any manner in which an administrative agency proceeds to do its business the district of columbia circuit for example has held that an investigation by the inspector general of the agency for international development may qualify as proceeding for purposes of section 1505 in doing so it rejected the notion that section 1505 applies only to adjudicatory or rulemaking activities and does not apply to wholly investigatory activity 141 moreover proximity to an agencys adjudicatory or rulem aking activities such as auditors working under the direction of an officer with adjudicatory auth ority has been used to support claim that an obstructed agency activity constitutes proceeding142 the courts seem to see comparable breadth 138 18 usc 1505 139 eg united states v blackwell 459 f3d 739 761 6th cir 2006 united states

judiciallyidentified uncertainty as to the intent required145 congress added definition of corruptly in 1996 as used in section 1505 the term corruptly means acting with an improper purpose personally or by influencing another including making false or misleading statement or withholding concealing altering or destroying documen t or other information 18 usc 1515b examples of the type of conduct that has been found obstructive vary146 section 1505 offenses are not rico or money laundering predicate offenses147 section 1505 has neither separate conspiracy provision nor an explicit exterritorial jurisdiction provision however conspiracy to obstruct administrative or congressional proceedings may be prosecuted under 18 usc 371148 and the courts would likely find that ov erseas violations of section 1505 may be tried in this country149 moreover the general aiding and abetting accessory after the fact and continued in the nature of trial the growth and expansion of agency activities have resulted in meaning being given to proceeding which is more inclusive and which longer limits itself to formal activities in court of law rather the investigation or search for the true facts is not to be ruled as nonproceeding simply because it is preliminary to indictment and trial see also rice v united states 356 f2d 709 712 8 th cir 1966proceedings before governmental

1505 can not be answered by myopic focus on formality rather it is properly answered by careful examination of all the surrounding circumstances if it is apparent that the investigation is legitimate exercise of investigative authority by congressional committee in an area within the committees purview it should be protected by section 1505 while formal authorization is certainly factor that weighs heav ily in this determination its presence or absence is not dispositive to give section 1505 the protective force it was intended corrupt endeavors to influence congressional investigations

substantive offense157 the overt act need only be furtherance of the scheme it need not be the underlying substance offense or even crime at all158 conspirators are liable for the underlying offense should it be accomplished and for any reasonably foreseeable offense committed by coconspirator in furtherance of the common plot159 as noted earlier number of federal statues including sections 1512 and 1513 include within their proscriptions separate conspiracy feature that outlaws plots to violate the sections substantive provisions160 the advantage for prosecutors of these individual conspiracy provisions is that they carry the same penalties as the underlying substantive offense and that they ordinarily do not require proof of an overt act161 the disadvantage is that they may lack the venue flexibility afforded by subsection 371 and other conspiracy provisions that contain an overt act element162 although sections 1512 and 1513 provide an alternative means of prosecuting

classified as contempt the failing to heed th writs or summons of the king or his courts of justice164 the first congress empowered the federal courts to punish by fine or imprisonment at the discretion of said courts all contempts of authority in any cause or hearing165 contemporary federal contempt is derived from stat ute rule and inherent or auxiliary authority section 401 of title 18 of the united states code notes the power of federal court to punish by fine or imprisonment misconduct committed in the presence of the court or by its officers and disobedience of its orders 166 rule 42 of the federal rules of criminal procedure supplies procedures to be followed in such cases other than those dealt with summarily section 402 provides for jury trial when the allegations of criminal contempt also constitute separate federal or state criminal offenses167 contempt may be civil or criminal civil contempt is coercive and remedial calculated to compel the recalcitrant to obey the orders of the court or compensate an opponent aggrieved by the failure to do so168 criminal contempt is punitive169 163 iv b lackstone commentaries of the laws of england 124 1769 164 id at 122

the contempt is to be punished by term of imprisonment of more than six months to jury trial208 the right to be prosecuted by the united states attorney or some other neutral prosecutor is reenforced by the rule209 but may be waived by the person charged210 section 401 does not set maximum term of imprisonment or maximum fine level for criminal contempt it simply states that criminal contem pt may be punished by imprisonment or by fine or both this approach has implications for things like probation special assessments and terms of supervised release that turn upon the maximum term of imprisonment associated with particular offense probation for example is unavailable to those charged with class or b felony 211 special assessments range from 5 to 100 depending on the classification of the offense for which an individual is convicted212 and the maximum permissible term of supervised release if any is determined in many instances by whether the offender has been convicted of class

criminal contempt under section 401 is class felony since it is punishable by any term of imprisonment up to and including life imprisonment214 defendants have argued alternatively that criminal contempt under section 401 1 should be considered neither felony nor misdemeanor nor petty offense or 2 should be classified according to the sentence imposed or the sentencing maximum the court agrees to accept as is done when the question is whether contempt case must be tried before jury215 the ninth circuit chose something of middle ground and classified criminal contempt according to the sentencing guideline range of the most analogous offense under the sentencing guidelines216 the sentencing guidelines once binding but now advisory exert strong influence over all federal sentencing217 the guideline for contempt is not always easily followed the guidelines assign specific guideline for most federal offenses it assigns contempt to an obstruction of justice guideline ussg 2j11 but section 2j11 states in its entirety apply 2x51 other offenses the accompanying commentary does explain that the sentencing commission decided not to draft specific guideline for contempt because of the variety of misconduct that can constitute the offense218 it goes on to say that in some instances the general obstruction of justice guideline or the theft guideline may be most analogous for violations of section 401219 section 2x51 declares if the offense is felony for which guideline expressly has been promulgated apply the most analogous offense guideline federal appellate court decisions indicate that this most analogous standard has been used to mirror the misconduct underlying the contempt conviction although with seemingly conflicting results in some

appears in the united states code it includes organizations as well227 nevertheless prosecution appears to have been limited to individuals although the custodians of organizational documents have been charged the term summoned on the other hand has been read broadly so as to extend to those who have been served with testimonial subpoena to those who have been served with subpoena to produce documents or other items subpoena duces tecum and to those who have appeared without the benefit of subpoena 228 section 192 applies only to those who have been summoned by the authority of either house of congress as consequence the body which issues the subpoena must enjoy the authority of either the house or senate to do so both to conduct the inquiry and to issue the subpoena229 authority may be vested by resolution rule or statute section 192 speaks only of the houses of congress and their committees but there seems little question that the authority may be conferred upon subcommittees 230 the testimony or documents sought by the subpoena or other summons must be sought for matter under inquiry and in the case of an unanswered question the question must be pertinent

answer pertinent questions but the courts have yet to say whether the proscription includes instances where the refusal takes the form of false or deceptive testimony there is word on whether the section outlaws any refusal to answer honestly or only unequivocal obst inance on at least two occasions however apparently the courts have accepted nolo contendere pleas under section 192 based upon false statement predicate232 section 192 bans only willful recalcitrance thus when summoned witness interposes an objection either to an appearance in response to the summons or in response to particular question the objection must be considered and if found wanting the witness must be advised that the objection has been overruled before he or she may be successfully prosecuted233 the grounds for valid objection may be found in rule statute or the constitution and they may be lost if the witness fails to raise them in timely manner 234 the fifth amendment protects witnesses against selfincrimination235 the protection reaches wherever incriminating testimonial communication is compelled whether in criminal proceedings or elsewhere236 it covers communications that are either directly or indirectly incriminating but only those that are testimonial237 organizations enjoy fifth amendment privilege from self incrimination238 nor in most cases do the custodians of an

g346g342g561communication239 an individuals voluntarily created papers and records are by definition not compelled communications and thus ordinarily fall outside the privilege as well240 moreover the protection may be waived if not invoked241 and the protection may be supplanted by grant of immunity which promises that the truthful testimony the witness provides or is compelled to provide will not be used directly or derivatively in his or her subsequent prosecution242 aside from the fifth amendment the status of constitutionallybased objections to congressional summons or question is somewhat more amorphous the first amendment affords qualified immunity from subpoena or interrogation whose availability is assessed by balancing competing individual and congressional interests243 although subpoena or question clearly in furtherance of legislative purpose ordinarily carries dispositive weight the balance may shift to individual interests when the nexus between congress legitimate purpose and the challenged subpoena or question is vague or nonexistent 244 in cases of such imprecision the governments assertion of the pertinence necessary for conviction of statutory contempt may become suspect245 the fourth amendment may also supply the basi s for witness to disregard congressional subpoena or question the amendment condemns unreasonable governmental searches and seizures246 the supreme court in watkins confirmed that witness in congressional proceedings are entitled to fourth amendment protection but did not explain what such protection entails247 in fact the courts have addressed only infrequently the circumstances under which the fourth amendment cabins the authority of congress to compel witnesses to produce papers or response to questions when dealing with the subpoenas of administra tive agencies the court noted sometime ago that the fourth amendment at the most guards agains t abuse only by way of too much indefiniteness or breadth in the things required to be particularly described if also the inquiry is one the demanding agency is authorized by law to make and the materials specified are relevant the gist of the protection is in the requirement expressed in terms that the disclosure sought shall not be unreasonable 248 at the same time it pointed out that as in the case of grand jury inquiry 239 under the act of production doctrine custodians testimonial act of turning over documents in response to subpoena is entitled to fifth amendment protection if his actio n by confirming the existence of the documents or his control of them or his belief that they came within the description of the documents sought in the subpoena would incriminate him or provide link in th chain leading to his incrimination united states v hubbell

g346g343g561probable cause is not prerequisite for reasonable subpoena249 in later years it explained that where grand jury subpoena is challenged on relevancy grounds the motion to quash must be denied unless the district court determines that there is reasonable possibility that the category of materials the government seeks will produce information relevant to the general subject of the grand jurys investigation250 the administrative subpoena standard has been cited on the those infrequent occasions when the validity of congressional subpoena has been challenged on fourth amendment grounds 251 contempt convictions have been overturned however when fourth amendment violation taints the underlying subpoena or question252 perhaps most unsettled of all is the question the extent to which if any the separation of powers doctrine limits the subpoena power of congress over members and former members of the other branches of government as practical matter however the other branches of government ultimately control the prosecution and punishment for statutory contempt of congress at least under the current state of the law section 194 states that the united states attorney to whom congress refers violation of section 192 has duty to submit the matter to the grand jury 253 249 the result therefore sustains the admi nistrators position that his investigativ function in searching out violations with view to securing enforcement of the act is essentially the same as the grand jurys or the courts in issuing other pretrial orders for discovery of evidence and is governed by the same limitations these are that he shall not act arbitrarily or in excess of his statutory authority but this does not mean that his inquiry must be limited by forecasts of the

held that it is specific intent offense and as consequence defendant is entitled to present defense of intoxication or diminished capacity269 they were at one point likewise divided over whether the threat proscribed in the section is one that would instill fear in reasonable person to whom it was communicated or one reasonable defendant would understand would convey sense of fear270 the ninth circuit has suggested that the supreme court may have resolved the split when it defined those true threats that lie beyond the protection of the first amendments free speech clause as those

given simply with the generalized hope or expectation of ultimate benefit on the part of the donor does not constitute bribe but it is not necessary for the government to prove that the payor intended

intended for the benefit to be made in exchange for some official action the government need not prove that each gift was provided with the intent to prompt specific official act see united states v jennings 160 f3d 1006 1014 4 th cir1998 rather the quid pro quo requirement is satisfied so long as the evidence shows course of conduct of favors and gifts flowing to public official in exchange for

that the wire fraud statute could be used against smuggling scheme that deprived governmental entity of its intangible right to collect tax revenues306 in the interim congress expanded the scope of the mail and wire fraud statutes with the passage of 18 usc 1346 which defines the scheme to defraud element in the fraud statutes to include scheme to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services section 1346 extends mail and wire fraud to prohibit the deprivation of the intangible right to honest services of both public and private officers and employees in the private realm it proscribes bribery kickbacks and various forms of selfdealing committed to the detriment of those to whom the offender owes fiduciary duty of some kind 307 in the public sector it condemns dishonesty in public officers and employees although the exact scope of that proscription remains largely undefined some courts have said that honest services fraud in th public sector typically occurs in either of two situations 1 bribery where public official was paid for particular decision or action or 2 failure to disclose conflict of interest resulting in personal gain 308 the bribery examples cause little pause more perplexing are the issues of how broadly the conflictofinterest provision may sweep and what atypical situations the honest services fraud prohibition may also reach if bribery cases turn on the search for the quid pro quo the other honest services fraud cases begin and in some cases end with the quid little more seems to be required than substantial benefit conferred upon public official and the inferences that flow from that fact 309 although technically the crime is complete when scheme to defraud is accompanied by mailing or interstate wire communication the courts usually require that some other breach of law or duty attend the conveyance if for other reason than to confirm fraudulent intent the circuits 305 carpenter v united states

that harwood presumably because of his partners normal work for lincoln park had recused himself from voting on matters that might affect the company the government say defendants never proved that they sought to have harwood misuse his official power and thereby deprive the states citizens of his honest services it is common knowledge that powerful legislative leaders are not dependent on their own votes to make things happen the honest services that legislator owes to citizens fairly include the informal and behind the scenes influence on legislation there was adequate evidence if any was

the official receipt of benefit particularly over whether some breach of ethical or disclosure statutes must also be involved310 while section 1346 protects governmental entities from the deprivation

case shall be fined under this title imprisoned not more than 20 years or both336 this parsing of the section presumes that obstructions in relation to or in contemplation of yet pending investigations or cases are only covered if they involve an intent to impede obstruct or influence an anticipated investigation or case grammatical consistency however may argue for construction that reads specific intent out of the relation or contemplation clause offenses ie whoever knowingly alters any record in rela tion to or contemplation of any such matter or case shall be fined under this title imprisoned not more than 20 years or both337 moreover by proscribing obstructions either in relation to or in contemplation of subsequent investigations or cases the section might be said to prohibit both destruction with the intent to obstruct an offense in contemplation of and destruction simply having tendency to obstruct an offense relating to the legislative history of section 1519 evidences strong inclination to close the loopholes in federal obstruction law but is not quite so clear on the issue of whether the offense would have an element of specific intent under all circumstances338 in fact some members expressed concern over how the new section might be construed in this regard339 336 18 usc 1519 337 the somewhat awkward alternative reading states whoever knowingly alters any record with the intent to impede obstruct or influence in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case shall be fined under this title imprisoned not more than 20 years or both 338 section 1519 is meant to apply broadly to any acts to destroy or fabricate physical evidence so long as they are done with the intent to obstruct impede or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter and such matter is within the jurisdiction of an agency of the united states or such acts are done either in relation to or in contemplation of such matter or investigation this statute is specifically meant not to include any technical requirements which some courts have read into other obstruction of justice statutes to tie the obstructive conduct to pending or imminent proceeding or matter it is also sufficient that the act is done in contemplation of or in relation to matter or investigation it is also meant to do away w ith the distinctions which so courts have read into obstructions statute between court proceedings investigations regulatory or administrative proceedings whether formal or not and less formal government inquiries regard less of their title destroying or falsifying documents to obstruct any of these types of matters or investigations whic h in fact are proved to be within the jurisdiction of any federal agency are covered by this statute see 18 usc 1001 questions of criminal intent are as in all cases appropriately decided by jury on casebycase basis it also extends to acts done in contemplation of such federal matters so that the time of the act in relation to the begi nning of the matter or investigation is also not bar to prosecution the intent of the provision is simple people should not be destroying altering or falsifying documents oftlineto obstruct any government function finally this sec tion could also be used to prosecute person who actually destroys the records himself in addition to one who persuades another to do so ending yet another technical distinction which burdens successful prosecution of wrongdoers see 18 usc 1512b srept 107146 at 145 2002emphasis added citations to sections

arthur andersen accounting firm340 yet without the benefit the supreme courts later decision in the case341 those circumstances might be claimed by proponents on either side of the issue on one hand an effort to sweep away the legal technicalities that bedeviled prosecutors in the case may be cited in support of the view that congress intended to eliminate the specific intent requirement in section 1519 prosecution under the in relation to clause on the other hand the supreme courts decision may be offered as evidence of the courts reluctance to read specific intent requirements out of an obstruction of justice offense in the absence of clear congressional intention to the contrary or to avoid the natura l if ungrammatical reading of an obstruction statute 342 in any event it seems clear that the conduct which section 1519 proscribes is not limited to conduct that impedes pending investigation the obstructed official consideration need be neither pending in contemplation of nor take the form of an investigation investigation or proper administration of any matter343 the question of whether section 1519 applies to congressional and grand jury investigations might also be subject to some dispute at one time the general federal false statement statute forbid false statements in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states 18 usc 1001 1994 ed there the phrase any department or agency of the united states referred only executive branch entities the supreme court said it did not refer to continued specific intent to impede or obstruct proceeding or bankruptcy case it should not cover the destruction of documents in the ordinary course of business even where the individual may have reason to believe that the documents may tangentially relate to some future ma tter within the conceivable jurisdiction of an arm of the federal bureaucracy id at 27 additional views of senators hatch thurmond grassley kyl dewine sessions brownback and mcconnell 340 id at 7 indeed even in the current andersen case prosecutors have been forced to use the witness tampering statute 18 usc 1512 and to proceed under the legal fi ction that the defendants are being prosecuted for telling other people to shred documents not simply for destroying evidence themselves although prosecutors have been able to bring charges thus far in the case in case with single person doing the shredding this legal hurdle might present an insurmountable bar to ccessful prosecution when person destroys evidence with the intent of obstructing any type of investigation and the matter is within the jurisdic tion of federal agency overly technical legal distinctions should neither hinder nor prevent prosecution and punishment 341 arthur andersen llp v united states 544 us 696 2005 342 in arthur andersen the court held that prosecution under subsection 1512b2 required showing that the defendant acted conscious of its wrongdoing and in connection to some anticipated future official proceeding 544 us at 703708 proponents of this position may also cite the case to overcome the argument of more grammatically faithful reading of section 1519 see 544 us at 704705 internal citations omittedsection 1512b punishes not just corruptly persuading another but knowingly corruptly persuading another emphasis added the government suggests that knowingly does not modify corruptly persuades but that it is not how the statute most naturally reads it provides the mens rea knowingly and then list of acts uses intimidation or physical force threatens or corruptly persuades we have recognized with regard to similar statutory language that the mens rea at least applies to the acts that immediately follow if not to other elements down the statutory chain the government suggests that it is questionable whether congress would employ such an inelegant formulation as knowingly corruptly persuades long experience has not taught us to share the governments doubts on this score and we must simply interpret the statute as written 343 see eg united states v jho 465 fsupp 2d 618 636 ed tex 2006accordingly the court concludes that imposing requirement that the matter develop into formal investigation ignores the plain meaning of the statute and the legislative history all that is required is proof that jh knowing made false entries in

proceedings does cover proceedings to take depositions in connection with civil litigation 361 as well as variety of pretrial proceedings in criminal cases362 including habeas proceedings363 bail hearings364 venue hearings365 or suppression hearings366 the supreme courts observation that statement that is misleading but literally true cannot support conviction under section 1621 because it is not false367 applies with equal force to perjury under section 1623368 similarly perjury cannot be the product of confusion mistake or faulty memory but must be statement that the defendant knows is false369 although this requirement may be satisfied with evidence that the defendant was deliberately ignorant or willfully blind to the fact that the statement was false370 on the other hand question that is truly ambiguous or which affirmatively misleads the testifier can never provide basis for finding of perjury as it could never be said that one intended to answer such question untruthfully371

is usually said that statement is material if it has natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing the decision of the decisionmaking body to whom it is addressed373 this definition is not easily applied when the precise nature of the underlying inquiry remains somewhat undefined such as in grand jury proceedings or in depositions at the discovery stage of civil suit on the civil side the lower federal courts appear divided between the view 1 that statement in deposition is material if truthful answer might reasonably be calculated to lead to the discovery of evidence admissible at the trial of the underlying suit and 2 that statement is material if the topic of the statement is discoverable and the false statement itself had tendency to affect the outcome of the underlying civil suit for which the deposition was taken 374 in the case of perjury before the grand jury rather than articulate single standard the courts have described several circumstances under which false testimony may be considered material375 in any event statement is less material because it did not or could not divert the decisionmaker376 the courts seem to have had less difficulty dealing with materiality issue characterized as the perjury trap doctrine the doctrine arises where witness is called for the sole purpose of eliciting perjurious testimony from him377 under such circumstances it is said the tribunal has valid purpose to which perjurious statement could be considered material the doctrine poses continued conviction is not fundamentally ambiguous where the jury could conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant understood the question as did the government and that so understood the defendants answer was false united states v brown 459 f3d 509 529 5

usually able to identify some valid reason for the grand jurys inquiries378 subsection 1623c permits perjury conviction simply on the basis of two necessarily inconsistent material declarations rather than showing that one of the two statements is false379 conviction does require showing however that th two statements were made under oath it is not enough to show that one was made under oath and the other was made in the form of an affidavit signed under penalty of perjury 380 moreover the statements must be so inherently contradictory that one of them of necessity must be false381 some years ago the supreme court declined to reverse an earlier ruling that the general rule in prosecutions for perjury is that the uncorroborated oath of one witness is not enough to establish the falsity of the testimony of the accused set forth in the indictment382 subsection 1623e permits perjury conviction without compliance with this traditional two witness rule383 since the two witness rule rests on the common law rather than on constitutional foundation it may can be abrogated by statute without offending constitutional principles384 378 united states v mckenna 327 f3d 830 837 9th cir 2003here the government did not use its investigatory powers to question mckenna before grand jury rather it merely questioned mckenna in its role as defendant during the pendency of civil action in which she

overcome obstacles which the common law placed in the path of successful perjury prosecution subsection 1623d in contrast offers defense unrecognized at common law the defense is stated in fairly straightforward terms where in the same cont inuous court or grand jury proceeding in which declaration is made the person making the declaration admits such declaration to be false such admission shall bar prosecution under this section if at the time the admission is made the declaration has not substantially affected the proceeding or it has not become manifest that such falsity has been or will be exposed 18 usc 1623d although phrased in different terms the courts seem to agree that repudiation of the false testimony must be specific and thorough 385 there is some disagreement whether recanting defendant must be denied the defense if both the substantial impact and manifest exposure conditions have been met or if the defense must be denied if either condition exists most courts have concluded that the presence of either condition dooms the defense 386 early construction required that defendant establish both that his false statement had not substantially affected the proceeding before his recantation and that it had not become manifest that his false statement would be exposed387 one more recent appellate case however decided that the defense should be available to witness who could show want of either an intervening adverse impact or of likely exposure of his false statement388 even without the operation of subsection 1623d relatively contemporaneous corrections of earlier statements may negate any inference that the witness is knowingly presenting false testimony and thus preclude conviction for perjury389

from many of the common law requirements of section 1621 it is perhaps not surprising that they ordinarily elect to prosecute under subsection 1623 section 1623 does outlaw perjury under wider range

trustworthy and support the account of the single witness upon which the perjury prosecution is based397 the test for materiality under section 1621 is whether the false statement has natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing the decisionmaking body to which it is addressed398 conviction under section 1621 requires not only that the defendant knew his statement was false which he does not believe to be true but that his false statement is willfully presented there is but scant authority on precisely what willful means in this context the supreme court in dicta has indicated that willful perjury consists of deliberate material falsification under oath 399 other courts have referred to it as acting with an intent to deceive400 or as acting intentionally401 although contemporaneous correction of false statement may demonstrate the absence of the necessary willful intent to commit perjury the crime is completed when the false statement is presented to the tribunal
