divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31973programs funded by the h1b visa education and training fee and labor market conditions for information technology it workers summary congress has repeatedly turned to immigration as means of immediately alleviating perceived shor tage of us workers with information technology it skills it temporarily raised the ceiling on newly approved h1b professional specialty visas in 1998 and in 2000 from th level of 65000 set by the immigration and nationality act of 1990 the h1b visa cap was allowed to revert to 65000 in october 2003 because the cap was reached before the start of fiscal years 2006 to 2008 employers have been urging congress to give them greater access to foreign professionals through various changes to the h1b program at the same time supporters of it workers have asserted that their jobs and those of itenabled workers are now being threatened not onl by temporarily im porting foreignborn professional specialty worker s but also by offshoring when the 105th congress raised the h1b visa ceiling it also initiated what was intended as longer term strategy to remedy the seeming mismatch between the qualifications of us workers and the skill requirements of us employers the imposition of user fee on employers that seek to utilize nonimmigrant professionals to fund programs that prepare us stude nts and workers for computerrelated and other highskilled fields eg biotechnolog the fee like the higher visa cap expired in october 2003 but in pl 108447 congress permanently reauthorized larger education and training user fee effective december 2004 it also modified the allocation of the fee to principally the national science foundation nsf and the us department of labor dol mo st of the fees had gone to the nsfs computer science engineering and math ematics scholarship program and to the dols technical skills training grant program the nsf renamed the program which largely awards funds to institu tions for the purpose of their providing scholarships to lowincome students th scholarships in science technology engineering and mathematics sstem to reflect pl 108447s expansion of eligible disciplines nsf

technology it workers the economic boom that characterized mu ch of the 1990s was particularly true among companies in information technol ogy it industries eg electronics manufacturing telecommunications and so ftware services the demand for workers with it skills eg computer systems analysts computer engineers computer programmers and computer support specialists also was expanding rapidly outside these industries as fi rms increasingly utiliz ed computerbased technologies in response to perceived shorta ge of persons with it skills1 the 105th and 106th congresses were motivated to raise for five years the limit on h1b visas the visa category allows employers to temporarily import alien workers to fill professional specialty occupations2 congress also initiated user fee that funded education and training activities of the national science foundation n sf and the department of labor dol to further augment the supply of highly skilled workers and thereby reduce the future reliance of us firms on highskilled temporary foreign workers the 108th congress came to the intertwined h 1b visa cap and user fee issues in muchchanged economic environmen t the economy experienced recession in 2001 with the labor market subsequently staging slow recovery it workers were especially hard hit both by cyclical and other factors3 this was reflected in the number of approved h1b visas for new admissions falling below the elevated cap from fy2001 through fy2003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31973crs2 4 see for example gates urges change in h1b visa program as step to preserve us

among us workers on october 1 2003 however the reversi on of the h1b visa ceiling from 195000 to 65000 meant that employers of workers in professional specialty occupations faced heightened competition for visas the coincident expiration of the user fee also meant that certain nsf scholarship and dol training programs ceased operation some asserted that the progra ms were longer needed because they thought an adequate supply of already qua lified workers existed to fill employers demand for it and other profe ssional specialty workers others countered that this was only temporary situation reflecting the jobless recovery which would end at some point and cause employers to rene w their pressure on congress to raise h1b visa levels and indeed the delayed rebound in the labor market from the recession that ended in november 2001 occurred at about this time with the h1b visa ceiling being r eached even earlier in fy2005 than in fy2004 the 108th congress responded in late 2004 by keeping the cap at 65000 but exempting from it up to 20000 aliens with at least masters degree from us institutions of higher education pl 108447 also reimposed and authorized permanently the h1b user fee for education and training activities despite the latest loosening of the h1b ceiling us citizenship and immigration services uscis announced in summer 2005 that it had received more than 65000 h1b visa petitions this was the first time the cap was met before fiscal year fy2006 began uscis subse quently announced that the h1b visa limit for fy2007 and fy2008 was reached even earlier in calendar years 2006 and 2007 as consequence the business commun ity has been urging the congress to reexamine the h1b program4 it workers and their supporters contend however that the labor market opport unities of nativebor n professional and technical workers would be harmed by additions to the s upply of highskilled foreignborn workers5 for related information on legisl ation being considered by the 110th congress see crs report rl30498 immigration legislative issues on nonimmigrant professional specialty h1b workers by ruth ellen wasem in addition it and itenabled workers assert that their jobs are now being threatened by usbased companies outsourcing work offshore6 this report begins by reviewing the userfeefunded edu cation and training provisions of the releva nt immigration legislati on passed in 1998 2000 and 2004 it then examines the nsf and dol progra ms funded through the h1b education and training user fee the report closes with an analysis of changes in

relatively large numbers of h1b visas for such occupa tions as electrical and electronic engineers accountants and auditors and college and university facultylegislative activity the 105th congress concern about an it labor shortage culminated during the 1998 congressional debate over raising the ceiling on h1b visas for skilled temporary alien workers the 105th congress chose in title iv the american competitiveness and workforce improvement act of 1998 acwia of pl 105277 the fy1999 omnibus consolidated and emergency supplementa l appropriations act to raise the cap from 65000 on new admissions of nonimmigrant profe ssionals who work in specialty occupations to 115000 annua lly in fy1999 and fy2000 and to 107500 in fy20017 the legislation also imposed user fee on employers that filed petitions to bring into the country to extend the stay of or to hire from other us employers nonimmigrant professionals from decem ber 1 1998 through september 30 2000 the cap then relates to visas approved for initial employment of temporary aliens while the user fee relates to visa petitions for initial and continuing employment of temporary aliens the fee of 500 per h1b visa pe tition was to be used largely to fund mathematics engineering or science edu cation and to fund technical skills training in order to better match th supply of qualified us workers with the nature of employer demand most fees deposited into the h1b nonimmigrant petitioner account were allocated to activities carried out by the nsf and the dol as follows acwia authorized and funded thr ough 282 of

106th congress responded with passage of the american competitiveness in the twentyfirst century act of 2000 pl 106313 the act raised the cap on newly approved h1b visas to 195000 annually between fy2001 and fy2003 while making additional visa s available for fy1999 and fy2000 pl 106313 also exempted from the higher limit on admissions for initial employment aliens temporarily employed by

2003 as well the 108th congress the subsequent reduced demand for it workers product of the 2001 recession and burst hightech bubble among other things was evident in the number of approved new h 1b visas falling short of the elevated cap in fy2001 through fy2003 once the limit dropped by twothirds from 195000 to 65000 on october 1 2003 however competition among employers for professional

productivity growth going forward it is unlikely that the it industry will be producing job gains out of line with its size in part this is because productivity in the it industry itself has been strong allowing it to pr oduce more output with fewer workers43 others put more emphasis on the offshoring of it work that previously would have been performed in the united states cau tious hiring by
